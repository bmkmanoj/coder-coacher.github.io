kids can y'all hear me
your boys live
chit chit chit chit chit chit boys live
you know this is rare I don't be doing
live videos that much that's not used to
but every time that I come here I'm
gonna do a live video with you guys it's
for a reason it's because I wanna get
the feedback from the people I wanna get
to know what the hell you guys are up to
what's going on in and you know for for
this weekend today Saturday 11 o'clock
11 p.m. on a Saturday most likely a lot
of people are gonna be doing other stuff
you know hanging out with their friends
you know blowing some backs out you know
like chilling with wifey's Netflix and
chill you know y'all do what y'all do
man but for those of you who are here
with me those of you guys who are going
to see this later on
I was just wondering man cuz I was like
writing down a curriculum of course I'm
doing right and I was wondering what
type of like courses or what type of
style do you guys usually like cuz I'm a
project-based type of dude like you know
I can't really I don't know now that I
can learn by like you know learning
every single thing let's say if I wanted
to learn a new programming language I
rather somebody shows me a project of
how to use that programming language and
then how to build things with it and
then like that I learn but I was
wondering do you guys rather have like
all the details like let's say an
example if you want to learn something
like laravel right
do you prefer to learn every single
thing of the framework first before you
do a project or do you prefer to just
see a project and then learn the details
later on so that's something that
wondering right now so I wanted to get
the the feedback from you guys hold on
trying to see the live chat room
see who's online chit chit chit chit got
a couple of people in here I know it's
like live I did a live video you know
unexpected you know people are probably
doing a couple of things right now
they're probably busy they're like man
right now I'm busy man but you know how
I do this you know I come in here
sometimes I get an idea I get a topic
another the head I'm like man I need to
ask somebody about this I want to know
what's their opinion on it because me
personally like I said I like to learn
more projects that's how I learned
that's how things stick to my head
because for me I'm thinking like how can
I put things together like you know when
I want to free cocaine I didn't like it
because I felt like I was just following
you know step by step you know things
from a documentation but I wasn't
building anything yeah I build the page
hey I build the you know an animation of
something or I build a game there was
nothing like a show for so for me that
way it wasn't that great well I was
wondering what you guys think right
that's why I created this there's a link
on my description that says take this
poll let us know which one you prefer
and as we continue this live video I
will do how you call this I will do the
results right so as we have this live
chat together we will see what the
people think
all right so right now let me see if I
could share this with you guys on the
screen let me see I'm gonna do my first
vote okay let's see sharing the screen
I'm gonna vote for project based so I
got this thing from here from the
description says take this poll let us
know which one you prefer
right typo
misspelling it's alright I'm not trying
to fix it right well you click on this
link it brings you here and I just want
to get everybody's opinion on it you
know just for me it's project based I'm
gonna click Submit
that's it I submitted it right and then
here we will see the responses let's see
what people think I'm wondering right
now see what do you prefer
for your learning right for me project
based I guess 60% of the people they
like a project based so and then 20%
they like mix detailed based so I guess
nobody likes a detail based you know in
this this comes through for for this
because I was actually writing down the
the curriculum because this week I'm
gonna knock out all of those videos
right and there's a whole bunch of
videos are I still need to get done but
I was wondering if I should just come in
here and tell you every single thing
like you know oh this is how you write
around this how you write route params
that's how you read and do a route
method or method that's how you do route
names then you go how to create a
controller how to passing data I was
wondering do people like like more
yeah
you know
you
Oh
read
you
classes
ah it's the last literally yeah so let
me see I don't know maybe
you
you
mother did that sir
let's cut them yeah only you guys can
see me now let's then be acting up for
some reason man but yeah man let me see
let me see what people are saying right
now so we got J roster we got Jerry we
got Barbara we got Lamont we got ak-47
let me see we got mah pecker we got time
voila we got our EP uh who was this
thing here Starscream let me show me the
fun product
show me the finish line and then show me
the individual pieces why they are
important ways to think about it I mean
can you you guys see me right now let me
see yeah yeah I guess yeah I could see
me down agree with you Starscream
sometimes that's good I rather see like
the final project at first and then from
there explain things to me and be like
hey this is why we did this this why
this is important but I don't know I
don't know if like if you get like a
full laravel project and you build it
are you really learning or are you just
following you know sometimes that
happens sometimes you you're following a
course and you just keep following
whatever the person says and your your
code na but if I tell you hey can you
build me a project America then you'd be
like I don't know what to do right so
it's hard man I think that's one of the
things that I'm trying to master I'm
trying to master the perfect
of having all the details having
projects that people don't get bored
with and then at the end have like a
massive project where they'd be like
okay there's a full production website
right but yeah right let me see
you know listen
coke Adam II coke Adam II freak okay
team treehouse for me you know they for
team tree has has worked for Chris Shawn
for me some tree house it was like 50/50
cuz I just kept losing interest it's
like they have great production that
have great animations they have very
good quality videos but then you wasn't
I don't know for me I wasn't learning
everything that I needed to learn it
wasn't sticking it's like I was paying
for me it was like I'm paying $10 $15 to
service because back then I had the
student discount right for most of you
guys yeah I gotta pay out them 20 25
dollars a month for a 14-3 house and for
me it was a grand I'm paying $25 a month
plus I have to go on on YouTube plus I
have to go or coke adding me plus I have
to go a free cocaine
plus I have to go on Stack Overflow so
I'm like wait why am i paying $25 if I
have to look everywhere else to really
understand something you know so that's
when I was like I got a disconnect I got
a I got a cancel my team treehouse you
know I like the the forum but then I was
like now I can't I can't do it you know
so I was just wondering man I'm still I
still want to know like you know we
gotta level responses right now
basically for people say they they like
your project based six people say they
like a mix and one person says mulching
I don't know what that means
oh yeah so that's one of the things man
all you have to do is go in the
description there's a poll right there
guys let's make this live let's see
right here right here on the poll right
it says take this poll let us know which
one you prefer
forget the typo you click here right and
then it's gonna bring you up here and
then you just vote or if you say you
want to add your own way of learning go
ahead and your way of learning you know
some people they they might say hey I
like to read a book and then also watch
a tutorial or something else like that
man kalenna
edwards man i love you too you love my
channel but i love you yeah man I'm glad
that you guys are here you know a couple
of people you know it's not that many we
got you know it's a Saturday night
adding even announced this you know this
is why people get pissed off at me
sometimes it's like what the hell you
did a live video you leaving Warner's
you even tell us ahead of time I came
you're gonna do a live video 11 o'clock
at night I'm like yep that's not doing
me read live videos is where yeah my
head I want to see you guys
and Wow
you
I'll start paying for this out of what

link
lemme
you
in
all right
last time
this
if Hollis
you
you
Oh
you
you know my fault man this is the
 worst man if it's not Verizon so
whatever long story short we switch from
Verizon to Comcast okay Comcast is even
worse than Verizon because I can drop in
the internet like this was all a
 a Nokia phone like we connected
directly to eat dinner how the
 the internet goes away like that
right seriously we in 2017 yo
never again man Comcast it's a piece of
 bro
but yeah man everybody who stuck with me
stuck with the live feed man like I said
we're gonna go check out the results
right now see what we got we got 17
results 17 responses so a percent well
41 percent is basically saying yes
they'd like to have the details and have
a project to go with it let me see I
like always you know you can't give
people freedom you see like Bull Cheney
bulging people don't know how to act man
we're dealing with ult's and somehow
adults still act like little kids man
goddamn Internet who the hell's kalenna
you never heard of it yeah man so I just
want to know I just wanna know
what else Kalina what the hell is that
I'm trying to figure out what the house
cleaner Oh laughs oculina no I'm
googling I'm youtubing Kalina I can't
find it Louisa Kalina Edwards let's see
oh yeah I like your channel too man I've
seen each other a couple of times man I
was wondering I was like there was like
a time that I was like man she
disappeared for a while you gotta be on
a cleaner don't leave you too man don't
leave you too
I be telling people man is like Rayna
what's this his name Aaron um let me see
we looking for Aaron and Peter I haven't
ringing would yield for him his last
video was four weeks ago you know it's a
lot of cool people in YouTube man but
you guys disappear you come in and then
you leave
yeah I gotta stay around man or at least
do a video per week man hey okay so
Jerry said if I had to explain component
its regular people's turn so what would
it be very simple let's say this search
right here right ah this is a component
right now if we expect it it's just a
input field right so white
search I'm pretty sure they are they
using what's the name of it is either
angular or what's the other polymer
that's what they using because you see
they created their own their own
elements so it says white TD search box
so that whole space right there and
that's a component right and let's say
they wanted to reuse this this search
bar
the same functionality that when you
come in here and you put a letter and
you say you know let's say C then it
gives you a draft up down with a whole
bunch of different different search
results then if you want to reuse the
same thing and you wanted to put it for
Gmail or you want to use it for another
version or YouTube you will create this
as a component so it's just basically
either HTML code or or like let's say a
Java Script that you're going to reuse
another that's how people all the time
it's like they create components for
every single thing and it's like no
component for every single thing out
there unless you're going to reuse it
you know like right now for example if I
know this search bar is never gonna be
used anywhere else on the website I
wouldn't make a component right what I
will do is I would just keep it static I
will build it from here on this page
right keep all the JavaScript in here
keep all the HTML in here now if I know
what I'm going to reuse the search bar
make it into a component because now
I'll take that code in that JavaScript
and reusing other places so to me that's
like an in the lame terms that's what a
component is right it's something a code
that you're going to be reusing later on
so you want to put it all in the same
the same code or like let's say the same
folder knows that simple all right let
me see it and see what
without what I would have brought it
okay what the hell docking and upper
Decker's what the hell what the hell are
you talking about I don't know
you know her coming uh the hell is
docking I've never heard her last shape
worry if it's some dumb if there's
some dumb sure that nobody knows and
nobody should care about your ass is
getting blocked yes is getting blocking
for some dumb yeah right I don't
know man I don't know what this
Internet's acting up I'm like here man
like it shouldn't be acting up at all I
love this connect the streets that
I eat dinner and everything man that's
what the guys like I feel like they
don't want me to win a what that video
man they always coming up when you
man that's why I joke around you know
with the Harry Potter framework it's
like sometimes because for no
 reason you know what I mean like
let's say right now you have a lot of
time in your hands and you don't have a
girlfriend and you don't have a
and wifey you don't have a kid you know
 socialize you don't have nothing
else to do there's a lot of people out
there that they try to recreate the same
 that's already out there you know
what I mean like to me is a waste of
time
what I would do if I had that extra time
what I would do is I will create either
something that's completely different
completely new change the world or I'm
gonna improve what's already there you
know I'm not gonna go in create it's
like right now say somebody send me a
message move the whole
with this guy's name all right somebody
sent me a comment like oh how about you
create your own front-end framework and
I'm like I don't even have the time for
that that's number one number two if I
wanted to focus on a friend their
frameworks what I would do if I know I
can't come up with a better idea then
react and I can create something newer
or better or different what I would do
is I would join the react team I would
think try to recreate the same
 that's their repackaging hey guys
here you go you know what I mean like
I'm not gonna do that I don't have
time for that you just gotta learn
man you gotta learn you just have to
learn oh but you want to learn man you
know I mean like if you want to learn
react my react
cuz this um there's like a million jobs
for react and not only that that they're
high-paying jobs they're not like
if you don't react you're not getting
paid like forty thousand dollars I'm
talking about 70 and up the eighty
ninety you know the highest-paid react
job I think it's like a hundred in
ninety two thousand a year like to me
that's like mind-blowing that's like
what and react it's not hard at all
all you need to know is JavaScript
that's like one of the things that
people try to run away from
people they're like man you know the
reason why we like view is because view
just makes things so much easier yeah it
makes things easier but in a way where
you're just pretty much like
sugarcoating something and trying to run
away from the main problem which is you
don't know react
you don't know JavaScript it's
like when you don't react you you know
JavaScript
that's it if you know JavaScript you
know react it's that simple we want to
do it there's some people that'll be
like oh man how can we get it easier
what's the easiest way we can we can
make this applications what's the
easiest way what's the easiest way to
not have to learn JavaScript like
alright be like hello like just
learning man if you go in and you
 practice your JavaScript in
three months you're gonna be
really good like you don't need yeah
 another framework to put in how
you call this a cup a facade there's a
thing there's actually a dam man what's
this I want you guys to check this video
out man actually saved it I gotta go
through my playlist cuz this video is
amazing this video is going to teach you
guys just using all the different types
of paradigms and ways to write
JavaScript this is gonna show you how
almost all the the frameworks use
different type of paradigms this thing
called facade which is the same thing
that Ruby on Rails did it basically work
that made things easier for people to
create you know get up and running real
quick and start building things as soon
as possible right but the guys that just
know Ruby on Rails they're not gonna pay
top dollar
the guys that know Ruby that you see
them getting I people say Ruby on Rails
is dead and this and that and it's like
man is dead for the people that are not
really good with fruit if you're not
really good you know it's the same thing
as JavaScript there's certain jobs that
unless you know JavaScript
you're not gonna gonna get hired because
they don't care how many frame work
you know you know how many give
up stars a framework guy and you're like
yeah I know the Teletubby frame
working the telling sorry framework got
27,000 stars on github and it's
like we don't care about that so you
know JavaScript if you know JavaScript
get hired these jobs where they don't
care about that they they don't care
about if the person really knows a
programming language or if they have any
experience or they care about us to
build a project and get it done as soon
as possible like some of you guys might
get lucky and get hired into a company
like that where they don't care about
your skills all they care about is can
you build something even if it will
 duct tape in a paper
clip can you make this website
work somehow
what because it's they building
prototypes they building projects and
startups that needs to get built as soon
as possible but then six months later if
the company goes up is your company your
ass is getting fired that's what a lot
of people don't talk about this
a lot of in the industry that
people don't talk about ok this they
think everything is all happy and dandy
by reality it's not it's like this you
know industry politics you know
I was like ok let's say an example um I
mean a new startup right and this I
deliver bicycles to all the hipsters
right so I come in and I give every
hipster hipster goals on my website send
me a bike comm right and all they care
about is can you build me this website
as soon as possible
before the competition creates a website
like this they pay you your junior
developer and a like okay bill wanna
find whatever framework fine whatever
you need just build it for me as soon as
possible
you come in you build it somehow you
 stick a paperclip you take a
piece of gum
and you give them the cold and you like
here here's the code oh come in they
like the the owners data oh yeah cool
everything works we could promote this
and put it on Google Adwords and start
promoting on Facebook and better
hey send me a bike calm the latest
 a start-up for all the hipsters
to go in and order their bike as
soon as possible
right now you got hired
you've been there for six months six
seven months and you build this website
what people don't tell you is a lot of
times because you're not that
experienced when things get really
really good and then they'd be like okay
we're gonna need real developers now now
we need to scale this and they realize
your code was because in reality
all you was going for was finding out
what's the latest framework
what's the you know the
that's gonna make it easier for me to
build this as soon as possible trend
when the next developer comes to a
senior developer a dude that comes in
with 10-15 years you know a
 a crazy degree I don't
Ivy League school and looks at your code
and be like Ari we're gonna have to
scrap this this guy built this
ain't no jest we're glue on the
framework what makes with view X
and they come in and be like oh this is

we don't know remove this
and we gotta scale this whole
website thing with angular 4 and we're
gonna come in and put in
Scala which is Java right all your work
is pretty much thrown away
I guess you laid the groundwork
you got to be built as soon as
possible
but now when things are good you're not
the top developer making those decisions
so your asses out your ass since getting
out of there because most likely you
couldn't keep up with the other scene of
the developers ya don't really like oh
they'll be like super nice to be like oh
you know
we don't think that you faked the
co-chairing account in the company and
this and that don't come up to you with
that bullsh I've seen it done to other
people you know which is something that
people will talk about people will talk
about you know the ugly side of rich
wasn't something as possible and you're
creating facade facade it's just like
just come in that looks super simple in
the front but behind the scenes is very
complicated right so for a brand new
developer comes in and learns a few GS
he sees everything super simple and
super easy but behind the scenes
everything is complicated so if you find
a bug or something breaks inside of the
code and then he tried to go behind the
scenes and go in there behind the facade
and you'd be like holy
I don't know JavaScript since then
you're gonna look like an idiot and that
 happens to people a lot of times
that's one of the many reasons why you
know a lot of people don't get hired as
junior developers for Ruby on Rails
because it's easy to create something
with Ruby on Rails and come in and be
like okay cool let's build this but the
problem is when you have a production
website touching right that site
you don't know the type of problems
you're gonna get until the site is live
in the type of bugs that you're gonna be
getting right and if you don't know
JavaScript but you don't know Ruby oh
you don't know Java you don't know the
Cori language which whatever framework
you chose if you don't know the core
you're gonna get and that's
saying sorry it seems like I just went
into a rant but I'm just really trying
to just be as real as possible with
people because it's really good to to
know what's behind the scenes don't go
in anything like oh man I can build
something as soon as possible because it
happens
like are they like really get into like
JavaScript and it's not
I wasn't even comfortable I don't even
know how to do a 42 I didn't understand
the 42 right but I knew how to do it
with angular right and there's so many
 that I knew how to do with angular
well I did not know how to do it with
JavaScript and there was a disconnect
there because it's like how the do
you know how to do it with the framework
but you don't know how to do it with the
language which means you don't know what
the you're doing you're just
following little steps and little
tutorials that you see online you know
oh this how we if we have a JSON object
here with all our data of the user and
we want to you know do a loop of every
single user and display their eye icon
and display the title and their names
and whatever you know but if they ask me
to do with JavaScript I can't do it it
happened to me in the beginning hole
when because I always tell you guys I
start from the bottom as far as what
development like in a real shitty
company but then from that start jumping
to other companies and getting better at
one point I was in a company where I got
hired to be a you know angular developer
and then I was building a couple of
different single page apps and it was
super easy to build angular and
then when something came up like a bug
or something customized when the user
would be like another use of the owner
would come to me but I hate can we build
this can we we you know search
box that's gonna come in out of populate
with every users information and then
once they click on the users information
can they go in we want the background to
change to their homepage background like
some crazy it's easy well back then I
was like wait what this is like outside
of the tutorials that I've taken online
you know me so in my head I was like
well they want me to do some that's
I've never learned anywhere I've never
seen it on any tutorial I've never seen
it on sentry because I've never seen it
on YouTube you get because number
one is embarrassing number two that
process of being like man okay because
every time that somebody asked me to
make something custom I don't know how
to do it and that's what's gonna happen
to a lot of people that follow the the
view trend of the same steps that
angular day which was hey we're gonna
make we're gonna create a facade
and reality is great for developers who
really know and how to build it it's
like the same thing as booster if you
know how to build something with regular
HTML CSS that's great you you've got its
fuse bootstrap but if you don't know how
to build it with CSS by itself you can't
just jump to bootstrap because at one
point you're gonna have to edit those
those files and go in there and change
it your own way or change your how you
call this like your your media queries
your your blocks into your own custom
way that the the client or your employer
might want so then if you don't know how
to do that thing you're gonna get fun
people don't talk about that which
people will just be honest and be like
hey man if you don't know the
language kind of get it really
out here a kforce insist so is this a
problem only with angular and few react
this is a problem that I feel you're
real started which was creating that
style of coding which is facade which is
we make everything seem simple in
easier for somebody to build or to
customize it or hard to - adding
features to it right now will be a real
basically started the whole movement
there from the angular really took it to
the next level in in how you code it in
the front end which is really easy like
it's it's really good to have your you
know like your for each or your ng app
and all that right because it's
easier to have them the HTML and yes I
understand that Pete that people would
be thinking that I'm against that no I
know it's easy the problem is that
people come in and be like oh cool I can
I know JavaScript because I know
 angular and I know VJ guess and
it's like nah man
you don't know all you know is the
tutorials the that they show you
other tutorials before each loops the
directives the the little ng
compute this and you compute that V
buying this like people don't know what
the is going on behind the scenes
you know so when you work in a company
especially like the larger the company
is the more difficult the tasks are
going to be so you're gonna get
different tasks that's gonna be very
custom very difficult that you're
not gonna find online you're not gonna
find on Stack Overflow you're gonna find
on YouTube right absolutely basically
put in the bow if you don't know how to
 know the language itself that's
number one and number two if you don't
know how to search for starting with
answers like this terms that you're not
gonna find the answer to everything
online but you're gonna find the answers
to one part of it and then you're gonna
have to keep searching for the other
part and then keep searching for another
part so it's like you gotta to solve one
problem you got a search three different
type of promise that you're gonna find
online like on Stack Overflow and
like that but if you don't know the
language you don't even know how
to surgeon you don't even know how to
ask the question you know like you just
don't know it so that's the problem
that's like you know that's one of the
things that for me with you I was like
man people acting like they shouldn't
bring me like this is literally this is
literally bringing all the same problems
that were with angular differences that
they added a little sprinkle of
reacting to it like the life cycles they
added that like you know that's what
that's the only difference but it's
pretty much angular right they didn't
really bring anything new and it's like
you're copying something that was flawed
and had problems and then you're
continuing it you know so that's what's
helping me you can't focus on a
framework focus on knowing the language
focus on how to build things then once
you know it use the language because you
already know how to do it use the the
frameworks cuz you know how to do it and
then like that it'll make your workflow
easier to do something custom you're
gonna be able to go in there and edit it
or change it how you want it now back to
the question guys the original question
which one is the best project based
Intel based learning it's right there on
the description I want you guys to vote
for this because I want to know which
way do you guys think is the best way
you come here around the description
click there you choose one alright and
then we will see the responses let's see
yeah
18 18 people voting so whoever hasn't
voted yet guys go in the description
vote and then come back click the button
I want to see you guys see which one you
guys like you guys like make
yeah like project based and yeah man
in this way we delete this delete the
other because people don't know how to
act people are immature people already
adding this case gay yes he is
let's see ball or chain I don't know
what that means you having Foley guys go
ahead though this is just for us to know
there's like data for us to know you
know cuz it's good to know what how
other people think right like for me
like I said before for me when I'm
writing down this curriculum right
thinking for clarabelle everything that
I gotta do so this how I create the
courses I come in or create the sections
and then from there I start adding the
videos like the name of the videos and
then the green ones are the ones that I
already finished
I already did in my first section which
should be call right so there's like the
intro area right and then from there we
have laravel mix and routes if you have
controllers without blady we got the
models we've got database and other
point we got forms of amplification we
got tinker and in Jer
so there's the project alright so well I
was debating is should I keep the
project at the end after I teach the
person you know all the details of the
framework or should it be like right
after the use mix where after the
Marauder installed
we're a small project like the task
manager which should be about eight to
nine videos and then from there go into
the details
hey this is the details up to rouse this
is the details of the controllers this
is the details of the blade is the
details of the battles the views so yeah
man so that's what I was like you know I
mean I need to get that that information
I need to get that info from everybody
so like that I didn't get to chew and
see guys but yeah so yeah so this I have
it you know this introduction this is
mix a mix and then right after you know
mix definitely I was thinking instead of
giving you guys all the information and
first things to like all this how you
talk control and decided to walk a model
decided to a database or go today
database instead of doing all that
before going into that basically come in
and give you a little project of like 9
to 10 videos you know each video will be
like three minutes so be like half an
hour like a half an hour project I
understand what's going on in and really
like understand the power of flower
Belle so that's what I wanted to do
because sometimes you come in you you
get into a course and then you realize
too like man this person's giving me so
much details I mean like you
haven't built anything yet so you lose
interest and you lose you know that that
little spark that you had in the
beginning you're like oh man I can't
wait to I start learning this course but
when you go in there you're like I gotta
go through five hours of
that I could have found them on the
documentation you know what I mean like
I rather just go in and start building
things that's what I want to know which
one you like it's like if you liked
mixed between both of them or your like
project based or you like detail based
all right so see
see let me see what else is online right
now kids let me see anybody else got any
questions let me know
groans sniffs says do it the way you
learned it
if I was to do it like the way I learned
it one of the main reasons why I'm doing
this course on their own because
literally as I get so many messages from
people that actually Joe was the best
course on Larrabee what's the best way
to learn mara
laravel and we have learned that well it
wasn't learning a course it was between
learning from the documentation going
through a website the cold scotch scotch
that I owe those scars that I own oh let
me see if I can show it to you guys I
will come here subscribe sorry oh they
always have like little tutorials or
certain topics so I'm gonna hear from
them
I will learn from who else was the son
IRA
I forgot me but yeah I will come to them
I'm going you to I will go to the
documentation you know I will come here
and be like okay I want to create
something with the templates how do I do
this how do I do a if statement so I
will come here copy this paste it into
my code and then from there play around
with all right so that's how I learned
which was a horrible way because
there's really no good courses there's
nothing that you could say hey this is
the best course on our go this is the
best way to learn it because there's so
many changes constantly and just do
we--how the framework is like they just
came out with five point five right and
like maybe six months ago that had five
point four
totally deaf right now five point four
and five point four was totally
different than five point three so it's
like course most of the time is out
there right and even if you come to me
and let's say right now I come to I come
to you for me here right
and for me that's like I think that
that's word that I get because I'm an
instructor or you to me you guys soon
will see all my courses on udemy for
those of you I mean you're gonna see me
there I'm in talks with you to me
because they kind of they like what I do
they like you know they like the swag so
they kind of want me to really be a face
of it I mean I shouldn't be talking
about this but at the end of the
day once I create all the courses all my
courses gonna begin you know me too
they want to just go over there but at
the same time on my website sports would
be always cheaper so no matter what but
let me say right here we come and we say
Maribel right we come here to say
student hi turn to fallarbor and then
there's a lot of courses on Marvel now
the worst course makes 96 dollars per
month its 2800 which is a three thousand
dollars right now one of the reasons why
people like laravel doesn't make that
much money is because like as far as the
course it doesn't tell how much is
because you have this I'm sorry of
Emilia's are supportive but his
course on on PHP laravel is like
literally one of the worst
courses ever like I can't go to that
course I don't you know and it's not for
me to talk to share on the guy but
everybody who has taken that course that
I know they've been like I hate
this guy I can't I can't listen
to him I can't watch his videos I can't
learn anything from him but because he
was the first one to create a course for
Valera he gets that big you know that
big best-selling so people go in and
they buy it and then they return
it you know that he has a 160,000
students bladder uh-oh
give it ratings that means that a lot of
people return this they
keep returning it because it's not good
wait and then there's a couple other
people who are coming up like this guy
Maximilian
he's on YouTube too he makes his money
from other other courses like I think
the angular course angular for like this
are his best-selling courses angular for
he's really big of UGS because he was
the first one to make a course on it and
that's one of the things about that's
 up about you to me like it's not
really as an instructor it's more about
who comes up with the course first like
hyper app right hyper have I told you
guys this is popping up and is getting
very popular if I come in and I create I
come in I create a tutorial on this or
hyper have you do me even though if my
tutorial is I released the
first or unity udemy promote smart
course yes
so going back to lerigot the lateral
course that's number one it's
horrible because there's like this like
a numbers game guys so like let's say
right now right you see this course
because it's still
I'm sorry to say because it's so bad yes
even though it has a high demand of
people that want to learn it
he only makes $3,000 let's look at what
 this guy is like me Coke's feel
a list of people aren't on trying to
compu that's why I want to create really
high quality choices and could be like
the the best type this is the type
of that comes to use me arena this
is course right here second course right
now on unity he's making fifty four
thousand dollars a month so that goes to
show you and even though this is almost
an equal amount of people searching for
and people searching for what the
development it's almost the same amount
of people searching for it for $4,000
NDS makes three thousand which tells you
the course is not that good it means
people are returning the out of
that course you know I mean so you know
in going back to going back to you guys
you know YouTube my youtube subscribers
or my people that support me like they
else it meant I'm not really trying to
compete with nobody on YouTube like I
could care less about just because we're
not in the same ball game I mean like
I'm not looking to be like hey I got a
hundred thousand subscribers now but a
top selling instructor
to help other people out there
because the reason like you know I mean
the cognition or they but the reason why
a lot of people you know this important
coastal Steven ground is because the
courses are really good or in reality I
don't see them like
giving back to the people helping people
out and going to me they're you
know they look at this more like a
business me when I can't even I didn't
look at it to my business I look at it
through the fact that I wanted to learn
how to code keep jumping from coke
adding into three Co camp to
team treehouse to you to me to YouTube
which is sky style to sight point
calm so Stack Overflow like that
you keep jumping to different areas but
I'll because you don't have one place
where you could just want in an easy way
like you know not all of us are coming
from a computer science degree the way
you know to programming like we're
coming from regular jobs you know what I
mean if we want to get into this
industry and it's not very welcoming a
lot other people they give you what a
whole bunch of big words so they give
you a bunch of that in reality is
scarce the people it scares people
it makes people lose interest so
that's the the barrier where I'm trying
to break you I'm like you know what back
the crowd of developers will be like oh
this is how you do this
algorithm this is how we make this
more fishing and this and that and like
I you can keep that this you know that's
not gonna help nobody doesn't wanna
change the world that's not gonna do
anything for nobody
what I hope is you know Lilian
this was to do something else for her
life a Tyrone who was
working at footlocker and it's
like this
I don't wanna work for footlocker
earning $15 an hour that's not
where I see my life right things like
you know what people used to be out here
like you know people's grandparents a
parents where they were like you know
working for Ford and Ford you you was
able
to maintain a certain type of lifestyle
and be able to buy a house be able to
buy a car be able to take care of your
family and do that I just have my
regular job no more right so those are
the people that I'm trying to help I'm
not always saying this I'm not looking
to be a millionaire I'm looking to the
fact of giving people a different option
a different way to getting you know just
financially stable you know technology
is high and it's gonna be high every
 year because that's what
everybody likes that's why everybody's
into it you know the people who jump
into the phone applications people who
jump into or websites people who jump
into machine learning people who jump
into you know deep learning
people jump into and it's made
like those step guys are always gonna
have a job so where do you want to be
you want to be one of the people that
always time a job or you want to be one
of those guys that out there life is for
me right you don't wanna be one of those
people so that's why that's my crowd
that's the people that I want to serve
that's the people that wouldn't work for
those are people I want to into the next
level you know because I wish I had
somebody who want to help me out you
know that whole year almost two years
this even though I got hired good a good
developer I wasn't earning top dollar so
like maybe my year and a half I'm down
to like a you know a half two years
talking you know help somebody out to
take them to the next level without
having to you know spend so much time
looking for resources and instead of
think we just instead of looking for
resources they just hit the ground
running but I okay I'm here to learn
this this are the best resources instead
of going from channel to channel
websites of website and in fact I'm
trying to learn from everybody and they
just come to me my okay there's the best
route let me just
let me not focus about all the noise
that surround me and let me just focus
on learn word let me sing listen what
everybody's over here little comments
J roster said bro I'm in the Navy on
some a 2019 I'm making good money for
the promise suck our at least junior
worth development job by the time I get
out what will you do pull really jump on
taking the courses man do I have a
friend who who went to the Navy which
this is so stupid to me man
my friend went to the Navy and he went
to the Navy and didn't do nothing with
being animated when he came back he came
back almost six seven years later from
the Navy and then started going to
college like going backwards it
means that that guy was seven years late
he could have been doing something else
better with his life now for you what I
would advise you is since you were smart
enough to say hey I want to plan
something I wanna have something planned
by the time I get out of here I want to
be able to have a job what I would say
is start taking the courses that either
my way to learn it to my website you not
the courses I have they're on my
description or you could just go in and
 you know just free-balling free
ball is just like I said before just
jump from channel to channel
website to website and trying to figure
out your own way of learning you know I
tell people the best way is just follow
the way that somebody already did you
know so you don't have to spend months
looking for the right resource instead
you just focus on learning in that same
Jerome Smith said yeah so what they did
to traversing media why I'm see somewhat
a dislike box I didn't see that
honestly I mean the more about that
there they say
that show their own general got the
insight I don't remember
traversing medias and saying that he got
a bob also shared that you understand
I'm reading through everybody
people benefits in your footlocker but
something I don't know I just you know
just created an example not saying that
we get less than that okay Shay
- we'll stop
or man I don't know I know that this
always somebody who dislikes my video I
don't know why why I don't know why they
even come to my video thing I know they
don't like it I bump into like out here
I don't like the channel if I don't like
your channel automatically you know what
I do and I like this not interested I
can type different videos you see as you
can see I almost get nobody like you no
other use of developers or like ranking
I'll get traversing media sometimes I
get the real cast there are sometimes I
get some candy sometimes again Chris
Sean that I don't get nobody else cuz it
means a 90% other people I just take
them off I'll be like ok this is your
channel not interesting and just click
in there so I don't have to see you ever
again in my life
yeah people people who are haters that's
just how it is
that's something I'm learning more and I
get into this like I realized that I
don't I don't with a lot of people
you know I mean like I when people
that want to get help other people who
are I'm doing or somewhere close to my
lane they they're not up there because
they want to be your friends and they
want to help you out this is there to
somehow take your sauce see what what
the hell is working for you take it
that's just how it is some people hate
yeah people wait agent no matter what
you do exactly like I just going yeah I
don't dislike no video the only way I
don't dislike a video is if it's like if
it's like some crazy I don't know like
something propaganda type
like out this Mikey but besides that and
that's it
yeah no I stopped I stopped doing all
that click beep that's the thing
man that's where it kind of sucks
click baiting because when you click B
people come to you into your channel and
they expecting a certain type of content
and when they get there you give them
seven minutes of content and maybe you
give them one minute of whatever was the
title for me I really do I really think
that's it that's why I don't do it on my
on my channel
but as you can see my channel has been
hurt from me from like doing it you know
I've been to real with apologize I feel
like I don't want to do certain type of
 like I haven't done a top 10 video
like well top 10 programming languages
or type 10 10 frameworks out 10 but
because I don't do that and because I
don't choose what I was trending didn't
hurt by it because I just want to keep
it real if I like something I like if I
don't like you I don't like it for more
than thing I don't wanna think he's died
if I'm not interesting at all right but
people here you to date they don't care
about that
what I care about is just to get as any
people even Westerkamp subscribers like
that reason why I feel like all the
people that come to my channel are more
annoying because I look at it being
myself two guys who have a hundred
thousand subscribers when I go in and I
checked out their cameras and I see a
hug dozen subscribers how do you a
hundred thousand subscribers and then
from there you only get like a thousand
views on your videos I think that makes
you think like wait what out of all your
videos you only get one percent of your
viewers to watch your videos you're
doing something wrong for me when I drop
a video I get at least 20 30 sometimes
even a 50 percent when I drop a video
which tells me people like my heart like
my content of whatever is it that I'm
doing it on whatever it is that I'm
gonna talk about
I felt Utah how does it tap and says I'm
actually sad because you because you're
real and provide a no-nonsense approach
to things and also as a person of color
I feel I think I can relate to you and
there's corn fries no first among people
of color is just motivating when you see
a person that looks like you yes and
that's the same thing I feel I feel
about like what development in general
or even programming like there is a lot
of guys and who are minorities they
don't come up like on YouTube they don't
show up pity they don't promote this
type of lifestyle more well you know
coming here and by far the better
right so when I was doing this I was
like man I don't know if I I can relate
to a lot of these people that there was
a lot of squares there was a lot of
dudes who this do I know this dude was
getting put in the locker you know what
I mean like I know he was getting
wedgies and like you know what release
while he was in school
those were now the people who I hand out
with so it's like even till now I still
be like I like the fact that you're very
smart but at the same time we're not the
the the same type of people you know so
it's like I can't relate to you and
that's how it is for a lot of people and
it's like other people who come to me so
my channel like there's people who who
might come to my channel and the people
that I might get the they not the same
type of people that would go to their
channel or vice versa right because they
can't relate to me right there's people
who are very
you know they're very privileged in
certain ways like when I told to one of
you guys in here I was like telling you
guys like my story you know like coming
from the bottom and doing all this
and somebody left a comment section like
here we go again
coming from the bottom it's like just
talk about code and it's like yeah but
coming from the bottom is like a
is a real life thing it's not I don't
have papi and mami to take care of yeah
I mean have nobody coming here when I
wanted to dalish you know what it's
supported me like I didn't have nothing
not I mean like everything that I've
done I've done for myself so for people
who are here and they doing all this
 by themselves or didn't have that
support what they're gonna own hey Shawn
like you know hey Shawn you could you
know go ahead go to your go take a year
off don't even go to college Shawn you
got a little fun here grandma left you
something nice I didn't get that and I
wasn't gonna get there right so people
who come from that background they're
not gonna relate to me I don't you know
what I mean so it's like that's just how
it is you know so he's like I always
tell people man my channel is about
growth and it's showing people what you
can do and what you can't accomplish you
know sometimes I might come in here and
just you know without a stack of
money it's not because I want to
be like showing off or acting up it's
just to show somebody out there there
might be a low kick out there who might
be like 16 17 in high school who's like
man give me no money why am I gonna
learn this thing why am I gonna try to
bust my ass learning the and then
it's like listen no boy you could get
that guala here son like you know just
to open the eyes because it's like
somebody comes to me and tells me hey a
doctor a doctor guess $300,000 $400,000
a year but to me that sounds foreign you
know what I mean like to me that sounds
foreign dust
I see therefore
that's a whole different world from
where I come from him where I could
relate to why could be like a man you
can make a money bi hit Chile you could
buy all the king's that you want if I
can still go clubbing you still live
your life and a king my coming in every
late to that oh with this guy you
know I like what he's saying like you
don't have to be nerdy to be into the
technology and creating cool
because look at the best
developers the guys who are really doing
a big like Elon Musk the creator
of Ruby on Rails like those
 guys they're living it
out they're living extravagant
they doing trips buying
foreign cars like T Chile but that's all
because of you know programming and you
know a lot of other developers they
don't show that side that's not that's
not the type of lifestyle that's not who
they are like this guy's who who
might have a couple of million dollars
in if I can still driving around in a
 Prius do I want to be the guy
with a million dollars worth of
trunking working every day and walking
around with a Prius no earning a
million dollars I need to have at least
I'll bengi your son
you know I mean because just to feel
good just a few like hey I busted my ass
for a reason you know
and certain people will relate to that
and there's other people are not going
to relate to that because they don't
come from that world of coming from the
bottom they just don't know that
for them that's for me for them knowing
hey I don't have my dad in my house
that's for for them to say hey you don't
have Christmas present that's foreign
for them to say hey you you have
to work in the summer
not because you could do it you know oh
yeah great
I'm working are a Shake Shack
this summer just for the hell of it no
you work at
Shake Shack because you gotta
have money in your pockets now you're
not gonna eat like so for some people
that is foreign to them you know I
mean I think there's people who are 90%
of the people who hate me on my videos
about who are the boot camps they hate
it because it's foreign to them they
don't understand that there's people out
there who might say hey I don't have the
options of getting myself into debt for
$20,000 and then on top of that not
working for three months for them that's
four because in their head is like oh I
got sixty seventy thousand dollars
laying around I could just you know you
know what I'll go to boot camp is 15,000
I have enough money to just chill and
relaxing
I could chill for three months maybe
I'll even go to my mom's house and and
live over there for six months until I
find a job and yeah if it becomes a year
cool whatever for a lot of people they
can't they can't even think that that
 is foreign to them that I kill I
can't imagine myself being able
to do that because I have to work
every day I have to pay my bills I have
taken all addition those people that
can't relate to me because of that
well I'm not think you know I'm not here
to to tell people a happy story I'm not
here to do you know like what a lot of
people want you to do force how you call
it
force happiness in like force positivity
like know if I'm positive that I should
I'm positively if I'm negative that they
I show that I'm negative keep some
people they don't like you know because
people YouTube is an escape sometimes
two people have shitty lives so if they
come here to YouTube and they're not
getting somebody who comes here everyday
life hey guys you guys can become a web
developer in two months if you guys can
become on I did in one week you guys can
do in two weeks no I'm not so you
I'm not tied up as America
like hey guys you got two weeks dude you
got two weeks before I shut down my
website you have two weeks to sign up
and be able to sign up you know no I'm
not doing that to you guys because
that's not who I am you know I'm like
I'm here to help out but I'm not here to
exploit I'm not here to sell
false positivity like you know like
 Tai Lopez's all of you my
 advertising right now like do
like stop you know he's like
he's like hey guys do you guys you know
a millionaire mentor a millionaire
mentor come get a millionaire mentor
like okay show me how to get a million
dollars working don't tell me this this
fake of like how to get a million
dollars by you know coming up
with with schemes that other
people have already came up with because
you have to understand this by the time
somebody tells you hey like the
same example I come in I tell you hey
man you gotta buy this stocks right I'll
tell you hey go buy the Google stock
right by the time I told you that that
whole wave is already gone it's already
too late the reason what I told you to
go buy is because I already made my
money and then now telling you hey I
made money in it but now you go in there
and go spend your money and then
it's too late for you you know people be
 selling dreams and schemes you
know
you know that's all I'm saying I'm
telling people like I want you guys to
really succeed man you know like I'm not
trying to be freaked out here man I just
wish people just understand before
people understand and be like oh cool
I understand what he's doing I
understand what he wants to do with this
you know I was like so people so people
before man I'm not looking into
competition YouTube is not a competition
I could literally rape I could literally
rip the game ring I could rape you -
brayner with two ways number one pain
a bunch of Facebook groups which
I have the money to do it
it's not like I'm broke I can
just go and pay a bunch of Facebook
groups and sound oh hey promote
me just play my videos -
everybody automatically my views go up
well my views goes up you to
start showing me all the other
things I could go in and put my answers
to a Cora Cora post there that post
started getting like 200,000 views
300,000 views every time that that a
corporate post gets popular then from
there I get a you know at least two
three subscribers from every 50 views on
Quora
like there's some million ways to do it
it's not that hard but I'm not trying to
so played a youtube game of like
oh man let's just try to get as
many subscribers as we can now our
quality I want quality subscribers I
don't want a hundred thousand
subscribers and only 1% of those people
watch my videos I don't want that I want
a hundred thousand subscribers and I
want when I drop a video at least fifty
thousand subscribers watch my video so
it should be 50,000 views per video
that's what I want you know so that's
what we're going for man you're not
going for to have a bunch of numbers
reason case is a yo have you ever took a
long break and came back to JavaScript
super rusty yes it happens all the time
it happens all the time there's a lot of

a lot of different methods that I've
learned from JavaScript that because I
don't use it every day I have to
continue looking at the documentation so
it's like it's fine as long as you know
how to as long as you know how to to
look be able to look you should be fine
yeah man let's see whoever hasn't voted
guys listen on my description I want to
know the people want to know if you
haven't voted on my description right
here there's a a forum right here you
click on that and then just vote what do
you what's your favorite weights of
Nariko what do you prefer for your
learning experience project-based detail

so let me check we got 22 responses we
got 24 responses if you have a voting go
ahead and vote I guess nobody wants
detail based everybody wants to mix make
some project based the majority is for
mix
yeah me too boy traversing me you're
killing the game like you see for me
this is cool I like what I see when I
see traversing media he be doing his
thing like you see he drops a video and
his videos there are 15,000 years 15
thousand views 10,000 views eleven
thousand views 31 thousand views 29 so
there's like a hundred fifty thousand
subscribers he gets about let's look at
this let's say let's do the math 149 all
right a new 49 no we're gonna do per
view let's say sixteen dollars on a
stick - average sixteen thousand nine
hundred and two times sixteen thousand
nine hundred to one hundred divided by
one hundred and forty-nine thousand four
hundred and seventy one and he gets
eleven percent of the views that's
actually pretty good
that's pretty good that's not bad
you know that means that he has a core
audience you know can come here and we
look at us who else is in the game let's
see let's let's see the one of the
biggest cameras I want you to see this
case
getting like warlike 3% yes I was used
that's simple simple program was going
you know they're like three percent so
many videos so away well gravel got one
percent of use that's the Brits hawks
seventy four thousand and there I'll let
see from looking at the videos I'll say
he gay so three thousand and saying this
big bonus has three thousand three
thousand two hundred fifty three and
then all right so you know so hundred
fifty three times 100 divided by seven
before or
I can definitely what Oh his video one
has videos soon that he created a video
became viral which was him and his
daughter so it was like something a
programmer asked me to his daughter the
program and I knew his stats because it
brought in so many people who are who
were just like pieces of like
people who were subscribing to this
channel and people who were like
pedophiles were like oh yeah your
daughter looks great
oh your daughter is blue they're your
daughter looks like Sonic you're not it
isn't that and it's like dining the
whole channel like you know he
had a very good core audience I think he
had like a good patience the last time I
checked before that video came in he was
getting like a good 10% you so that
means a core audience of 10% of all his
subscribers which is something great I
think that's what people should do
definitely strive for because it just it
means that your your fan base and we're
subscribers are more loyal and they
there for a reason
it's not like oh I found this person's
channel once and then I'll never come
back to their channel because anybody
can come in and go hey I subscribe to
Joe there now I can see them again you
know what I mean
yeah so it wasn't started at school
whereas pixel oh man he should have
stayed you should have stayed around
with he was like one of our engineers
man and him deaf tapes learned
Codecademy the guys disappeared and they
was they asked like three four years
disappeared
II like the computer guy I don't know I
don't understand his channel I don't
know what the is this channel about
chen he has nothing else to talk about
he does so many videos that he has
nothing else to talk about like right
now he's living off you know like if it
Google right now there are a whole
algorithm of how the videos show up like
here because anything that's quality or
even worth listening to
they're Anna's he's killing it soon
we'll see what their kindness is Zach
see like their advanced videos work
great it's like to use it like a
documentation from a language and you're
like oh you want someone to tell you I
mean instead of you having to go in
there and look at the documentation oh
yeah
come to me the super mario clone while
he's using the ability takes 20,000
subscribers that is crazy
very bad news you know that's how you
know me he started you don't know what
to make videos about I'm gonna create a
clash royale video Oh somebody don't
have nothing else to do everyone was
like that's like one of those channels
that he's good
he got 600,000 subscribers even rain now
if he wanted to sell that channel he
will make a couple dollars off that
channel wait dick let me see whether he
started I'm gonna live there advance for
me let me see it was the oldest video
where I'm seven years like come on let
me get to something years young when we
get to study music in YouTube what we do
with it you guys gonna have to excuse me

to do it
I'm just forcing you to do it I'm gonna

baby their interview J yes in three
minutes you know it's not my fault I'm
not doing down purpose it's just you
trying to
the subscribers to their VG ps3 three
minutes wait to our view maximum and
then make the video to be like 20
minutes long this will be crashing on
the Google advertising
today game and dev tips just a man I
talked to him a couple of times but
don't like traveling they he knows
the passion that's the thing that that
pisses me off
it's like you come in you do a lot of
work right and then people like you and
people support you but you do see like
oh you know what
and then you disappear
I mean to move around
you know I think they are pretty
subscribed to you and they're putting so
much work and face behind you keep on
making videos do one video a week one
video a month at least it's not that
hard people have like dishes as they
come into user was like
Fonfon a function and his channel is
good
goodnight size channel at all I feel
like you know he makes his channel more
complicated than anything but for me
personally laying dead channels not for
me topics that this top is there that
are just not like for the average
developer moles and his topics are not
even useful yeah
