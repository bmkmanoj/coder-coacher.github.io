back at it again man coding face.com
your boy is backing out and did it again
listen guys we all get in traffic right
now we all know way back to little
island we chillin we went to this you
know it's canceled wolf
it was great I have fun you know chilled
the family it was a good thing right
so I'm here you know I'm listening to
the people's peoples is like man there's
something going on with Chris Shawn you
know he's calling himself a software
engineer he's not a software engineer
like he's barely a junior developer this
doesn't die and I'm like guys you know
like it doesn't really matter it's just
a title like it's just a title guys like
I do it myself like you know when you go
and like I said you talk to somebody
who's a regular person why cause
civilian right somebody who has no idea
what what development is what
programming is you know when they ask me
hey what do you do live in hell I'm a
software engineer that's it they
understand what that means you tell
somebody oh I'm a web developer in
reality they're like what you're a web
designer you make websites I'm like no
I'm not a web designer on design
websites I programmed them basically I'm
a developer so to make it easier for
them to understand a lot of times are
you selling I'm a software engineer am i
a software engineer
not really right it's just a title right
now as far as high colors as far as the
title itself there's so many companies
that use it just for everybody like
nowadays you go to Facebook you go to
even Google
you know he is just so far engineer
that's it you program so far engineer
that's about it right that's the title
for you and Netflix they call you a UI
engineer that's it right a full-stack
engineer you know those are the things
that I'm seeing especially now how the
web has become like the web is not how
it used to be like at one point I used
to be cool a webmaster the people who
who are like you know my age 29 30 years
old or even older they know about this
they know back in the days they usually
just call people who work on websites
your web designer right that's a that's
your title or people will say hey we're
looking for a webmaster but guys it's
just titles we don't know what the hell
they're gonna call us ten years from now
you know it's like I don't know tapi the
tapi the developers or something like
that I don't know if maybe in the future
everything might be just be touchscreen
so they will just call us hey are you a
tapi developer like you know what I mean
like it's just a title it's not a big
deal guys you know don't stress it you
know I do myself somebody asked me if
I'm talking to a regular person a
civilian there's really no point of me
to break down the John russ of
programming that I'm in right but I hate
I do front-end and the backend I'm a web
developer like if I go in and tell that
to a civilian they're like wait what
you're what they think developers are
like people who the construction do
buildings and things like that you know
for us because we're in the industry we
know the different genres and subgenres
of like programming the reality is like
people just be like hey I'm a programmer
that's it
that would make sense because that's
what we do we all program doesn't matter
phase C sharp doesn't matter if it's
Java doesn't matter if it's web well you
know PHP doesn't matter for this
JavaScript is programming really it's
the same thing guys you know so people
freaking out with the whole thing about
Chris Shawn if he's a software engineer
like guys it doesn't really matter it's
a title it's like you know people give
themselves title a few years ago people
used to call themselves I'm a CSS rock
star or I saw this one time I'm the
second coming of I'm the second coming
of Jesus with JavaScript I was like wait
what and like people put things like
that on on their freaking on their their
comments and stuff like that
unlike the resumes like now there's
people freaking out people for
definitely freaking out you know I was
like people was like y'all talking about
somebody I thought was if inside like
something happen with Chris Shawn I'm
like wait what
like I told something bad happened I
thought like you know Chris Shawn was
gonna be like you know I was like there
was gonna be a video somebody leaked to
a Christian sex tape or you know it's
like oh my god Chris Shawn does drugs or
but something crazy but it's like all
Christian names himself a software
engineer or a software developer like I
thought it was gonna be sighs serious
like I thought it was gonna be like a
Christian sex tape you know I was like
more like oh my god they found Chris on
doing a line on the bathroom like things
like that would have been shocking I
would have bet oh my god Chris on we
need some man we need to help him out
he just say you know he's a software
software developer like it's not a big
deal guys yeah man YouTube drama you
know maybe you know people get mad you
know I feel people go too hard on
Christian I really do
I think people a lot of people go too
hard on him because you know he he got
opportunities I early stage in his
career you know and not a lot of people
get those opportunities you know but
it's it shows that he's been doing good
it's for a reason that he got it he's
been here for a long time I mean like in
a company like were like a year almost
who he is now so they did a good job
they gave it to the right person because
you know somebody like me I'm on my
first three months I quit the job I was
like young I'm gone because I wasn't
getting paid that much like I don't know
how much Chris Sean gets paid but he
seems happy there you know what I mean
me I'm like on my first job I know
they're not paying you the top dollar so
I'm the type of person that like hey I'm
gonna come here for three months and I'm
out of here
you know like I'm definitely gonna get
that top money because in reality you
look at it this guy's making a lot of
money out there man you know and when
you stay in one company they don't come
in they don't take care of you like that
you know they don't come in and give you
the hey here's a extra $10,000 you know
ten thousand fifteen thousand dollars
cause your skills going up this year
none they would okay here's a thousand
dollars up like that's nothing that's
like $50 on your check you know
that's not real money you know what I
mean
her is like a making it job no I'm just
I'm just making a video I'm making a
response to it I'm not making it I'm
actually surprised it's like a BS story
you know I mean I thought it was gonna
be something cool so I think cool like
happen you know Chris song got a crazy
sex tape
they found Chris song with two black
girls and man like who knew Chris always
all his money on you know all freakin on
a strip club like you know that that
would have been a crazy story you know
what I mean was a Christian is a
software developer so for engineer like
whoop-dee-doo like it's not a big story
it's nothing crazy guys
we're a man now sometimes you can force
their head but companies that's how
companies are man like you're not gonna
get money I'm being honest guys like
let's say you're a junior developer they
look at you as a junior developer
forever like even if you've been there
for two three years I've seen it happen
to people like that's like nothing new
people get hired as a junior developer
they stay in a company and those people
they still look at you as if you're a
junior developer you're like now I
already got my skills oh you know like
I've been doing a lot of work like I
should be getting paid way more money
companies they're not trying to hear
that they're like nah we don't that's
not our you know they'll come up with
this line that's not our policy you know
that's why why you think so many
developers jump from different companies
because every time that you jump to
another company that's a ten thousand
twenty thousand dollar raise because
you're already coming with all the
skills from another place and it's like
now you're gonna get paid higher
if I wanted to this well I wanted to
talk on this car because I'm driving
Barbara got Derick Barbara I'm driving
like I can't type I'm I'm on traffic
right now I can't type that's why I came
here and I talk about it you know what I
mean like that's why Plus this is good
it's good so like that everybody here
can move on for that cuz I I remember
sort of the video from kershaun like I
know the last two three videos or
something like that but he was talking
about it but I didn't think that it was
like a bigger thing than what it is you
know what I mean I remember he was
talking about it like people or me being
mean and stuff like that I think that's
really messed up you know what I mean
like people just gotta take it easy you
know people go hard on me you know
luckily I'm I go right back at them you
know what I mean like I go hard you know
they people really don't want to mess me
you know even I know a lot of youtubers
out here like they can't stand me
because the swag is too real the sources
is outstanding you know what I mean I'm
out here sourcing to the max you know
but people get tight you know people see
me I got a beautiful family beautiful
kid I got a big body bends about to buy
a big body house I'm doing if you know
for you too full time like people get
tight they be like why does this kid you
know why is this kid like this you know
what I mean like why is he good
why he good I'm not good you know I mean
like this people like that and then they
just come in leave a crazy comment and
be like oh man
even rappers even one of you rappers are
our developers now it's like man like
just live your life instead of you
coming here and leaving hate on me try
to better your life so you could be good
and then the next person can hate on you
you know like that's what people should
do you know but I really do think that
people go too hard they go to harm me
like I said myself people go hard
sometimes on me but I don't paint on
mine because then I come around I'm like
man I look at my bank account I look at
how many people I help every single day
how many emails I get like saying thank
you how many freakin messages I get from
people that want me to work at their
company and I'm like man I live good you
know what I mean like why am I worried
about what some you know some dweeb you
know on a basement you know next to the
bathroom is like his room is on the
bathroom is on the basement right well
he got a smell you got a smell the ish
all day right and then he's tight he's
like oh man why does he get
opportunities you know why he good why
can't be good let me drop some some hate
to make sure to ruin his day you know so
I just think about him like I gotta just
chill not paying attention enjoying my
life you know what I mean so
so that's why I would say to Chris
console okay just chill don't block
nobody don't don't do nothing crazy
don't fight with the people you know
just be like hey is a title that's it
move on for me
enjoy your life you know you're doing
stuff that a lot of people wish they
could be doing that's it now changing
subject you know how do you know when I
come in here I give you guys like a good
10-15 minutes of a subject and then we
move from that all right so what's good
man what's good kids we in traffic right
now
was the beef was the tea oh man yo
Barbara you gotta sauce it up sometimes
you got a source up the the the
community real quick you know I mean
like people love this they love this
dish I don't know how to play the game
man unfortunately you know gotta learn
how to play the game
bro now I don't even believe it man you
know that's why I don't even believe it
because you know what to salsa
dude if you give me if you give me proof
that he said that I'll give you a good
20 minute video on that kid you know

me where you live that can't how many
years you bring in this game can't
accent where are you from you know how
much you're making axel how much you
know what programming languages do you
know what companies you work for ask him
that just you know if you really said
that just acts from that you know and
then you put my my career with his
career you just cross-reference it and
be like Oh who's winning you know what I
mean like I'm good
like I I realized I don't have to like
go hard no more young people because
like I said I'm good like I'm chilling
right now like I'm sunroof you know I
got a nice piece of burger waiting for

isn't that I'm like bro I'm in my house
I'm chillin I'm on chunk lettuce right
now you know what I really like I'm one
chunk elite dust I'm wearing the same
shirt from the day before because I'm in
my house it's like a house shirt you
know I mean like I've never been into
like really go hard like on the clothes
I'm more of a person that I like to just
buy material things like computers games
watches I like jewelry I've never been
into the clothes like I'm more of like I
could just put on the hoodie and I say
I'm good and I think I'm always gonna be
like that because it's like I'm not
really like into the whole whole thing
of like oh man I gotta wear you know
different shirt every single day of the
day of the frickin month like no I'm not
gonna spend my money on clothes like
that I got other stuff that I like to
spend money on
but well yeah going back to the other
kid if he did say that like just some
man cross-reference your life with minds
and that's it just be like yo bro I
almost like you know a different level
you know what I mean it's like was this
other guy's name simple programmer I'm
not a huge fan of his his channel
because it's more like a motivation or
lifestyle type of channel and it's like
a lot of different type of questions is
not just about programming but when I
compare my life to his life of my kill
simple program was winning he's got like
20 different condos and houses that he
rents out like he got freakin people
that edit his videos like he's winning
you know it's like so when I look at the
other kid that you guys are mentioning
right now I'm like bro I'm winning
against that kid like that's it like I
can't I don't even have to talk to him
you know what I mean
guys man life is good man I've been
noticing that you know these days I'm
upset those days that you know I might
get a little depressed cos I miss my
sister or I'm like I'm sad about I wanna
you know before it was I want to spend
more time with my family and now I got
to spend more time with my family
you know what I mean so I'm living
really really really good right now
you know I'm giving myself a few months
to a year to see if this thing works you
know I'm about 60 to 70 percent I'm
making right now 60 to 70 percent of
what I made I was making on my my job
full-time which is fine it's not
everything but I know the long-term is
gonna pay off right now if I get
desperate cuz it was like the other day
I was at Macy's right and I'm like I'm
usually the type of person that if I
want something I just buy because I know
I have that money there but then I was
like thinking about it I'm like yo I'm
not working full-time like I used to I'm
making 60 to 70% latter well 60 70
percent of what I was making before so
now I have to think about what I'm
buying and I was like man you know what
man if this thing doesn't double itself
in the next four or five months imma
just go back he'll go back to work cuz
it's like you know when you have the
financial freedom like I could literally
be like hey I'll buy whatever the hell I
want
I could go to wherever city I want to I
could go to Dr if I want to it's like
now I know it's because I'm starting
this new business but now I'm more
conscious about money or how I spend my
money on what I do with it before I did
it so now I'm like hmm you know what if
this thing don't double up in five
months five six months then you know I'm
more I might just take one of those
offers man you know I got a lot of
people that want me to work in their
company you know
got a couple of places that it's gonna
be funny it's gonna be hilarious when
you know be like oh shoot Joe works for
this company you guys is gonna be
surprised man I've been just like on the
low I don't my YouTube thing I do my
thing but I'm like not even you know

emotional because it's like it was real
you guys don't know a lot of you guys
don't know what that feels like being
like a bum
like on the freakin train like asking
people here can you swipe me in like
that like I didn't even have money to go

if somebody tells me oh I'm fake I'm
dissing that bro like my life is 20
times better than yours like hush your
mouth shut your throat that's yeah you
dirty bucket like such a trope that's it
like I live in amazing life okay
I'm getting blessings cuz I put in my
work and people don't know what I've
been to
tell them man
me like yo what do you live just
suddenly yo where you live Batman
cross-reference Joe's life with his like
well like yo Joe lives in one of the top
ten richest neighborhoods in freaking
New York State like he lives good like
he's chillin he works from home got
savings would you know about savings man
but you know this times whatever like if
I wanted to start I could really start
what you know about savings man what you
know about 100 King like you know we was
trying to talk about man I'm about to
touch 100k subscribers man what you know
about bank account 100k and above what
you know about that cannulate come on
mainly shut your throat man like that's
whenever somebody says anything about me
but I yo Joe said shut your throat not
even shut your mouth shut your throat
don't let no air come out of there
shut that up real quick
man that was a little quick rent you
know you know how I do man
sometimes you have to use like let the
sauce come out it's like the sauce is
fighting it right now say I could go
hard but I don't want to like I'm still
young I was thinking about it too the
other day I'm like man I'm 29 years old
I'm leaving thirty-year you know it was
gonna suck I'ma be 30 in December 3rd my
dream was to come out in force of 30
under 30 but that's not gonna happen
anymore which what that was one of my
bucket list but that's not gonna happen
anymore which freaking sucks
that was like one of my dreams like when
I was like 16 17 18 years old I'm there
I wanted to be on the Forbes list for 30
under 30 and those people the guys that
come out on that magazine for 30 under
30 day it's not really about money it's
more about the impact
there's people who who are broke on that
magazine but they've done an impact like
this this kid then what was his name I
forgot his name
but there was this kid who he created a
app that helped homeless people
five shelters and he was on the list I
was like yo man I wish I could get on
that list man sometimes one of the
hardest thing okay if you guys didn't
notice I'm switching topic Rainer one of
the hardest things is coming up with
ideas man people say all the time in
this amiable emails Hey Joe I got this
great idea for this app and this this
and that and I was like you know the
hardest thing about development period
programming period is coming up with
ideas you know coming up with things
that is gonna solve problems you know in
this time that you look at applications
that people create and you were like man
this is so simple why did I not think of
it then it's like you're not thinking
about solving people's problems
you gotta start thinking about that cuz
look at that kid that kid made a whole
bunch of I think he didn't make no money
but he got the recognition for creating
the application that help the homeless
find shelters like people need that
people need to find out where all the
shelters are why didn't I think of that
you know what I mean
or even and a sign that people don't
even know about my mom my mom was a
teacher in Dominican Republic right when
she came here to the United States her
papers didn't mean anything because you
gonna have a bachelor's from another
country and when you come here to the US
it doesn't mean anything but if you go
from the u.s. to somewhere else with a
bachelor's from here it's like oh my god
it's amazing right but going back to the
story
my mom came here and when she came here
she was working in restaurants and after
restaurants somebody told her hey we
want you to you know you could work as a
taxi driver and my mom was a taxi driver
for like almost 10 years that's how she
raised us we live here me my mom my
sister and my mom was a taxi driver my
mom was never there
she was never home because she was in a
taxi cab right and then I look at uber
and I'm like man why didn't I think of
that like my mom is a taxi driver well
she was a taxi driver now she's a
teacher but before she was a these
people I do not want to curse there goes
my video match every time I curse I'll
get him I cannot play but yeah freaking
people almost crash in front of me but
yeah so things is crazy so yeah I'll be
thinking in mind like man why didn't I
think of that or you know like when I
was in junior high school I was injured
in high school I created a chatroom
right we had computer class and what we
used to do was I set up this website
remember I tell you guys I used to make
a website about like Dragon Ball Z
whatever so I made a website for my
classroom so whenever we used to go to
the computer class we all be talking in
their own chat room back then there was
no aim I mean there was a me but you
couldn't install it on the the school
computer so what I did was I built my
own chat room for everybody to be on it
and then we used to be talking Matt BS
in there you know doing a whole bunch of
bullying
like you know like just pretty much just
defecating on on everybody in there
right so um yeah it's so funny man
I remember I almost got suspended
because you remember on was a scary
movie when the little special ed kid was
like oh whatever swallows so then we
started doing that on the chatroom
so there was this girl this girl
tatianna and this girl Lisa and we will
be like the whole time on the chat room
like tatianna swallows so mind you not
little girls used to have this was like
so immature none of the girls who would
be in a chat room so then all the guys
would be laughing every like oh man and
then guys will be talking about oh yeah
like I got to third base with way
Angelika or little things like that so
then the teacher somehow somebody you
know this always a dweep so that was
this dweep there's a little kid this
little nerd I forgot I think his name
was victorious he goes in and he
snitches right so he snitches he goes
like Oh Joe created a chat room when
everybody talks about everybody in there
guys talk about what they did with the
girls in the classroom this is not so
mind you I'm never talked anything about
no girl because I never I never went out
with any girls from my school all the
girls that I used to go out with used to
be going to another school I used to go
to is 93 girls that I used to mess
around used to go to is 77 or they used
to go to the Catholic school that used
to be around my corner but everybody
else from my class will be talking about
the girls that they messed around with
in school so this thing blew up this
thing became a big thing in the school
and they're like man
are we gonna we're gonna suspend you the
sexual harassment this this and that and
I'm like what are you talking about I
was like maybe 12 you never use all
around there I don't know 12 13 around
there so it was something great but now
that I think about it I'm like you know
I could have just created a Facebook I
could have done the same thing I will
create an attender or something you know
what I mean like I created a chat room
for people to talk bs on but you know
sometimes you have opportunities and you
miss out on it you know and one thing
that I hate the most and that's the main
reason why I hate view Jas if you
haven't noticed on switching topic one
of the reason why I hate VJ s so much is
I hate the idea of using something that
was already created and then you up you
basically upgrade one or two things on
it and then now you crew you call it
something else right I hate that because
it shows that you you don't have
creativity you're not creating anything
what you're doing you're you're
upgrading something that was already
created you're making a little better
something that was already created right
and like I hate when people do that like
you know like the guy who created flappy
bird right he created flappy bird and
then after flappy bird everybody started
making games like that like little
floppy floppy whatever flappy - flappy
turtle or whatever right no games that
is the same gameplay but the only
difference is it's not what a bird like
I really hate that
you know because it's like it shows you
have no creativity all you're doing is
improving something that was there and
then renaming it to something else and
yeah that goes back to the same story
that was just saying like you have to
create new stuff man and you know so I
you know my hat goes off before for
those guys you know like the guys that
created snapchat the guys that created
Facebook Tumblr the guys I created your
Twitter was the other one tender
make all our stuff man
like it's crazy
if we almost home right now kids I know
yeah
yeah roll
when I get home what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna create a couple of more videos if
you guys haven't checked it out the
hyper app course is free guys go take it
people been asking for the restaurant at
write for a long time then we say hey
Joe we want to see all five projects I'm
giving you guys one project for free
completely free for those people that
don't don't have credit cards or don't
have any way to pay for the whole
courses take the free course man it's on
my website don't think just because it
says hyper fjs is just hyper FGS now
it's a full HTML CSS javascript in
advanced JavaScript that you're going to
learn in that course
listen man I'm good man
I'll try not to curse man let me see now
I actually live where I live is actually
in the top five I just didn't want to
say top ten but I mean look it up look
up Dix Hills man and look it up to do
yourself that favor
you know people are crazy man
and now I could guys if you know if you
don't understand this video there's like
five different topics in here in this
whole video so you know once I get home
I'm gonna look over all the messages all
the messages you guys put in the chat
room and then I think 20 minutes later
20 30 minutes later you're going to be
able to see this video so watch it from
the beginning what I said by Chris Shawn
was that people need to you know ease up
you know don't don't go so hard on him
you know and don't worry about if he
call himself a software engineer like
that's fine
software developer that's fine because
even when even when you like thing out
like Allah says the senses you fill out
the census there's nothing there that
says web developer all it says is
software engineer matter of fact
software developer that's all is there
so it's just a title you know most
people don't even know what those things
mean so I was like you tell somebody
here I'm a software engineer like it
makes sense to them but if you tell them
hey I'm a web developer they don't
understand what the hell that is
they're like wait what you are a web
designer like you know so that's what it
was
and Barbara's mad because she thinks I'm
stirring up drama
I'm not I'm actually defending my boy
because I think for people to get upset
I hate him for that I think it's really
it doesn't make sense you know I wonder
stand if it was like Chris Shawn got
into a fight with somebody or Krishan
you know curse somebody out on the
internet or you know they found Chris on
doing drugs in the bathroom you know
Chris Shawn got arrested for picking up
prostitutes or something like that I
don't know that's something you'll be
shocked in gonna oh my god Chris Shawn
did what but a little thing like
software engineer software developer
like it doesn't really matter man so
yeah that's why it was the video was
about in the beginning right and then
from there transform to multiple
conversations you guys know how I do it
man I think I think I'm gonna start
breaking down whenever I do like a long
video like this I'm gonna record it and
then break it down into multiple
multiple parts for people
and also I'd I could put in the title
plus that will give me extra content
think about it yeah because I'm pretty
sure nobody watches this videos the
whole way through
I mean how many of you guys actually
watch like let's take one of my long
videos when I do like 40 minutes one
hour two hours three hours how many of
you guys are actually watching like not
a lot of people really watch
yeah man I saw you doing that's what
shows that is original
yep that's a very very good a very good
garden to tell people man you know
don't focus on algorithms all the time
because that's not really what's gonna
get you hired you know if you're going
for a company like let's say Google yeah
you might need algorithms right but one
of the main reasons why people that go
to those interviews this is something
that people don't talk about right I
break it down right let's say right now
somebody who is a senior developer at a
company they go into an interview for
for Google right do you guys think that
they have to go through the same process
that a junior developer goes through or
let's say somebody who doesn't have
enough experience or enough projects do
you guys really think that they put you
against the white you know white
boarding I'm gonna hate who you guys
sort this tree out and whatever like do
you guys really think that happens that
don't really happen guys at all that
only happens to junior developers guys
who coming in straight out of college
that's a way to test people out but if
you have enough projects and you're
already you already established in the
industry you're now gonna go to that
algorithms this is definitely something
that I will say to me they're a waste of
time because it depends on what type of
career and what type of project you're
working on
like if you're just a you web developer
and all you do is what development like
I say ecommerce or creating websites
like if it's all you do algorithms are
not used at all I've never gone inside
of like anybody's website or anybody's
web app and seeing I hate there's an
algorithm here he used this algorithm
you don't use that at all
I've seen it done in like video games
you know I definitely see algorithms
inside of video games but I've never
seen it on a website so it's like if
you're going for web development
position like what do you need that for
not for real honest tell me what website
you've built now you have to use the
other way there's somebody could explain
that to me which website they used an
algorithm in I'll give them a year's
worth with my website plus a $50 gift
card from Amazon the aughts I mean where
do you guys you
now you know when people come in it'll
be like painting on your man just tell
your boy Jonas is out here saucer I'm
out here in the crib man
tell him tell him whether you meant that
normal on okay that's a theory no sir I
know what this one is
no no no that made me minor okay no get
out there what to get them on underwear
doesn't go mingle
Tecna systems all over so now I know
trabajo word man so I'm outta here kids
right now I'm gonna eat some good food
now that my girls my mom she lives in my
crib she gave me MacOS she like stuff
she locks the door on the the door like
the top lock don't ever
don't don't you guys say that when
people you go to your house and then
people dock like to top the top lock
that nobody has the key for and you're
like wait why mark he's not going in
when the door is open
over that way how much in the UK can we
fix a burger your mother here kids man
tell your boy look me up man
Google me man do the googles man tell
them do the googles man it's a beautiful
day man enjoy your life yes stay
positive man don't let nobody bring you
down don't let nobody give you drama
just enjoy your life man especially when
you're doing way better than a lot of
people you know what can they say about
you you know what I mean I'm out of here
