Conan face.com today we got something
special okay today we are going to
create a personal v card so if you have
taken any of my courses or seen my
tutorials I usually like to start with
the HTML breaking things down okay
before I even start doing any styling
okay so first of all we already changed
the background to the blue which is
color one okay so now we're gonna come
here and we're gonna start breaking this
down so let me see if I can move this to
the side somewhere
okay most us like this alright so we
have two sections we have menu section
so we're going to call this section okay
a section and then we also have another
section that is going to be called
content area so we're gonna say class
content area okay we also going to
create I don't know maybe a class yeah
create a class on the body tag and then
we're going to say home okay so we got
that we got class home we have the
sections which is this is class say info
section okay we're gonna create a div
this diff we're gonna say class logo
I also do like this info box okay
now inside of the info box we have let's
say should I put it like a h4 yeah h4
and then put in P so dough like that I'm
gonna have email phone and what else
email form no email okay and he has to
email Joe Santos Garcia phone seven one
eight two one nine seven six five - okay
then from there create the find me on
and we come in here and we're gonna do a
section of icons so we're gonna say let
me see find me on oh let's see
icon section okay and then here's what
we're gonna put in each icon which is
most likely gonna be a something like
that
okay so for now we're just gonna leave
it blank okay
save that we come back to the page okay
this is working alright now next thing
that we want to do is we want to break
this down the next section which is the
content area so we got a Content area
and then we have one large image and we
have let's say this area which is going
to be I don't know what to call this I
guess profile
yeah profile be fine okay so we're gonna
have an image here from now let me just
put it as a as a div so say user image
okay and then inside of this we're going
to have profile now inside of the
profile we're going to have us what is
this like let's say h1 h1 okay we'll say
name say Joe and then Santos Garcia do
this like this little break line which
will make it on directly let me see how
it's coming out yeah okay so you can do
like that now let's come back to this
okay so you got that let's say this is
like a h5
okay when I say h5 and we're gonna say
web developer okay now let me see what
else let's put a paragraph and put in
some hi my name is Joe Santos this is my
page and I'm from rich wood New York
okay now here's where we come in and we
put in the button so we got to button so
we got portfolio button and a resume
button so we could say something I did
we can say primary BTN call it portfolio
okay on this one we could say goals
BTN we say resume okay and that's about
it I'll see it we already broke down the
whole website the Lindon that we're
missing is this which is like a little
hamburger where that's like a floating
floating thing so we can put a c-note
insider info section but we could just
put it right on the top we could say
something like this let's see before now
hamburger icon okay hamburger icon we
could leave it like that okay so we
basically broke down the whole site the
HTML all right so now what we have to do
is come in and focus on this side the
info section all right so we're gonna do
two things we're gonna come into the
main that CSS we're going to create a
new CSS file you are not satisfied we
are saying underscore home that s CSS
and then we're going to import home save
that and here for home we're going to
say what should we say it should be the
first thing so we're gonna say home and
then inside of that home we're going to
put in all of our CSS for this thing
okay I wanna know if from the images and
to all of them use the same thing no
they're a little bit different each one
okay all right yeah they're a little bit
different each okay so I'm gonna say
home content area we're going to say is
white well background white okay let me
see
saying home body spike this I like there
let's do this one with some parcel
source index dot HTML
so we still getting an error so let me
see what's the error
yeah the Arizona and parcel sucks
because they don't really tell you
anything okay
in fallacy it says after homebody okay
so all right so I'm missing the
semicolon okay see if that you know what
let's set up some scripts so I'm gonna
say watch and I'm gonna come here and
say that's on the package.json we're
basically adding a new script there's
gonna be watch and then we're gonna say
Parcell source slash index dot HTML so
basically we adding a new script for
this location for the parcel to run and
then now all we have to do is say MPM
npm run watch okay now watch is not
there but is not there because we can
save it let's do it one more time as you
can see it runs it cool so now you have
to do is say MPM run watch instead of
having to put the full location of the
index dot HTML it's already saved there
as a script okay now let's see okay
refresh this okay one thing that we we
got an ad we got to definitely add a new
preset file so I'm gonna say reset the
SCSS you go to CSS reset
copy from this one
so very simple CSS reset okay now here
we're gonna say I import reset semicolon
save it building and refresh this thing
Oh weird
it was like the recent doesn't go
through because it still I see that
space there there shouldn't be a space
at all so let me see it was the problem
okay let me see Carrie says should be
there surprise why it's not working it
should be there so weird sometimes you
bump into little errors or glitches that
you don't even know where the hell is
the glitch because technically the sass
is in there we are importing the the
reset and the reset is there Oh cut them
in the recess not saved in that's some
BS when you you get caught and you're
like wait what the hell is going on and
is like oh yeah the file is not saved of
course of course is not saved all right
so we're gonna say you know change a
couple of things here let's go to the
home that is CSS close this close this
and
basically let's look at the image for a
second remove this from here okay so I'm
gonna say we got what is the info
index.html info section and you're gonna
say like this
what section I'm gonna say wave let's
say 35 per sec okay content area we're
going to say wave let's say 65% okay now
what else should we do to this thing so
now in this section I'm gonna come here
I'm gonna say float:left now you know
what if I don't even have to do it like
this I have to say flow but nothing I
could literally come and say something
like this like the margin left margin
live 35 percent okay I can left 35
percent you can say with 35 percent
position:absolute top:0 bottom
zero left zero and there we go okay um
yeah all right so we got one since your
absolute so we got like this now the
next thing that we want to do is I want
to move this info box area I'm gonna
move it down so inside of the info
section we're gonna say the info box
when I say wave we're gonna leave the
way for now that's fine but let's say
bottom I say 60 pixels and let's say
position absolute okay the side of this
we're going to say padding I don't even
know how much padding I should give it
this thing I see that was like 54 pixels
so let's say padding 54 pixels
okay and there you go so we have it down
here now I say this thing is about 12
pixels it looks a little bit bigger than
that yeah it's like yeah that's 56 say
this is like 15 so let's see yeah let's
see
guys I'm building this which we guys I
don't know none of the sizes I'm just
looking at it and pretty much guessing
it and then fixing them as we go
so I forgot what we named it it was H
fours so I say H 4 we're going to say
font size gonna say 16 let's use some
ramps so let's say for RAM it's a little
bit too small so on the main dot SCSS
I'm gonna come here and I'm gonna put
HTML in the body to be fun size 16 let's
say 18 pixels
okay so 18 pixels and then just come
here I'm gonna say 0.6 or imp 1.6 room
it's a little bit too big so let's say
1.2 room
yeah that's fine let's say the paragraph
it's going to be fun size 1.1 Rim which
is just a little bit smaller font weight
let's say is 0.1 room from where let's
put at 300
okay let's get some google fonts that
car slash funds was underway for number
of couple of styles yeah I like this one
so I'm gonna take this we're going to
customize that we're gonna add then
you're gonna add light regular medium
and bold it's a little bit a little bit
too much but that's fine okay we're
gonna come to our index.html and this
here save that okay then from there
we're gonna copy this okay let's see
what else
font family put it like that so it could
be passed down yes alright now the next
thing that we want to do is we're gonna
come here we're gonna say at the whole
we're gonna make this I forgot the
colors of this thing let me see
I'm gonna say color is a color color - I
don't even know the colors for this day
so this guy starts color 3 yeah there
you go so that's what it is color 3 and
we gotta say like this we're gonna come
in and put in see margin I'm gonna say 1
rim on top zero left or right it's a
little bit too much so let's say 0.7 run
okay so 0.7 ram and then on the
paragraph we have a larger margin at the
bottom so we're gonna say point to rim
there
zero left and right but then we're gonna
say point a trim at the bottom let's
give this a little bit more
let's see 1.5 rim okay starting to look
a little bit better yeah
okay think the paragraph is a little bit
too big so let's make it two point nine
room yeah okay so we got that let me see
what else I just create like a white box
for the logo okay info section how we
named it let's see yeah
info section then logo close this okay
close the package
okay here we're gonna say logo I'm gonna
say background white
I'm gonna say height let's say 400
pixels
wave 200 pixels okay all right so we got
that we're gonna say this thing this
pattern that we gave inside of info box
we're gonna give that padding inside of
the hole info section and there you go
okay so starting to look a little bit
better okay and
let's see we're gonna say something like
this where is the main scss where is
that okay here we're gonna say Heights
100% now let's say for the content area
we're going to do height 100% and there
