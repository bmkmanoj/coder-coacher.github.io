start doing our deployment and I know
you're probably thinking wait but the
website is not done yet and that's right
it's not done yet but at the same time
let's say for example you wanted to
deploy this website right now even
though all of this page is a start on
dynamically coming from the database
because we haven't set that up but right
now you need a portfolio online right so
you need to have at least something
online so before we even jump to the
databases we're gonna start putting this
on a different server right we're gonna
put it on Heroku okay so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna take this one
step at a time and the very first thing
that we gotta do is make sure you
install git alright so if you search
here install git you will find this page
get installing get alright you click
there and it shows you for every single
system if you have a Linux if you have a
Mac if you have a Windows pretty much
just follow the steps that it has there
for me it's Mac where I just come in i
download this this D I think is a dmg
file and basically download it and then
install it and that's it then when you
come to your terminal you come here and
you say git and if I show something like
this
it means you have gate already installed
now the next step that I want you guys
to do is go to github.com sign up for an
account
alright fill that out once you have an
account make sure you sign in for me is
gonna face a gmail and then let me see
if I remember the password
I keep changing my password every two
months or every month but yeah okay so
we're here right this how it looks when
you land on github.com you go to your
profile cool alright everything is fine
this is cool now the next thing I want
you guys to do is you're gonna come here
you're gonna click new repository and
you're gonna call a my portfolio alright
so you're gonna call it my portfolio and
let's say node my portfolio node all
right click public don't click this and
it allows this way if I really do
nothing right just pretty much just
leave it like that
create repository alright and that's
fine now the next thing that I want you
guys to do is you're going to go to
source tree you're gonna search this on
Google source tree right basically is a
user interface for forget so you're
going to download this download it for
whatever system that you have right and
then once you download it you're going
to log in with your account
alright so let's say for example I'm
gonna delete this account remove it
first download source stream like I said
you're going to be able to log in with
either bitbucket account or what I get
help account alright I want you guys to
download it right and make sure that you
basically you sign up with a github
account alright so what you're gonna do
is if you don't see this here if you
don't see any accounts here what you're
going to do is you're gonna come to this
little corner here click accounts
you're gonna go to add and you're gonna
see this that says host page
pocket and USA github when you do it or
github you're going to come here and
you're gonna do a little something like
connect account it's going to bring you
to assign into github you sign in with
whatever was here your email me okay
always allowed copy this save it can't
give this a little second save alright
so we already have this here we we are
logged in with our account right for me
is coding phase calm
I remember this page that we had when we
created the portfolio node on github
we're basically gonna copy the stuff
that's here and we're going to go into
our atom terminal we're gonna do this
come here and we're gonna copy this
command so first of all let me open on
your terminal okay put LS that's fine
we're gonna do get in it alright alright
now we gonna say get add read well we
don't have to say read me we just say
get add but before that we gotta do a
git ignore all right hold on we gotta
create a new file
it's gonna be doc get ignore all right
doc get ignore and we're gonna say node
modules save that so that's what the
file that needs to be in there and then
now we're gonna do git add and then
we're gonna say dot and then okay commit
I'm gonna say - first commit okay what
did I say oh that's my fault
I missed the M all right okay so as you
can see they added all those files and
to get so what's important about get is
that it keeps track of all your files
every time that you do changes you can
come here and save like a version of
your project at any given time and I'm
gonna show you how everything works just
give me a little minute so we could at
least get the setup so then from here
when I copy this as if you see in case
you close this window before that's fine
I'm just copy it from here get remote at
origin and then HTTP slash github.com
slash whatever you are our username is
and then from there the name of the
basically of the repo which is my
portfolio no dot get all right you copy
this paste that in there there you go
and then we gonna do
copy that
you say get push you origin/master
which means hey push to the origins
master which is on on github.com now
saying hey I got a 10 - Kate I got an
authentication fail for get help calm so
I scolding face my portfolio I get note
if that is happening that's fine we're
going to come here so our source string
we're gonna go into here and we're gonna
click here new repository we're going to
add existing locally alright and going
to your projects no js' click open ok
double clicking so this opens up ok then
you should be fine now let me see
push that into master and everything
should be fine alright now if you're
getting an error here on the command
line you can do a Google search on how
to fix this I mean it shouldn't take
that long it's just you you just gotta
set up an SSH key and do the whole
process which I'm not really going to go
into it right now because in reality
most of my work when I deal with again I
like to do it with source string it's a
more professional way is better for us
because we can actually see visually the
commits that we create and then we could
push it and it's so much easier but at
the same time at some point you should
fix this
connect your SSH basically give us SH
key to to get help so it can have it but
for now we don't have to worry about
all right you can do that on your own
time that's gonna take about 20-30
minutes but for now basically we ready
I say that's all we need to do if we
refresh this page we will see all our
files are on github now okay and
everything that we're going to do we're
going to do a wave source string source
tree just makes our life so much easier
guys trust me when you didn't with get
it's one of the best tools that there is
out there
every professional company uses source
stream alright now next thing that we
want to do is we want to go to Heroku
calm all right you're going to sign up
for this sign up alright I'm going to
come here in I'm gonna log into mines
once you sign up you should see I'm
gonna show you right now all the things
that you should see you should see a
page like this of course is gonna be
blank because you guys are just creating
one but you're gonna come here to the
right you're gonna click on create new
app and you're going to say create
whatever name that you want to give to
your app you could just say portfolio
portfolio Joe whatever your name is
portfolio whoever it is that's creating
it ok create an app alright now the next
thing that you want to do is you want to
connect to github you got coding face
calm it's for me for you is gonna say
whatever github account that you guys
have all right
once you connect it there from there
you're going to come here you're gonna
say my portfolio
search it see what you show up so as you
can see my portfolio node you click
connect
alright now don't do anything for now
you could come here and click on enable
automatic deploys alright now the next
thing that we got to do is you're gonna
go to I'm gonna tell you right now
because I already did this before
Gabe calm slash GSG click my portfolio
and it's this file there's a file that
we need copy that
alright so here on our project we're
gonna create a new file call proc file
just like that no extension know that
before and nothing just proc file
alright as you can see you got that
little K which means a hiroko file and
then here you're going to pace web node
index alright we're going to come back
to source stream and as you can see when
we did a change it showed it up over
here automatically it shows us hey a new
file called proc file we add that all
right we've got two commits up here and
we see we got it
Proc file for for Heroku all right but
one thing - I almost forgot we got to
also change see there's no dot index J
guess what this is it's basically saying
hey there's a note app or any but we
need to give it the index the server
right so we're gonna say server / server
jes save that file okay it changed here
and basically says we added proc file
for Heroku go commit says the cons on
the final will be added to the version
control Park file then I show me this
again press ok ok got at it now you see
this little one right here it shows us
that we have a new change that we need
to commit for the remote to have all
right so basically he is also showing it
to us like hey like we haven't pushed
this to the live site all right so we're
gonna go to master push it okay there
you go all right so it got pushed cool
now let's come here let's go to where is
it that Rocko app okay we're gonna click
on deploy branch sass master
then I click there and we're gonna see
here if there's any errors all right
it's just going one by one
so what it's doing is basically doing
what we did on manually our local
environment where we say hey MPM is
store is doing all of that it's
installing all the packages that it
needs and I see deploy to Heroku click
view let's see if everything worked it's
loading another thing too is this is all
free but one of the reasons why it's
free is because it's slow right now if
you want to pay for the premium I think
is like seven dollars a month or
something like that to basically make
this live like it's already it's gonna
be live but the only thing is that
there's a premium to it you see like
right now is zero dollars a month
alright so everything is on but it takes
a little while to turn on because it's
free so the very first time is gonna
take a little while taking a little wild
off all right let me see deploy campaign
if deployment ok same didn't send any
data empty response so there might be
something wrong okay let me figure that
out alright guys so this way I figured
that okay one thing that I forgot was
changing this the app that listen we
need to put a process that EMV dot port
or localhost 3000 right so basically
just add this to your server that jes
alright also another thing that I wanted
to do was basically you're gonna come to
your package that JSON you're going to
start create the smile
so basically you'll see scripts and then
gonna say start and then you're gonna
say note server server right you've
actually come here and just say server
dot J yes like that and then after that
what you're going to do is you're going
to come back to your source tree you're
gonna click commit you're gonna have a
couple of changes here commit all the
changes you're gonna say yes pushing to
Heroku click commit click OK
and then the next thing that you want to
do is go to your Heroku dashboard
whatever your portfolio job portfolio
Johnny whatever your name is write
whatever you named it go into there go
to your overview resources go to the
deploy click there then you come down
here and you click deploy branch alright
manual deploy click there and then what
it's gonna do is gonna pull in all your
new changes and it's going to deploy
automatically alright once this is done
then it's gonna tell you hey check out
your app and it's gonna give you a link
down here we're just gonna wait until
that's done alright give you a little
second and one thing like I told you
guys from the beginning this might be a
little bit slower because like let's say
right now I'll go fast because the first
time loading it but like let's say a
week from now when you come to this
website portfolio Joe die Heroku that
app Heroku app calm matter-of-fact
alright when you come here it might be a
little bit slower and that's because
it's turning on the server for you right
so it's like it's not on 24/7 so
basically once you land on the website
then it turns it
on for you now if you wanted to be on
24/7 you have to sign up for basically a
membership before Hiroko like you see
how we have install add-ons that zero
diner information you could come here
configure dinos like let's say we wanted
to upgrade to hobby see right now we are
free dinos so right now we have free
hosting for us if we want this to be
like you know running all the time
without no delay we come here for $7 a
month and then I say you got right
that's all the hosting that you need all
right guys so so far right now
everything is good our website is live
we now have our portfolio on Heroku app
calm and we good alright guys so I'll
see you guys in the next video
like the whole deployment process is
done every time that we come here and we
click push to master automatically we
click there whatever changes we do gets
changed on the website all right if you
don't see those changes all you have to
do is go to Heroku login go to your app
click deploy and then come all the way
at the bottom and click deploy branch
master alright guys so I'll see you guys
later
