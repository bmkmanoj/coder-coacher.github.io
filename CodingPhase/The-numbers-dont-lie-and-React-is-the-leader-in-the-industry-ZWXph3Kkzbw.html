what up it's been a minute I know guys I
know you haven't seen me in a little
while I know it's been a little minute
but we here we here live chillin you
know the numbers don't lie
react took over the world and a lot of
people get pissed off at that but it's
just a reality of things when you know
right now I'm looking at this website
called pure free was it pure fit perfect
stack I'm gonna show it to you guys in a
little second so you guys could
basically look at it too and we could go
over the numbers because you know life
is about numbers man you know we could
all say hey this is the best is the
amazing whatever framework learned this
to this and that do whatever right but
the reality of things is this only one
framework that really taken over the
whole industry and it's been doing this
for the past few years or any right now
of course you know lately I've been
telling you guys about hype rap yes
hyper app is one of those frameworks
that is gonna help you understand how to
create small components and very quick
and very easy right
but at the same time you must have that
skill of react and the main reason why I
like hyper app is because it's so
similar to react just a few little
things are different so if you know
react you pretty much can take it to
hyper app your skills take the skills to
hyper happens they'll be proficient
because it's using JSX it's using
components so you're pretty much
understand what's going on right so
anyways I'm just letting everybody get
into the room right now so we could have
as many people as we can live and we
could do this video right now and we
could go over all all of the
frameworks right this is a whole bunch
of frameworks here I'm gonna share my
screen okay here we go all right so we
gotta look at trends was trending this
week right we're gonna look at Marco
Marco is a brand new framework from the
people that could basically work from
for eBay they they created this
framework
it's pretty smooth it's pretty cool I
like it I like it I don't like the
syntax is a little bit weird the way how
things are remind me too much of like I
call it what's the other language this
stupid framework of Vijay s it reminds
me too much of you jes so I don't know
I'm not a huge fan of having everything
in one page you got the class styles and
you have your Dave's like I don't know
I'm not a huge fan of it but lately it
has been really going up then you have
pre-act
which is this other one here there's all
the top top trending ones right so you
got pre-act which is pretty much it's
like the Sun of react right there's like
the baby of react is pretty much a clone
pretty much the same shape that's why
they called it pre-act so yeah it's
pretty much the same shares react so if
you know react you know pre-act then you
got view you know angular it reacts baby
from a threesome that they had with
amber amber backbone you know so
backbone and reactant and angular had a
threesome and this baby came out so that
one that was trending - okay then you
got react of course you have angular
inferno which is another one which is
you must react to you got polymer from
the people of Google then you have
backbone then you have irelia you have
Ember who else you got knock out somehow
knock out still alive somewhere and
marionette is still alive somewhere so
yeah those are the trending ones all
right now as far as state management
right now it's angular do we have
angular just Estate Management Redux
View wax mole bags and then that's it
for now all right now as far as the
bundlers number one is web pack
everybody should know that everybody
uses web pack of course then you got
rolled up you got required GS fuse box
which is a new warm browserify I haven't
seen that in a long time people don't
use this no more
but so you could see like what packs
still holding it up you know now this to
me is the most important thing all right
this is the most important thing for
sure the numbers of downloads how many
downloads are they getting per you know
per day and per week in total how much
downloads are they getting you know
that's what to me really matters because
it shows me how many people are using it
in their projects because it's like when
you come here and say hey show me the
stars so let's go to the stars before we
go to the numbers of downloads let's say
we talk about stars and we say hey you
know webpack got 31 thousand stars
browserify
has 11,000 and as you can see browserify
had only once basically it was barely
trending it's like nobody's using this
so it's like it's holding on to stars
that's been there for four years you
know I was like those are stars that
have been there for a long time plus you
also have to understand that people give
stars to things
not because they're gonna use it not
because they they are the best they give
stars because sometimes you want to like
use that as a bookmark even okay I'll
give it as a star and then I could call
my github and find it later on but at
the end it's not really like a star
system where you say hey this is the
best because it has a star no it has a
star because people have just
used it as a bookmark you know to come
back to it it doesn't mean that they
really use it on their apps it doesn't
mean that they they really think it's
the best one it's just a number that you
give it's like a little star that you
gave to it okay I'll check this out
later that's how people use github you
know I do the same thing I'm guilty of
it too where a lot of times I'll come in
and be like oh I like a project that I
see on github I'm like oh cool I'll come
back to it so I'll give it a start well
I haven't even tried it I don't even
know if it works I don't know if it's
good for my business I don't know if
it's good for the company I just give it
a start just to try it so stars are
completely to me are a flaw system so
even say hey this this framework is
better than the other one right so with
that said you know what I mean like
we're gonna leave the stars for that so
it's like right now leading with the
stars are pre Atwell react then you got
view angular and then you have backbone
polymer ember pre-act inferno irelia and
redux holding the number one spot for
state management then it's angular and
then backbone and mo backs a few acts
like nobody uses them shits barely
almost anybody uses mo backs or UX like
people just use Redux Redux is literally
the best state management system for me
you know it's simple at first is hard to
understand and see how it works but it
just saves you so much headaches man
that two-way binding
you know two-way binding data shame it's
too much it's like too many bugs too
much to keep track of you know
the best way is Redux all right now
let's go to downloads so this were
really matters there's the numbers that
matter this this is the numbers that are
you know pretty much tells you like
who's leading the industry like it's
that simple
right so you have react with 214
thousand downloads then you have angular
with 51 thousand downloads which shows
you how the industry is pretty much
everybody uses react everybody right now
is jumping to react and I mean it's been
there for a while now it's been there
for a long time now that react pretty
much is dominating the industry at first
it was angular that dropped off big time
after they they changed the whole system
to angular 2 and then now angular 4
which is ridiculous they don't even have
an angular 3 so yeah and then you have
PAC board like a lot of companies still
use backbone like this isn't something
new right so then you got view number 4
which is coming up you got pre-act which
also coming up and then you have some
downloads from marco now one thing that
I want to put out there too for the
creator of this website I talked to him
pretty much a hyper app hasn't been
added to this yet because it's still
such a new framework that they're
waiting like a month or two to add it
but soon as that gets ad is gonna be
definitely being probably like the top
four top five from what I see from the
numbers that I've seen so far because
everybody you know it's like I always
tell you everybody wants to jump on the
latest thing everybody wants to jump on
what's the fastest thing the fastest
thing out there right now is hyper and
matter how you look at it now when
you're working at a job right at a
company a company is gonna come to you
and it's gonna tell you hey we want in
in a front-end framework that we know is
gonna keep on getting updates and it's
gonna be always the latest trend no
matter what but at the same time we want
it to be solid right and have a solid
team behind it so no matter how you look
at it reacting angular are always going
to be number one and number two no
matter how you look at it because of the
way how companies are a company let's
say for example I'm gonna take my
company I can have the Liberty to go in
there and insert like a new framework
like hyper app or even if I wanted to
add a few GS or pre-act or Marco I have
the Liberty to do that because I'm
pretty much the senior developer there
right but let's say if I work at let's
say Google or let's say an example let's
say I work at advice.com let's say I
work at was another good company
something respectful let's say I work at
Nike let's say an example for Nike right
let's say I work at Nike I can't just go
in there and be like hey man we're gonna
switch everything to hyper app right
they're gonna be like ok what's what's
your reason you know so I would say hey
there's the fastest framework is you
know one of the best frameworks that
I've tried it's super simple very clear
it's not depending on a whole bunch of
libraries it's just everything that you
get is some basically like two functions
right - two different functions on the
app and the H that's it so you're good
um the way that okay that seems cool now
who creates it who's the team behind it
you know then I'll be like always a
couple of guys couple guys from Japan a
couple of guys open-source they'll be
like I don't know yet let's
give it some time because currently we
want to have everything very stylish so
we're gonna go with the way or Facebook
in the way of Google so they gotta go in
and follow those companies so of course
they're gonna choose either react or
angular no matter what you know what I
mean but if you work at a design agency
you work at you know you're not your own
business you could choose what you want
it's like a lot of people they which is
something that I bring up a lot when I
talk about VJ s a lot of people get
missing screwed the fact that you know
they see a lot of times blogs talk about
you view or they'll talk about other
frameworks too and they'll be like oh
yeah man everybody's using everybody is
using view because it's on a block it's
like no man not really nobody is using
nobody is using for you like I'm being
honest like the major companies they're
really using just react and angular now
they try to get it get it up there and
they try to break that barrier to
basically let all those main major
company to say hey now let's jump on
this but in reality man like you can't
you can't go over go boy Facebook
doesn't matter how talented you are
doesn't matter who's behind me guys
that's just how it is the numbers don't
lie you know so companies out there
they're all using reacting angular no
matter what right whenever you have the
option to choose a framework then you
could come in and but I all want to
choose Elm oh I want to choose a hybrid
yeah I want to use a few oh yes I want
to use Marco you have the option because
it's a really like it's your project you
could do whatever the hell you want but
that doesn't mean that's what the
industry is using what's the majority of
the industry like numbers don't like
guys like this are huge different when
you know people tell me like oh yeah
view right now is like the hottest
right now I'm like guys this 214,000 979
downloads for react can we compare that
to 25000 to 244 like come on can we
compare it saving a way to compare it
and be like Oh everybody's jumping on
this like no I don't know who is using
this like almost nobody uses this
literally like almost nobody uses it
like the people that are using this are
using this on their own personal
projects and yeah people like oh I'm
loving it yes I'm a branding developer
yes I'm following a YouTube video yes
I'm following a video on udemy but that
doesn't mean that's what the industry is
using you know so that's what this video
is about is like numbers don't lie guys
is pretty simple react took over the
world this is gonna be reacting in
 there's gotta be reacting in
fridge like your houses appliances
there's react on or on lights
right somebody would show me a program
that they created it's like an interface
of the creator for I forgot what the
name
I think Phillips the company they have
you know to turn off the lights and turn
their back on the UI interface of it
it's made of react there's video games
well mobile games using react there's
 what else this mobile apps user
react like react is just everywhere man
like it already took over a1 that's it
there's no more debate there's no more
anything it's just a 1 that's it we just
need to give us give it as tighter and
better hey this is the best framework
out there there's the number one
framework out there period that's it
everybody lost that's it
react to go over the world
oh yeah man so you know how to do this I
usually come in do a little quick video
with you guys a little topic and now we
could just pretty much hang out you know
what I really like now we could just
hang out chill enjoy this this live
feedback see what you guys is up to and
now let me see who's in here who's in
here right now
let me see
Stefon Rita said I agree I just barely
got a job in your room everyone have a
have experience developing and reacting
everyone seemed to want react develop so
I guess I got lucky
yes FinTech says angular's to go let me
see fam production is what is react yeah
buddy we need to get you up to speed
let me see who else is in here we got a
bunch of stuff let me see hey fam
production series Hey Joe if you go
approximately how long did it take you
to be in the position you are today how
many hours that you put into it put in a
date okay
let's calculate it let's say okay I've
been working how many the missing let's
look this up let's actually look this up
how many hours I've worked or I've
practiced coding or how much I've
learned and let's see how many hours
hours let me see how many know how many
days Monday not Monday good Sunday
how many days how many working days in a
year let's see yeah okay 260 days okay
how many working days so let's say an
example 260 days times five 1,300 1,300
that's 1300 days now let's multiply that
by by eight all right so I'm gonna write
this down that's ten thousand ten
thousand four hundred hours those are
the working hours now I've been working
as a developer meaning I'm working in a
company we're gonna project whatever it
is I've done ten thousand four hundred
hours right now let's say my first year
I was probably doing about let's say 20
hours per week so let's say an example
mmm let's say per week let's say 20
hours per week so 20 times 52 that's
1040 times five so that's five thousand
two hundred hours of me coding on my own
time so 10 thousand four hundred hours
of basically work me working as a
developer in a company or working on
projects or contracts and then five
thousand two hundred hours as
you know my own time learning online you
know you know doing stuff for YouTube
even when I'm doing stuff for YouTube I
consider that part of learning too cold
because when I'm doing a tutorial or I'm
talking about code I'm re reinforcing
what I learned already well I already
know so I consider that part of it too
so let's say we got 15,000 15,000 600
hours that's how long I've been doing
this all right fan production I've been
doing this for fifteen thousand six
hundred hours pretty much okay let me
see what the hell is Redux angular react
state management system
it's just front-end it's like the front
end it's like JavaScript frameworks you
know cuz you could do all this stuff
with another JavaScript but if you guys
have been following my web site coding
phase calm or been doing the tutorials
with me you will notice that coding your
vanilla JavaScript takes a long time so
what you need is a framework that makes
that process of working with JavaScript
easier and faster so that's what it is
now state management system is imagine
like this I don't know if you checked
out my hybrid tutorial where I talk
about state management state basically
is whenever you you do a change on a
page and a single page app or a
component you have to keep track of
whatever the user date so let's say
somebody filters they're on a website
where they want to buy a house if they
filter the house from 200,000 to 600,000
you keep track of that and then change
the view whatever the user sees
depending on on that that option on that
filter cuz he only wants to see houses
from two hundred to six hundred thousand
so you have to keep
back of that now when you try to do that
with just regular JavaScript it just
like it becomes a headache to keep track
of that because you gotta keep in your
head or sometimes that data guest gets
changed and it just messes everything up
so yeah now hold on let me see maybe I
could fix this audio a little better
oh wait it's already good yeah so that's
the whole thing let me see what else
durian rice says bro I kind of have a
long ask question is there any way I
could contact you privately yes you can
contact me at coding face at gmail.com
send me whatever question you have send
it to me there let me see what else we
got
Mandela effect conference view Jay has
reactions and various angularjs annecy
princess view I want the time
spending learning it back damn man you
guys yeah I can't have me cursing no
more man I can't even curse on this
channel they should have I can't say
 either I can't say nothing like I
can't curse anymore Google's not letting
me letting me slide no more like I'm
gonna show you guys this
so just because I said I said some word
I forgot me remember if it was a F word
or it was a s word whatever it was like
let me see so they they're already given
me like warnings like Oh Limited ads or
no ads on my videos because of of curses
if I curse like now this just started
like this wasn't here before so now I'm
basically I can't curse on my videos I
came and seeing nothing he
things that sound like a curse I can't
even curse and I can't talk about
controversial situations or nothing it's
pretty crazy if not your boy don't get
paid from the ads which is a lot of BS
so let me see what else where can we see
the numbers there's a website called
pure for perfect stack pu r f ECT ECT
sta ck calm and it gives you like all
the information like and it's live tools
like it's connected to the github api is
connected to the npm api so you see all
the information there live all right let
me see what else what else
get sorry everybody I want to read
everybody's comments and you know guys
make sure you give this a like on under
the channel man and give this a like on
a video come on there's a lot of people
in here make sure you give this a like
trust me
Joey Michelle says hey broad you started
your hyper fgs course I've been watching
your channel for a while it really has
helped helped out a lot I just recently
made up my first portfolio page we would
like to check it out send it to me to my
gmail coding phase at gmail.com I would
check it out with the people here live
when we go over it alright okay Barbara
what up I see who else is in here let me
see let me know what you think about it
homie yes I'll check it out Missy D and
this any more people was good was good
was good was good react one but what
about that license Joe what about it
like there's gotta be a license like
it's like right now if you create
something will you leave it out to
everybody to pretty much clean me cuz
that's a thing if you don't claim
something then people will claim it
people will put it in their code and say
react as part of their code and then
they will countersuit on Facebook and
say hey you guys stole our code because
they registered first so that's how it
happens and you know that's how it works
guys if you create something right now
you create our own open-source library
and you didn't put a patent on it and
you don't say hey this is mines so
whenever somebody else uses it I'm
giving everybody the license to use it
but you can't claim it as yours that's
the thing it's like you know that well
react it's not yours so why would you
try to claim it but there's companies
who do it so Facebook has to protect
themselves because
they have react all over their website
and all over their apps somebody could
literally go and sue the people that
created something it happens all the
time guys
look it up people there's company who
who specialized in just suing big
companies period like they don't do
anything they don't make no products
they don't make nothing it's like right
now you came up with an idea of creating
a watch that it's connected to your skin
right let's say an example somebody
already put a patent on that and say hey
I created that I created the idea I put
a painting on it even though they never
created the product they never did
anything with it just because they were
the first one to go to the US government
say hey we have this patent on it now
you got to pay them because they can
they basically wrote it down on a piece
of paper so Facebook has to protect
itself so you know a lot of people are
they trying to grab onto that and try to
scare threaten you developers in black
oh man you can't you can't use react
because reactors basically you know it's
owned by Facebook as I guess it's on my
facebook cool do you think it was owned
by like duh using a brain you know what
I mean so but people are using that now
on the internet like oh man you
shouldn't use react you should jump to
view or you should jump to amber or
whatever out there because of the
licenses like nobody's telling you not
to use it what they're saying is you
can't claim the code on on your whatever
your application and say hey I own
everything on this code because you
don't that's a facebook is not looking
to sue you because you're using the
library they put an open source so
people could use it you know they're not
there to try to you know on you but
what they want is for you not to be able
to sue them because you have on your app
that's what they work let me see
Kiki will says I don't know if I should
switch to react Oh Kiki well what is it
that you use you know what I mean
blank silent pond says angularjs is the
leader at toy now that was a long time
ago kids like that was like 2012 2013
2014
maybe but 2015 16 17 is very react like
trust me like there's a lot of corporate
companies who still use angular 1 so
it's good to learn angular 1 but any
project that's being created new it's
being created with react what do I think
of phpstorm I think it's good but it's
just too heavy for me
it's like it takes forever to load it's
like too much options too many things to
do like just keep me something simple
give me a text editor I'll go with Adam
I tried Visual Studio code didn't like
it I'm sorry I'm sticking with Adam
period until what do you say angular was
king over react angular is you know
almost head-to-head with react but react
already past it now as far as downloads
how many people are using react or
angular way more people are using react
then angular that's by a long shot
look it up the go to pure fake stack
calm look it up is right there
does anyone anyone have an idea what is
view react why's all that I feel like I
am another world
production we need to get you up to
speed man
very good boy okay
this is a good question from MSL 2015 he
says I was doing your Netflix : tutorial
why do you use internal CSS and when
should I use external CSS okay you're
probably talking about why did I use it
in the stylesheet like I didn't use a
stylesheet I didn't create a CSS I just
put everything on the on the style tag
on the head
number one there's like three ways of
doing CSS there's like inline CSS which
is putting CSS on the element there's
style CSS which is using the style tag
and putting it on the head and then
there's taking out the CSS and put it in
its own file you put CSS on its own file
because you want things to be more clear
and more separate like when you have all
your HTML on one page you don't want to
have 10,000 lines of CSS because it gets
that deep right so what you want to do
is have multiple CSS files outside of
that HTML and then from there link don't
CSS files into one one main CSS file and
then you load that and link it to the
HTML page now for that example I put it
on the style tag on the head of the HTML
page because we was doing something so
simple that was just one page it wasn't
like very complicated you know we just
kept everything in that same page that's
why but as your websites get bigger and
your projects are bigger you can have
all that CSS in one page trust me I'll
be thousands of lines you'll be
surprised
do you use webpack bro yes Jack Daniels
I use WebP rat wetback
that's what I use webpack Kizzy without
my was good
let me see who else is in here let's see
test corner no js' is good to learn for
the back end depending on your area
where you live so it's best to look
around your area what company you see
what companies use so yeah that is true
you gotta find out what what type of
companies are around you and then figure
out I mean once you learn one back-end
language then you know all of them now
you understand how the backend works
don't worry about it just learn to pick
one and then from there just you could
get higher at other companies all you
really need to know is two different
type of databases my sequel and MongoDB
if you know how to work with both both
of those two then you're gonna be good
yep yep kids
can't be real no more man I gotta I
gotta go corporate now give me a second
sorry guys my son basically is giving
out his first words he's now saying
hello little Eden is talking guys
yes he's only two months old all right
so yeah Kizzy I can't be real no more I
can't I can't curse I can't say anything
I just gotta keep this professional now
let me see what else I'm over here
reading reading the questions sorry if
I'm a little bit late cuz I got a
read-through everybody
Joe did you do Stephen gratis full-stack
course yes I looked at it but it's like
I I know all that stuff already you know
what I mean like I already know I
already know all that stuff like I know
that if Stephen grant is gonna come out
with a course it's gonna be legit cuz he
really breaks it down and takes his time
I mean that's what he does full-time you
know he don't work he don't do anything
else he just makes courses so yeah okay
let me see hi bro can you do a
comparison of all the JavaScript
frameworks out there oh they'll be
difficult because there's a lot of
frameworks and it's a lot of frameworks
every day a brand new framework comes
out you know it's like right now like
I'm trying to help out push hyper AB GS
and it's because I really like it and I
also believe in the creator of it he's a
pretty cool dude
and I like I like how simple it is and
the fact that so small is not using
dependencies of anything it's just
everything as a side of that library of
the hyper app library that's it it's not
really going out of his way to search
for other libraries which makes it
really heavy but hyper app is just super
simple it's like that's what I'm telling
you guys check out the tutorials man
like I'm giving it up for free here on
YouTube which is something that I you
know I told you guys I don't do anymore
not because I don't want to give
for free but at the same time it's like
nobody does it when you give something
for free which is amazing to me there's
people who you know they'll come to the
channel and won't do something because
it's free but when it's on my website
and you're pretty much paying for a
subscription $10 a month for $5 a month
whatever it is people do it and to me
that makes me feel good because I'm I'm
doing something for people to do it I'm
not doing it to just have it there on
YouTube and nobody
works on it you know it's like why am I
putting all those I was four if nobody's
gonna do it but yeah man
so obviously take advantage man let me
see whatever style tags are easy for
prototyping yes exactly
Hey Joe what do you use more you do me a
tree house I use you to me man tree
house I only used it for two months and
then I kept the description cuz I pay
for the whole year which kind of was a
mistake
you know how sometimes you pay for
something ahead of time you like you pay
for the whole thing in like oh man once
you got it you're like I'm probably not
gonna come back here anyways can I use
HTML template with react instead of JSX
they say it's easier to do this in for
you yes I don't think you know I don't
think you could do HTML templates I mean
I haven't tried it but I'll tell you
this it's easier people think in their
head because they're like oh man I don't
want to put in HTML in my JavaScript but
trust me guys it's easier because you
have everything on that page you don't
have in multiple files whenever you want
to change something you gotta keep on
switching between files HTML here
JavaScript their CSS over there but when
you have let's say Oh your HT your
JavaScript in your HTML in one page
everything is easier plus it's gonna
make you a way better developer trust me
using V binders V buying their V
for each or V whatever that is not
gonna help you as a developer I'm being
honest it's not gonna help you as a
developer to learn JavaScript you need
to do JavaScript you can't have
something in between like I will use it
now because they were if something's
gonna make my life easier faster but for
somebody who's starting up like
if you know if you don't know JavaScript
like that then you should be using react
because react is gonna make your way
better developer and it just hands down
okay what's the best free coding website
out there I don't know but you could
check out my website coding phase com I
have a whole bunch of free courses there
and free tutorials that you could get
out of it you know yeah because you you
don't wanna sign up for a subscription
it doesn't mean that you can't get
access to all the free stuff like
there's so many free stuff there and
also to like you know like the hyper app
tutorials or even any tutorial that I
put out here on YouTube they're always
gonna be on my website first like all of
the videos are gonna be there like here
I have a schedule like every two days I
drop a video of a tutorial so if you
really don't want to wait and you're
like okay let me see what Joe is working
on let me go to his website coding phase
com register there and then you should
be good and just take all the courses
are free out the file if it was me man I
would just go to the website register
take all the free courses if you like it
cool you like it if you don't then your
daughter now if you want to support the
kid then sign up for a subscription and
then you get the full access to all the
major courses again a lot of people man
like I'm looking at my website I'm
missing right now coding phase comm
let's look at Google Analytics I want to
see I want to see the stats I'm a
numbers type of guy you know what I mean
Lake like currently just right now
basically we got we got like four or
five people on the website at all times
it's always like photo there's probably
four or five people four to five to ten
people every single day on my website
and not like you know not five people
just in the whole day just like five
people to ten people at any given time
taking courses which is really good
because I haven't really paid for no
promotion I haven't really got it out
there like that I'm basically building
up all the courses once I have all my
courses done then from there I'm gonna
promote the out of this and I
really got it out there so it's really
good daily right now we get I'm gonna
tell you right now daily we get a
hundred and fifty five people taking
courses there's about nine hundred
people that signed up to the website in
every single day this a minimum of 155
people taking the courses so that's good
I mean this independent you know what I
mean like out of let's say my eight
thousand people eight thousand people
that are on my youtube about fifteen to
twenty percent of those those people are
on my website currently you know they
register some of them are taking the
free courses some of them are taking the
paid courses so yeah what's good about
it it's like I get to interact and work
with those people you know what I mean
like cause it's like right now I got
eight thousand people on my on my
YouTube but that doesn't mean that's
eight thousand people that want to learn
there's eight thousand people that just
might want to see my channel they might
just want to see what I'm up to that's
fine you know but and my website was
good about it is that everybody that's
there they want to learn so for me
that's really really good thing cuz it
just motivates me to do more videos in
and get more stuff out there you know
let me see what else
hold on a freaking spider I hate spiders
that's the good and bad about living in
the suburbs my good that you could just
chill and everything that's nice the bad
is that you're like too close to frickin
nature you got snakes you got I mean
we're not snakes but you got a spiders
you got a whole bunch of raccoons and a
whole bunch of Shh I don't want to see
the S word I don't want to curse because
like YouTube is like freakin buggin out
on me
they trying to kick me out let me see
what else with react how do you style
your components well basically the way
how you style components with react I
mean since you use JSX the way how you
do it is basically the same way how you
would do it for regular JavaScript right
you would pretty much change the the
stylesheet by using a function of style
right a method of style but since in JSX
the way how it's done what you use is
you basically same way how you would do
a inline you will say style you say
style and then you say curly brackets
and inside of it you will use the object
and put in whatever properties you want
to change on that element now of course
you can just say give that element a
class and then you could just use
regular CSS and change it like that like
you don't have to use inline CSS at all
like Adam using only using our special
situations where I
control the CSS through the JavaScript
like let's say an example let me see you
see it's this up right now I see I'm
gonna show you guys a little something
hold on city projects NPM watch all
right let me share my screen with you
guys now the beauty of hyper app to guys
is that it's pretty much using JSX so if
you know react you pretty much can use
hyper at all right so look at this
element here I'm using CSS on this
element and I'm also changing it with
JavaScript so you're gonna see the start
changing every time I press up
I press plus the border radius is
changing on it see if it comes a little
circle I press down and starts making a
square starts to removing the border
radius okay click reset alright and how
this is done let me see hyper see
projects code or projects I prep all of
the stuff I teach you on the tutorial of
hyper app but yeah so if I come here
JavaScript hyper app let me see
all right as you can see here I'm
passing down a class of plus on this
which is just a class but here is the
style tag great so there's a property
style property just like in regular HTML
and then what I'm doing is I pass down
an object so this is the same thing that
you have to do with JavaScript period
with JavaScript you have to pass down
either an object or pass down each
property like that like let's say
padding-bottom it's not padding that's
bottom
it's padding and then upper case B and
then bottom like that all right so
that's how you do it with JavaScript now
whenever I want to change something so
like let's say here I want to say when I
press a button I want this to change to
be whatever the total number of times 2
in pixels so all right here i'm
concatenating the pixels together with
the numbers so in a situation like that
you want to do that with JavaScript so
it's super easy man like I don't know
how to explain it right now
just know that is it super easy like
that's what I'm telling you guys man
take this freaking course man take this
course this hyper app course man you're
gonna learn a lot man I talk about state
management I talk about how just like
front-end frameworks work like you don't
learn everything like you learn
everything that you're gonna need for
any other framework all the frameworks
follow the same conventions all right so
yeah now let me see what else
we react how do you say let me see I
already read that what's the best
freaking website out there you I'll tell
you go to my website or you can just I
don't know check Co camp over free cam
whatever like if you just want to
practice coding go to those websites let
me see what else what else
do you communicate with other youtubers
with other coder you tourists have you
told about doing collab I mean I was
like super open everybody that's been
here for a while and knows me knows that
I was like super open to work with other
people and even I'm the only person out
of all the youtubers I'm the only person
that has created top like a top 15 of
the best YouTube developers it's like
just to promote other people to get them
out there whenever I find a good channel
I tell all my viewers about it nobody
else does that right nobody does that
for me nobody shares my channel nobody
talks about my channel only person that
does a is Chris Shawn once in a while
you know but besides that nobody
throws any love I mean so I don't know
love back at nobody anymore period I
just stick to myself it's like you know
I came in here like kumbaya people
started copying what I was doing
people started doing exactly whatever
moves I would make that would make the
same moves so then I say you know what
man I'm good I don't need to talk to
nobody I don't need nobody stealing my
sauce like I'm good you know what I mean
like I'm here for the viewers I'm not
here for the youtubers you know they
could go ahead and suck my
fill-in-the-blank you know what I mean
yeah man I mean the other person that I
want to work with I don't know maybe
this weekend send him a message man too
real Casa Darrow and you know maybe real
tough candy I would love to have both of
them on one podcast us three Jersey you
know talking to each other and just
sharing ideas and have the people here
enjoy that that collaboration you know
but I'm now I'm not I'm not really
reaching out so nobody cuz everybody's
always like oh I'm busy I'm this
bro I work full-time I have a frickin
major website which I do videos every
single day for I have a family just had
a kid like enough somehow find time to
do collaborations and answer emails and
talk to other youtubers and talk to
other subscribers I do video calls with
subscribers all the time so if I can
find the time all these people that
they're coming up with excuses is
because they don't want it to it so
right now they can suck my
fill-in-the-blank you know that's just
how I feel
anyway it's my first paycheck I'm
signing up I'm not doing it right
I'm not working right now yeah now don't
worry man you signed up when you can
yeah man let me see what's your opinion
on CSS great I'm not using it I'm being
honest I'm not using CSS grid I barely
use flex boxes because to me it's more
work than what it needs to be there's
more you have to do more work than what
it's worth if I can go in and do
everything that I want to do or we're
just playing CSS in like two seconds
why wouldn't I just to say hey I'm using
CSS grid or I'm using flex boxes my god
on use that at all you know plus like in
my company we gotta support a lot of
older browsers because there's a lot of
older older people who use our website
so you know what I mean like I'm not I
can't just be switching up switching up
type of frameworks or or like you know
the latest latest things that come out
every week from CSS or JavaScript like I
have to choose something that's excited
hey Joe when will you add more projects
to the JavaScript course I'm thinking
about doing it this weekend I still got
to do another validation like that's
another than tool that's how people when
you sign up for my website
none of the courses are done meaning
none of the courses are complete and
they're never gonna be complete because
when I create a course that's where I'm
gonna be adding projects into it like I
create the course I teach you order the
basics of it you know like I said like
the JavaScript course I go in there and
teach you what's a function was a if
statement was a loop teacher all the
loops teach you variables whatever right
I'll teach you all those stuff and then
from there every day or every week
whenever I got a chance I go in there
and add
another project to it so I'm still gonna
continue adding a whole bunch of
projects to it so it's like it's like a
lifetime thing you know that's what I
tell people the best thing is either
doing the yearly or doing the the
lifetime subscription because then
forever you're always going to be
continue seeing projects like that's
what I'm doing right now
yeah man whenever whenever you're ready
I'm here man highlight you boy who's
your favorite udemy teacher that you
always learn from Stephen Ryder to me
he's like the gold standard because he
takes his time creates diagrams he
breaks down things in a way that you can
understand they like he's not trying to
sound like oh I'm the smartest guy in
the world like some people they like to
throw a whole bunch of big words to get
you confused and think like oh my god
this guy's so smart and there's reality
is like nah he's just be in a a hole and
just like trying to act smart for no
reason when you're there because you're
trying to learn you're not there to be
impressed you know what I mean that's
how I think of like a lot of instructors
they just go in and be like oh they want
to act like they the smart it's like me
when I make my tutorials my questions I
make it like dummy proof like anybody
that can pretty much use a keyboard and
use a browser can learn what I'm trying
to teach them I'm not trying to teach
you in a way where you're gonna be like
oh man there's two events no because
you're there and you're paying for a
service to somebody to break it down for
you in a way that you're gonna
understand it you know what I mean so
yeah let me see let me see what girl was
good was good was good
yeah man I'm about to be out of here man
we've been here for an hour we chill for
a while and yeah we good guys make sure
you check out coding phase comm that's
the only way to support your boy that's
the only way to you know at the same
time just gives me motivation the more
people that sign up the more motivation
that I have and the goal right now we
got nine hundred the goal is to get
10,000 people on the website once that
number reaches to 10,000 then I'm doing
this full time 100% a hundred percent
full-time every every day and just like
you know like today I took a day off
from work but that's what I'm here for
o'clock like most of the time I might
work right now you know I don't get home
tonight 5:30 6 o'clock so then from
there I don't get to do any videos or
talk to you guys till the nighttime you
know imagine if we get to reach this
number of 10,000 people then once we get
there then its full time I'm doing this
full-time 100% of the time I'm getting a
bigger office right now I'm doing this
straight from my extra room that I have
in the house but I want to get my own
office like a real recording studio just
for it to do videos for you guys and
like something legit you know take it to
the next level so the goal right now we
we one-tenth of the way there we're at
900 now so once we get to 10,000 then we
doing this a hundred percent of the time
full-time and then at the same time like
I get to help out more of you guys you
know there's a lot of people that want
to help me out and help me promote the
channel help me promote on the website
you know I want to also pay you guys you
know and give you guys money like you
know like Matt Barbra like you know they
do it out of love you know they really
help out a lot in and get the word out
there and they've put in so many so many
you know hours in today's and you

is like you know and the community is
growing in and we're getting a little
extra money
of course I'm want to give back to the
people that basically got us here you

what I mean like I'm not looking to
become a millionaire I'm not looking to
do anything I'm just looking to do this
 full-time I'm just looking to be
able to come here every single day and
instead of me giving in nine-to-five to
a job give nine-to-five for you guys
right every day wake up by 8 o'clock in
the morning record a bunch of videos
create a bunch of tutorials help out
people 101 I want to bring back you know
the the mentorship program where I will
take five or six different different
people and mentor them for you know the
last time we did it was for a month I
would like to do this for three months
and just get people up to par like you
know to the top of the game I saw that's
what I want to do you know that's the
plan man I've been telling people and
you know and also to just start giving
back out like people freaking free
laptops whatever thing you need some RAM
let me help you out
pay for your ram you know things like
that like people think it's like oh you
know if I come here I'm doing all this
stuff if you look at my very first video
go look at my very first video I talk
about all this stuff the goals that I
have for this channel the goals that I
have one is coding phase calm the goals
is to just help our people the goal is
not to be like hey guys let's just try
to
make Joe a millionaire now like I don't
need that like I'm making enough
I'm good what I'm making right now not I
mean but how can we help other people
out you know what I mean because if I
had somebody like me when I was starting
I would be so freakin grateful because
nobody else won nobody believed in me
number two it was so hard because I had
to do all this stuff by myself I didn't
have no friends that we're trying to
learn how to code nobody was there and
in that whole period that whole first
year that I was doing this you know so I
just want to be able to help out other
people that's it and be able to do this
full-time so yeah whenever you support
the channel whenever you go to coding
phase calm it's like I said people have
concept be the same oh I want to donate
this to your cause I want to donate this
don't donate anything to me don't send
me nothing because the idea is not to
donate tiny the idea is for me to Ernie
and give you you know Quality Counts and
give you something that's gonna help you
move on in your life and create
something great for yourself you know
what I mean
like I'm not looking to be hey let's
let's throw a twenty dollar donation to
Joe's like it's great if there's a
donation if not it's fine but what I
really want is like let me earn it let
me work for you and be like hey let me

you always in here showing love here's a
brand new on our brand new SSD here's a
you know a freaking course whatever
whatever I can give back to people
that's what I want to do you know some
we just hear me alright guys so code
offense calm is the website check it out
yeah we go
you know what I mean yeah and any any
ideas that you guys want to have for any
of the courses let me know email me
