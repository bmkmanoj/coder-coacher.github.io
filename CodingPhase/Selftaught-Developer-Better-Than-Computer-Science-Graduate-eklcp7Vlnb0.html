at it again man listen today we're gonna
talk about why teaching yourself it's
actually better than going to school
right let's let's start by going to
school right let's start with the topic
of going to school before you know you
go from kindergarten to twelfth grade of
high school there from there you go four
years of college right sometimes even
more and like let's say you have this
passion of you know building things
programming and coding a lot of times in
school what they teach you is a lot of
theory from what I've noticed and you
know in job in the job environment is
pretty much a lot of times students who
are graduating with a computer science
degree or mechanical engineering or
Electrical Engineering when it comes to
or you know comparing them with somebody
who taught themselves how to code and
how to become a programmer most of the
time the programmer is actually a better
coder than the computer science major
almost all the time now one thing that
they do have that's actually better than
teaching yourself is they get a lot of
fundamentals stuff that like let's say
for example like right now like let's
say an example you guys you guys is over
here and trying to learn what
development right a lot of people don't
don't look into how important it is to
actually know databases right so pretty
much people think is just HTML CSS and
JavaScript and that's it they created a
web page and that's a the thing that
that's all you need to become a you know
a developer or programmer but they don't
teach you what they don't look into
learning actually databases and you know
the whole night right now when you
actually in school like let's see in
college cuz I actually took one year of
computer science but I use didn't like
because there was too much theory but
going back to the topic in that first
year I remember I
like like three calculus classes on top
of that it was just mostly theory but
one thing that I did get and I was
grateful was my introduction to
databases and I think if I didn't have
that introduction to databases I
wouldn't understand a lot of the topics
in the early stages of me learning how
to become a web developer right so I
think in that sense is good for those
guys that have a computer science major
but at the same time a lot of times I'll
be seeing it all the time this guy's out
there who who went straight from high
school to just learning by themselves on
learning how to code when there was like
17 so by now when they become like 24 25
these guys are our freakin geniuses you
know what I mean
Wow the other kid who went to college
and was like oh yeah I'm just going to
college and I'm gonna do this for years
it's not even half half as prepared as
the other kid that actually taught
himself why because he one kid is doing
it by himself in his house and he's
called him 8 to 12 hours now this other
kid is only coding projects when they
give him homework there's a big
difference and that's it that's the
thing that people don't understand when
you're going to school a lot of people
think like hey I'm doing all the
projects from my class the teacher
taught me how to create a webpage and
then I'm going to create a little
 page in about me page and then
I say you know what the other kid is
actually looking online what's the best
ways to create a website how do you know
add JavaScript HTML CSS how to do or you
know a whole bunch of stuff that you
know adding frameworks while the kid
that's actually in college it's not
doing anything is just getting basics
you know sometimes they teach you you
know stuff like was it Java or like
seashore
and yeah it's good to you know learn
those programming languages but at the
same time like comparing it to a kid who
has been coding since like 17
you came and compared them because the
killer's been : since 17 is so much more
prepared than the king who went to
college that's my opinion
that's from what I've seen of course
it's gonna be people who's gonna say hey
you know like I went to college and I'm
a great developer I'm went to college
and I did this and I and you know like a
lot of times man yes that's great that's
you know good for you that you went to
college it you know you think you're
four years but don't you think it would
have been better if you what I should
have been programming and coding for
four years every day you know eight
hours a day instead of doing a whole
bunch of like psychology classes
sociology class history a whole bunch of
stuff that you're like why am I in this
class why am i paying so much money just
for this this BS and then that's when
somebody might say hey that's why you go
to a boot camp but then that's the same
problem soon because in a boot camp
they're gonna teach you the basics
they're not teaching you anything beyond
the basics they're not teaching you
something like you know to become a
great developer they're just gonna teach
you hey learn you know learn loops learn
conditionals this is how you create a
page and you put it up online on Heroku
you can learn that online like you don't
need those guys man like it's pretty
crazy so I would say hey you know for
years degree comparing it to a kid who
is 17 years old and been coding since 17
and now is 24 years old so imagine like
this 24 year old what a degree and a 24
year old without a degree but has been
doing it since 17 has been coding since
17 with a large portfolio comparing it
to a kid who just graduated from school
and all he's doing
is pretty much doing the homework that
they give them every two weeks and one
final project every six months come on
guys you can't even be you can't compare
it you know what I mean so it's up to
you if you really want to take a you
know four years of school get yourself
in debt well I will say hey don't do it
you know what I mean anyways man this is
my joke back out of the game man
listen we got a lot of good things
coming up next week
so make sure you you keep watching my
videos the quality is gonna be better
the cameras coming in is way better I'm
getting a whole room there's gonna be
just a studio just for us to basically
create videos for you guys and yeah and
thanks everybody who's actually been
buying courses on you know on you to me
like what you guys don't understand is
that even if you guys don't buy the
courses that I'm providing to you guys
because you click on the link hey I
actually get a little something right
and what I'm going to be doing next week
is I'm going to interview basically the
stores who I gave them free courses
right and you guys gonna actually see
what where your money is going to you
know because you got to think about it
you're buying this courses but you're
not buying it just because I'm telling
you hey buy this course because they're
actually good and those aren't courses
that I learned but at the same time
you're doing it because you want to help
out other peoples you know what I mean
like if the course is only fifteen
dollars and you're gonna get 40 hours of
a video of like basically tutorials and
learning the full process of becoming a
web developer and you spent fifteen
dollars pretty much and then I make a
dollar and from that dollar I give 40
cents to the students all that stuff
start adding up you know what I mean so
you guys are putting money in I'm
putting money in and let's just help
each other out man this there's a lot of
people who definitely need to help right
now man and you know today Trump became
president so you don't know where we
gonna be at
you know a year two years from now so I
rather you know help people out and be
like please God if things go bad at
least know that I'm you know I try to
help people people out you know so
