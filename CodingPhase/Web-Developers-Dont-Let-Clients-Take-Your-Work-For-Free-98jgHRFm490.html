game man : face.com guys i just wanted
to tell you this man everything real
life that's worth something it's hard I
know hard to get a heart to create so
with that saying I want to put an
example let's say gold it's hard to find
gold it's hard to find diamonds
it's hard to you know build or your
rolls-royce it costs a lot of money
because people gotta put by hand and
stitch you know health
everything customizable they cause a lot
of money for a reason so for you guys
when you create something and a client
comes to you and tells you hey man I
only got this much I already got huh you
wanna you know you wanna mm how they got
700 then give us $700 work with the code
give them half of the code and tell them
hey see if you can make this work with
halfway code when you have the other
half I'll make the rest of it work for
you all because people don't want to
give you value right they don't want to
give value to your work
a lot of people were especially been
doing freelance they don't want to give
that value to your work they think like
oh man if I put this on Elance they
charging me $3 the Indians are trying to
give me $3 why should I pay you
you know 45,000 our $50 an hour
when I can go on events and pay you know
three dollars and fifty cents an hour
well he doesn't tell anybody the cement
you contact a meet
I didn't contact you right that's number
one number two you don't understand this
different type of quality if you want to
get a shitty quality something that's
going to break tomorrow go ahead and get
it from Elance and pay that your 3050
right but if you want quality and you
want something that's going to last
something that you can be sure it works
it's something that I'm going to support
like most of those guys think on Elance
they go in they sign up with fake names
and then they disappear because nobody
wants to pay taxes right so they go in
and put fake names fake accounts and
they disappear so if you guys something
for you and you will have contact for
her how is he going to support the
software I'll support the you know the
web development for your website how is
he going to help you out whenever you
need a couple of changes are you going
to keep on hiring more developers every
time that one developer disappears you
know that's why a lot of times you see
projects where over 20 people have
worked on it I've seen a project where
every single line was ran by somebody
else and you'd be like how do out it
that this should happen and it's because
people don't want to spend our money
they don't want to spend our money
saying hey I got a dedicated developer
working on this I have a dedicated team
that I hired for this somebody that I
can trust somebody that I can put you
know I can create a contract with and
say hey this person created my website
so if this person created my website he
has the obligation to support that
website support that framework that he
put in you know like those are the
things I tell a client you know like if
you want me to build something for you
you have to understand that well number
one this thing takes time number two for
it to be really good we have to test it
and test it and test it and that means
those are hours of testing it making
sure that everything works you know so
those are something that I tell people I
tell them like hey man I'm working on
your website but you got to understand
there's a value to this thing there's a
price to it you're getting quality work
it's not like you found me
I wasn't in the corner I wasn't like you
know I wasn't in the alley
you know I was I wasn't some crackhead
looking for work you know what I mean
like I'm a professional buddy you know
what I mean that's what you came to me
so that's why you got to make sure you
get paid your full amount don't let
nobody comment it how you call it
bamboos are you and just take your your
time because nobody's going to gives you
time back that time that you spend
working on a client website or working
on something for a client doesn't matter
what it is if it's a phone application
doesn't matter if it's a website doesn't
matter if it's a software doesn't matter
if it was in the database that time
nobody's going to give you that time
back that time that you put in for that
client nobody's going to give you that
time back so the only way that you're
gonna get you know your award which is
what I was saying man money doesn't
bring happiness but at least it gives an
award to you like say hey you spend you
know 300 hours on a project you know 300
hours he is 20 grand you know what I
mean like he's ten grand like it makes
sense you be like okay now when your
wife is nagging at you like oh man you
always in a computer oh you're always
doing this and that or when your friends
are telling you hey man what happened
man you ever play ball no more you doing
come outside man like come on let's hang
out now you have an excuse now you could
be like hey man I got money in my pocket
I didn't did it again that's when you're
telling like that because you know it's
your hard work man you're putting in
that work so make sure you get pay for
it don't do things for free man don't
let people bamboozle you don't let
people come in and tell you all mansion
you know that you
you both said yeah we're gonna do
something for 2,000 and the guy come up
to you but listen man I only got 700
right now you give me a week I'm gonna
give you the rest nah man you ain't
gettin nothin you who give me those 700
