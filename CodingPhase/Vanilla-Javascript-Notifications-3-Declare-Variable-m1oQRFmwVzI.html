we're going to do is basically get all
the elements that we're going to use so
we got to bring this together and we're
going to put this on the bottom so from
now from here at the top and say bar
notify equals document a doc query
selector and then we're going to put in
dot brick notify which is this right
here so when we add the class active is
going to show up so let's remove that
for now okay so that's that element and
then we have the album's so we got a
little Phi let me put this tool okay
where you guys are
albums then we're going to say query
selector or and then what we're going to
say is find all the elements that have
the class album now to make sure that
we're actually looking at the right
thing we're going to say notify you got
a constant like that so you actually see
what's in there go to council okay
that's an object that's good and then
albums they should be an array okay so
it's an array with multiple
so each object inside of this array is
one element so basically every single
album here every div with the class
album see have all those the classes
that we have phoned us as class album
all right so let's jump onto the next
things which is inside of this notify
right so we come to the note 5 it's
quick active again and let's run it so
we can see there's actually a class call
items total so we want to get down to
let's say it's copy of person and us a
kind of total input items so there and
then we're going to copy this again and
then now what we're going to do is to
save save PN which means save button and
let's see all the class of that and just
buy it all right okay so that's good I'm
gonna say 105 albums
I don't total say it BTN console.log
albums alright so for now we already
declare everything that we're going to
need from now let me just remove this
from here let's active save this and run
it yeah so that's how we want it now
