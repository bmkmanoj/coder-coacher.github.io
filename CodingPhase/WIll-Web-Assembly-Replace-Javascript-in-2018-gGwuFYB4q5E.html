at it again matte-coated face calm
listen your boy is back I did it again
guys listen people been asking me hey
Joe
what do you think about webassembly is
it going to replace JavaScript what like
think about that I will say no like it's
not gonna replace JavaScript if you know
there's a million different languages
that were right next to JavaScript and
they still couldn't replace it right you
have stuff like dart you have typescript
you have what else oh well you got es6
which is part of javascript if you think
about it but what is like the browser's
decided to say hey we all got to switch
the typescript
do you think that's going to happen I
don't think so do you think all the
browser's are going to say hey we're all
going to switch up to webassembly I
don't think so
what assembly might be useful for
certain things like you know for
graphics you know you're maybe for video
games maybe for certain things that you
want to use for processing or just to
have things more efficient because
everybody knows JavaScript is a
clusterfuck JavaScript there's a whole
bunch of errors the guy created it in
one week and there's a reason why
there's so many Arizona it's well it's a
 language that somebody created
in a week like you can't you can't
complain about that
but I forgot the other name of there was
a language at the same time that
JavaScript came out and basically it was
from Microsoft it was JavaScript
competition and Microsoft's try to push
it out or in the Explorer and try to get
it out there I don't know I don't know
the exact name you guys might be able to
look it up on Google and you don't do
your Google's right
so do your Google's in it and look it up
but there was a language that was
actually
competition for JavaScript and that a
win nope it's dinner
so some think that now it's 2017 after
more than 20 30 years of the web being
out here right and so many websites do
you think that there's going to be
another language that's going to trump
no pun intended
Trump the world of the World Wide Web
with you know removing JavaScript for
web assembly or replacing it is that
going to happen I don't think so
kids I really don't you know I'm
actually getting busy from all around
this whole this whole place but yeah I
mean do I think that's going to happen I
definitely I don't thinks of us at all I
don't think that's going to happen you
know website is something cool Elm e LM
L it's cool it's something cool is
something that seems amazing you know as
front to mess around with what do I
think is going to replace HTML CSS and
JavaScript no I don't think so
you know those are one of those
technologies that you know all the Nerds
is going to get excited about and
they're gonna be like oh my god this
language is the best or whatever but is
it gonna go into you know businesses I
don't think so because at the end of the
day it's not up to us develop person who
decide was going to be popular was gonna
actually make it to the top out of all
the languages it's like me I love
crystal Lang but isn't gonna make it to
the top I don't know you know it takes
time to find out right but
when it comes to languages you know like
webassembly um which I consider
experimental languages do I think
they're going to go and replace
something like JavaScript I really don't
think so you know so don't don't put all
your money in that little basket that's
what I'm gonna say to you you know if
you're spending a lot of time trying to
learn web assembly and you think that's
going to get you jobs which jobs is was
going to put money in your pocket man
you're going to be broke because I
really don't think it's going to be in
just for whether something maybe you
know in Google they might want you know
say a freaking webassembly developer
well it's like now you're competing with
like the top put a crop meaning like now
you're dealing with guys who just
graduated from like MIT and graduating
from like you know freaking Georgia Tech
and all this this great university right
guys who are creating amazing project
and now you're competing with them to
try to get that one job there's going to
be five ten jobs in the whole world for
webassembly
and now you're competing with those guys
you know what I mean is like is they
trying to learn a programming language
that is only useful for rocket science
like you know for throwing
 high-quality rockets to space
like do you guys really think like
you're gonna be able to get those jobs
there's gonna be so much competition
because it's probably going to be only
two or three people in the world who's
gonna be able to get those out right so
I don't know what assembly I don't think
that they there's a future there for you
know regular the developers right if you
want to try something experimental and
you want to be cool and you know release
something of cold pennant or jsbin and
be like oh yeah look look what I create
on webassembly great you want to be that
guy who gets a lot of likes on copán
cool
what is it going to put money in your
pocket I don't think so
all right guys I'll see you guys later
man
make sure you subscribe make sure you
like this video man you boys back I
didn't did it again down guys
listen you gotta have fun with this this
is you know a lot of people going to
come here and they're going to be like
oh my god is not the regular developer I
know that the swag is too real the sauce
is too great but you gotta come in here
to swag it out kids alright guys make
sure you subscribe make sure you like
this video you already knows your boy
Joe back at it again man listen make
sure you subscribe and make sure you
like this video man by the way if you
want to know exactly what courses I took
to become a web developer they right
there in the description it's no secret
it's nothing crazy is no secret gift
that I had it's just pretty much I took
the courses they're pretty cheap they're
like $15 beads on specials and just this
mess change your life change your
