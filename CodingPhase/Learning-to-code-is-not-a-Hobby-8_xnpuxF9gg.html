again man coding face.com your boys back
and out and did it again
yeah all right guys so listen I want to
talk to you guys I want to tell you guys
something this year right it is very
important you guys have been signing up
to the website you had guys have been
supporting the channel
but now it's time to really take the
series I keep saying this all the time
but seriously take you're serious like
don't take coding as a hobby
alright everybody that's here should
have a reason why they want to learn to
code they want to create their own
application they want to build their own
applet on you know their own business
their own you know freaking idea that
they have they have a service that they
want to create something they want to
get a job if you were one of those
people that they just don't know if you
want to come up with an idea right now
cool just say hey I just want to get
money I want to get something stable and
I want to do something that's fun and I
could enjoy cool that's your goal but
use that as motivation to learn to code
use that as motivation to come in and do
the work you know I see a lot of people
that have signed up and they have signed
up to the website and you know more than
I think like 75% of the people they've
probably completed over three to four
courses right
this thing is like unlimited access when
you come to the website currently right
now 65% off is unlimited access for a
simple price seven bucks right now 52
hours a year or a hundred four hours for
the lifetime okay
now you sign up to this thing you do one
you got to you got 3 you follow the
timeline let's say an example you don't
know anything you know hey I don't even
know how to use the text editor I'll
never even use Microsoft Word I came out
of a rock right I came up out of under a
rock like I need to learn how to use the
text editor is right there you need to
learn the terminal there's just
you guys will get comfortable with
little commands is super easy my seem
intimidating but it's super easy then
you learn to build your first web page
after building your first web page yes
you could jump in so say hey I want to
build a responsive app cool you could do
that but there's something that you
should do before that you should try to
start building things on your own
because if you come in and you follow
along you're following along you get
what I'm saying
like it's not you building anything
you're following the way how I did
things and then from there you're just
copying and pasting okay while we are
watching the video which is cool but you
have to build something okay so let's
say you come here and you say hey I just
want to build something super simple
super easy you could say hey I'm gonna
build a webpage how can we do this okay
we search on driven website we find this
simple website which is just a whole
bunch of boxes when you think about it
this is very easy you come here and say
okay there's one box there's another box
inside of it there's a whole bunch of
boxes and inside of it it has icons and
some text inside of it
alright you break it down like that the
same way I taught you guys and I learn
to code HTML and CSS you build this page
but you build on your own and then
anything that you find that you're like
oh wait I don't know how to do this I
can't remember it you go back to the
video and find him but I oh yeah he told
us to do this here he told us how to
break things down here how to you know
organize things in order you know you
follow the video there from day you
create your own thing and then you come
back to the video when you're stuck okay
that's how it is now if you can't find
your answer on the end
video itself go to Google come in and
say something sounds dumb but you could
literally say something we just say I
want to align a text to the left how to
align text to the right let's say to the
right in HTML is right there and then
you will see it says o P align attribute
you click there you could use this that
could be something simple but you could
do it with CSS now you come in and you
say okay I want to do it with CSS and
say okay I want to do it CSS and then
you see you got text-align:left text
online right text-align:center that's it
it was that easy okay
it's just you know you try on your own
like I said we follow along then we try
on our own if I'm stuck I look at the
video if the video doesn't have to
answer I googling okay now going back to
the topic of coming in and just like you
know taking advantage of this don't do
it as a hobby if you come in and you
sign up for a website don't do it as if
you signed up to the gym right you come
to the gym you work out super-hard your
first two days then your muscles start
aching your it hurts and that's what
happens to of code you bump into a road
and you're like ah my muscles ache and
you're like stuck so then what happens
there is you say I'm gonna come back to
it a day from now I need to get some
rest I'm gonna come back with a fresh
mind and brand new okay a day pass by
today's fast by now you come back three
days later okay you work out for a
little bit you do your little coding
then you come back bump into a road then
from there you say I'm gonna come back
in a day from now one day becomes a week
now you come back again so then you're
going through this whole cycle until you
notice that one day
you say ah I'm already paid for this for
the whole month I'm good you know I
could come back to this at any moment
next thing you know now it falls over to
the second month right so now what you
could have learned in the first month
you could have been already done with
like three courses
you still on one course because you've
been letting it go you've been leaving
it then you're like oh mad I don't know
man like I should maybe come back later
you know it's like a month already you
haven't done anything
you got charged twice already you
haven't learned as much as you should be
and let's say a year from now you come
back and you're like oh yeah on my
fourth month I cancelled I try other
services I tried other things and you
know I still I still haven't even
mastered JavaScript you could have done
all of that in your first five months
but you was taking it as a hobby this is
something that you cannot be mad at
nobody else could be mad at that because
that was something that you decided to
do you get what I'm saying like you
can't come in and say I want to use this
website or I want to learn to code as a
hobby when you start thinking about that
you say oh yeah it's my hobby a hobby
means you come in and learn to code
whenever this time it shouldn't be oh
it's whenever this time no is I have to
make time for code I have to make time
to learn to code I have to make time to
come in and and start building my own
things let's say we build the schedule
right build you guys a schedule and say
hey you come in Monday to Tuesday's is
just learning Wednesdays and Fridays are
building things from scratch building
things from zero with everything that
you already learned so you got Monday
Tuesday Thursday and from there maybe
Saturday
you come in and those are your learning
days Wednesdays and Fridays is for you
to build original things meaning
websites meaning applications meaning
ideas you might have okay but you need
to start building things don't follow
along the videos without no substance to
it you just like you're following along
like this is Netflix don't do that don't
treat this as a hobby treat it as
something that you're trying to become
and it's something that you have a goal
tool right you have a goal at the end of
the day so make that goal of reality
don't make it a dream all right
hobbies are things where you're like oh
yeah man you know I have a hobby of you
know building ships you know people have
hobbies of I have a hobby of building
robots right how about you build robots
instead of you playing with Gundam and
trucking and putting in Gundam plays
together like how about you just build a
freakin robot like it's not that hard
when you think about it it's not gonna
be the smartest robot it's gonna be
something that hey you press a button
and the robot all it does is just grabs
a thing and goes like this
I say you built a robot doesn't have to
be super complex doesn't have to be a
robot that talks to you doesn't have to
be a robot that does a million things no
a very simple robot something that you
can program and say hey when I press
this button your job is to move your
hand grab and squeeze that's it that's
how you start right if you think like
you're gonna be able to do everything in
one shot it's not gonna work like that
all right because that's when you gotta
have realistic goals
you gotta give yourself time all the
things that I know right now the other
things that I teach you guys is really
from all the mistakes that I've made
right so now I teach you guys
things that I will say hey man I wish
somebody would have taught me years ago
I wish somebody would have told me hey
man all the stuff that you trying to
learn on the side and all these things
that you trying to master you know I
spend so much time like I'm trying to
master JavaScript for a long time and
then I realize I'm like for 90% of the
things that I need to do with web
development I don't need to be a
JavaScript master it's that simple right
over the years you will master
JavaScript you will become like super
good and be able to create your own
libraries create your own frameworks yes
but for you to get a job for you to
start working and start creating
websites you don't need to know every
single thing if we want to go here and
be like hey man we're gonna right click
into this alright we're gonna come in
here we're gonna try to find you know
let's say I don't know we're coming here
and try to look at the whole Dom tree
and then we trying to learn everything
inside of the Dom tree like what are you
gonna learn from it like yeah you
learned everything but you could have
been building websites you could have
been building sites for your clients you
could have been already working all
right
some people fall into that loop of
trying to learn too much you know what I
mean so just take it easy but don't take
it too easy where you're taking this as
a hobby this is not something that you
do for a hobby man there's not something
that you come in and be like how cool
when I get a chance I'll call when I'm
watching Netflix and Wow you know I'll
code a little something there
you're not focused on this watching
Netflix unless you already master
something wrong you already know the
language that's a distraction take your
time
sit down if you have too much noise
around your house buy some some
headphones that you know isolate your
ears and you can't hear nothing outside
and just focus on what's in the TV or
your screen
your computer or monitor just focus on
that give yourself that one hour two
hours a day to be able to work on things
don't take it as a hobby all right and I
was just coming up with this top because
I'm like man a lot of people are signing
up to the website right and it's January
it feels good it feels good it feels
like you know we all gonna work hard
this year but let's see how much it
drops off by next week let's see I'll
keep you guys updated I'm gonna tell you
guys this is data this is data that I
feel is valuable for us as developers
and for us who are trying to become
developers the way how things go people
come in try to learn so much you know
what I mean by next week start slowing
down by the week after it's like this on
the fourth week is I hope a lot of
people fall off the edge all right the
other ones they stay a study pace you
know there's a lot of people who's gonna
stay at a steady pace and continue
learning but so many people are going to
fall off and this video is just to tell
you guys at that moment when you're
about to fall off and be like I'll be
back I already signed up from a movement
I'll come back to it you know what I
mean like once you get that moment in
your head remember this video be like
now I can't do that because I'm a fall
off if I fall off then all of this is a
waste and then this becomes a hobby
right we don't want this to become a
hobby we want this to become a career we
want this to become our business we want
this to become our road to greatness and
you know great achievements you know
what I mean like become something in
this world you gotta say like create
something that you could be proud of all
right that's what we want to reach we
want to be able to come in and say hey
you know last year I saw it last year I
sucked and then this year I'm nice Yano
saying like this year I'm nice
see was just me bumping to the road I
didn't know what to do I couldn't even
go to interview I was nervous I was you
know trying to learn too much I didn't
really master anything but this year I'm
nice that's just how it works I'm not
saying that's gonna take your whole year
if you follow along like I told you guys
the timeline everything here is just
telling you like the things that you
gotta learn on the timeline now if you
already know the stuff you could go
ahead skip go to the next thing
now if you feel you're comfortable go to
the next thing you will skip it you
don't have to do everything but at the
same time you know just make sure it's
not a hobby make sure it's not something
that you coming in and you spend spend
$7 sometimes we sign up some stuff that
you know we forget we were members of I
don't want that to happen to you guys
because who gets the benefits me Oh
it'll be great if people just sign up
and they forget like hey man I signed up
two years ago I had somebody this is a
real story somebody hit me up and I
don't know the guy or the girl hit me up
like hey man Sun up in September and you
know they cancelled in September they
came in you know they came in signed up
and cancelled that same date right so
they're from day they came back into the
website like once or twice the do comes
back emails me and tells me hey can I
get a refund we are in January there's a
30-day money-back guarantee you get your
money back
but it's a 30-day thing so to me it kind
of tells me like wait you signed up you
cancelled and then you came back in like
maybe once or twice gave up
right you gave up not me gave up on you
is you gave up cuz you never contacted
me you never told me if you had any
issues
build something or setup anything you
gave up and then four months later is
you're basically trying to put it on me
to be like hey can I get a refund like
no I will give you the refund is not
even technically it's not even possible
I can't even do it so 30-day thing like
if you come in on the 30 days you get I
click one button that thing goes right
back to you your account so you're good
but after 30 days I I'm not gonna come
into out of my pocket out of your
laziness out of your irresponsibility
for me to come in and be like hey make
send me your PayPal information so I
could send you back here you're freaking
five dollars that you paid because at
that point I had to write out a special
in the beginning that was like the first
month of the website I did it for order
the the people it's like you were five
dollars you want me to send you five
dollars you get what I'm saying like
sometimes people don't even know what
they're doing in this world this you
have to take this seriously man I've
never contacted anybody so tell them hey
man could you send me my father's back
like I don't know if I really you know I
didn't know that I didn't want to get
incidents don't get into it if you think
this thing is a hobby this thing is a
real thing people come in and change
their lives you know I think God that I
learned how to code because it really
changed my life right now I'm seriously
woulda thought I would have been like
living with my mom somewhere oh you know
no money still driving around that you
know was a Saturn Vue if you know what a
Saturn Vue is and the reason why I bring
this up is because this cards are
completely pieces of ish I'll show you
guys the card that I had that constantly
turned off on me when a time super
cold outside and I'm in this piece of
fish and this thing is horrible just
dying everywhere right but that's all
that I could afford at that time so I
had to take it right I had to take it
and who knows I would have probably
still being on that side of you if I
didn't change what I was doing
in 2012 2011 2012 alright so you have to
put in the work you have to come in and
take this serious you know when I do
this stuff that I come in and creoles
courses it's for your benefit my benefit
will really be if I come in and say hey
man everything that I put up is $115 you
know is it worth that money yes it's
worth it but am I gonna put at that
price no because what I want you guys is
to come in and learn everything I can
more out of you guys becoming developers
and passing this on and tell them other
people's like hey man this guy helped me
out because in my you know my big scheme
of the world and everything that I want
to do is it's more better for me and
more beneficial that more people get to
know who I am that me tried to get money
from a small amount of people it doesn't
work for me
I want everybody who's out there who's
trying to get into the industry somehow
I want to be able to touch them and say
hey there's the right way learn this hey
that's all I really want right and
that's what I'm saying like guys take
this come in work hard but don't take it
as a hobby don't do it to yourself
this is not something that you just come
in and just be like I'll cool I'll do it
next week next week becomes next month
next month you forgot you even signed up
now you signed up for three months right
you got charged three months nobody got
anything out of it and set me and that's
not what I want you get what I'm saying
so I will keep on reminding you guys you
know to not fall off the
the trail of becoming a developer okay
so yes your boy job back at it again
coding phase comm your boys back and not
and did it again and by the way if you
want to check it out the website is
there like I said sixty five percent off
is literally until Friday night
well you technically a Saturday 12 a.m.
that's when it ends and then it'll be
back to believe fifty percent off if you
use the links on my description okay so
it's up to you guys what you guys want
to do it's right there I'm creating more
courses every single day this Ruby
course that I'm building currently right
now is super fun if you wanted to just
learn programming and you say before I
will start learning HTML CSS I just want
to learn to program
I will also recommend just start with
the Ruby one you don't even have to jump
into HTML CSS JavaScript none of that
stuff if you wanted to just say I just
want to learn to program first and get
the idea see if I like it
start with the Ruby try that out okay
try it out it's a beautiful language and
then from there you will start seeing
things that you know it's the whole you
know the whole spectrum of web
development alright that's my specialty
that's what I do
this is not about software there's not
by building apps it's not about building
games my specialty is in web development
so take advantage if I'm telling you hey
this thing works it's for a reason
alright anyways guys this your boy job
back at it again coding face.com
your boy is back I don't did it again
please leave a comment tell me let's
have a conversation from now on I really
want to have conversations with you guys
on the comments so we could talk about
the videos that I do you know what do
you guys think I mean have this happen
to you or have you seen this happen to
other people where they sign up for
something they take it as a hobby and
they end up losing in the long run or
they lose interest okay let's talk about
it
