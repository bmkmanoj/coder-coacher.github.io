like they did great like I was surprised
man Matt biggest thing April came in
it's like what everybody left gonna
comment was like you know April
she got a dis sense of style her silence
came out pretty legit she came out
almost exactly like um the design which
is great um basically you know she still
got to go over her JavaScript which is
fine the project wasn't to finish
everything was just to get it as much as
you know as much as possible from it so
it's like if you flap to the different
sorry see if you got to the JavaScript
that's great if you didn't that's fine
but at least the design has to look
legit you know so yeah
that's what we up to matte-finish thing
there's a JavaScript Tommy very firm
your boy campaign man knock it out
you know everybody's doing good man I
really wish deference and Andre would
have been able to come in but you know
everybody got their own reasons why they
didn't come in but you cannot you can't
say hey man didn't do the work came in
then they want to show their face hey
man that we're busy we don't know we
don't know the reason but at least you
know they took a chance to try to still
show up for the first few episodes so
that's fine you know what I mean -
that's cool here man but you guys are
love to do and I know today it's Friday
like I'm in a good mood I'm going to
take a little family road trip I'm gonna
do a vlog about it I don't know like I
told you guys I might be creating
another channel where I'm gonna put in
or like old blogs and
I don't know I'm going to see what I'm
going to make you know because I'm not
going to put it here so but I will tell
you guys what's up
I create a new channel I will tell you
guys basically what was the vlogs way
more such an opening so you guys can
search it up and basically you know at
it it's got to be most of these is going
to be me and my girlfriend we also in
the baby so if you care about my
personal life what you just want to see
me doing crazy you know then you're
gonna subscribe to it if you're looking
for code of course you're going to come
here because I'm always going to be
talking about coding and programming and
learning frameworks and write out a lot
of you know the whole shebang but yeah
man it's crazy boy we in here
man I can't wait I can't wait to
complain you don't get to relax
but we can take some time off like I'm
going to work on a new project you know
I told you guys yesterday the big
announcement which was on my lunch break
which was that I'm going to go back to
my original videos to me they're not the
most fun videos but it's still fun
because I get to help out a lot of
people more people get to comment really
more people get to subscribe because of
them so you know what that's what people
want to see so I'm going to give them
one I'm going to create too many as a
topic
because not everybody's up to that level
you know that everybody has to three
years in it and like like I feel like
also to like you know the more mid-level
and advanced developers they already
have other channels that they go like
most of my my videos show up in search
result of topics that basically they're
beginner topic you know so most of my
audience are beginning they're not you
know professionals and our work in
developers so me creating topics for
developers that are working or
developers who have like to be is or in
the field is not really beneficial is
there's really no part of you creating
those the support so I'm going to create
the rocket stack like that absolutely
maintaining optimal area a couple of
tutorials on those but on this channel
of not gonna be the focus
we got to give four people one you know
only so much that I could do I try to
put people on some cool everybody
wants to do the cool from cool all
right we're going to give you the
basement well known that maybe hopefully
you guys who grow was me and then later
on you go actually you know create some
cool content Jason who
experimenters hold selectively abnormal
all along the Pacific coast castle but
anyway when like I just really want to
low you know what
what type of the story is you guys wrong
man I'm thinking about mainly creator
like Cole creating some type of a survey
to give you guys the opportunity to or
even like the commentary a comment
section let me know what you guys really
want what type of tutorials you guys
want if something you want me to go all
the way to the beginning you know how to
build a web page or web pages with HTML
and
they're from they build apart CSS and
then build upon JavaScript if you want
that I will do it for you guys but it's
up to you guys to let me know what
exactly you guys want
and the beautiful morning
like look at that
okay my little drive my little guys to
work
I'm on the northern state right now
my job is like hauppage which is like
eggs if 46 in the daughters day
you know no sunshine it's not that much
traffic in the morning - for me which is
great because everybody usually is going
to New York City and my job is the
opposite way so I'm actually good you
know except for this asshole put the
starts to go on the fast lane and then
he's going freaking slow
 cops when I have to put it down
first
got there cops yeah
and let's get back to us welcome back to
what we
but I also been looking into this all
JavaScript library hope favor I don't
know if you guys have checked it out is
basically this is a library to create
this engine like a web development not
what the game engine right so it's a
game engine that you could do with html5
and JavaScript and it seems pretty cool
the only problem is that right now you
can't really use es6 wooded with it so
you have to use es 5 which is super
annoying because it's like I'm so used
to using es6 now that when i have to use
the S 5 I'm like oh man I gotta use this
thing there's always I guess that I was
doing some on my website on some
other company's website with jQuery and
I'm like oh man I got a text
jQuery now that jQuery is so outdated
there's certain things that you can't do
and also it's pretty annoying I'm about
to compliment this this guy
is slow as
if you're not going to go fast to the
 of the lane I disabled for for
people to go slow
so we started that I want to turn that
the left lane is the past to be able to
go fast and puzzles
i'ma see you guys later man make sure
you contain yourself make sure you
subscribe and show you like this video
man and like I always say if you want to
become a web developer you want to do
what I think to basically be able to get
a job working as ministry take the
courses that I did you know like if you
take the questions that I took at least
you know hey it works for joke and it
can work for you you know so that's what
I would say take those courses
you know Coldfield the PHP my sequel
course I have they're es6 course by
Stephen Ryder leg if you take those
courses you're going to be great there
you're going to do it you're going to
definitely do good and you're going to
learn what you need because the hardest
part about learning how to code
especially by yourself is finding the
right resource because you're constantly
going to spend more time looking for
resources then actually learn so if I'm
giving you the resources take advantage
it alright guys I'll see you in there
you guys need a mission subscribe make
sure you showing up okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
