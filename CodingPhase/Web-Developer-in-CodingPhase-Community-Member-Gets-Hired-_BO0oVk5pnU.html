viewers like you and people that support
our website coding face.com
go check it out over 20 courses in there
that's gonna guide you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro so yeah so down every man
congratulations man for you know getting
hired and yeah that's what's up I mean
what's the stack what you guys is
working on right now we're gonna be
working an angular it's some see like
c-sharp and some that stuff but mainly
I'm just gonna be focused on angular
because I don't really have much
experience in c-sharp or net plus but
they're willing to train which is really
great so but I do have a strong point in
angular like the latest version of
angular so when I went to the interview
they you know they saw that uh you know
angular skills were pretty tight so I'm
gonna have some projects on my portfolio
so I think that's one nice man I tell
people man you gotta you gotta get in
there man you gotta get you know it's
either angular react if you know one of
the tools you're gonna be good no matter
what it depends on who you are you know
if you like the angular way or you like
the react weight either way is fine
either way you're gonna be golden out
here you know what I mean so you know
see I was really a big hurry to like
well not so much in a hurry but you know
after I got more comfortable with
JavaScript it was like okay I gotta
learn a framework like I just started
off slow got the basics down of
JavaScript and then from there I just
went on I gotta learn angular I know
anglers hot or react but I just went on
an angular route because traversing
media had like this deal on udemy so I
just have to learn it that's how it is
man I'm also coming out with the top ten
udemy courses that every developer
should have for 2018 and actually the
the angular course from traversing media
is one of them
you know I I chose this course because
it's pretty simple pretty
straightforward there's not like a
whole bunch of theories I hate we're
gonna go over every single thing that
angular has is like no these are the
things that you're gonna use on your
every day for your application this
wouldn't this was gonna get you hired so
I'm really happy that you took that yes
I'll go ahead and I was gonna say uh
yeah Brad's been killing man he has like
the angler course that he made is just
really really good he's good at breaking
down things he just updated it like a
couple of months ago an angular five and
firebase is really really really good so

really really great and you as well
