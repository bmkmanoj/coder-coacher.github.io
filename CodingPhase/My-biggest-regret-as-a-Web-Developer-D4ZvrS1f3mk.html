ginger you already know steel bull joke
back at it again man coating face.com I
didn't did it again all right guys
listen man today's topic is going to be
my biggest regret as a web developer as
a program alright my biggest regret this
the only thing I regret and what I
regret is the fact that I got interested
in programming web development at the
age of 14 and then I left it alone and
never came back to it for ten years a
lot of you guys might see this and be
like man I relate to this because the
first time that I try to make a little
page a little all you know a little
change in my myspace page or or whatever
right or is anger or you know for the
old school people like me Angelfire or
those the other one geo cities on Yahoo
like for us those were the moments where
we got first introduction so introduce
introductory introduced to was
development programming in general right
so that was the first time that we got a
little taste of it and like now when I
look back on it I'm like man why did she
took me 10 years to do like I could have
been doing this a long time ago like
seriously I could have been doing this
since the age of 14 like who knows where
I would have been that right now what
level of skills that we have for
now like that's like my biggest regret
you know but what I'm thankful with them
I'm grateful about is the fact that even
though it was ten years later when I
started like started looking into it and
started learning it wasn't too late it
wasn't like you know I was like
40-something
fifty something it was okay I was 24
when I got into this so it took me a
little while but at least I got into it
you know what I mean like just could
have gone the other way I could have
just continued to him everything else
that I was doing with my life and just
wasting my time and then later on I
would have came back and trying to learn
web development but luckily I figure it
out you know at the age of 24 and I
could have been doing so much that's my
biggest regret man like right now you
imagine lean that would have been like
what almost 20 years of doing
web development like I would have been
nasty right my legs
I'm already nasty but I could have been
nasty nasty with the code man you know
so those are my biggest regrets right
there man that the fact that you know I
got interested in interesting at 14 I
could have just continued from there on
you know I didn't have no support back
then but who cares who cares nobody
supports you supposed to continue and
you just do it for yourself you know
what I mean but I was so young that I
didn't understand I was like wow man
nobody supported me my mom is
telling me to get off the computer okay
I'll leave the alone but I was
always in love with coding I always
loved the idea of opening something up
and being able to just go in there but
okay cool this how this thing works and
if I break it and take it into a million
pieces I can put it right back up
together
so I used to love doing that used to
open up the control
in the house open it up see where the
batteries would go what did I connect to
like those are little things that you
know sometimes if you know as a parent
like me now if I see my son interesting
those things I'm gonna try to help him
push him to to continue on that you know
it's like so you have a kid a kid goes
and plays basketball every single day
you kind of pick up on those things but
I okay maybe he likes to play ball maybe
I should get him inside of a team you
know what I mean like I didn't have
known that and I love my mom and I'm not
saying that I'm putting a lot of foot on
her but at the same time it's like man
you know like I hear the story of like
Mark Zuckerberg like you look at the
video way when he got accepted to harbor
like there was like you know that father
helped him out so much and I got having
the best schools uh you know bought him
a computer when he was really really
young like you know little things like
that can't really push you forward man
and like for me that's like one of my
biggest regret again I gotta say cuz you
know I could have been doing this a long
time ago like the things that I'm
learning now I learned five years ago
and the things I'm learning now I could
have been doing this you know like
 15 years ago some crazy
like that you know I mean like who knows
where I would have been building by now
you know so those are my regrets those
are the things that I tell you guys like
yo take advantage it's never too late to
learn how to code it's just about you
know being disciplined and and just
going all out you know I did this real
quick of today's web developers lunch
break when I tell everybody yeah if
you're new to the channel you know when
I have a lunch break I come out of of
work come chill and a big body bends
I just be an asshole right now
but yeah I just come to to the car chill
record a couple of videos for you guys
things that happen that at that moment
like this is something that I just got
right now like there's a thought that
came into my head and I was like man
what do I regret about what develop
marrying them and it was my biggest
regret you know it's just the fact that
I didn't continuing with this when I was
14 I should have just continued you know
as I got tell you guys to you guys come
here and you're like yeah get interested
you know so many people signed up to my
website now everybody gets to finish all
the courses not everybody gets to even
start it I've seen people who go in sign
up and don't even start a course and I'm
like wait what you came man you paid and
I know you want to support me but the
same time my channel is not for me to
just hey let's just throw money at Joe
no my channel is for you to take this as
motivation and if I can come in and
create a course for you to help you out
cool Alleluia right now if I can't I
will still tell you hey go check out
this course from some other person who's
really good right so the idea
here is for you to get into this get
motivated become a developer learn how
to program this is just the beginning
you know don't give up right away just
because you got into a problem doesn't
move that you can't figure out
everything else it's not that hard guys
