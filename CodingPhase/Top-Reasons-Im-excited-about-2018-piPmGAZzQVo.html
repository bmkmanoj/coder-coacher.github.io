job back at it again calling face.com
your boys back and I done did it again
alright guys so why am i excited about
this 2018 you guys this video is brought
to you by viewers like you and people
that support our website coding phase
com
go check it out over 20 courses in there
that's gonna guide you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro there's a lot of good things that
are happening for me 2018 this you know
I'm building my website coding phase
comm is growing every single day you
know I'm doing a lot of cool things you
know and it's just it's a good start for
the year okay I moved to Connecticut
here as you can see you know the
beautiful mountains of Connecticut you
know we live in the mountains kid but
yeah and there's a lot of cool things
happening you know like I said in my
website I'm working on starting this new
scholarship program which is gonna gift
opportunities to basically the top you
know 50 poorest countries in the world
and also any kid below the age of 18
right you could be a baby from being a
baby from one years old to seventeen
years old if you want to become a member
of my website you will be able to for
free and that's something that I feel
like it's gonna help a lot of people out
is gonna get them started that's
something that I wish I had when I was a
little kid you know when I was 14 years
old man I wanted to get into web
development you know bad I used to make
website my first website was about
Dragon Ball Z I got a mail almost a
million well half a million of viewers
per month you know unique viewers it
wasn't like hey is there's a few people
half a million unique viewers on my
website and pretty much I didn't have to
support I didn't have nobody to help me
out I didn't have nobody to teach me
what develop madding have the resources
that a lot of people have now especially
you know with my website we're Garen
for free for people who are you know
kids aren't kids and and people who are
in the poorest countries in the world
right people who I know cannot afford
you know $10 a month $20 a month $15 all
right they can't afford it so it's like
for me it's like I'm giving back to the
world you know hopefully God comes in
and sprinkles a little something on top
of me you know a little sauce but we do
it just because it's like hey when you
do good things good things happen to you
you get what I'm saying so that's that's
my motto
that's how I feel about certain things
but yeah and I'm also working on you
know learning new things out there I
also want to focus more on building
phone applications that's something that
I've been trying to do you know for the
past five six years I've been like
straight focus on what development but
now I say you know what I already know
all this stuff and that's what I'm
teaching it but at the same time I'm not
being challenged right so I want to
start working either getting more into
software development or applications
development so that's what I'm entering
right that's what's getting me excited
that's what's getting me motivate to
continue and I know a lot of people
constantly tell me Joe how do you keep
on you know staying motivated how do you
continue doing this everything guys I
love it I mean that's how simple it is
man I love it I have fun with it and at
the same time once I feel like I already
mastered something I pretty much jump to
the next thing where I feel I'm gonna be
challenged okay so that's where I'm at
right now at the same time you know I'm
here with my family I'm here with my kid
you know my baby is growing up every
single day you know a little eating is
basically walking around already he's
seven months old like you knows all
little things that you know it takes to
the heart you say hey man this is my
motivation for 2018 you got what I'm
saying
also at the same time I have a couple of
businesses that
have a line that are doing pretty well
so I want to focus on those things I
want to be able to scale it you know
like I say you know I'm not looking to
become a millionaire
I just want to become respected
successful in a way where people will
say hey man you know that kid he did it
by himself he did it you know we're not
so poor he did it online
he learned online you know I'm not
saying like anything that I do any type
of accomplishment this pretty much it is
an accomplishment for everybody who DIYs
right do it yourself right you know a
lot of people say hey you gotta go to
college for this you got to do this in
that and it's like a lot of times the
most successful people never even went
to college now that's something that
they don't tell you in school they don't
be like hey man you know the most
successful people in the world don't
even have a college degree the most
successful people in the world pretty
much just work hard and you know they
have ideas and I come up and they
execute it and if you execute your ideas
you're gonna be fine you get what I'm
saying if you don't put limits to
yourself you're going to be fine so
those are things that not a lot of
people tell you about so I feel like I
want to be like the face of that you
know what I mean I want to be the face
of like the the cool kids who was like
everybody was like didn't believe on and
it somehow at the end of the day at the
end of their lives they became
successful you know that's what that's
what motivates me you know what I mean
so 2018 for me is just gonna be me
working hard 2018 is gonna be me just
like creating new ideas and businesses I
told you guys one of my what I consider
my mentors or people that motivated me
was Johnny FD
levels that I owe guys who came in and
of course they do different things like
level style he's a web developer but
Johnny ft he does like drop shipping and
stuff like that and he's successful in
that world he travels all over the world
from Thailand to freakin Ireland to
Spain but he's all over the world right
now that used to be my dream that I was
like one of my dreams I was like man I
want to be able to travel the world man
I want to do this in that now with a kid
with a family like am I gonna be able to
do that I don't know but I'm gonna make
it happen right at least until before
the baby gets to you know gets to the
age where he has to go to school so
that's one of my plans I want to go to
the ER for like a month or two you know
just go to the are just for the hell of
it you know stay like an air being
beautiful like a month or two and just
lift the lifestyle like hey I'm living
right in front of the pool right in
front of the beach like you know it's
like comfortable I want to just say hey
I did it you know what I mean hey I
couldn't travel the world if I wanted to
that's all I really need you know I mean
like if it happens it happens if it
doesn't it doesn't but I want to be able
to have those opportunities and give
those opportunities to myself you got
I'm not saying so that's where I'm at
don't want my motivations you know for
2018 like I said you know this whole new
Johnny a scholarship that I'm basically
coming out is something else that it's
gonna motivate me a lot because it's
gonna help me to continue building more
amazing courses for everybody because
I'm gonna have so many new members that
is like holding me accountable to
continue dropping you know constant
constant content you know so yeah I have
all of you guys here and I have a lot of
paying subscribers and I you know are
really appreciating it guys I really do
appreciate it you know it really helps
out you know because sometimes like it's
like I always tell people is like I will
do all of the stuff completely for free
if the world worked a little bit
different you know what I'm saying but
it's like how can you tell your wife I
could tell your kid like hey man I'm
gonna spend 12 hours a day in front of a
computer and then there's nothing to
show for at least I get to show them and
be like hey this is why I'm in front of
a computer 24/7 either teaching to
people or either learning or you know
showing them something as I hear
monetary things like here here it goes
like there's the reason why we do it
right so for all the pain subscribers it
just helps out great it actually makes
my life easier because it gives me an
excuse to actually do this right so yeah
anyways guys this is a boy joke back at

top reasons you know why I'm excited
