jump back at it again man listen
alright : face calm man make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man because your boy is back
listen
alright so we gotta talk about you know
AB blockers and pretty much not
supporting you know the creators right
I'm gonna tell you this little quick
story right about me right when I use
YouTube right I use it for what it's for
right in the sense of hey if I'm gonna
listen to music I'll listen to music and
go search for whatever you know a little
be the base card or I Chloe in search of
ugly god or I'll go in search of rich
the kid you know I'll go on search for
this artists right and then when the
commercials come in I just gotta go on
I'm like whatever like I'm not paying
for this music so why would I go
in yourself a blocker and block you know
the odds and basically that artists can
get paid you know so it's the same thing
as a as a creator right when somebody
comes to somebody's YouTube channel and
they watch all their videos but the same
time when a commercial comes in they
just skip to every single one skip that
means you're pretty much saying you
Ranger to the Creator right I don't have
no problem with that because it's a free
country you could do whatever you want
but at the same time is like sometimes
we have to support our artists sometimes
we have to support our content creators
and pretty much as I hate don't use
adblock because it's not helping them
and it's not gonna help you guys either
like you know like give my channel for
example that got sold you guys already
you know I give 25% straight away so
pretty much out of the whole pie of the
channel you know Google gets half
I get half of it and then from that half
automatically it gets cut and then it
says okay from my half my 50% imagine
now that 50% I say hey now this is just
a hundred percent and then from there I
say okay
25% is for taxes 25% is for you guys you
tools or viewers you know give you guys
free stuff and then 50% is automatically
for me to buy a new equipment new camera
pay a editor pay you know like in
reality I might leave out of here with
25% of the whole you know earnings pie
right so when somebody comes in it has
an ad blocker or it comes in and you
know skips through the ads every single
one of them like you're not helping me
you're not helping yourself you're
basically just saying you to the
Creator and it's a free country you
could do whatever hell you want but at
the same time just know that that's how
people get paid you know I'm not looking
to become like a super youtuber at all
all I really want is just to be able to
have just enough so basically I could
say hey I want to go to Africa and start
teaching over there what the ran away I
want to go back to Dominican Republic
which is a poor country and be able to
teach web development over there I want
to go to Columbia teach what the felony
I want to go to Mexico teach web
development I want to go to Philippines
teach web development I want to go to
India teach what development like go to
the Ukraine go to Lithuania Poland go
teach what development right and that's
all I really want out of this channel I
want to be able to help you guys are
watching me you know become what you
want to be in this world and get out of
that job get out of dishwashing
get out of retail nobody wants to be
working in retail forever get out of
that office job that you hate
it stop being a mechanic
stop being a taxi driver like there's so
many people out here that they want to
get out of there their careers not even
career as their boasted jobs and I feel
like what development can't help you
guys achieve that this is not about hey
ten easy ways of getting rich this is
not about that this is about just having
a a certain quality of life be able to
 make enough money to you know
survive in his world not only survive
but be living comfortably you know I
feel what development who actually gives
you guys that so that's why I created
this channel you know so I mean why am I
going into this long rant and talking
about ad blockers in this and that well
I just want to say like guys if you have
an ID blocker like you know if you're
blocking the ads or never watch
any ads on this channel like you do
understand that what you're doing is not
helping nobody out
yeah not helping me and I help in to
other people that I'm trying to help so
it's like you know it's a big you
to everybody that's what you're
basically doing and I know it's not
everybody that does that here because I
do understand that but at the same time
it's like there's a small percentage of
people who are doing it and I'm like oh
man like people just don't know like you
know the time and effort that it takes
for me to come here there's days I just
want to relax like right now I just
wanna you know chill relax play some
Xbox one bust some ass on 2k that's what
I want to do right now because the whole
week I've been coding the whole week and
now I'm gonna spend my weekend basically
editing videos making videos for you
guys for the rest of the week and I
think it's very important that people
know you know how much it takes to
actually do this you imagine like this
imagine when you watch a show on TV like
Dancing with the Stars you say all these
people all they do is just go in there
and just dance and
a to the Lord cha-cha doing this and
that but the reality of things is that
people this whole big team of people
that's actually working in those those
shows so everybody got to feed their
family so imagine right now if everybody
would be like hey whenever the
commercials come in we're not gonna
watch no commercials at all and then
that's when you know people start seeing
hey the ratings drop soon as the
commercials came in so what happens now
now that basically the commercial you
know commercial the companies are not
gonna invest into those shows no more so
what happens those shows get cancelled
and you know that's just the same thing
as here you too you know if you don't
support your art as your content
creators like who's gonna support them
you know I mean and for me like I'm not
here to become a millionaire night to
make a whole bunch of money I'm just
dead ass I just want to be able to at
one point be able to teach what
development to other people that's it
and I want to be able to still continue
giving you guys that 25% of my earnings
and just give it back to you guys now
imagine this this hypothetical right
let's say an example if I was to make I
don't know if I was to make 200 300
thousand dollars a year how much is that
how much is 25% that's like let's say
200,000 right let's just start you know
be able to give you guys $50,000 worth
of things free courses free laptops be
able to go meet up with you guys have
like a group I don't know a group meetup
where I can say hey 25 of like the most
active you know viewers here hey let's
take a trip to Thailand and
let's go meet up and let's do a retreat
and just like pretty much hang out be
able to you know create something great
like those are the ideas that I have
right now I don't have that type of
money
my granddad I have money you know so be
able to pay my rent keep a roof over
my take care of my family taking a baby
that's on the way but that's about it
but this was more that I wanted to do
for you guys you know what I mean the
only way that we get to do that is by
supporting each other support me and
I'll support you guys all right you
already know it's your boy job back at
it again make sure you check out coding
phase comm which brings you back to the
YouTube channel because that's what we
do yeah subscribe make sure you like
this video man if you want to support
