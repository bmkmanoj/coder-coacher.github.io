back again
aye man we already know coding face man
we still gonna continue building this
Netflix app man don't get tired I know
the last videos were too long I
understand that but trust me this how
you're gonna learn man you're gonna see
a couple of mistakes you're gonna see a
couple of things you know that happens
but that's how you actually do learn
trust me if I did those mistakes you're
gonna do it too and you know that's
normal
nothing wrong with that but listen okay
so let's get back so you know let's get
back to the point now basically we're
gonna create this this background image
right you know for the moment we're
gonna take any image I already went on
on the internet from this one pretty
cool you know poster of the Batman all
right so we come in here we go copy copy
the URL and we see hey if we wanted to
build you know the page with a regular
image and show as a regular image we
will do it like this will say image
source which is SRC and that equals the
URL of you know where the image is at
where's the address and you will say
okay give me that and then the image
will show up here but this is actually
too big all right this is humongous this
is actually out of control right now
so what I will do is I will go online
okay I want to create this to be the
background so you create you know you're
going you search fullscreen background
image yes okay cool let me see what they
have see what other people have done
you know Phil's entire page with image
no white space that's sort of what we
want so we'll say okay let's copy this
this code and say okay let's put it here
we actually don't want this image here
as an image because you see what's the
problem here
this thing is is humongous we want to
have more control of it so for us to
have more control we'll say okay let's
put this inside of the large image image
section right which is this it's out of
this diff so let's put inside that idea
of large image and let's paste it here
copy the URL copy it which is command C
and then you put in the URL inside of it
okay it's in the background let's remove
this image from here actually looks see
right now that's all we getting right
now for the moment all right well at
least now you see how to create how to
put the images in the background right
so right now at the moment this thing is
centered so we actually want to see
Batman first so we'll say here put this
to the left and then this what this
means is it's centered vertically so
it's showing you whatever is in the
middle of you know of the image but
vertically so this is horizontal and
this is vertical and what doesn't seem
this is fixed so there's a fixed size so
no matter where you go it's always gonna
be in the same spot it's gonna be stuck
right so what you do is okay that's
right let's see what happens see now we
can see Batman right technically you
have to pick the images like that you
see a full screen you get to see
everybody right well at least for the
moment we want
Batman right now let's say let's come
here and let's give some space to this
let's go to the large image and put some
space and say padding there's another
trick about patty like let's say formula
to say I want 200 pixels on top and 200
pixels on bottom I will put it there 200
pixels and then if I wanted to say I
want 50 pixels matter of fact let's keep
it the same that's here 25 pixels to the
left for 25 pixels to the right what I
would do is I would say ok 25 pixels so
this right here gives me a padding where
now all of this is in the same place you
see that and now we actually centered
vertically the the text because we're
saying okay give me 200 pixels here and
give me 200 pixels here so now the text
is actually in the middle you see that
we almost get it there
we gotta make something similar to this
not exactly the same which we could
actually do exactly the same if we had
every single image and if we wanted to
you know go all out but right now what's
important it's about what you're
actually learning it's not really how
it's gonna look if you want exactly like
Netflix we're gonna take the styles of
Netflix the type way of how they created
it and make our wall away so I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
