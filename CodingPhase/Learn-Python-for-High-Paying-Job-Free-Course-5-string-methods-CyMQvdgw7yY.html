about building string methods okay so
this is website called Python that's
reference that read the docs that I oh
it's pretty good you get to find all the
information about Python
I mean Python has its own official
documentation but this one's pretty good
it's pretty legit okay so what we're
gonna do is we're gonna start here we're
gonna basically find the fundamental
datatypes okay so you're gonna click
there and as you can see on sequence we
have STR which means string characters
so we're gonna click here and you're
gonna find a whole bunch of built-in
methods that we can use with strings
okay so we're gonna find let's say the
simplest one upper okay so what this
does is basically it creates a new
string for uppercase okay so let's say
for example we come here and we say say
title okay we're gonna put in title and
you say title equals to Star Wars
episode 3 which is actually my favorite
Star Wars of all time all right so now
we run this see nothing happens but if
we want to print it we say print title
alright we'll see it says Star Wars
Episode three okay now if we want to
make this uppercase all we have to do is
do exactly how we have here so we say
dot on the string right so we have to
string itself and then we come here we
say dot upper and then we basically call
the function okay so now what that does
is it returns back a new string but it's
all uppercase okay now you could come
here and look at other ones like lower
capitalize you can swap case click on
count and we're gonna find out like
let's say how many characters are inside
of this string so let's say for example
I want to know how many A's are actually
inside of this string itself so we gotta
come here and we're gonna put in eight
okay so as you can see it says hey
there's only two of them so in Star Wars
Episode three there's only one and two
so it basically returns back to us the
number two
so title now is actually equal to two
instead of the string itself is actually
just returning how many characters are
inside of this strength as far as like
the letter eight right so next thing
that we want come in here is basically
saying something like this let's say
format right so format is something that
you're gonna use all the time okay so
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna put in
over here a new variable called episode
alright and then I'm gonna say episode
three and I'm going to say title
title is equal to Star Wars all right
and then now what I'm going to do is
basically reassign title but it's going
to be formatted ok so I'm gonna come
here and say format and I'm going to say
for now I'm just gonna put X&amp;amp;Y ok so I'm
gonna say format x equals 2x equal to
title alright and then we're gonna say y
equals 2
why equals 2 episode sorry okay so we're
gonna do that and then now this is very
similar to es6 alright so what we're
going to do is we're gonna come here put
curly brackets and then say Y and then
here we're gonna put curly brackets and
put X okay so what this is doing this is
basically replacing where X is located
at replacing it with the title okay and
then where Y is located at is replacing
it with basically the episode alright so
if I run this says Star Wars Episode
three when I print title now if I was to
come here say Episode four they come see
here runs it says Star Wars Episode four
you get what I'm saying so this is very
useful for a lot of situations okay you
know we could come here and let's say
for a time what you might say something
like this you might go I'm gonna create
a variable and I'm gonna say name right
and then I say input and then what is
your name okay now we could come here
say age we're gonna say input what well
how old are you okay and we're gonna say
City equals two input we're
was he born okay so now we're gonna come
in and create a full string using this
different variables but now we're using
format okay so I'm doing this so you
understand by how powerful this is and
when will you use it okay so now we're
gonna say something like this print all
right I'm gonna say print and here we're
going to take a string we're gonna say
string this user is let's say the H so
here we gonna come here and put in H all
right so I'm gonna say this user H is
whatever 30 years old and his name is
let's say his name is name okay and then
after we do that we're gonna say also he
was born and then right here we put in
city okay and then now we come here and
we say format all right so now you say
format and we say name equals to name K
H equals the age
and then City is equal to city all right
now we come here we run this see what it
says what is he named Joe how old are
you 30
where was he born mocha
this user is 30 and his name is Joe also
he was born in mocha you get what I'm
saying like it's pretty simple pretty
easy and like it's very useful now let's
talk about concatenation and multiple
concatenation okay so we're gonna come
here delete this and we're going to
create a string so we're gonna say
something like name okay you're gonna
say name or F name alright I'm gonna say
Joe alright and then we're gonna come
here and we're gonna say el name okay
I'm gonna say like this Santos Garcia
now if we wanted to put this into one
full name we say full name one thing
that you're gonna notice a lot of people
in Python instead of doing camel case
they do a snake case which is you put in
the first the first word and then you
come in and you put an underscore and
then the other word okay so what we're
gonna do is here we're gonna basically
merge both of the strings together so
we're gonna say F name plus L name and
then we're going to print this out we're
gonna say print full name alright
we run this says Joe Santos Garcia and
as you can see it is just adding them
together alright so if we want to give
it a space best way to do is where it
says F name we give it a space right
there come here and say Joe Santos
Garcia as the guys can see now another
thing that I'm gonna show you guys is
what happens when you multiply a string
okay so I'm going to delete this here
and I'm going to take a number so I'm
gonna say number all right and I'm gonna
say number is a string of the number
three okay and then what I'm going to do
here is I'm gonna say new number okay
I'm gonna say new number equals two
number times four okay and we're going
to come here and we're gonna print out
the new number okay now let's see what
happens
it basically multiplies it four times it
says three three three three right in
JavaScript if you've used JavaScript
before it's very annoying because
strings are pretty much like the same
thing as numbers right like you could
literally multiply the string of three
with the number of four and
automatically it will tell you hey this
is 12 but it's like hey man this is a
string and this is an integer so it's
like what are you talking about okay so
in Python thank God we don't have to
deal with that Python is actually like a
real programming language like they
actually know what they were doing so
that's why a lot of people like it now
instead of putting the number here we're
gonna get it from the user so we're
gonna say input right and then say
what's your number okay I'm gonna do
that and we're gonna run this I'm gonna
say what's your number and I'm going to
put in the number for and then
automatically it goes 4 4 4 4 but what
happens if you really wanted this to be
a number you wanted to multiply with for
another number it's like right now
you're like wait I don't want this to be
a string I want this to be a number very
simple you could come here and literally
take this number right so the number
variable you could say int all right
go like this
and this was your number we say four and
it automatically it basically converts
that string of number it converts it to
a real number which is an integer okay
so now when you do a multiplication and
actually multiplies four times four okay
instead of saying hey this is a string
and I'm multiplying it four times so I'm
just repeating it four times what it
does is says hey I'm gonna convert this
into a number and then from there I'm
gonna say now I'm multiplying both of
these numbers okay so there's a lot of
cool stuff that you can find here with
you know over here in this area of like
the documentation whereas like strings
there's a lot of cool stuff that you can
see lowercase capital I swap case play
replace finding the index let me see
there's a couple of little things in
here alright so anyways I'm gonna see
you guys later
and yeah let's keep on moving</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
