that you're about to see now just make
sure that you subscribe and click on the
little bell because that's the only way
to get notifications if someone is
comfortable with vanilla JavaScript
would you recommend that beginner to
learning read will you recommend that
beginners to learn react or PHP in
Arabic course so we'll have a better
shot becoming junior developers yes so
basically the question is let me sum it
down and put him on simple terms if I'm
a beginner right if I'm a junior
developer would I recommend someone to
say hey focus on learning react and
focus on PHP larva yes that's exactly
what I've been saying for the past year
I've been here on YouTube for one whole
year right and I've been explaining to
people all the time like hey you gotta
choose either angular react or like
let's say something like PHP laravel
WordPress like you got a 2-0 you're lame
right trying to master everything trying
to jump on every single framework trying
to do everything that's out there it's
not gonna help you find a job what is
gonna do is gonna make you constantly be
worrying about
oh what's the latest thing what should I
learn you know you could spend a whole
year you know looking into what's the
best thing to do right trust me take it
from me I could have probably started
working I don't know two three months in
and I didn't start working until like a
year I spent a whole year trying to
learn everything from backbone so
angular to ember to I learned no GS
learned a little bit of PHP at first I
was learning Ruby on Rails and then
because everybody was like learn no js'
at the time and it's like Ruby is dying
I was like okay I might jump to no js'
so those are the mistakes that I made
right when I tell you guys something is
because of my own mistakes don't do the
mistakes that I did
you know what I mean like if I give you
an advice is for a reason
I've already been down this path as a
you know as a self-taught developer
somebody who's learning online learning
on on udemy learning on a coke atom it's
in treehouse free code camp the whole
shebang the whole list Pluralsight I've
been through every single website right
the things that you gotta focus on are
the things that is gonna get you a job
right away you know sometimes you might
play around with a like a new technology
or new framework just to play around
right but that's not your main focus
that's like something that you're doing
your off time like oh yeah cool let's go
check out Elm or oh cool let's go check
out elixir oh let's go check out golang
but let's be honest you're not gonna go
get that elixir job as a junior
developer you're not gonna go get that
gold leg job as a junior developer that
never worked at a company like those
companies are not gonna trust you the
ones that are gonna trust you are you
know you'll be coming either front-end
developer is known HTML CSS and
JavaScript right and knowing at least
one framework either react or angular
everything else is irrelevant to be
honest with you all right every other
framework out there is irrelevant
there's really no need for you to learn
it right even though I told you to learn
um how you call it hyper app but hyper
app is is almost related to react and
redux so it's almost like learning the
same thing so that's the main reason why
it's all you guys to learn it right now
um as far as like the PHP backs you know
back in like you want to learn something
like PHP laravel you want to learn the
latest PHP PHP 7 you want to be able to
come in and say hey I know at least one
database right and most likely it has to
be my sequel you know a lot of times
people sprang a lot of you know a lot of
their time you know trying to learn
MongoDB and then they end up never
working at a company that uses MongoDB
right like you gotta understand like
what's in your area what are the type of
companies that are around you like let's
say if you live in San Francisco you
live in New York City
most likely at some point you're gonna
have to use
to be if you live in Detroit you live in
and I don't know
in Iowa somewhere if you live in
Mississippi most likely you're not using
MongoDB right so that's one of the
things that I always tell people like do
little research in your area find out
what the jobs have what exactly is it
that they're hiring for and yeah man
make sure you get in there okay guys
this video is brought to you by viewers
like you
and people that support our website
coding phase com
go check it out over 20 courses in there
that's gonna guide you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
