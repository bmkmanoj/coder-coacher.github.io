job back at it again man calling
face.com
your boys back guys I'm just having fun
alright so I just finished working on
you know the JavaScript future pew a
future-proof Java screech approved
JavaScript alright alright so that's
what we just finished working on future
proof JavaScript and basically we got
little all the basic stuff basically got
the basic stuff right and now we're
about to jump on the projects so I was
just wondering what type of projects I
need four to five projects they are
simple and it's not too huge right
they're not gonna be like projects
they're gonna take freakin five hours
each I'm talking about projects that
people can use on day one of just
learning JavaScript right and I want to
see what people tell me here right what
type of projects you would like to see
as a brand new developer right and
you're like okay I want to practice
JavaScript you know vanilla JavaScript
raw JavaScript what projects you think
will be good me personally I was
thinking about creating like I don't
know creating like a quick game to
practice JavaScript you know so I was
thinking about doing something like that
ago little quick game that you press a
button and then a ball will go and you
know go to the other side depending on
the math that you put in or whatever
numbers you put in then if it goes in
then you get a point something like that
I don't know I'm writing shit down I'm
writing down ideas and that's why now
I'm like I'm coming to you guys because
I don't want to create some dumb
projects that nobody's gonna get
anything out of it so any ideas that you
guys might say hey I think this will be
a great prize
for the JavaScript crown JavaScript
class something that you would like to
see done without no framework without no
jQuery just raw JavaScript all right so
I actually want to see what you guys
what you guys think yes no beer the beer
is gone
I left a beer beat behind me and you
look clean look don't worry all right
yeah my girls things like I look like a
whole complete different person without
a beard and it's like you might be right
MA
you know what I mean but it's fine man
this shit grows in like a date now
you're gonna see by tomorrow you're
gonna see this shit already Wolfen it's
annoying but yeah man let me know what
type of projects you guys think will be
good I need five projects I was thinking
of a game and then I was thinking about
you know something like let's say
something simple like creating a moto
right maybe creating a slider I don't
know maybe creating like some type of
gallery that you click on a photo the
photo pops up you know there's certain
animations on the on the modal itself I
don't know I guess the icon move or
something like that or maybe creating
like a notification bar where it'll pop
up from the top and basically I'll go
green after you click OK and then come
back up so I don't know what type of
projects you think will be good
something that connects to a rest api
well that's the thing
I don't think connecting to a rest api
it's a good project for beginners right
because not only do you have to teach
them
the basics of JavaScript but then from
there you have to teach them what a REST
API is then you will have to explain to
them what Ajax is like you can't put
that into one course unless you're gonna
make it into like a 20 40 hour course
and that's not what I want to do I want
to make it where this future proof is
just basically teaching them all that
they need from JavaScript to start
building things not you know creating
this full application in JavaScript
because it could get very deep that's
not what I want to do with this course
because I wanna I'm gonna teach all of
those things well I want to break them
down into sections you know like I wanna
have for a course we're just dealing
with REST API is I want to deal with you
know like CSS animations like I don't
want to put everything jam everything in
into one course because it just gets
overwhelming because then you're like oh
my god it's so much to fucking learn you
haven't even master one thing and then
now you're jumping into something
completely different you know so that's
why a REST API I don't know if I'm gonna
put that let me see oh sorry I haven't
gone on on this cord
I've been busy today I've been just like
recording videos man knocking things out
you know
also to writing down the discussions of
the courses or talking to one of my
partners who is basically helping me out
to promote this so talking to him we
planning a big roll out in the next few
days through our udemy and Skillshare
calm I'm talking to the guys from
Pluralsight but they're telling me they
want to if if I put courses on
Pluralsight it has to be just that
course
Pluralsight I can't have my course in
other places and I'm like what
nah if I want to put something floor
aside then I'll create a course just for
Pluralsight but whatever I think they're
models stupid you know because it's like
if it's my content I want to sell it on
your on your platform who cares if I
have been on udemy who cares if I have a
skill share what they want is exclusives
I'm like now you gotta pay me for some
shit like that let me see a magic 8 ball
game I'll be good
they'll be good I'm thinking about that
jello can you do Ruby on Rails after
JavaScript I'm gonna do after JavaScript
we jump into Lera go directly to laravel
that's what we jump into now for
somebody who's interested in Ruby on
Rails I would say laravel is almost the
exact same shit the only difference is
in PHP like if you know Ruby already you
could literally translate like what you
do on PHP to to Ruby on Rails so you
know what I mean something similar to
scratch yes exactly that's what I'm
doing damn busy ran you pretty much like
you you said exactly what I are
basically said in one of the videos so
right now I'm uploading a video call
before jump into the Dom right and
before jump into the Dom I explain to
people how big and how big the DOM is
right the Dom if you guys go into the
console log right now and you got the
console that log parentheses and you put
in no console dr. dir and then
parentheses document if you put that in
there on the YouTube page
you will see all the elements there now
you're gonna see that every element has
like 50 60 different properties inside
of it in different that you have the
child's whatever was inside of that
element you know and it keeps on
repeating and repeating repeating
there's so much things about the Dom
that in reality you don't need to know
all right
so I want to focus on just 80 percent
other things that you use every single
day because there's going to be 20% of
things of JavaScript that you you
weren't using at all you won't need it
until like a year two years from now so
there's really no point for somebody
who's a beginner to try to learn
everything under the Sun when in reality
all you need to know is the things that
you're gonna be working on now you know
what I mean so busy red you basically
you read my mind that's exactly what I
said on a video I was like yo you're
only I'm teaching you guys you know I
actually said 89% any 9% of the things
from JavaScript and then there's a 10%
that I'm not teaching it because those
things you don't need to know it until
later on when things are more advanced
and then I'm gonna create another course
which is gonna be advanced JavaScript
you know it's I don't want to overwhelm
people because when you start looking at
different courses you're like man
there's so much to learn there's so much
shit that I got a dual it gets
overwhelming guys trust me like some of
you guys who already been doing this for
a while yeah be like oh no this is easy
but if I'm coming from zero and I come
in and I'll be like hey I gotta learn
the syntax I gotta learn how to think of
of creating something as a programmer
then from there I gotta learn rest then
from there I gotta learn Ajax then from
there I gotta learn you know get put
post patch request like there's so much
shit in what development that you just
can't learn it in one shot those things
you you
as you need it you know so that's what
I'm saying so that's why I'm like I'm
taking it one step at a time
because I don't want nobody to be
overwhelmed I know some of the some of
you guys are gonna be like oh man I
already know this stuff but I keep
getting emails from people who actually
signed up to the website called in
phrase calm and they keep telling me I'm
loving the course I'm loving what you're
doing here you're making it simple
you're making it in a way where I can
understand it so that's what I'm doing
you know what I mean I'm doing it for
those guys
now everybody who's who's more on an
advanced level or intermediate give me
some time give me some time probably by
the end of the month next month probably
end of August you're gonna see all the
advanced stuff you know you're gonna see
like things that you're more interested
on but at least you can come you know
you can follow all the courses cuz every
single course is related to another
course you know like the course that the
JavaScript now we're basically gonna be
relating it to what we did in the HTML
CSS so if you didn't do the HTML CSS and
you say okay I already know this I'm
skipping it basically the project that
I'm doing for the JavaScript is related
to the HTML CSS so you're gonna get the
like you're gonna get the the final
project you know in a zip file from the
HTML CSS so you don't have to you know
recode everything but it would be nice
if you follow through with the beginning
so like that by the time you get to the
end of the JavaScript you oh yeah so all
this stuff makes sense you know what I
mean there are some people who are
actually going through the whole process
and they're getting something out of it
you know so that's what we're doing
right now okay I see I think is very
useful to learn how to use forms in
JavaScript yes that's one thing too I
was you know what I'm gonna make a list
let's make a list rana of the projects
listening to what you guys tell me RN
web DK said forms right so that's one
project right we have forms now let's do
eight ball a ball game right now let's
see what's another one you guys let me
know which other one should I do
let me see Roger yes basic jeaious
banana GS is the same thing it's just I
like singing raw sounds raw you know
what me vanilla sounds like super Alice
super like that raw sound like some
Russian you know sounds like we're
character bring back the beer the beers
coming back give it a day
today is Sunday by Wednesday the beer
will be back they'll start getting crazy
once again you know it's just weird a
summer right now so it's like I gotta I
gotta let this brief you know I was
starting taking a suntan everywhere else
and my beer was starting to get white I
said you know what let me bring this out
let this out you know what I mean like
but yeah Barbara I gotcha
let me see what else I'm reading
everybody's thing JSON is not for
beginners yeah I would say JSON is is
between beginners and mid-level you know
it's in between and there's like other
stuff that you could do like this
intermediate like local local storage
sessions like you can't put all the
little stuff into a basic JavaScript
course there's no way if you put some
like Auto intermediate and you're like
advanced stuff of JavaScript like people
get scared people would be like I don't
want to learn this shit cuz there's a
lot you gotta give it to them like small
bites like okay here take a little bite
as this and then you master that then
take a bite of this then you come out
and over here with the full plain but I
oh look what you ate you ate the whole
place you know you can't just come in
and give a full plate of shit you gotta
give
little bites you know what I mean but
yeah cuz JavaScript you know even now
like I'm going over shit and I'm like
man did I know a lot like I was thinking
about I was like I was like doing some
JavaScript video today and I'm like I
started doing advanced shit and I'm like
wait I can't do this event shit on a
beginner's fucking course like I got a
dumb it down for a second so I was like
okay how would I learn this you know
fighting no nothing what would be the
easiest way you know that's one of the
things I think that makes me a little
bit different than everybody else's
courses or whatever tutorials because
people automatically think that people
know the basic stuff now oh yeah why
would I write a function you know why
would I write an if statement if I could
just do in one line and then somebody
who's a beginner would be like wait what
the hell just happened here a
parenthesis then a a question mark then
some value and then a freaking a colon
and then another value what the hell
just happened you know so it's like you
got a dumb it down it's like it's better
to actually just write everything down
for the person so they could see you
know what's going on and they could
learn it the case is too much man
let me see word the
save Joe listen man I got many fucking
skins man you know what I mean like when
you choose when you choose a different
characters from Joe you you be like you
know you're like oh man Krishan l1 l2
right then you come in you press select
select start and then you press x
squared comes in Joe comes in like this
unlocked and then you come out you get
you get the fucking shave beard Joe then
you get the pissed-off Joe on a rat fuck
oh no
then which other versions do you get
from me you get the web developers lunch
break John this all my versions you know
I have like matte versions of myself
when it comes to this YouTube shame like
if yeah if you guys don't catch it in
almost every video I do something that's
funny under low only a few people catch
it so you gotta watch the comments
people always catch it at the end but
you won't see it until later on you know
well I always drop it like a little sign
hello Jim where people will be like
y'all this kid is crazy I'm missing of
course you need JSON to know ajax of
course i missing
come and let me see what else
Joe there's always one in the family in
caseous hours or wear it man
we passing Casey around like that shit
it's a coffee a cup of coffee like yeah
you want some Casey put some sugar on it
it's a little sweet
I see who else is in here man yeah man
so what else tell me another we got two
projects right now guys cuz I'm gonna
leave pretty soon cuz I've been on this
shit since like 10 o'clock in the
morning today is 6 o'clock I need to get
off the computer already cuz tomorrow
I'll go back to work and I gotta fucking
go back to work you know that's how the
bills get paid people think like people
think I'm over here again becoming a
millionaire from the internet and it's
like nah man the bills gotta get paid
bro ranked I do this shit for fun and to
help people out you know what I mean so
yeah so we got two two examples right we
got the firm's we got a eight ball game
like a magic ball game right and we need
three three more too many more projects
for JavaScript that we should do just
raw JavaScript let me know
yo for room not us that's great man I'm
glad you know you're not the only one
that has told me that that like they
showed my my videos to other people
like in their family and then I assume
like I like this guy or I like what he's
saying or you know they could relate to
something for minds I mean you're not
the first person there's a couple of
people that have told me like yo my mom
loves you my sister loves you
my wife he's always asking me when am I
gonna go watch Joe when is Joe gonna go
live listen that's the idea behind this
I didn't I didn't want to make a boring
channel I wanted to make about coding
and show people how approachable this
shit can be like anybody could do this
right and at the same time just make it
fun now let you get bored you know so
and I want to drop content every single
day for you guys so you guys don't you
know sometimes you lose motivation
sometimes you lose that that extra that
little earth of like hangman I'm gonna
continue coding right but at least if I
continue you'll be like oh man Joe's
here every day he's doing this shit and
yeah I know I called every single day on
my own so at least I wanna you know
motivate people to continue doing this
shit so even like now I got a couple I
got a couple of girls who hit me up
they're like yo we saw your video from
the unicorn girls are girls with code
are you are unicorns right and they're
like yo we loved your video
I showed it to my friends now they watch
your channel like I have a lot of girls
who are coming into this because I help
help them out to stay motivated and show
them I hate you could do this too
and it's the same thing for everybody
else like I know if just regular people
people who are not even interested in -
what - that I mean they back oh they
bump into my channel thinking about oh
cool maybe I should get into this
alright so that's the idea behind it
let me see your Barbara Samia emailed
with discord I lost it send me an email
I need that coding face at gmail.com go
ahead and throw in that advanced stuff
be different it's not about being
different it's about thinking of like
somebody who doesn't know JavaScript
like for you and me we might know
something already about web development
listen so somebody who's like I want to
do this but I have no idea or somebody
who's been doing JavaScript like not
saying free cocaine coke Adam II team
treehouse and they still don't get it
and they come to my my website I want
them to be able to get it you know what
I mean I don't want them to go through
the whole process I'm gonna oh shit like
nobody explained it to me like this you
know what I mean so that's what I'm
doing there Joe quit his job not yet not
yet give me a little time man I'm
preparing myself you know it's not gonna
be like I quit it's just gonna be like
more like you know a respectful way of
like hey guys thanks for the opportunity
I love to hear love working with you
guys for a year two years whatever it is
and then from there move on to the next
chapter of my life which is I want to do
this shift like full-time like I'll be
honest the goal in what I told people
right now we got like 700 something
people that signed up to the website
right the goal is 10,000 10% I could say
I'm 10% there to the goal right the goal
is 10,000 now I know I can do more than
that but the goal is to have 10,000
users active users not just people who
sign up once and never come back is to
have 10,000 active users on the website
right and how much is that 10,000
times you know when you put it in let's
say 327 10 dots hold on I'll do the math
for you guys 10,000 times 3.27 okay
that's a little bit too much I don't
think that I'm doing the wrong 10,000
Vizio look cuz then that that would be
too crazy ten thousand times 3.2 fuck is
wrong with this calculator
I'll keep putting on multiply and
multiply C two times okay
three point two seven that's a lot I
don't I don't even think I need that
much okay let me see 10,000 divided by
three point two seven okay so that's a
more reasonable number so all I need is
really 3058 users and then once I get to
that point we're gonna say come by out
so everybody wanna say sayonara and it's
gonna be like hey made it made it to the
goal
alright we got several hundred so we
need another two thousand and then
that's what I'm gonna say peace to my
job and I'm gonna just do this shit
full-time that's the idea you know for
me to survive in this world I need ten
thousand a month
unfortunately your boy got a lot of
expenses that I got a family I got a lot
of shit right but if I make ten thousand
a month I'm fucking happy I think after
that I just fucking do everything
fucking for free and shit you know but
or not maybe not maybe I get stingy you
better not fuck that
hungry nah man but the idea is to do
this your full-time like if I get to
have the opportunity to do this your
full-time like I'm taking it to the next
level I'm gonna rent out our office
basically like a nice loft making a
crime high call it's a recording studio
you know with the green screen put more
time into it like the editing put more
time into making sure all the tutorials
are top-notch
you know the whole shape so that's the
idea you know what I mean so wish me
luck hopefully by next year we'll get
those three thousand members on the
website and that's why I got my other
partner - my other partner he's gonna
help me out pay for advertising because
that's one thing when you open up a new
business I think you shouldn't do it by
yourself you should do it with somebody
else just for so your money doesn't you
know you don't pull into all your money
you know or your personal money you
basically you use somebody else's money
to build your business and then you pay
them off and then you continue doing
what you gotta do so me and my partner
we we're looking into it I see what
we're gonna do you know got a budget for
advertising get it out there you know so
I drop in legit courses man and you
never know you start traveling the world
go to some talk some meetups you know I
say hit up all the high schools that's
what I want to do kids from if I'm gonna
do a session tonight I don't think so
not tonight man tonight I'm gonna be
watching a movie with the wifey chilling
at the crib chillin with the baby you
know my little baby kenji AKA ethan AKA
the Wonder Boy the Golden Boy 10,000 a
month doesn't seem to add up well let me
see
so maybe I got it wrong so we do this
how much I'm earning right now for and
I'm very transparent when somebody signs
up for the fire Olive King is I get
three dollars 27 cents out of that
because you know you got to do
transaction fees you got to do pay the
company that's hosting so let's see so I
need $10,000 a month right to be able to
survive in this world then we multiple
no we divide that by 3 27 right and
that's it gives us 3058 users so that's
the goal to get 3058 users a month and
I'm not talking about people just come
in and go
it's not about active users people who
are getting something out of this you
know so that's the idea there's gonna be
Monstar gonna be better than others you
know people might come in they like it
then people they finish all the courses
that they needed then they cancel the
subscription so then that goes away so
the best way would be to advertise to
people that never seen the website or
never been here before so that's the
idea behind it
you know man but you know I'm still
waiting on you guys man with what other
games not other games what other
JavaScript examples that you guys want
come on man let's see the people who are
here to talk that's at Casey it's cool
once enough in a while it's good have a
like a little gay joke but that's it man
you too distracting you know what I mean
so I need I need three more examples
come on guys
forms we got a forms we got a ball game
what else
come on guys let me know let me know an
old snake game how about but that's the
thing I want to create something that
people are gonna be able to use you know
what I mean like I could go and create
50 games that could go create a hangman
game I could create a snake game but
it's like you've already got an eight
ball game we need something else
something that people are gonna use so
I'm gonna say the notifications
verification so we got eight forms we
got forms April game notification was
another one guys come on
a logging system in raw JavaScript I
think I could put that with the forms so
that's fine anything else man come on we
got three we need two more come on man
come on guys use your brain share
database connections crud but the other
thing that's not really a beginner's
tutorial that's more to a mid-level tour
in advance it's because I'm talking
about a beginners tutorial because this
course is all the skills that you need
to basically continue on your journey
with JavaScript so it has to be
something that people are going to be
able to to build something in
understanding right away if we go and
create a electron app he's like hey guys
here's our four loops and therefore four
loops we're gonna jump you two electron
wraps like come on guys like that's too
too difficult
well the calculator calculator is easy
to learn but I was like yeah I did Dom
manipulation I think with the a ball
game that we got and uh notification
custom Jas lightbox that's good see
there you go Charles come on guys
you got the idea
missing postal light box all right one
more come on who's gonna get the last
one who's going to get the last one we
got forms we got an eight ball game
we got notifications we got a custom
light box there's one more yes Casey I'm
gonna do you know api's but later on
it's a process man this is the thing
there's like so many people here who are
come to my channel who just don't know
anything the majority of people that
comes on my channel don't know anything
most of you guys that don't say
something on the chat like look right
now how many people are in the chat room
right now alright and how many people
are actually watching us the people that
are not saying nothing most of the time
I'm almost 100% sure they're complete
beginners all right they're complete
beginners and a lot of times they don't
say anything because they just you know
they watch they trying to learn they're
trying to do what they they got to do
they trying to see if this is this is
maybe for them or maybe it's not so I
have to cater to them so you know I
could come in and create event stuff but
at the same time it's like when I was
doing like the rocky stack nobody was
doing it because that's not the audience
that I had
you know what I mean like my audience is
not fucking like Chris hooks if Chris
hopes goals and creates a course on
krystal krystal Lange his audience are
more mature in the sense of how many
years they bring as developers and you
know my audience is mostly people who
are trying to get into the industry so I
have to finish the basic stuff so I
could help them grow and keep them you
know motivate it to the next level you
know I can't go in and throw something
that's gonna be super difficult for them
and then they're gonna be like oh man
this is too hard this is not for me cuz
that's what happens people give up
because they're like this shit is too
