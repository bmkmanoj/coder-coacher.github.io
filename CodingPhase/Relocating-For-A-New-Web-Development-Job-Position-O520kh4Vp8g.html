back on it again man coding face calm
listen we're gonna talk about relocating
for jobs right so people have been
telling me like hey man I live in the
middle of nowhere I live in you know
Wisconsin are living cancers I'm living
Omaha grammar right then I hate we want
to be able to move to a bigger city we
want to be able to move to the New York
San Francisco la Seattle one of the big
texture sitting right so what's my
advice to that my advice is number one
plan out exactly you know how you're
going to move
meaning are you going to take all all of
your things or if you just leave me with
a Sookie you know because depending on
what you want to take that's how much
it's going to cost hopefully you guys
have a laptop and you could be more
mobile because having a desktop and
walking around with a iMac it's gotta be
difficult you know I mean so I would say
try to get yourself something that form
or move something that you know you know
you can just say hey if I have to rent a
road somewhere in another city for a
couple of months I'll be fine cuz I have
to still code at home I can still work
and do everything that I need to do
off my laptop right preferably it has to
be a Mac well it doesn't have to be but
trust me guys get a Mac stop playing
with yourself yeah so definitely get a
Mac or what else also plan out meaning
how long you're going to be there so
like I say an example if you say hey I'm
going to move to San Francisco and I
know San Francisco super-expensive
like let's say you're gonna move over
there you're going to rent the ring with
roommates which I I definitely would say
that would be the best way because if
you're moving to a city and you don't
have a job there's really no point of
view renting out an apartment or renting
out a house unless you know you have a
job secure you know so you could go and
move and we're a couple of roommates for
like three to six months until you get
yourself situated and then from there
they start looking for an apartment
don't start looking for apartments
before you move in because you never
know if things might go sour for example
the same example you he's getting hired
by a company so before you even get
there they hiring right and then all
yeah we can hire you we are going to
bring you into the team now you're
working at the company foot so what and
then you realize like hey I fucking hate
this company but now I have an apartment
I have a fucking car has a whole bunch
of shit that I gotta pay so now you're
stuck to my job because of necessity now
best thing to do is to just be more
meeting any moment if you go to that job
you don't like it you could just leave
and you say hey I just want to quit this
job you can quit the job you know so to
do that you got to make sure you have
enough money in the bank account where
you say hey if I don't want to stay here
and I want to just start looking for
another job
it's gonna take me a month it's gonna
take me two months I have enough money
to you know to last me so the best way
is just write the rule guys I'm telling
you
you know so I'm trying to act bulging
stop trying to act like you got money
out here it's not about that it's about
just you know being smart if you know
them well that you know that job you're
not a hundred percent sure if you're
going to love it then put yourself in a
good situation where you can say hey I
have money too so basically be able to
put the job don't depend on the job the
job supposed to depend on you is that
simple guys oh yeah man
you already know your job back at it
again coefficient calm and yeah man

know you show me some love the patreon

way man this of course is man I have
courses right there on the description
they're not my courses I'm not selling
my courses I'm not promoting my courses
you know what I mean so what I'm saying
with that when I say hey I'm not
promoting my courses what I'm saying is
hey those courses made me and so
developer and yeah like those of course
as I recommend same way how somebody
would come in and recommend you a book
and will tell you hey man I took this
book and this book changed my life this
course has changed my fucking life guys
this course has got me in here
feeling good got me here being able to
take care of my family got me here to

where I'm at and it's all because of
course is like you know react react or
Redux from Stephen brighter you know of
course is like the cult steel which

me a look into the you know the back end
