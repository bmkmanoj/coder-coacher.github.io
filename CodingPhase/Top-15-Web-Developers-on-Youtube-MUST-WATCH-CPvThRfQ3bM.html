you gotta watch his channel I don't know
why he only drops video like you know

videos more often so I don't know what
was going on with him but his little
catalog is pretty legit plus he actually
put in quality videos it's not just like
you know just pay more but a like me
right now with a screen and I'm chilling
in my room like he actually goes in and
got the lighting got everything so it's
pretty legit and then what about the SEO
junkies and why do I call him the SEO
junkies why because I feel like you know
their channel is about you know whatever
is hot whatever is gonna get me views
whatever is out there not bringing them
down but I don't feel like the
connection there as I get from other
channels I like to go check them out
because sometimes they got some pretty
cool topics and also too you know I like
the simple program I like his his
background and how he's made money
over the years like that's an
inspiration because at the same time for
me like I don't plan on becoming a
developer forever in you know being a
developer forever and working for
somebody else I'm gonna actually you
know own properties and and be able to
move on and you know go to the next
stage in my life right now I'm 29 and

like seriously like no no really like
how sexist can you be it's pretty much a
channel about girls sexy girls at that
