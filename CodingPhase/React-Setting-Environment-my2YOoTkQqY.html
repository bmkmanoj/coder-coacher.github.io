is basically set up our environment and
what does that mean basically just set
up our project folder and download all
the packages that we need okay so first
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna go
to github.com and then you're gonna go
to coding phase comm you know coding
phase DLT c om all right you're going to
go there github.com so let's go to phase
comp and the first thing you're gonna do
is download the starter kit all right
you're gonna come here you quite the
cloning or you could just download it
you know to keep things simple we got to
download this it's gonna download into a
zip file it's gonna go into our
downloads folder okay so let's go here
downloads all right cool let me see
where is they okay start a kick so what
we're gonna do here is we're gonna
double click it for me it's just
right-click click archive unzip it right
now zip your folder there from there for
me what I have is I have a project
folder so all my basically we're gonna
come here to terminal come to the
terminal and we're gonna do CD and then
the little squiggly line right door
right above the tab key on your left
side of the keyboard then I go there
that's gonna take you to the hole right
and then here you're gonna create a
folder you're gonna call it projects
you're gonna see make their projects
alright I already created it so it's
already there for me alright so once you
click there you're gonna press enter and
that's going to create
that folder for you right the next thing
that I want you guys to do is open up a
new Finder window right and pretty much
you're gonna right-click let's say for
example on your desktop right go to your
desktop you come home or you could even
do this directly from here you could say
CD and then you go to projects and then
inside of projects you're gonna say open
that and that's going to open that
projects folder for you right what I
want you guys to do is come back over
here come back to the home take this
projects folder and drag it to your
favorites so you always have access to
it that's why I already did it here okay
click on projects alright now once
you're here you have a couple of
projects right for me I have a whole
bunch of different projects but what we
want to do is we want to actually drag a
folder right the one that we had here in
our downloads co-star ticket 20:18 drag
it in right now here we're gonna need
this react and let's say react - Redux
okay cool so what we're going to do is
now you're gonna double click on that
alright and here on our terminal we're
going to go into that folder we're gonna
say CD react - Bri Docs okay cool
now click the less alright so we have a
couple of files here now we're gonna
follow the instructions that we have
here if you guys have an install node
you're going to come to this link and
install it basically you come here
download that and install no to your
computer right
you could also install yarn after you
install note that's up to you
if you want to install yarn is optional
right make sure you have a text editor
Adam of course and all this other stuff
is just optional don't worry about that
you don't need it okay
so the next thing that you want to do is
you want to come down here to the folder
right so we already inside of react
redux right one thing that we're
forgetting is installing gulp so we're
gonna go to go J yes searching Google so
scope J is calm and what you're gonna do
is you're gonna copy this paste it here
that is going to install gulp right so
you click enter and once you click enter
then you have access to gulp
on your command right on the terminal
alright so just follow those
instructions right just make sure you
install this cuz it's very important all
right now the next thing that we want to
do is we're gonna say MPM install
alright and you're gonna let that run so
that's gonna take a little while you
know it's a lot of files that are
downloading and installing into that
package for the no modules right so once
that's done then from there we can jump
into our project alright guys this might
take a little while so I might post a
video for you guys and then I'll see you
guys in a little bit alright alright so
everything basically download it and now
we good alright so let's get started
what were you gonna do is now we're
gonna say NPM run watch and there you go
let's say we got everything started guys
but I react we got our project ready
and now we're good we can actually come
here create a new window alright make
sure it says react Redux on your
terminal that means that you inside of
that project okay so then what you're
going to do is you're gonna say
something like open and then dot then
you say a and then you'll say Adam then
that will open Adam with our project
inside of it
alright makes our life much easier I
would definitely recommend downloading
in package call JSX
so install here you come here you say
JSX
alright search it make sure you install
it I will say I'll tell you right now I
will say the first one language
JavaScript JSX alright install that and
also install this one which is called
platform you'll ID terminal what this
does is basically it gives us the access
to a terminal straight from Adam so now
you can just click right here at this
little corner and you have a terminal so
you don't have to keep switching from
here to here you can just do everything
here okay alright so currently we
