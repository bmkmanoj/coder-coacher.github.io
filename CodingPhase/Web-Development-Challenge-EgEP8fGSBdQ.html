coding phase comm your boys backing out
and did it again currently working on
this PHP course is coming out amazing
it's pretty great but today we have a
challenge man this is something that I
said last night it was one of my first
topic of the livestream basically this
is the way how we're moving on from now
on right so as far as the projects for
the mentorship program I want to give a
chance to every single one of you guys
to be part of this and also you know
just give you a little bit more practice
okay so the idea behind it is we gave
the mentees a couple of projects like we
gave them three projects to create right
and they pick one and then from there
they build it all right so then from
there this week what I'm doing is I'm
letting them choose whatever they want
to do they go either continue working on
the first project and fixing it up you
know clean it up maybe do some
JavaScript you know challenge themselves
all right we they could do that or they
could come here and find a business on
their neighborhood they have to take a
picture a selfie picture of that Nate of
that business right so like let's say if
you are in your neighborhood right let's
say you're from New York right the
Chinese restaurant down the block right
take a picture selfie picture in front
of all the Chinese restaurant you don't
have to talk to the owner you don't have
to do none of the stuff we just want to
know that it's a real business and that
you actually sing the business all right
so now you're going to build the website
for that business
I'm not saying go to the owner and tell
them hey man I want to build your
website here pay me a thousand dollars
our building know this is something for
you all right if you want to go the
extra mile later on after you have your
project done then you can go ahead and
reach out to them right
for now all I really care about and all
I really want from you guys is for you
guys to find a business on your
neighborhood and then bill
the website for them right doesn't
matter who it is nothing right now
what's cool about this is the people who
got cut and the people who are going to
get cut the mentorship show right well
you guys have the chance to actually
come in and compete with them because
once they get cut doesn't mean that
they're gone forever what it means is
they're on the same list as everybody
else that's watching this show and
everybody else who's on this YouTube
channel right so if you want to
challenge yourself and you want to say
hey man you know what maybe I could be
on a mentorship show hey you know what I
could actually do it better than those
guys I'm gonna prove it right you could
come in and really just build the same
project that they're building you know
what I mean take care of yourself to
come out and be like yo I'm gonna go
hard you know I got one week to do this
project all right so you have this whole
week to do the project and you guys can
compete too you know what I mean like I
think this is a great opportunity for
everybody man I really think that if you
guys can go out there you don't have to
build every single page of the website
right like you don't come in and be like
hey I got a to learn about page I got to
do a contact page I got a doing a menu I
got to do this and that no you don't
have to do all of that you do the front
page of it that's it that's all I'm
asking all right now if you are a design
or somebody with design sense build on
this your own design for it right or
find three different images from dribble
and get inspired by them maybe you like
the colors of this one maybe you like
the menus of this other one maybe you
like the front page of how this one
looks and merge all three of them to
build this this website for the business
that is in your neighborhood all right
now this is my challenge to you guys
right this is my chance to you guys
because I know a lot of people
sometimes I'd be like oh I'm just
following do you know tutorials on
following courses I don't know what to
do I don't know what projects to do this
is your opportunity if you really want
to become a developer you need stuff for
your portfolio you need real businesses
it doesn't matter if the person pay you
or not you know your company's gonna
look at you and be like hey what
businesses have you made websites for
and then now from there you could be
like oh I have this website that I built
for this person I have this website that
I built for a business in my
neighborhood you know etc etc right so
it's up to you guys man I want you guys
to take advantage and not only that that
it puts you on the same level with the
people that I cut right so at the end of
the show we're going to actually come in
and give something to the viewers or
give something to the people who got cut
who continue the project because get it
because you got cut does it mean it's
the end of the world it means that now
you have to work harder because the
people saw something in you that they
say hey this person is not working that
hard this person didn't you know give
his oh this person still got a lot to
learn whatever it is that the people
chose to cut you right all you have to
do is come in and actually just do the
work and then at the end of the day two
weeks from now well a week from now cuz
is this week and then next week is the
last one last episode so by next week
you know you could be like hey man I
came in I got cut but then at the end of
the day I still came back in and got
back in the game the people chose me
right so we're doing two polls to where
I'm letting the people choose who gets
cut this week and who gets brought back
in you know what I mean or even who's
the person that's gonna you know cuz one
of the guys that got cut could be like
oh I'm not coming I'm not doing more
videos I'm not doing more projects I
don't wanna
this that's a I don't have time whatever
it is right so now you that was supposed
to come in he was waiting on this he was
like man somebody already got picked
this is your opportunity to show up on
the last episode and just know everybody
out the box if you feel you're better
than everybody that's on a mentorship
show go ahead show your skills man I
want to see people man so everybody that
sends me their projects by Friday

create it and we're gonna let the people
choose who gets in for next week which
is the last episode you get what I'm
saying like this is how we put in the
spice on it alright this is the little
spice on it that it is gonna motivate
all of you guys now I'm giving something

neighborhood I don't care if it's double
daga in the corner if it's the Chinese
food down the block I don't care if it's

care what it is it has to be a small
business something that you could come
in and create something like their own
website their own branding something
that you're improving on
upon them all right like they could have
their own website right but at the same
time you could come in and be like hey I
got a way better website then the things
that they have on their original website

those are the things that you got to
come in with man number one because I'm
not just speak spoke a lot right now and
you probably like wait what wait why
