coding face.com your boy is backing out
and did it again
guys listen today we're gonna start
something special man today we started
Ruby on Rails and I want you guys to
come with me
in this journey to learn and grow me on
Rails because trust me once you learn it
you're gonna be like oh my god like why
didn't I use this from the beginning why
didn't I start learning with Ruby since
the beginning right so I already created
basically all the whole course on how to
learn Ruby right which is on my website
currently right now I'll show you guys
one second okay so as you can see learn
Ruby back-end developer master course
so pretty much we learn here everything
that has to deal with the programming
language itself all right now you go
into every single thing about the
language we go deep we go into
object-oriented programming we go into
how to explore it in your local
environment so everything that you need
to know it's already on the website okay
now Ruby on Rails is the framework Ruby
on Rails is what we working on now okay
because once you know the language yeah
you know the language but now you need
to work with the web okay because it's
just a regular old general-purpose
programming language so you could use
Ruby for anything that you want you
could even make games you could come in
and create applications you can create
command line applications whatever you
want to do with Ruby you can do it okay
now for the web there's nothing better
than Ruby on Rails for the past 10 years
I believe even more than 10 years
probably like 1314 years because I
believe Ruby on Rails was created in
2003 and since 2003 till now it has been
the gold standard to every web framework
out there you know before there was even
any framework that you could think of
like it was Ruby on Rails right
everybody else
follow what they do everything that Ruby
and rails does everybody else in the
industry follows it so what's cool about
it is that once you learn the framework
you pretty much could pick up any other
framework out there because they pretty
much all copy from Ruby on Rails okay in
one way or another now what's cool about
this is like I told you guys everything
that I do here is according to the
industry according to how many jobs are
there for junior developers how many
opportunities are there for you to get
jobs it's not just like hey man there's
my favorite language and this is what
we're gonna do it know everything that I
come in here tell you about is because
it's gonna be an easier way for you to
get into the industry I told you guys
about PHP PHP is is huge it's the number
one language in the web period there's
no other language beyond PHP and maybe
JavaScript because every website in the
front end needs to use JavaScript at
some point but besides that when it
comes to any type of applications or any
type of website like PHP is number one
hence down okay they're from they are
believe is dotnet you know just to be be
Co you know 100 percent clear on this
let's look it up similar tech comm is
you know me I like to talk about numbers
I like to talk about real things it's
not just me coming up out of my
you-know-what and just pulling it out
from there so hey guys I brought you
this like know everything that I do is
research I spent like four or five hours
on a topic all the time and you know I
tell that to my wife all the time I'm
like man she things like all the time
I'm working it's not really that I'm
working I got to do the research before
I even get to come up and tell you guys
about something you know so let's look
for Ruby on Rails okay you just want to
show you this before we continue talking
about Ruby on Rails
let's go to frameworks so in the whole
web you know number one is PHP that's
how many websites is out there seventeen
percent of the whole web is in PHP if we
come in the entire Internet 17 percent
what 19 percent is done in PHP eight
percent is done in that net and about
0.97 percent is done in Ruby or rails in
the whole web ok now when you start
breaking it down you say okay who are
the top ten thousand websites you start
seeing it that is still no matter where
you go top 10,000 top 100,000 top 1
million Ruby or else is always going to
be there number 3 no matter what and you
probably think like Oh number 3 is it's
not that good it's like you know
everybody just cares about number one
and maybe number tools so it's like who
cares about number 3 well the the
reality of it is like even number 3 is
like really good because even you can
see number 4 is known to yes number 5
would be just regular Express so it's
like then you start moving on to other
things Java Python Django you know what
I mean
but like from what I told you guys from
the research that I've done I've looked
at big cities smaller cities right now
probably till like a year to there's
gonna be a huge opening where people
need developers that know Ruby on Rails
and there's not that many people because
most of the people are jumping into
ships are like ok I'm gonna jump into
nodejs or I'm gonna jump into Java if
they're doing software engineering or
they might just jump into Python right
or they might just say hey I'm just
gonna jump to dotnet if I want to work
in a corporate company they might just
want to learn dotnet but all the
startups and not only all the startups
but a lot of the companies that have
been around for the past ten years they
most likely have built their their
websites and
rails okay there's a lot of legacy code
out there that needs developers to come
in and fill in the job yeah you might
say oh man I want to work in a starter
from from scratch and you know the
latest thing that's out there but when
it comes to this career it's not about
that what it is about it's about you
getting that first job getting that
first experience right if you're finding
yourself in a situation where you're
like oh man I'm competing with too many
people for no js' jobs I'm competing
with too many people for Java jobs I'm
competing with too many people for
dotnet jobs right Ruby or rails is like
it's like I don't know how to explain
it's like a tool that you have on you
unclutch
you know whenever you say hey man I
can't find a job and none of these
places at all it's like you know Ruby on
Rails is guarantee you're gonna find a
job all right
and not only that that every single
company out there if you say hey I know
Ruby on Rails I have built multiple
applications of Ruby on Rails that means
you really know the web okay cuz Ruby
unreal goes into every single part of
building web applications web sites on
you know api's so once you know that you
pretty much can pick up any of the other
frameworks that's out there like this
cuz like I told you if they just copy
from Ruby on Rails you could look it up
every single framework out there copies
from Ruby on Rails you know even laravel
neurosis is blainley
just like a straight-up copy of Ruby on
Rails they just think of Ruby on Rails
but translate it to PHP you know adonis
TS is translated into JavaScript for no
GS so it's like all the frameworks
that's out there Django Jesus Christ
django Django you can't even say say
this out there but Django is like oh my
god they've copied so much from Ruby on
Rails it's not even funny like
I'm telling you guys Ruby on Rails is
like the gold standard I don't even know
one more to tell you guys so listen so
for the past next two weeks that's what
I'm focusing on on the website I want to
make you guys proficient and make you
guys really really good with Ruby on
Rails
if you come with me on this journey to
learn Ruby on Rails trust me you won't
regret it
you know stop listening to people out
they stop listening to the internet most
of these people they they basically tell
you things out of their own favoritism I
don't come in here and tell you hey
everybody knows Ruby and Ruby on Rails
are my favorite languages but in a whole
year I haven't really told you guys hey
learn this right because before a lot of
the places were looking for mid-level
developers a lot of those mid levels and
senior level developers are jumping ship
to other programming languages which
means that's your opening right if I've
been doing Ruby on Rails for 10 years I
don't want to continue doing Ruby on
Rails for another 10 years I want to
jump into golang I want to jump to
elixir I want to jump to um you know
other programming languages like that's
just how it is it's like the same thing
as you if you work in freakin Macy's you
don't want to be a Macy's for another 10
years you get what I'm saying it's just
how it is it's human nature you want to
jump to something else and try something
else right but for you guys you need
developers this is your opportunity get
in the industry come in get those jobs
souping you know what I mean and get
that money like you know what I mean so
basically we're going over all the
basics of Ruby on Rails everything that
you need to know currently right now
we're up to doing the views and I'm
gonna go deep into the views because
you're gonna have to know a lot of stuff
you know render the views or you need to
know er B which is the templating
language for Ruby you need to know you
know all the things that
that you're gonna need to become a
full-stack developer right so there from
there we're gonna jump into the models
then from there we're gonna jump into
databases and after that after we're
finished with the whole MVC and how
everything works with Ruby on Rails we
basically jumping into this project that
I have here so we're building a
Craigslist okay now you might think Oh
Craigslist is just posting and that's it
no Craigslist has a lot of stuff that
you don't see behind the scenes right
Craigslist you might look at the website
but I always so simple it's just text
and some images yes but there's so many
other things behind the scenes you know
like dealing with databases creating
categories creating all tags creating a
a proper way to filter those are those
listings so all of those things were
going to be building in this Craigs in
this app okay now as you can see we're
gonna go into creating the the sections
of all the listings creating the details
you know like once you click on the
image or you click on the title you're
gonna be able to come in and see the
full fill detail of the listing itself I
bind that to all of the different
categories because it's gonna be kind of
ridiculous but we're gonna do at least
two or three categories we're gonna do
probably something to sell we're gonna
put in the jobs job section we're gonna
put in personal connection which is
stuff that people use you know what I
mean so if you go to Craigslist
Craigslist
incognito
let me see if I can open this up for is
a new tab okay
craigslist.com okay so you see Haven
Connecticut okay and as you can see
there's a whole bunch of different
categories so you got jobs you got
housing you got community personals
discussion forum services gigs resumes
so we're gonna do jobs right and we're
gonna create one category inside of the
it's basically it's gonna be like one
category and then it's gonna have
subcategories so it's gonna have jobs
and then jobs is related to onyx a web
writing and TV or film and then we're
gonna have one that's gonna be for sale
and we're gonna have you know strictly
platonic personals or nose or like
community we could do community this is
like personals it's a little bit creepy
it's like a man man seeking man women
seeking women like I don't know if we
want to go go into that world so but
yeah so we probably do community for
sale and we do jobs okay so basically
three different categories that we're
going to build for this application and
it's gonna be pretty legit it's not
gonna be doing it the same without
Craigslist does it we're gonna come in
and actually upgrade Craigslist so make
it more modern everybody that has used
Craigslist knows Craigslist has not
changed their design their website in
God knows how long it's been the same
website since that you released it so we
pretty much creating something that's
gonna be legit something that we could
be like oh cool there's a cool website
and you could have on your portfolio and
be like hey this is Craigslist with
upgrades and you could show that we're
you know to your
your employer or you know to any client
that you might have and it doesn't have
to be named Craigslist like you
literally could change it to a Jos list
whatever you want to change it to you
know like this is just a title like we
could change that title by any moment so
you can use this same application to put
it for your portfolio for you know you
know to have something legit you know
this is where you know my skills come in
when it comes to like building
portfolios and making sure that you guys
get jobs it's like I like to come in and
give you things that you're gonna be
able to use you're gonna be able to show
to somebody and somebody's gonna be like
oh wow you built this and then you're
gonna be able to explain to them all the
things that you build inside of this
we're also gonna put in a admit section
so it's just gonna be full-featured
application if you're looking to build
your own web applications if you're
looking to become a full stack developer
like this course is gonna be perfect for
you so for the next two weeks maybe
three weeks this is the main focus
because there's gonna be such a huge
huge course like I'll be honest it's
gonna be a huge course that is gonna
take some time so basically for the next
two to three weeks this is what I'm
working on and I want you guys to take
this journey with me you know if you
haven't subscribed to the channel or
subscribe you haven't subscribed to my
website and you want to get access to
all of this courses and all of the files
guys take advantage I know a lot of you
guys have been signed up with other
companies ya already have courses with
you know and you to me that you still
want to do and you still want to finish
but I'm telling you right now like you
subscribe to my website it's just gonna
be a extra plus for your career it's
like the icing on the cake all those
services out there all of the courses
that are out there they teach you the
basics the way how to teach things and
the way how I designed the projects is
really like building stuff that a client
will come to you and say okay can you
build this for me
or you work in a company and a company
might be I hate we need to start
building this type of project like all
the things that I do is like real life
experience it's not just like hey list
or to-do app just to do it to do it you
know what I mean like this is more like
legit so I mean I'm not telling you guys
cancel whatever you're doing out there
it's just this is a plus for your career
you know a lot of people have been
taking advantage I'm getting a lot of
emails people have been getting jobs
just by doing the first you know seven
eight courses that are on my website
right and they're not even going for the
full stack you know what I mean like
people come in they learn the front end
they learn JavaScript they learned their
es6 they learned react they learn on you
know hyper app which is a basically I
will say is like complimentary to to
react it's like they both go hand in
hand
so those things is something that as
soon as you're done with those you
pretty much come in and start getting a
job like ASAP you know and it's like
real projects it's not like little BS
projects that you came and showed to
people there's real things you know what
I mean so you know take advantage come
in trust me
listen to me hold my hand through this
right hold my hand we're gonna get
through this thing you're gonna learn
Ruby on Rails we're gonna build a solid
application I know a lot of you guys
that have been hitting me up man I want
to build this thing for my company I
want to build this application because I
see a niche I see a hole in the industry
that nobody has done this guy's after
learning Ruby on Rails and understanding
how it works you will realize that all
the things that you can do in other
languages and other frameworks they take
you literally like probably five times
as long to do as compared to with Ruby
and rails like you come in with Ruby on
Rails or one person could be like twenty
man team because it just has all the
tools for you to come in and just do the
work and just get that
kitchen done you know what I mean so
take advantage I'll see you guys on the
website come check me out
coding freeze comm later on today we're
gonna do a live you know what developer
lunch break any questions you guys so I
have let me know leave a question or
over here on the comments I want to have
this as a conversation are you
interested on Ruby on Rails are you not
interested what are your questions you
know
do you hear people Oh Ruby on Rails is
dead I can pretty much show you order
the details of like hey man those are
things that people choose to say but
like oh people come in and and pretty
much make up stuff and it's not even
good like it's so crazy like people come
in and just be like hey man Ruby or
rails is wack and that's it and then
just people keep on repeating and
repeating is like yo you're buggin like
there's so many jobs everybody else
copies from Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails
was bad and Ruby the language itself was
bad people wouldn't be copying it you
get what I'm saying like there wouldn't
be a reason why other languages are
copying what Ruby and Ruby and rails do
you know what I mean so don't listen to
the Internet send me questions I'll
answer all of them when you send me an
email I also answer 90% of them
sometimes I don't answer some of them
because it seems like people want me to
do they work guys I'm busy like if you
got a question I can answer your
question if you want me to answer
something I'll do it but if you want me
to come in and and start doing like your
homework
I see people hit me up for it I came in
okay I got this thing I got this test
that I got a dual can you help me out to
building as I bro like that's a task for
you you know what I mean like I can't
