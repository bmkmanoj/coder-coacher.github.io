thing that we're going to were basically
gonna take this bio section and we're
going to build it so let's get started
just come back here to our atom we're
gonna go to the index dot HTML we're
gonna come here
this is our top section we're gonna
create another section gonna say section
okay you're gonna give it an ID of bio
okay and then we have two different
sections we have one which is the bio
which is like a paragraph and the next
one is a section for logo okay so we're
gonna come here we're gonna create a P
tag okay you guys already have this
files here so open up the bio copy this
those sort of files that we downloaded
before
okay hey studying here okay one thing
that I usually like to do is I like to
go to the settings and go to my editor
and put in soft wrap okay the reason why
I like to do that is because now as you
guys can see it stays within the size of
the window okay you know so the line
won't be like you know thirty thousand
lines to the right
they'll be looking like a paragraph here
in our editor okay and then it tells us
like hey every single down here it means
is part of that single line okay
so let's save that okay I'm gonna open
up this secrecy
it's actually moving all the way to the
top and that's not what we want okay so
let me make sure something I see you got
top section pants position:relative
that's fine okay and this we're gonna
say height 100 VH save that and as you
can see now that brings it down okay
cool now let's come here
you got the bio let's do the Styles
later let's just finish this okay so we
got the paragraph okay
the other part is gonna be a div with
the class of logo or center logo
centered okay so I'm not created to live
let's copy this this image that we have
up here which is the image of the logo
paste that in okay now the next thing
that we're going to do you're gonna come
here we're gonna do an ID of bio and
then let me bring this up a little bit
more for you guys id of bio we got a
paragraph we also have
what was it the class of Louisville
centered okay so and this one we're
gonna do is we're gonna display flex
okay oops let's play flex and we're
gonna say justified content centered on
line items centered so that's gonna
basically position it right in the
middle and that's what we want okay
now the lesson that we want we also got
a dual display flex justify content
centered no no matter fact not justify
Counseling Center we're gonna say this
belief flex which is gonna put the items
right next to each other okay and we're
gonna say is play flags we're gonna say
for the paragraph we're gonna say with
fifty percent
we're gonna say wave fifty percent for
the local centered okay now we're gonna
give the paragraph a color of white okay
let's say line height let's put in one
point five okay let's put in font size
point nine REM okay let's make this a
little bit bigger the line the space
between the lines okay so that's fine
all right let me see what else we're
gonna come here on this bio we're gonna
basically create a padding of let's say
50 pixels all around 50 pixels all
around we're gonna say background black
okay and as you can see because of the
the blurred this thing is going over
this so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
say position relative Z index 3 and as
you can see now we're actually above
this section here so now nothing is
leaking to our section here okay
so currently right now this how it looks
fullscreen I kind of want to make this a
little bit smaller as far as like maybe
put it in a container so let me see
something um see how this looks okay
yeah I think I'm gonna put it in a
container because right now currently is
full screen but it's a little bit too
much so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
put a container around so I'm gonna say
let's say container and container is
gonna be max width say it backs with
1400 pixels
okay now this the bio it's the section
is the bio okay so don't like this I'm
gonna put this container oops get
container and here I'm gonna put all the
elements inside of the container okay
okay that's more reasonable all right
now max with 1400 okay that's fine in
here I'm gonna put in the class of
container and inside of this I'm gonna
put in let me see I'm gonna move the
display flexing side of the container
okay there you go now the next thing
that I want to do is I'm gonna say
margin:0 auto okay cool so what that did
was it took the container I mean let's
break it down even better for you guys
that I probably lost like why exactly
did we do so basically we have this
section okay
the section is called bio then we say
hey this is the container of it the
maximum width that we want this to be as
1400 pixels okay and we want this to be
centered now anything inside of this
container we're gonna make it into
display flex so both of these items are
using flex boxes okay so that's what we
date there okay and we're gonna still do
a couple of more changes so I'm gonna
remove this padding from here instead of
the bio having the padding I'm gonna put
the padding on
on the paragraph so I'm gonna do this
and on the padding on the centered logo
centered so now we could actually
control the padding a little bit more
okay save that alright there you go now
one thing that I forgot to tell you guys
when you did my what developer starter
kit and you know to install it and
everything I will say try to get this
which is called beautify so atom
beautify search beautify on your
settings and then to the install search
beautify there and then install this so
what's cool about this is that you're
gonna be able to beautify your almost
all of your files you know everything
from crystal to CSS and CSS right like
literally almost everything you could
think of you can beautify it and you're
gonna be fine now what we're gonna do
we're gonna check on Adam beautify click
on settings and we're gonna go to s CSS
click there and we're gonna say beautify
on save so what that's gonna do is every
time you save it beautifies here your
code if I click controls control Z you
can see the difference alright so as I
say control s automatically everything
gets beautified now the next thing that
I want to do you see how with the
padding on everything as far as like you
know top and bottom let's do this top
and bottom padding is gonna be 0 for
paragraph and for the logo Center and
then now on our bio we're gonna say
padding I'm gonna say 100 pixels
top and bottom and 0 left or right save
that
and there you go now you have something
more more better okay now the next video
what we're gonna do we're gonna
basically build this section here which
is gonna have all of the latest videos
alright guys so I'm gonna see you guys
in the next video bye
this video is brought to you by coding
phase common all of its members make
sure you go visit a website it's the
only place where you're gonna learn how
to become web developer with real
projects take it from me it's your boy
joke back at it again conference calm
keep it real keep it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
