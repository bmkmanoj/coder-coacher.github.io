again listen make sure you subscribe
we're about to start a video about
JavaScript man this is the basics you
already know you could only get it right
here for free man people gotta pay for
this and giving me team treehouse I was
at Coursera you're gonna get all of this
for free here on YouTube and make sure
you subscribe you dig all right so we go
into this JavaScript variables what the
hell is a variable right so a variable
is a container for storing data values
so pretty much you're saying okay var
car model equals BMW so now when you
will say oh what's inside of a car model
what's the car model for this car right
an example and basically I'll return you
back BMW right so like let's say how do
you declare a variable in JavaScript var
first-name equals Jane so what this
becomes you know it's basically saying
hey declaration you started with a var
it's okay var variable name is gonna be
first name and then the value of the
variable is gonna be Jane right alright
so what's the data type so what type of
data types can you put inside of a
variable right so pretty much you could
say there's a bunny
you're quite to say true or false so an
example does the car has window tinted
windows right it's false so it's
basically false the car doesn't have
that right now let's say an example a
string somebody left a comment this
becomes a string so pretty much you say
hey var car comments equals if'n hate
this BMW is the worst car ever I gave it
3 out of 10 super unreliable so pretty
much you could put in red alert letters
inside of any the regular characters
let's say a number you could have you
know semicolon
a dollar sign you could put that Dada
but everything has to be inside of coats
you go either have single quotes or
double quotes right so let's see what's
next all right we got numbers all right
so you could say hey vark are year
equals 2017 so you had to put in
positive numbers or negative numbers
inside of what you know inside of a
variable okay so then you have no what
does no mean no basically means that it
has no value
you basically just say hey what's the
car color of this car
you basically say no there's no value
for it yet you know what I mean
now let's go to undefined undefined is
basically saying hey you declare this
variable but it has nothing inside of it
meaning it has not been defined and it's
not known so pretty much what you're
saying is okay it got the fine but then
it's not equal to anything so that's
what no means that's it I mean right now
you don't need to worry about that you
worry about no and undefined once you
get to that point but for now all you
really need to know is about true or
false strings in numbers
all right now let's say you wanted to
start coding this is a very important
thing in JavaScript string
numbers and numbers are not this they're
the same but not equal to the same thing
so like let's say I wanted to say age 22
in US as a string in age - as a number
right if you go like this you say okay
22 times
age is gonna give you 484 all right but
let's say it's age equal to age
- so h2 is gonna say true because
they're both the same number it's 20 to
22 but when you say age is it the same
in the same type of variable it's gonna
say false
you see age these two are different
because one is a string and one is a
number but they're both numbers I don't
know it's a little bit confusing but
that you you learn this as you go on it
and you get more experience all right so
this is the video for now make sure you
subscribe and continue trust me I'm not
gonna I'm gonna dump this down man
I'm gonna make this thing so simple for
you to understand I'm not gonna give you
mumbo-jumbo languages and dissing on it
you know I'm just gonna bring it down to
you know dummy level like that's you
know sometimes all you really need is
somebody to teach you just the same way
how they speak to you and the streets or
wherever you're from like you know just
like your friend explaining this to you
you know what I mean all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
