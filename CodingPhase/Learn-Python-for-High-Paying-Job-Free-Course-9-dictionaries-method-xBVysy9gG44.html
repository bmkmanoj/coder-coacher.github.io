gonna talk about is a couple of methods
that you can use with your dictionaries
so start very simple I'm gonna use
couple of things that we're gonna see
here on the documentation so you just
saw it clear so let's say you want to
clear out all of the keys inside of this
dictionary so what you would do is you
say users doc clear though see so users
is actually just a dictionary but has no
keys it has no values all right now
let's say you wanted to pop just a name
from a dictionary then you will actually
come here and use pop so you say pop and
then now you will put in the key you say
name and when you run that you will
notice that name is no longer inside of
this diction right so that's what pop
does another one that's useful its
update so let's say for example you have
another dictionary or you have a couple
of keys that you want to actually merge
with this dictionary well basically you
can use update update and then pass in
side of it a dictionary where you will
say for example let's say car
you say SV
Oh
you'll see six years pro
okay
let's say houses
- all right or you can put in the number
- okay and then you wanted to merge this
dictionary was this dictionary right
very simple what you would do is you
will say okay run this and as you can
see automatically emerges both of them
together see car SVD pro six Pro houses
- and what's cool about this tool is if
you wanted to merge like let's say for
example city right you want to overwrite
city with something new so you'll say
okay city and city and instead of having
it Queens you say New Haven okay now you
run that and as you can see the city
became Haven and you also have all of
the other keys add it to this dictionary
alright now let's go back to here to the
documentation now let's say you wanted
to get a list of all of the keys inside
of the dictionary then you can use keys
so you can come here and instead of
saying update come here actually say
users that Keys make sure you put s
plural and basically take this
put it here this and this you can see it
basically returned back up dick keys
with a list of all the different keys
inside of them right now we could come
here and say something like this
actually convert that into a list by
seeing list and then put it in
parentheses
user duckies right and then now we
actually have a list okay so that's one
of the ways to do it you can pretty much
do the same thing as values all right
there's the same thing and you've come
see about that you can see like this
values
now what it does it basically gives you
all of the values inside this dictionary
now let's say you want to find out how
many keys are in there or how many
values are in there you could come here
and say this come and say Len and that
will return back a value of a number so
as you can see it says eight all right
same thing if you come here see keys
says eight so that's in case for
whatever reason you might say hey I want
to know exactly how many values are have
inside of this dictionary you know how
many keys do I have inside of this
dictionary
sometimes you might need things like
that code so at least you know exactly
how to do it all right so I'll see you
guys later this video said boy joke back
at it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
