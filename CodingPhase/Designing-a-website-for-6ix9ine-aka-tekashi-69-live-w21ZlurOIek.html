face.com
guys I don't have no camera so you can't
really see me but if you want to hang
out with me what I designed is and you
guys could actually talk gonna chat I'm
also gonna look at the chat room to see
was popping let me know you know I mean
if you enjoy this type of videos so
basically remember I tell you guys I'm
coming out with a new series so this is
what I'm doing now I'm basically
building the website as far as like the
the layout of how I want to build this
website for Takashi 6-9 and then from
there the tutorial is gonna be with HTML
CSS and JavaScript we're gonna build the
page okay right now just designing it I
hope you guys enjoy this and you let me
know if you're into this okay I've done
this before where I've done like some
pretty simple you know live streams but
it's up to you guys if you guys want to
see more of this because I do this all
the time I'm constantly designing work I
just never share it cuz you know this
channel is about coding is not really
about design so I don't really share it
with you guys but hey we're doing a live
stream
let me see who's in here make sure I say
what up to everybody Juan Lopez Ramsay
Jordan Kelvin Davis laid 3000 silver
blade Freddy Martinez kawase who else
let me see who else
yeah you could definitely pick another
artist what would you want you to change
it alright you could definitely change
it but yeah so right now this is what
I'm designing is what I'm working on and
yes now I'm also gonna go let me see
that is how I work when I'm designing a
website I usually search for
inspirations
I'm gonna go to like let's say a dribble
out there see if I like a certain color
scheme something that I might my like
you know like this like the the colors
in this so this catches my attention
okay you might think might wait but this
is a dashboard why would you look at a
dashboard for artists website well it's
just for the colors it's just for the
colors is not really for for the design
itself see so what else we got in here
okay so let me get started right now
before you guys got in here what I did
was I took this image from sukashi 6-9
and basically let me see if I can show
it to you guys so took this image and
basically I took it blurred in the
background and I have to blur in it that
from there you have this image okay and
then that's what I did so far let me see
what the hell was this background okay
so let me see okay so we got this is
gonna be like the home page on page
layout oops
homepage layout let's move this up a
little bit let me see what's the ruler
man it sucks using windows cuz it's like
all my shortcut keys I can't really use
it like okay so that's the ruler let me
see if I could change that the preset
preferences for this we see cursors
plugins general interface
so yeah I'm on a Windows computer guys
so this is how I need for me I'm still
trying to get used to it put the ruler
in pixels put this in pixels and there
you go okay so up to here is like let's
say I want this to be like a 1000 okay
so that's pretty much it
okay so that's like let me see I think I
run there that's fine okay now this
right here we're gonna take the colors
that we're seeing here and we're gonna
use this so I'm gonna save this image
I'm gonna basically put it here go to
colors see oh okay
generate the colors okay we're gonna
click on the image
okay I wish you could so many more by
guess not
okay I'm trying to catch that color real
quick there you go and there we go case
we got some colors now I wonder can you
guys see me I just set up this
microphone I don't know how bad doesn't
sound can ya hear me let me see yeah so
I guess you guys can't hear me - trees I
know your microphone sucks man
listen man it's not really set up on
this computer so it is what it is you
like it or not you can stay you can
leave it's up to you listen man for the
Marion Queen who says man it kind of
shaded to see one of my favorite
youtubers design a side revolving around
child rapist listen man I don't know
about if he was a cherry Pez I don't
know about none of that I know about
music man if you know what I'm saying
like that's it that's all I know I don't
know what else you might see on the
Internet
I know him from music I don't know him
from anything else I mean if you like it
you like it if you don't you don't you
could change the the artists change the
idea is up to you and actually you
really don't have to be here this is
like a random livestream Thank You Ven
there's a random livestream this is not
really like like a set livestream you
got what I'm saying like this is pretty
random you hang out if you like to if
you don't hey don't hang up
the right color I want something that's
similar to what it's already there but a
little bit lighter okay there you go all
right cool
now the next thing that we have here
okay what else what do we need in this
website what is this thing I guess I'll
try I was gonna do like some Super
Saiyan colors on it but then that looks
corny and I say a delete that alright so
here let's say we have rounded corners
enemy for there's a new layer so like
that
runner coins is a little bit too much
but there's a
my pixels better delete that new layer
okay what was the color we had okay so
here I'm gonna put in like a section for
the videos so we're gonna copy this
freaking hard I feel like there's no no
command key there's no command key on
freakin on this on this freakin
windows keyboard man I don't know how
you guys do it man
so be honest with you guys like Windows
is it's not that great man
I like it for what it is for editing and
for you know for videos because you can
actually go in and put in whatever
graphic car you want and make it
powerful but at the same time you know
you can come here I'm actually going
over the wrong way I should do it like
this you should do it select often this
one and then now I got damnit
I know
is not spreading out properly like
technically you supposed to literally go
along so like one like this like all of
these then when you click here it's
supposed to basically distribute
vertically centered like I don't know
why this thing is not doing it whatever
I'll do it through CSS this is just like
a mock-up it's not really now ready the
final product okay so let me see
in this
to making this bigger all right let me
see what else so we got main page I'm
gonna have a page for the music videos
then we have another section for this
into a group
it's okay okay now for this from here to
here oh this whole section okay let me
see who's in the chat room right now
Missy Allah
somehow somehow have this live chat like
right here on the side somewhere so let
me see how well we could actually do
this see pop up pump up chat okay so
let's do that let's bring this in
because I don't really need to have this
you know there's a big-ass screen let me
see if I could make this text no bigger
alright cool so MC yes sir man
nah man only reason why I'm here is
because my MacBook is being replaced it
does the screen of it is gonna replace
but this is not something that I'm I'm
proud of you know what I mean like I'm
not proud of this thing
okay let me see change the colors wait
we have with his other thing we had
everybody shots at 7:00 now this one
this this colors don't look good
you know sometimes finding the right
thing right colors is it's as important
as the design itself you know like for
me I take the most time is really and
just like finding the right color it's
the right color scheme that I like you
know what is keep it simple
bark
our youth it was like four times speed
activated let me see what else okay so
we have this let us open up this other
okay left this to the top all right we
got a duplicate this one more time make
this go fullscreen okay and we're gonna
basically let's make this a little bit
bigger okay
this thing we're gonna use blur Gaussian
blur on it
all right the next thing that we're
gonna do here so we got glowing blur on
that this background album I think
that's the album cover for him
Missy
okay that I will cover is this actually
so anywhere else
let me see
okay get this is gradient get this color
in
okay I'll take one here and top cut that
up and let's see what else
yeah well I think you know for for what
it is
Thanks you could you xee or full what's
a little sketch but sometimes you just
want to do something quick you know it's
just something quick made so it's a part
that we can actually you know say in
Google so I believe is day six nine up
yeah day six nine
basics night along
okay let me see
I hear we probably put in like I told
Spotify
so let's start using Seaview it's a
screen okay so that's what we got so far
see what I'm gonna do so these six nine
stories but this medium okay
day six nine installers five top 400
singles and then let's get the the names
of the singles six nine singles
okay so we got gum Oh Kota Kiki and
gaudy gum Okuda kicking gaudy okay come
o khuda kiki Gotti
I'm Okeke so OH
Amen if you are a new person watching
this and you haven't subscribed make
sure you subscribe man
make sure you definitely subscribe okay
this a little bit bigger me see it was
56 pixels that's a little bit too much
so let's say at 48 let's bring in the
color
thing two three three yeah so day six
nine in stores let me see
I also want to take some inspiration
from Spotify see they usually have some
good typography for this type of sites
and was it Inc said world star-69 what
the hell I don't know what's going on
you see like this is the type of BS that
happens and I'm like yo Justin be acting
up sometimes on windows world star
hiphop calm okay
yeah this website ain't to so this will
they have all the links to all the
different spots so let me see
so we gotta I don't know iTunes store
Spotify app of music I was on music
title so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
take this put this here and then put the
logos here on the side I know he got
five charting singles by K can't
remember what's the other one
he got gum Okuda kiki gotti other
charter or Billy Rondo yes or Rondo yes
we got a gumbo coda Kiki Billy I'm gonna
put six cuz I know that that new song
God he's gonna be poppin - so come on
coda Kiki Gotti
Rondo the one come makoto Kiki Gotti
Billy a Rondo
okay cool
take this
let me see what else I know then the
graph on this way too big even this is
way too big
okay then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
come in here I'm gonna put in I'm gonna
put each logo but I'm just gonna
basically create a section here is gonna
be for each level that we're gonna put
okay all right let me see what else
let's see this okay so this is 100% all
right so that's good hide this thing so
there's 100 percent of the view so this
I'm basically designing for nine twenty
by 1080p screen so let me see what else
a hold on me let me close this why is
this tab here taking space for no damn
reason okay
low goals crippled logos okay let me see
what else this Katya Rondo okay so like
that and then I don't know why this
thing instead of spreading it out evenly
like is like technically once you go
like this put it here see I don't know
why it's doing that like it supposed to
even everything out okay say after right
and then you're supposed to go like that
spread it out so like that's one of the
things that sketch does oh that's way
better than Photoshop like and sketch
you go actually go and say okay I want
this here I want to spread out evenly
between all three boxes and Photoshop is
like oh no I don't know if it's like
it's not smart enough or what the hell
like it doesn't know how to calculate
from there to there take all the
freaking elements and freaking century
like it's not that difficult Photoshop
like what a hell if I go like this this
is supposed to be centered
like why if I'm present here I want the
center why are you not centering in it
like you got on saying like this is kind
of ridiculous oh man it really does piss
me off sometimes but whatever this is
just how you call it it's like a a
prototype this is not like the final
thing it's not supposed to be perfect
but it does piss me off like it makes me
want to scrap this whole project and
just go straight to sketch like this
thing should be able to Center this
thing automatically I shouldn't have to
tell it like oh yeah center like this
like this is kind of ridiculous like a
sort of works with one element so if I
click here I go like that
I'll Center it but why can a century
were six different elements does not
make sense
all right cool so we got what you got
the Takashi six nine here let me see day
six nine album I see if we what's this
okay let's group this all together album
okay okay so let me see what else okay
this section maybe we'll take whatever
he has in is Wikipedia copy this going
to
oh I need this like this better
let me see so who is in here what up
yeah way I'm just chillin man I'm just
making this website for you guys man see
you guys have some new content something
that nobody else is doing
hopefully the apps you know the apps
don't come in and Jack our
okay let me see
okay let's see let's see
and the
I advise people you know cuz I see my
room you about torrents and crack and
cracking this and that like once you get
a certain amount of money like once you
you feel like you can pay for service
guys pay for it because you know when
you are developer you are a creator okay
so when you are a creator you understand
you understand how it feels to actually
put in a lot of time into something and
then either nadya paid for it
or you know not get dumped on the money
that you're supposed to so if you have a
job like come on guys
and adobe has this service you know this
glowy Photoshop Illustrator all this
stuff for like $30 a month and use the
constantly like you might as well pay it
man like me personally I could go and
crack this whole program and get it from
Torrance but I decide to just buy em say
hey I'm just gonna pay for the monthly
subscription yeah okay what up son
there's been a long time yeah my Mike is
always blinking out every single day
they pick up little album your mic is
bugging out business and that it's
always sucked in you know man
like I don't know what to do I don't
know you could hear me you can't hear me
there that's like I can't do anything
about it you know that me did you know
maybe the Abbas I should be on top do
you guys think
I don't know what the hell is going on
with this microphone with the system
itself I don't know it's like I just
don't staying for four windows I don't
know if you guys can hear me you know
it's not always something else if it's
not the livestream mr. Mike if it's not
the my let me see here's something you
see like I don't know like like why
doesn't this work I got enough it's
the live stream itself or is the mic
like the mic sounds too far
chit chit chit yeah so I don't know if
you guys could hear me now I'm trying to
I'm trying to fix this microphone and
see what the hell's going on so it
sounds like it's fixed Jesus Christ I
don't know what it happens like I bought
this off Focusrite interface I pay like
two hundred dollars for you the
microphone is like $250 like this whole
set up it's $500 like you tell me for
five hundred dollars this can't
worked like it pisses me off man so a
scaler
agree with you a hundred percent I hate
the fact that you gotta pay for it as a
description every month I rather just
buy it but then you wouldn't get all the
updates you know I mean like every month
they come out with something new
something that makes your life easier so
L depends on the type of person that you
are you know if you I know some people
that they still using Adobe CC like the
last one that they had before they they
forced us to have subscriptions they
still use it but if you want all the
cool new things then you gotta pay for
the subscription okay so let me see
about page okay there's the about page
I'm gonna move this up more
rearrange a little bit different
okay so we got this okay let's move all
of this up
it was a Groupon logos logos goes into
the album section and then video section
and the album section let's move it down
okay
there you go am i eating some Platanos
with bloody nose with some some rapes
bonus trips
you
you
we got bio gallery to our music
you
okay I want to create a new item for
each so I'm just like putting space in
it I know there's better ways of doing
this but I'm just proud to type in this
whole website now somebody's gonna be in
there
Joe there's a shortcut for that I'm like
yes there is but I'm just prototyping
you know what I mean all right so let's
see it's make this a little bit smaller
all right let me see how long got this
you
let me see artists websites well I was
Universal as a group music
you
what a fine do they have any other
artists websites just want to see things
that they might have
why Jesus my ratchet his channels on my
girl man
it's cool it's a cool idea
alright so what we have we have six nine
bio gallery tour music contact RLSA even
contact
this section was actually put in there
that red bandana that I got out got a
bloodbath out okay so video section
okay so
the chat is
usually crazy where's the energy you
know the energy is probably not that
much because I'm not there you know what
I mean I usually get it late but right
now I'm just doing some work man you
know now everybody's into seeing the
work that it takes to build a website or
the things that people you know they
work on
you
why am i building this website because I
say you know what let's build something
that you know I want to create content I
know what is creating first of all so
that's exactly what I'm doing
nobody's doing this right nobody's
really building websites like this so
you know if everybody's going right I'm
going left and then once again I'm
pretty sure a week from now we start
seeing people by oh sure I'm doing a
website for Drake I'm doing a website
for this isn't that which is what I've
been saying you know people don't come
here whatever I work on then they see
that I was working and then they
basically they try to replicate it on
their own channels so but I'm crazy I'm
crazy and you know I'm making all this
stuff up so this is my way to prove it
okay so let me see videos
then is like stop his side Oh God
okay okay we got the video section here
see if I can move all of these
so in a group wrote this videos
let's put some shadows on this boxes -
okay drop shadow okay
say 50% ask me okay
let's copy the styles copy layer style
paste layer style paste layer style
paste layer style and there we go they
are latest videos
so our bio gallery
yes a media
I know I shall I put a video or midea
what do you guys think is this really
for six nine no it's not for six nine
this is for you guys that's the name of
the title but it is basically we're
simulating if I was gonna do a website
for six nine this is what I will build
right right now just prototype for this
project and then what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to build a website with you
guys here on YouTube okay you know to
help people out there more projects for
their portfolio the mic started
are you serious what's up with this
yeah yeah yeah
like this shouldn't be happening at all
it's like you get fixed when I
disconnected and connected again
how about now you hear me good now I
don't know why the hell it does that man
listen yes right
you
okay the axial panel
it closed this I got to figure it out
all the time
I'm not doing this right now
and I ain't got time for that I smoke I
smoke dreams now you are remote what
developer only working from home yes
basically work from home do a whole
bunch of different courses oh my god
this cracking sound why does it do that
I'm about to break this and I'm so
pissed it's like I literally literally
went to Guitar Center and said what's
the best thing that I could buy to make
sure my sound sounds good and you know
oh yeah you could get the focus right
this this and then I get this microphone
in and it's like it's a piece of
and if it was cheap I wonder stand and
when I cool it's cheap who cares but
this cost money you got what I'm
saying like I hate when they
take advantage of people all right so
what
you know we have 6-9 homepage we got bio
media to our music stop me to bio media
tour so I gotta add the tour I'm gonna
see me add a new section here
okay so this I'm gonna call as header
because I actually I wanted this to
sound professional I wanted this to be
like Jay so I went to an audio store and
like literally bought something that was
good and it just I don't know man I'm so
disappointed I'm gonna sell this on
eBay that's somebody else deal with it
you know what I mean but at the same
time it's like man like this should
be working like there's like a $500
thing like the mic is a 200 the focus
raise another 200 now when you add the
taxes like $500 are spread you know what
I'm saying like that's crazy all right
so we gotta do the tour section see how
many people are watching this how
many people are in here hanging out we
got 35 people watching hey man make sure
you give this likes man I never
understand why people give dislikes like
who takes the time to give a dislike I
never take the time to be like oh this
light I never do that like I just
automatically if I watch somebody this
is me automatic I just click like that's
it
you know what I mean like I'm not here
to bring somebody else's channel down
like who does that you know what I'm
saying
those desire you're like man loser
status okay so we got this album here
think I gotta move this up a little bit
okay what else
create another section so let's bring
this back down
you
okay so let's see what else a buggy now
again about to break this
 it's like I have to disconnect and
connect it again like why does it do
that yeah cuz I just disconnected it and
connected it again
like what the hell is going on with this
shape man it's so annoying so let me
just finish this dissection so I could
get out of here I don't know if the
audio on the focus right or
what the hell it is okay so this whole
section I don't know why what should I
do here we already got it like this you
know what let's get up
Takashi six nine
this kids crazy
alright larger than two megapixels
you
you
all right
I should play here tour dates right
there
okay I'm still working man working
working working
you
what
I like the design let's go to increase
me school taught me color theory
like what looks good and what doesn't
look good but all the stuff is just you
learn it from you know practice and
looking at other people's good design
it's like this really good designers out
there so what I do is I look at their
work and then they are learned from
you
oh I can see you know anything that you
want to build in this world you can if
you practice and control it at some
point you just can't give up
be fine in this world
delete that Tsongas some back copy this
I gotta actually most a date okay like
this the extended needs to be to the
left or okay so this thing here right
there
this one just move it there okay that's
fine it's not
all fixed we'll fix that in the code
it's easier to deliver to the trial till
to my ear okay now our next thing we
want to do wanna make this a little bit
but I die for now
put this in a group called column okay
oops I'll be this paste it
and they okay cool
you
I don't know what you guys think should
I move this up should I move which
sections should come after the homepage
so the about latest video day 6 9 tour
dates I don't know I feel like from here
no from here she goes to somewhere else
instead of the Bayou right after it what
do you guys think should I change it
switch it up
just kind of added one last thing which
is gonna be like the footer
okay
okay
alright guys so let's see the microphone
messed up still or can you guys hear me
good yeah let me know I'm trying to
figure out what the hell is going on
with this microphone
stupid mic still messing up alright guys
so this what we got so far of course
we're gonna do some tweaking to it but
this is gonna be like the home page so
yeah so we gotta do some tweaking to the
page but this what we got so far so you
got the whole page
we got the bio section we got the latest
videos
we got the album section which is like a
six nine and then we have the tour dates
and after the two days we're just gonna
have like a a footer which is gonna
either bring them back to the top or
gonna have like you know copyright this
copyright dad trademark today its
trademark to that all the good stuff
okay so yeah man
apologize for the damn microphone I'm
gonna figure it out man so I will see
you guys later I hope you guys enjoyed
this this is not a typical livestream
it's just a regular livestream just me
building this so you guys could see it
before I start coding it and start doing
the tutorials for YouTube okay so yeah
