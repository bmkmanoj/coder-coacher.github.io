it again man : face calmness and your
boys live man that got it again alright
so today we're going to talk about five
font and frameworks to look out for in
2018 man the five front-end frameworks
to look out kid
alright alright first of all I'm going
to start with my two favorite ones right
so the first one is pre-act I don't know
if you guys have heard of this is pretty
much like react but way faster alright
so they looked at where we act had they
follow some of the conventions that they
have you who actually take our react
application and basically put it the
same way imp react but just importing
instead of importing reacting import
pre-act and then everything runs you
know smooth right so it's really great
because it's like I love react I love
the way that react works that's a
framework and the fact that it's just
plain JavaScript it's not like we gotta
understand things Ivy bind is rebinding
that or you know by this or ng this
empty that it's just JavaScript alright
so if you know a little bit of reactor
or you already know react itself pre AK
is easy to pick up right now the thing
is the number one up-and-coming
framework everybody's talking about it
everybody that loves to react is jumping
on this and let's see what happens when
angular II you know not angular sorry
when react releases fiber let's see if
there's a big difference between fiber
and pre-act if there is then people
might just jump to react fiber now if is
still
neck-to-neck a lot of people gotta jump
to react 420 equal that's what sure all
right now inferno is another one
infernal is very similar to pre-act
but they just have different you know
architecture in the back you know the
background the way how its build itself
um but it's
much like react is the same thing as
pre-act
I know it sounds react react they always
right it sounds very similar right
but the difference about this is that
you know I think this one is type skirt
support it has his own routing system um
you know like they already have almost
everything
infernal Inferno server furnace or mo
backs inferno Redux inferno rearm router
infernal test utilities like this so
much that's already built for infernal
that if you know react you can jump on
this it hit the ground running and it's
actually faster which is you know why a
lot of people are jumping into this
because then I hate wheel of react but
we know that we can actually make this a
little bit more faster and you know we
just waiting for react fibre but till
then we got Inferno Jas and pre-act
then from there we got riot riot is
another one that's just being on the low
it's very it's very independent it's not
like any major companies behind it it
doesn't have you know laravel behind it
like vgs to say hey this is vgs no riot
JSS it is very similar to view in
certain things but at the same time is
it's different
and then what's cool about it it's like
it's an independent or framework it's
not you know it's not the mainstream
like you know sometimes for us
developers we want to try the new the
latest there is like you know how when
you listen to a song and you listen to
it from an artist that nobody knows you
like oh man this is my favorite song
right but then once everybody started
using it you're like oh man I hate that
artist man now he's popular isn't that
that's pretty much where we are right is
that right now right because this like
is very independent right now it's very
underground so there's like one of those
frameworks test on the come up but
people not everybody knows about it yet
right now there's another one this comes
to this this
issue here with polymer right polymer
everybody know about polymer because
Google released it you know when I first
came out of first time that I heard
about components was actually from
polymer polymer 1.0 I think it was alpha
excuse me it was alpha at that time
right but now they they basically they
notice that in polymer law and nobody
was picking it up nobody was using it
nobody was talking about it and then
they realized man we got a you know
revamped this whole framework and let's
just you know release a new version
still or with a lot of the the colorful
polymer one but now it's update is is
more in the sense of like how react came
out right so as you can see angular vgs
who are there's a million different
frameworks that all switched up to the
component model how react did it and
then polymer is no different they pretty
much taking some of it and then creating
it in their own way but it's pretty cool
I really enjoy polymer I think it has
its own its own fan base it could get
somewhere next year let's see how it
goes right now then we have irelia i all
right so already has been around for i
can't say if it's been around for a long
time
why is definitely it is definitely not
it's like one of those projects that
everybody's been talking about like
under load they're like oh have you
heard of how well you have you heard of
this have you heard of that
and I think 2018 when they come out with
a better version then where it is now
I'm pretty sure that a lot of people are
going to jump on this because it's a
pretty cool abbis I like the way how it
works you know it's very similar to
reactive it's more closer to just
JavaScript instead of using something
like angular where you gotta know I've
made a million different things and with
it all ng actus ng this ng cloak ng
whatever it's like this is just
JavaScript if you know JavaScript you're
going to be fine with this framework so
this is why I like it I don't know if
you guys have checked out your boy um
your boy Eric sorry so I'm gonna try to
remember everything that I wanted to say
in this video but your boy Eric he has a
pretty good tutorials on irelia he's one
of the people that have been using
irelia for a while
if you guys don't know who he is he's on
my on my youtube channel check him out
Eric Hanson he's pretty legit man is a
pretty legit developer check him out he
got the Tourism irelia you know this is
one of the people that um I looked for
actually you know when it comes to
irelia tutorials he got some legit ones
oh yeah man those are my top 5 picks
right this my top 5 picks for 2018 I've
been coming frameworks now who do I
think is gonna win out of all of this 5
ah it's between pre acting referral
that's for sure you know this all the
ones that have the biggest fan base
there's other ones that everybody is
talking about there's other ones that
everybody was to be using all right so
if you want to be ahead of the curve and
you want to say hey I want to join the
cool kids then you got pre acting
referral guys alright so make sure you
