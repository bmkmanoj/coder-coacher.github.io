simple joke back at it again man
scolding face.com listen make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man the kid is back alright guys
so we're gonna talk about basically
hosting right there's a couple of
hosting companies out here and I was
saying the one that I use is it's
actually called namecheap.com
I usually get all my domains from
namecheap.com I get everything from
namecheap.com hosting as far as like
whenever I'm doing something for clients
if you work in something in PHP or
WordPress or you know just want to put
up a simple website up man named chief
comm you can't go wrong right now I'm
gonna put a lengthy low we're pretty
much it's gonna get you a discount
whenever you buy a domain or whenever
you sign up for hosting and yeah man I'm
gonna show you guys how I actually you
know my domain later on in the video but
um yeah that's all that's the configure
that I actually use like you know
namecheap.com has been around for our
ill minute and yeah whenever you need a
domain that's what you gotta go guys
like just to be honest with you guys
like that's the company domain so super
cheap I've seen places where they they
charge you for that IO like let's say
copán that I owe or you know crystal
crystal casts that IO which I just
bought I've seen it for like $60 and
some places for $80 and I'm like hell no
when I could just go to namecheap.com
and get it for that thing is like $32
which is super cheap for a regular comm
you get it for things like $9 to $10 for
you guys you probably get a little
discount so yeah man like I will tell
you guys go to the website
and if you still don't have a website up
man you guys are slacking I've been
telling you guys exactly what you need
for your portfolio if you still don't
own your own domain your own com you
guys are slacking right now because what
the hell you gonna do you're gonna give
somebody your github account and be like
hey go see my code at github they can't
see your freaking website dummy like you
need to actually show them websites stop
thinking and you're gonna send them
little code bytes or be like hey watch
my algorithm like no people want to see
what type of websites have you built so
yeah man start buying domains on
namecheap.com or you know there's other
places too where I do my hosting
whenever I want to work on a project
like on Merivale or I want to work on
something for Krystal lang I check out
Heroku com sometimes I use digital ocean
dot-com which is good but you have to do
everything manually I feel like I'm not
a DevOps person you know I could
maintain a website as much as I can but
I'm not a professional I'm not like the
best in the world I could do it myself
but most of the time I rather just
either pay somebody else or just use
Heroku and you know it'll scale it for
me you know so yeah anyways guys I just
wanted to do a little quick video cuz
somebody actually hey man what is it
that you actually use for you know
getting your domains and what is it that
you actually use for hosting
namecheap.com
that's all I use when it comes to like
websites of regular websites whenever
you building a web application I use
Heroku digitalocean I don't use you know
AWS because AWS it gets complicated I
feel like you have to be somebody who
put it in time into your your server and
on AWS and you know just ask Ellie and
I'm like that's not me I like to code I
don't like to be worrying about the
server that's not that's not my
specialty most companies that I've
worked
for I pretty much just go in do my code
let somebody else handle the basically
the deployment I do the deployment a lot
of times but most of the time somebody
has already set up the server and
everything for me like I don't have to
deal with that maybe I won't point out
I'll probably try to learn in myself but
for now or for man like I'm already like
you know I'm already good you know so
yeah I'm just trying to fix the the
little you see the little focus get your
boy out here man you see that you did
yeah man yeah guys so I'll see you guys
later
just a quick little video you know for
for the viewers and for the fans and for
the squad so let you know exactly what
hosting company I use and yeah check the
link below I'm gonna put it there if you
guys want to buy a domain or you guys
want to get some hosting namecheap.com
is what I use unless it's that sense it

your boy joke back at it again man

sure you like this video man by the way

I took to become a web developer
stay right there in the description it's
no secret it's nothing crazy there's no
secret gift that I had it's just pretty
much I took the courses they're pretty
cheap they're like fifteen dollars each
on specials and just listen man change

something fun and something cool that
you could call a career
