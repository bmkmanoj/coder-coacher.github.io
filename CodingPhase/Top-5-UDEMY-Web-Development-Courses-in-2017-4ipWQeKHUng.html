you're back at it again man
listen : face calm man make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man listen
we broke the mark this weekend man we
broke the 500 subscriber mark right now
I'm excited I just want to say to you
guys thank you
you guys did it now let's keep it going
man is let's get this you know just get
the flow going man we've been doing so
good man it's only a month and a half I
only have a month and a half in this
thing and you know I'm already killing
the game right now and that's because of
you guys but yeah man so people been
asking me anyways how about like what
courses do I use right on udemy and
first of all before I do that I want to
explain to you guys something remember I
made that video uh wrong you know close
to New Year's where I said basically hey
I want to be able to help out other
students and be able to give up free on
udemy courses and you know give our
laptops give them you know at least
digitalocean
subscriptions for free the way I'm going
to do that is by basically you know
giving them what I earned from YouTube
right and that's what I want to do like
you know I want to help out people in
the hood I want to help out people in
you know in areas where they think like
oh you can't make it out or like you
know people India people in Africa
people in Latin America like we're very
lucky here in the u.s. man and like you
know we have access to so much but
there's people out there that they just
trying to make a living and I'm gonna
help those people out and I'm gonna help
people here in the United States too
because everybody thinks that you know
we all good and you know black white
whatever nobody's doing good right now
you know everybody the economy is a
really up people say that there's
jobs but it's only jobs you can
survive with nine dollars an hour you
can't survive being a dishwasher you
can't survive being a you know parking
somebody's car
like you can't survive with that man and
my goal here with YouTube is to
basically help
those people out man you know what I
mean and do the switch so yeah and
anyway so um here so from this links
that I'm about to give you I make I
think a dollar a dollar 50 or something
like that so that's completely fine I'm
looking forward to you know using that
money and basically helping people out
but at the same time I'm going to give
you my you know my top five courses that
I actually used so remember I was
telling you guys about
you have to learn PHP like this is how I
learn PHP right with this guy uh of
course that they're a little bit like
code Academy and I search on YouTube but
where I learned everything it was here
man this guy he gives you nine and a
half hours of of material and it's like
it's like he's like one of the top-rated
instructors of
you know I was like you know back-end
languages oh you mean the guy is killing
it right now
the course is usually $175 and now
because I'm giving you guys this link is
15 dollars man so you know what I mean
make sure you check out this course man
for $15 you can't go wrong man you're
investing into your future and then you
have this other course there's for
people who have no experience at all or
if you have no experience at all with
anything I would say take this course
man $15 HTML CSS JavaScript node and a
whole bunch of information like CSS
bootstrap now you're gonna get
everything man like 42 hours of material
you don't even get that or any channel
on YouTube like I'm being honest I don't
have that much content in my my channel
nobody on YouTube has that much content
Plus this guy he's like he's really like
you know pretty famous in the industry
you know he actually they hired him to
basically you know go into the boot
camps and basically help them out with
with their whole programming and I could
make courses right but like I told you
guys paying $20,000 for a boot camp it's
not worth it man I'm telling you right
now I rather pay this guy what I paid
right now you guys are getting for $15 I
paid $200 for this course when I came
out all right and this guy is like Glee
jig like no class updating January 20 On
January 2017 so that means he just added
more into the course like this guy
you're not gonna get that for nowhere
else trust me man like you're gonna get
expressed mongodb but he got the whole
like came and explained it to you guys
man
you guys just got a bite of course trust
me and of course let's see we got
JavaScript understanding the way apart
listen if you want to know about
JavaScript this is the course are you
going to take this guy goes so and deaf
into it that I'll be honest with you
guys this is a like a beginners course
this is like somebody if you already
know JavaScript and you want to take it
to the next level this is the guy just
got Anthony able to say I think he's
Brazilian the dude is amazing like I
haven't seen no other course like his
like he goes showing that's into it like
there's no way that anybody else could
even beat this course 11 hours of like
just JavaScript like I'm not talking
about little jquery's or doing little
sliders I'm talking about like vanilla
JavaScript just learning JavaScript from
the scratch from like you know
everything variables everything in a
objects in I can't go in into it man
like you just gotta take him plus like I
told you that um this courses you could
take the course and if you feel like
it's too difficult or you just don't
like it
returning I've done it a million times
I'll be honest with you guys questions
that don't like I just go and get a
refund and they send me my money back in
three days
is that simple like of course you only
get 30 days money-back guarantee if you
want to game the system
I don't know that's on you but don't do
it guys because if you learn something
give this guy $15 you got understand he
you know me probably for promoting this
this course I probably get like a dollar
50 freaking udemy takes like two-thirds
of whatever he made so in reality he
probably makes six dollars so help the
guy out six dollars is not bad plus
sixty thousand people have bought this
course like that's not a small number
trust me man like he's like legit like
he goes into everything every single
thing that you could think of in
JavaScript he explains it you're like
okay I don't want to talk about it
number because this course is so deep
that I came to explain it
alright now you got this one Stifel
gratis is my favorite my favorite of all
time any instructor or time like I
freaking love this guy like I'm not like
I love this god this guy I've learned so
much from this guy like it's not even
funny man like if you already know
JavaScript and you want to learn es6
javascript which is the new javascript
and you want to stay in and basically up
to date with the the industry and where
the industry is going you gotta buy this
course like I'm going to make a DSS
course later on myself here on YouTube
but I don't even know if I'm gonna be
able to beat what this guy you know what
this guy has like I'm being honest like
this guy is frequently jig like I don't
know I wish I could just like hang out
with it like straight up just just so I
could learn cuz I don't know how he he
knows so many languages like he has so
many other courses too like this guy's
like super legit
and then from there the guy that told me
react like it was him he taught me
reacting like I don't know man I came in
explaining to you guys like this guy is
so good like look at that best-selling
course I want you to meet this guy so
freaking amazing 14 hours of freaking
video like for $15 guys like
I don't know I don't know what to say
man like $15 if you can't spend $15 on a
course and I'm not talking about guys in
developing countries you know frickin
Africa Latin America for a game you know
wherever you act I'm talking about us he
says come on guys
$15 that's like one McDonald's and and
extra-large french fries
come on it's not that much man like
invest in yourself so you could you know
in a year from now probably even less
you can start getting a job in six
months from now you know what I mean
like take you know take this time learn
all this courses because there's so much
material here not being honest there's
no way that you can finish it in a week
you're gonna need a month like this
course is on long and like but they're
like super stuff like you don't need to
go to a boot camp you don't need to go
to anywhere like you take this courses
you get these five courses and like
straight up or just buy one I would say
right now if you're you're starting off
and this is your first time buying or
udemy course by the pH PMI sequence that
one's going to be good for you and
you're gonna be able to be good for now
as you you know you get your feet wet
and you like oh I like this I like this
courses keep on buying for the
full-stack nodejs
and then I will say keep on buying the
rest when you have a time and you feel
like you're ready at the same time guys
please come back to my channel if you
decide to buy a week from now two weeks
from now three weeks from now buy it
from the link that I'm giving you guys
that's going to be in the description
where I'm going to put it somewhere
around on the YouTube channel um so you
guys could buy the course because this
is not only helping me it's helping the
people that are watching these videos
who basically did they come from nowhere
like they coming from like places where
they can't afford all other stuff and
it's like we all in a community right
now where we all should help each other
out like I'm helping you guys out and
when you help me out I help out the guys
who are on this channel too that they
can't afford a freaking laptop I have a
guy who was telling me that he has to
pay like two dollars he has to pay two
dollars to go to a MMA cafe to be able
to watch these videos right here man
like I'm being honest like that
breaks my heart like just knowing that
somebody is going out of his way to pay
$2 to be able to watch my videos because
he don't even have a computer herself
like do you know how crazy that sounds
and we like in 2017 like he has to pay
$2 and for us $2 is nothing but in his
country and Bangladesh like I don't know
how much is that but I could imagine
that's a lot of money I'm from Dominican
Republic and I know that 2 dollars is
about 90 purchase Wondrich pesos so for
them their economy is even worse than VR
they probably who knows how much money
that is imagine for you to go use a
computer you gotta pay $100 $150 like
come on you know how crazy that sounds
so I'm trying to help out those people
like okay I'm not rich I wish I was rich
and I could you know help out everybody
and give them money back
I'll give stuff out to every single
person but the only way that I'm going
to be able to help people out it's
through this channeling you know little
links like this and me giving out half
of whatever I earn on YouTube that's the
only way that I'm going to be able to
help them out because at the same time I
have a family I have a kid on the way I
have a fiance who I'm about to get marry
soon you know what I mean but yeah oh
yeah so it's like come on guys you know
help me out help people out in the
channel endless you know this get this
going guys like straight up guys know
I've been making videos for a while now
I'm not here asking you
anything the only reason why I'm giving
out this does udemy courses here this
information about udemy courses because
people have asked me if you look at the
comments you see that people keep on
asking me about you to me courses and
then I actually found out that if I give
all this links Arco action make a dollar
out of the cell so if you actually a fan
of mine as a fan of of the channel just
buy it from here man and so we could
help out other you know fellow
developers just like us that you know
they have if you guys think you guys
have it batting somebody hit me up with
story to where they're like hey man I'm
freaking I'm like washing dishes and
doing all this stuff I'm trying to
switch up my careers like you know it
 sucks that we have to be doing
type of jobs like that but now imagine
this something some guy out there trying
to better himself he don't even have a
computer you don't even have a
smartphone he has to spend a hundred
dollars imagining his and his currency
imagine he has to spend a hundred
dollars to go to a freakin internet cafe
and spend two hours there watch my
videos and somehow learn how to code
come on like that you know what I mean
going guys
