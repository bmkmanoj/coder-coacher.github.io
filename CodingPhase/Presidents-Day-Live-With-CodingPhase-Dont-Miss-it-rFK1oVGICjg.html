Joseph
Torres quagle Vic Vic Griff knows that
new member
what up how you doing man how you doing
man yeah we here we live man we enjoy
this day old friend you guys is off
today man a lot of you guys that work I
mean I work but you know me I'm on
schedule okay we gotta I'm trying to get
this new device that is for my camera so
you guys gonna have our way better
quality when you guys seen your live
streams from now on it's gonna be pretty
good man yeah man
go over algorithms I'm gonna go over
algorithm
one day I'm not a mood to be doing that
right now I got a lot of good news guys
listen if you check on my description
there's a link that's gonna give you 55%
off right now you might say hey Joe you
usually do 50% off why there's a little
5% is gonna make a big difference yes it
makes a big difference you know in the
long term it makes a big difference
right you get to save a lot and you come
in you know kill the game man you know
what I'm saying that you come in to the
website get to learn there's a lot of
cool projects aren't working on
currently knocking out this new react
project that I'm building with you guys
which is about recreating a Craigslist
clone so we building Craigslist but
we're building it in a way that it's
gonna be nice and modern because if you
ever been to Craigslist calm you know
that it looks horrible it looks like a
1990s web site but now we pretty much we
created something legit something
amazing something that you can put on
your portfolio site that you could be
proud of all right so we got bad news
all right then from there we got a
couple of other stuff that we're doing
you know somebody told me Joe why don't
you do some tight Don why don't you you
know like teach it to us because there's
people that's really interesting in
Python right now because I don't believe
that Python is let's say quote unquote
the best language for you know web
programming for building websites and
building web applications what I'm doing
is I'm going to create the course I'm
gonna create a series here before
YouTube completely free you know
completely free you guys don't have to
go and pay thousands of dollars to go
learn Python software like you're gonna
learn here with me which is boy coding
phase calm right now this is the way how
we gonna come in
you know help the community out the way
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set it up in a
way I started recording them last night
I did a whole bunch of videos something
like twelve videos already um each one
it's like 10 minutes long so it's like
what that's like 120 minutes so that's
like what like two hours already of
content so what I'm doing is I'm
releasing one video per day on YouTube
completely for free well on my website
is gonna be already there whatever I did
I'm gonna say if for example tomorrow I
release I guess video number one of
Python right when you go to my website
it's gonna be up to video number 20
right so you're gonna have access to
everything automatically if you go to my
website for free all right all you have
to do is just register now the people
that just want to see your on YouTube
one they want to discover our content
and YouTube they're gonna see it you
know one at a time day by day one video
per day so that's how it's gonna go down
right but if you go to the website you
registers automatically is like it's
like Netflix you go in there if I had
you can binge watch the whole thing if
you watch it here on YouTube is gonna be
like regular TV you watch one video per
day so there's a lot of cool stuff you
know and the main reason why I want
people to start learning some pythons is
not really to do what is so we could get
you guys comfortable to start building
you know applications and at the same
time you know we're gonna go into gold
ah I don't know if you guys have heard
of this so there's a game engine and
they use something called G I think it's
GD script which is pretty much Python
right so I'm gonna teach you Python to
pretty much like we knew into gold ah
all right now
this is like a freebie right this is
like a freebie for people right a lot of
you guys you want to become a web
developer all my courses are there right
this is just an extra content that I'll
do it for you too all right this is
extra content that I'm doing for YouTube
so for people to have something to look
forward you know because now every
single day I can come here and you know
answer questions every single day right
I still want to drop one video per day
every single day of the year right so
you know sometimes people don't send me
questions that's why I tell you guys
send me questions I mean what questions
to my website or send me questions or my
email coding phase at gmail.com because
there's only so much that I can talk
about you get what I'm saying
I don't wanna be talking about the same
thing over and over again I don't want
to be doing here's the top ten
programming languages and it's like I
don't want to be doing that right I like
to create for original content I like to
give you guys original concept when you
come in we talk about something that we
didn't talk about last week right so the
way to do this is by answering your
questions when you send me questions I
answer them and then from there you know
I help you guys out and we create great
content here on YouTube so yeah man
that's what we're doing right now
we also promoted this coupon code go to
the website literally on my description
take fifty five percent off man
that's a lot man you know instead of
your paying $20 per month you could pay
nine dollars per month like that's a big
difference you know that's a $11 safe
right instead of you paying you know two
hundred dollars per month
peanut not per month per year you can
say hey I'm gonna pay $90 you gotta say
like it's a big difference right so yeah
man so we ain't here man so what's good
so add Monty any questions guys sent me
send me some questions right now let's
talk about it man
see what is dotnet development dotnet
development is just C sharp right and
basically Microsoft has Azure framework
his own system that they created years
ago so pretty much you use C sharp to
build on the back end for web
applications that's pretty much it it's
nothing crazy so we'll eros I had the
same question as a big brick because I
was gonna start when it comes to making
my own project so what was the question
you're John mutters that somebody moved
it up let me see if I find the question
I want to answer it so let me move to
see it's inside can't find my own window
okay so OBS and I'll put it here on this
window and the browser I'm gonna put in
this window okay so let me look at the
the comment that Vic said so Vic said
your Joe about to start jQuery or steals
bootcamp I still struggle in coming up
with ways on how to use JavaScript for
our projects what's the best way to
practice well think about I like this
javascript is the interactivity of the
website right without JavaScript there's
nothing that clicking there's no action
right like you could click on things and
the most that you can do is like submit
a form or click on a link that's about
it that's the only interactivity
now sometimes you can also do like a
little hover effect if you hover with
the mouse on top of the enemy but that's
about it but like let's say for example
you have an element right you want to
create a model okay so you'd have a
gallery and you say okay this is one
picture one picture one picture right
now you should create this like the
first project that you should try to do
there is like the easiest thing that'll
tell you which jQuery when you click on
the image right take the image and
create a element
just called the mold it's like a little
pop-up right and what you need to do is
take the image that you have here right
ICTA the URL of the image when you click
on it you say okay when I click this
image take the URL of the image tag
right take the source of the image tag
and then now you put it inside of an
element and you basically say hey create
this element of this this model and put
the imaging salary that's that's easiest
project that you can do there from then
the next project that you can do you can
say hey well if jQuery I want to create
a drop-down menu okay you do that right
there from there you say hey I want to
create a menu that pops up when I click
on a part right so you click on a button
and the many comes from the left
although many comes from the right
whatever you decide what's another
project that you could do something very
simple to get you started you could
create a slider right so let's say for
example you have four four images right
or four elements right you say inside of
this element there's four let's say for
example keep it very simple let's say
400 pixels right but inside of the
element you say hey I only want this
view to be 100% 100% of that the view
the view size right and then you say
hitting right you put heading around it
and now you see this element is gonna be
100 pixels right so now because there's
400 pixels with jQuery you could say hey
I want to move the elements to the left
100% so what that does is it slides one
element to the left and all the other
elements is gonna move to the left okay
like that's what I'm easiest way to to
create a very simple slider it's like
there's so many different ways I
actually created that if you go to my
website you literally can see that on
the restaurant web app we did a a slider
there's a couple of other places that we
dis fires it's super simple right now
you got
look at websites right how I learned to
code as a self-taught developer is by
looking at websites all right and say
hey man how can I do that right so you
start studying what the person did you
break things down okay
so I will recommend go to tell me right
now
I know this is a little bit more
advanced but is good because it's like
you get to see what's possible so you go
to a Ward's comm right and let's say
from here I wanna see if we find a going
website so no me too too much
well there's a little bit more advanced
state what you need to see I mean you
could check this website a awards and
find websites that you are interested on
you say okay how did they did this
things right or you could go to code pen
the i/o where you could actually see the
things that people created so you're
gonna cope and a hot yoga and say for
example drop-down menu a new subscribers
let's go
okay so drop-down menu and you can do
with CSS but you search deeper okay you
click here and as you can see you see
will think they're here so it says drop
a mouse over drop down and show 300 the
mouse leave drop down in height now you
can actually do this with just CSS but
at the same time you can start looking
at what other people did right and then
you start breaking it down and then now
you recreate it on your own way so I
mean that's how I know right when I
started building my very first web site
Dragon Ball Z right I used to go to this
website
oh let's see if I could find it it was
called saying item right and it's crazy
that this guy still to this day saying I
am saying I write to this day this guy
still creates content but he makes
thousands of dollars per month right
this is one of the most famous websites
alright so I'm gonna share this and this
website look the shape but he's been
around for so long like you see he got
advertising here he makes money
I know this his website is I super old
but he makes money and then from day is
transferred to Naruto Bleach one one
piece whatever but I'm gonna see web
time machine okay
when I first started man I'm gonna show
you his website was the first website
that I I cop okay
see he's been around since 2002 2017 man
like it's crazy
alright so this is back in 2001 2001
this is let's see how his website
instantly let this is no fun love it
it's going way back way back into time
okay all right so this is Adam Michelle
a lot let me try it
2002 it was around 2001 2002 and you see
if I can find it
look this is crazy inside of website
used to look and then this I used to get
used to get transferred like people who
come in and send you like traffic you
would you would join up a banner network
and basically they will send you traffic
like this I don't even type 100 let's
see if that comes up man I'm trying to
show you guys nice to see like it's
crazy I look back on it and it's like
man this is how you like when you're a
little kid and you want to become
something like you guess you don't man
yeah so this is how the
website look I mean the image is not
there but this was exactly how the
website used to look my first website
was something like this is like you have
the Dragon Ball Z banner here you have
the links here on the side you have like
news here all right
that's like exactly how my website used
to look back then I'm talking about 2001
2002 so it's like the way hilar was to
go into his coat and pretty much copy
like I'm being honest I used to just
copy his coat and bear just change the
images so all the way but that's back
then right but that's how I learned HTML
back then you know I didn't really learn
CSS codes back then you used to put the
CSS inside of each element saying we
have some people doing our react you do
everything all the styles in line that's
how you used to do it back then there
wasn't a separate CSS file back then
like nobody used to do it you know but
now it's like you go to a website that
you like you look how they build it and
yeah that's a yeah there was another
website so that I used to pretty much
never from down you know at some point I
used to work with uh with the guy Planet
Namek calm this was also one of my very
first websites that I worked on I'm
suddenly I was like 14 14 years old you
know we're gonna show you right now and
it sucks you know what sucks that my
website my original website which used
to be my very first website was Majin -
ooh
dot-com and I imagine imagine decibel
dotnet and pretty much I don't know why
it's not on way back I guess it was so
short like I had a for a short amount of
time my gosh
creating and then I don't know like I
remember my mom took away the credit
card like I don't know like three months
after cuz they were charging me like
crazy
so yeah so I get I can't even show you
guys my original website it don't even
show well but yeah man so that's how you
learn man that's how to fire projects
you gotta go in there man and just like
find something you're interesting on
right you like hiking create a website
about hiking create you know a little
gallery cover create a little slider
things like that you start building and
from there that's how you build your own
projects let me see ya Joe let me see
what else my rearrange ill says yo stop
stop remote and start start building
this amazing you don't need to be here
sorry Mario you know I was like that's
how it is man unfortunately that's what
we're doing today man we're promoting
today is a promotional day today's a day
of answering questions helping people
out but the same time we're promoting
the code because people constantly tell
me Joe can I get this cheaper can I do
this and that and it's like okay so
here's the code to get a cheaper you
gonna say so yeah man so I'm sorry Mario
if you don't like it there's that
there's the X bar somewhere it should be
like while I go on that side the X
button for Windows cuz you know I'm
pretty sure you have a Windows where's
the expiring on Windows I know for Mac
the little red button is somewhere
around there but for Windows users gotta
be up there somewhere
that's the x-plane you could just X this
out and get out of here all right
see the Jena Malone it depends you
should check out sublime unless you work
for yourself then doesn't matter the
best choice is the same not joking I
don't like doing I don't like a lot of
stuff it's just like text-based things
like just like I like user interface I
like colors I like doing sound look
pretty I like things that you know keep
me coming back I like the fact that Adam
has like a million packages like
yesterday I was like yo I wonder if
there's a package for GT script and
literally right there there was a
package for GT script I was like man I
wonder if there's a package for four
prettier on Adam and there was a package
for prettier on Adam so I was like you
know I mean it's like you can't go wrong
you try to do that home on vs code sorry
buddy it's not gonna be there 90% of the
packages that are on Adam are not on or
vs code because people don't want to go
through the hassle of going to all the
walls that Microsoft puts in front of
you to release a package or even a Dean
like there's a million themes on
freaking out like the way how you can
customize Adam man I would not trade it
for anything man Joe Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver and Muse do people use these
programs or is there a lazy way the
people that use Muse right these people
are use mules is usually designers who
want to come up and pretty much
prototype something that they designed
right you want to show to a client hey
he is on your websites gonna look you
click here and it takes it to the next
page so that's how it works all right
professionally nobody really does that
nobody comes in and say hey whatever we
use or Muse has to find a website nobody
does that
at all let me see when I started was
every scene there was one every scene
was getting big winter has
yeah I started way way back I started
when there was like websites look
horrible I started when there was no CSS
like a CSS file I started when they was
just in line I started when there was no
CSS great there was no no flex boxes I
started when there was tables right the
people that have been around for many
you know it's like the other day
somebody left me in comments like you
know I was like Joe you know cuz the
video I'll say hey what do I know
you know what I mean I was joking around
like what do I know like I don't know
anything about this I just started
yesterday and there's like bro I've been
doing this for so long
like it will spin your head right now I
started professional in 2012 I know in
2011 my first job I got in 2012 right we
are in 2018 now if I start our 14
building websites and I know how
websites work even from back then and
then I started doing it professionally
in 2011 professionally right because you
can build websites on your own but
you're not a professional
until you working at a company a lot of
you guys think like hey I'm really nice
a great developer no you're still just
you're doing this thing as a half you
still have an eye on a job still haven't
worked anywhere you're on the internet
writing opinions about things that you
don't even know yet you're not a
professional you right you're a
professional when you're getting money
in your pocket and say hey man you just
got paid hey man you you know you
freaking you have something on your
resume right but I was like telling this
or my bro like I've been doing this for
so long it's like you're not immediately
it's been a while man let me see what I
was let me see - Chi Chi chair I'm
reading everybody's things
Joseph that is cheating yourself what oh
let me see I use jQuery three times then
quit
the Aquarius nice man jQuery it was a
blessing when it came out man
you know to this day people are still
pissed off that people are using other
frameworks for for things that you could
have done with jQuery and it's kind of
true like this things that even now
we're using frameworks for stuff that
when you think about it man
you could have done this with just
JavaScript like we didn't even need a
framework all right but if you know a
lot of these frameworks they come in and
give you a little something extra a
little bells and whistles you know but
so be honest with you man you know so be
honest would you like this like a lot of
stuff out there man but yeah let me see
the presidency cause a blind person who
prefer visuals to be a co sure they were
creating 2016 I'm just reading down the
line of comments I'm sorry I'm trying to
catch up to whatever is on the screen so
we've got actually answered things live
as they pop up here on the view and I
see Jenna what up I see Harry what up
I'm trying to get there every let me get
there I'm reading everybody's things I'm
late
missing clone you original website
coding fees just enrolling your courses
do I have to go through all your courses
before I jump into the projects like the
restaurant web app um big rig that's a
big rig sorry maker if that's a good
question do you have to wait before you
start doing a project if you know HTML
CSS why would you go to HTML CSS
building a cool social media side right
if you already know that you don't need
to do that somebody send me a message
about there I'm gonna do a video about
it so I'm gonna talk about it a little
bit here but
for video on it later on do you have to
go in and do something that you already
know no right you do it if you feel like
you want to do it you want to get the
extra practice right so if you already
like act like JavaScript and you already
passed jQuery so go ahead start learning
react start building the restaurant
but the web app you know do hi Brad like
do those projects because you already
passed up getting stuff right but you
have to answer to yourself like are you
ready to move on from that because the
same way how this girl has sent me a
message she was telling me hey I I'm
taking the what developers bootcamp and
pretty much I finished the HTML CSS part
do I have to do your HTML CSS part when
I go to your website and I said that's
up to you
are you done with HTML CSS if I show you
a design can you build it right if you
say hey I could build any design you
throw at me Joe don't do it on HTML CSS
cuz you already passed that right what
if you're still not comfortable of
course do the HTML CSS even if you don't
do the project just to review it or even
to like listen to it while you drive it
or like for example like just to go over
certain things it's fine to go back you
know because the the problem is that
people think like this thing is like
Netflix this thing is not like Netflix
guys this is not like oh we watched one
episode and you're like oh we're ready
to move on well you're not ready to move
on yet you gotta answer that to yourself
you gotta be like hey you asked like hey
am I ready to move on from CSS can I
build anything that anybody closer if
they can if anything that they throw at
you you could build it go ahead and move
on from that very same thing else with
JavaScript if somebody comes in and
tells you hey man do you understand
function is very interesting loose do
you understand
very
arguments methods do you understand
object-oriented programming with
JavaScript if you understand those
things move on it's time for jQuery hey
if you understand jQuery we like this
because you already know everything in
JavaScript you say okay cool jQuery
saves me time jump to react you know
what I'm saying like you have to answer
that to yourself I can't answer it for
you yeah man yes sir I'm live right now
man let me see what else what else
so I'm greedy I'm trying to get to Henry
cuz Henry has a question things that I'm
ignoring him what is because I'm still
reading comments and you know let me see
that horn says anyone here uses Joe's
courses on coding phase how is it is it
worth 100 a year personally I mean it's
my website I mean I don't know if I can
answer that but I will say I started in
July right there's people that have
signed up from July till this thing
today so that's why that's like a lot of
months right and those people have been
satisfied enough to stay on the website
for a very long time the people that
cancel their subscription are about
eight percent of the people that sign up
to the website most of the people stay
on because I'm constantly creating
projects for you that just guide you in
real life events real life situations
that you're gonna learn from right and
then not only that that once you get
your job I have a couple of people that
they already got jobs right and they
still come back and still build projects
with me because on projects that I'm
building ourselves that they still are
using for their jobs right like somebody
hit me up the other day like hey Joe can
we go over react router and this and
that I just
that's what I'm working right now the
Craigslist claw doing the react router a
full application building Craigslist and
use a react router using no DES using
javascript HTML CSS and basically we
reinforce him whatever he learned from
before on the website reinforcing it
while also teaching him new stuff and
basically he's using the skills that
he's using right now that he's learning
he's using it for his job at this very
moment right he's texting me ran out of
yo come on I want you to finish this
project because I'm working with this
stuff on my own job and it's like I'm
learning here for you at the same time
so it's like you know it makes you think
like is it worth it it is worth it to me
if I had somebody who was doing the same
thing that I'm doing you know five six
years ago I would just subscribe and
signed up that's just being honest right
because one of the things that you you
find it is number one that you could say
hey this is a problem and this is one of
the main reasons why a lot of people
sign up to Kansas number one you don't
get somebody that's gonna answer your
questions number two you don't have like
a friend who you can call up in May
hey I'm stuck here can you help me out
with this like people email me if I can
help them out and it's not something
about their their Windows computer 99%
of the time weak strong the problem
right a lot of times of issues with
their own computers up in like a man I
can't help you out you gotta learn how
to debug your computer right but
everything when it comes to the code we
hash things out you know we help people
out and it's just me right and I got
over 2,000 members on the website right
and it keeps on growing every single
date keeps on growing
just today I believe 17 new people
signed up right seventeen new people
signed up so 70 new members right so
they're gonna be here for a long time
because I'm constantly coming in and
creating new content for them right
whatever new framework comes up I'm
going to create the courses for
right all this stuff is like I said to
you guys once you get to a certain level
of like you know understanding how web
development works all of these
technologies doesn't matter what
technology comes out I learned that like
this and I can break it down for you in
an easier way than somebody else would
most people will teach it to you the way
how the documentation is right but why
would you teach it like it was in the
documentation when the person can go and
get the documentation for free you gotta
say so I say when you pay for service is
for the person to break down something
that was difficult for you and breaks it
down in an easier way where you can say
oh this clicks alright so it's up to you
if you want to subscribe or not but yeah
Henry what's the question I can't find
your question hurry you're Jo I've been
dabbling with going and I love it what
do you think is the future of gold man
coding phase am I wasting my time I
think golden if you come in and you say
hey man I have a flag right I have a
plan of coding for a year or two right
and you're really working as a developer
and say hey I'm building projects I'm
knocking things out then Goulding is
gonna be great for me right for the long
term in your career because golden
they're paying a lot of money paying up
to a hundred thousand I've seen
sometimes even like two hundred forty
thousand dollars for gold and developers
so that means like that's twice as much
as a high-paying developer right so you
you know the most of all most people is
gonna make here it's like 120,000 right
and that's like I get peak right and
that's just being honest that's the if
you work at it at a big company that's
like your peak and you stay there for
five years you might make one hundred
forty thousand fifty thousand that's if
you stay in that company for a long time
right but think about it there's guys
out there was gold named making two
hundred and forty thousand dollars now
take this into account this is not just
some regular dude who's getting this
there's are
$240,000 guys anything above $100,000
they gotta test this right that's
just being honest they gotta test the
shadow you gotta go to the whole process
of answering a million algorithms you
gotta have a whole bunch of projects you
gotta have a whole bunch of companies
that you've worked on as a senior level
developer so golang is more for let's
say someone who's been around for a long
time all right
somebody was like okay they're on this
seventh eighth year tang fear and like
you know what I'm tired of doing HP for
ten years I already have to sting onto
my belt
I've been doing this for whatever I
worked at XYZ company I worked at ABC
company right so now you've got that
crazy resume right so there's like now
you come in and our company is gonna
give you that chance right to look so
hire me but to be honest as a junior
developer that's not a job that people's
never just be like hey man hey we did a
junior developer is like now it's like
most of the jobs that are working with
golden is complicated you know complex
problems it's not like something that we
say hey we need somebody who go in there
and go ahead and create just a little
REST API it's like nah there's more
complex things you know I mean so long
term is gonna pay off if you start now
it's gonna pay off
but don't expect to be like hey man
we'll find a job next month with like
that's not working like that
Chris Sean is in here I'm super late I'm
trying to read all the stuff I saw I
apologize I'm gonna read everybody's
things I don't want to skip nobody's
questions or answers and let me see
happy Presidents Day everybody man yes
sir man listen guys 55% off you know how
to find this anywhere look at all the
other instructors competitors whatever
you want to call it
Oh guys who do code are liable teach
code online guys
find their subscriptions how much it is
how much they paid per month how much
they pay per year guys what I do here is
like charity you can pretty much call it
nobody does it at this price at all
maybe the only person that I've seen
that have guard this cheap is a lower
caste that's 8 and that's because he has
to support of laravel so the Larry Bell
sends people to Larry caste calm so he
gets like hundreds of thousands he has
hundreds of thousands of members so he's
like Amen if I have hundreds of
thousands of members I'll put that unit
at $2 a month you know what I'm saying
but that's not that's not really that's
not the reality of things right but here
man so take advantage on the link on the
description you click that link 55% off
man so we in here let me see good good
CACO no face calm and curious truth
Carol Lawrence I'm reading everybody's
stuff man what is the opinion on next
Jay yes I've heard of me a little take a
look to be sure that that's what I'm
thinking about
next stop Jay yes that's the framework
server side rendering okay so what is
this it is like nodejs another framework
from OGS oh oh this is the thing that I
saw like a few years ago Universal what
I see a sense import chromosomes okay I
don't know they're not clear about what
the hell is next ideas so I don't know
to be honest with you I don't keep track
of every single thing that's under the
Sun
because there's a lot of stuff that a
lot of services that's like there's
another service just like this already
so I was like why would anybody switch
up to now using next GES or even at that
why would a developer who knows how to
build their own web pack of gold for you
know their own process right why would
they use somebody else's thing and lose
the ability to actually customize it to
your own way right sometimes a lot of
the services it's just like parcel Jes
right parcel Diaz everyone's a oh man
it's so great like even I created a
small course of body and after trying it
and building like a couple of projects
on arrows like this is dumb my what
developer started is a hundred times
better than this cuz I can customize it
and do whatever I want
freaking parcel Jes is only good for
like two things building a reactor and
building a huge EES app and maybe an
angular like single page apps that's it
like you don't have no control of
customizing where things go where things
are going to be compiled to lose like
why would you use that service so next J
yes it's not next for me let me see what
else I'm reading we got snugs in here
says yeah man I work with one of the top
golden developers tool it's like five
times smarter than me say the golden
devs are smarter than him these these
does create Linux on see ya like that's
what's ailing like you know it's like
it's loves to these things like guys
like this level since you are next one
from meek Millz levels to this like this
level solution
you don't know same thing I feel what
development is the starting point right
what the minima is the starting point
right it's the easiest thing you could
get into you could come in and say hey
I'm gonna learn HTML CSS JavaScript done
you got that done in a few months you
got
we're going you get to pay your bills in
this and that now as you continue to
grow and you start challenging yourself
you say okay I know what development
right that's where I'm at right now
right so I'm like I've been doing this
for five six years professionally
somebody okay what's next for me right
that's why I started teaching it to you
guys because I'm like I could break down
all the stuff that took me a long time
to learn and even now when I see other
people's tutorials of courses they make
things that are so easy seem complicated
I'm like I can come in and build it
easier for people to learn especially as
a self-taught developer right so that
was my first challenge right my second
challenge now is to actually transfer
from doing just what development we're
now building applications focusing more
on building applications or focusing
more on building game develop you know
games so focusing on came to fund those
are the two things that I haven't
challenged for myself down like y'all I
challenge you Joe to become a game
developer get paid the most that you can
and then just check that off your list
right so that's my goal right now okay I
have a lot of things that I'm doing with
coding face calm and creating all the
course and other stuff but at the same
time that's like a personal goal am I
gonna finish it am I gonna be able to go
to like EA am I gonna be able to go to
rock star or Bungie I don't know I want
to challenge myself to be able to go to
today I know all right so there's guys
out there that they their challenges is
way higher than that they're like hey
man how can we create an operating
system like that's a little bit too
advanced for me that's like everyone
like okay he likes to keep that right
when guys come in and be like how can we
build a robot and do this in that way
that's a little bit too events I'm not
going that deep you got what I'm saying
so there's guys out there that's doing
goal and that's like literally like
building distros building freaking
operating
like that's way too advanced from that's
like I'm not going in that deep for me I
feel like I got a life I got other
things that I gotta do you know like you
know even all these projects that I do
for code increased calm like I enjoyed
this more than me trying to reach this
ultimate a freaking goal of like
becoming like you know this top 20
developers in the world like I could
care less you know I mean like if
somebody comes in and tells me you shock
okay cool man I got money in my pocket
got Craig got a nice car about to buy
another nice car I'm freaking traveling
I'm doing whatever the hell I want you
know I mean like listen I'll make more
than freakin Facebook developers in this
lame town and you know what I mean like
that's how that's not that's my Awards
man that's where I come in everything
here job all the work that you did I
mean I look at my salaries between like
all the big companies I'm like man I'll
make more than those guys you know the
meaning that's that's my gold you know
what I mean so you gotta figure it out
see if you actually want to become like
a golden developer because it's like you
gotta you gotta go deep man it's not
gonna be that easy they paint you a lot
of money but it's like you gotta be the
top of top man you know so let's see
what else who else is in here man moon
stack I mean stack weren't stack the
mean stack is old man I feel like the
mean stack even saying mean stack
nowadays it seems old yeah but when you
think about is like eight man wasn't the
mean stack like popular like a year and
a half ago two years ago I was like
that's how it is in technology Manning
and freaking in the web right that's
what a lot of guys who don't like that
you see a lot of guys who wasn't
drinking purely organic something my mom
is for me it's like an iced tea /
lemonade yeah so how you call this thing
what was it
Digital jazz messed me up yeah so
technology just goes mad fast this goes
mad fast and that's why a lot of people
don't like the web - a lot of developers
don't like the work because they're
constantly creating new stuff every
single week and the reason why people do
that is because people are bored when
you you work as a web developer right
and you're like okay you get to a point
where you already understand everything
about web development you understand how
HTTP works how close requests get
requests put past whatever you know you
come in and you see how can we get
something that already works and
changing let's create graph QL just to
reinvent the wheel and create something
new
oh we have angular how about we create
react so then now you recreate something
that was already there and you say okay
cool same thing with PJs how can we try
to steal both markets in the game wait
what we take angular we take the best of
angular and we take the best of react
and then we just have a baby that they
cannot abort oh my god
great we have huge es all right so huge
a s is born all right so we got fusion
yes to this little nightfall so people
are bored right so people come in and
this only Gloria is like yo you look
crazy
now I'm just making an example I'm a
very visual person right so I'm giving
you the examples make some random guy
like taking frequent react and taking
angular and having a little baby Kool
view J yes
the baby's born you can't abort anymore
you know Plan B's not gonna work you
know
so that's how it is right so people are
bored let's be honest people are bored
you know a lot of times people say oh we
we're trying to innovate we're trying to
listen that no you just recreating the
wheel because there's only so much that
you can do and what about without
repeating yourself like for you guys
aren't coming into this industry like
one thing that you're gonna notice that
I'm gonna continue telling you this is
repetitive the same thing that you do in
PHP is the same thing that you do
washroom the same thing that you do with
Ruby on Rails is the same thing that you
gotta do with no G is the same thing
that you're gonna do we know D is the
same thing that you're gonna do with
that neck right you're doing the same
thing where you taking requests you're
sending out a JSON you sending out a
data you return him back of you you're
doing the same thing over and over and
over over over over again so what do
people do people get bored they say okay
now it's time to create a new framework
now it's time you know it's like I'm
smart I can create a new framework
that's gonna save too many seconds do
you need two extra two milliseconds no
do you have to come in and create a
brand new syntax for something that was
already there or like people come up
with things that is already easy on on
JavaScript right it's already easy on
JavaScript and they're like we need to
create a framework just for this little
thing it's like okay once again
recreating the wheel right but that's
why a lot of developers don't like what
about it and because they want to focus
on building projects like you know a lot
of you guys are probably frustrated
right with every time that you you think
like oh man finally you know somebody
send me a message like oh man finally I
learned
angular and you know took me six months
have really really learned angular and
then the next thing you know is like
sorry buddy now is angular two or four
and five you know what I mean and then
the next week is like sorry buddy I was
hot around the streets is react alright
so I was like the next thing is like
sorry buddy Harry Potter's here the
Harry Potter framework into Hermione CSS
bundle you know you got that her mighty
senior says bungu man you know and it's
like you know I was like now this is the
latest thing you know so now you gotta
stop everything that you do it and go
learn the Harry Potter framework what
the CSS won't do that you know so hey
man do you want to get the latest CSS
grid do you wanna write CSS grid with
one line download here - ESS alright do
you want to animate your thing's
freaking Hermione does that all you have
to do is add it to the classes in his
life this is the same thing that animate
Jes was to animate CSS was doing this
the same thing the angular was doing and
it's like great now I gotta come in and
learn it again you get what I'm saying
so but that's what development that's
what you guys are fighting for you know
I mean but at some point you're gonna
say Amen I want to challenge myself I
want to do other stuff I want to build
other things and that's when your love
for programming here for you know coding
it's gonna bring you into other
technologies and other frameworks
languages other things to do
you got what I'm saying but that's just
how it is
so yeah man let me see so who's in here
who else is in here man we got a lot of
people made a lot of people came by the
same without well do you recommend the
murray stack or react PHP react media
look react immediately away from meteor
for one simple reason unless you
your own startup unless you build on
your own projects meteor this barely I
mean meteor is that the same level as a
3GS there's like no jobs for those
things like nobody's looking for that
range so it was like if you decide to
become hey I want specialists on meteor
nobody's looking for that nobody you're
not gonna find it jobs is like we're
looking for specialism meteor you know
so it's like you're building something
and become an expert something that it's
like a hobby and people use as a
hobbyist it's interesting but nobody's
using right so I will say focus on react
plus PHP focus on even the myrn stack
you know nodejs use no tests to
basically create rest api's and that's
it you know what else
focus on Ruby on Rails and also to you
gotta find in your area right
cuz this is the thing somebody send me
chill dish there's no jobs for react in
my area
I'm like bro if there's no jobs for
react in your area then why would you
learn it like that's like a logical
thing you don't wanna say like when I
come in and I searched all over the US
all the major cities I go and check on
random smaller cities that are outside
of major cities around the u.s.
basically what I do is I do the research
right but if you live in wasn't Wichita
- Wichita with which it Iike what's the
name of that missing shitty car was it
funny what's your top you live on or
Wichita freakin Kansas right
if you live in Wichita Kansas and they
have only dotnet and angular jobs the
logical thing would be for you to learn
angular like what I come when I come in
and give you guys something that's in
their advice right it does a general
purpose advice right it's not gonna fall
for 30%
it's not enough you know I come in now
give me an advice and for 30% of you
guys it just it doesn't work for you
guys cos the location that you live on
is not same as me or anybody or that
that I'm talking to or talking about it
in my videos you know so it's like you
have to do your research too you know so
yeah man um so yeah now let me read what
everybody says here I think I already
caught up
I think I'm reading I'm reading reading
reading Joe was no js' dying I don't
think that dying I think it's gone
stable I think it's more stable now
right the companies start going to use
multi s and they're gonna use it for
smaller AP is like let's say for me I
think if I have a company right and I
have a major website that it's already
built on PHP or already built in dotnet
right and I say hey man we need a little
small API that's gonna connect you know
how about with the server load and and
connect to the database to the iOS
applications and this and that I would
say hey let's not build a dotnet
application let's just use No - yes we
could do that with like a few number of
lines and like literally like two three
JavaScript files and you're good to go
and we create the REST API for the iOS
application right that's what people are
using it for right what people are
seeing online even with the merged stack
it's more of like people are trying to
force the idea of using no des for every
day and it's like most people most
companies are not using it for that
because they already have already
infrastructure is already set up so what
they're doing is they're using it just
for small API
using it for building a whole website in
you know server-side render your whole
website link now people are not using
that like that companies are not using
it like that
they use it like let's say one section
of their website maybe the cell oh cool
there's a new technology no GS let's
build a about paging you know a nodejs
people do that you know what I mean like
I thought that what was it Walmart or
something like that people were saying
oh Walmart was it one more I don't
remember Walmart or Walgreens one of
those two everybody was saying oh man
one more the whole website is billed no
Jay yes I'm like wait what like no I
looked into the the technology behind it
is like no it's like they have certain
sections of their websites that's being
you know powered by no genius but the
whole website is not known GS you know
what I'm saying so it's like sometimes
people come in and they think like that
I already know two yeses everywhere no
no genius is everywhere for smaller
api's and like smaller things that you
want to build quick right but when you
want to go like a full application most
companies are going to safe around right
the safer route of like hey we know this
works and we knows that there's already
been proven to work so they are gonna
choose Ruby on Rails laramie or.net like
it or not right Python like Django it
hasn't been proven yet people don't use
it that much there's a few companies
that use they out there and it's like
people think is I already uses Python
Google use Python it's like oh boy like
they the the way that they use it is
totally different than how a regular
company you use it you know what I'm
saying so it's like most companies are
not gonna choose Python to build their
website Plus on top of that there's not
that many what developers on who use
Python right most web developers they
use other languages like PHP freakin
JavaScript or you know Ruby on Rails
dotnet which is C sharp you know what I
mean so companies they want to go the
safe route all the time you always gotta
remember that you know no Jes is not the
safest round because a lot of things
happen things break and tricking
packages getting tricky and dropping
like there's so many things that
everything happens with nodejs I have a
friend of mine who who basically his
whole website somebody some idiot and it
is one thing sometimes you see things on
the internet that you like oh man we got
a jump on it right away
so some idiot built a website with no GS
and react or server-side rendering right
like three years ago when it was like
I'm alpha right when it wasn't the norm
like now people now they figured out the
best ways to do server-side rendering
they figured out the right libraries of
you know the whole shebang right some
idiot jumped on this thing for like
three years ago when nobody was doing it
right and then he built his major
website for this company and now my
friend works there and he tells me it's
not import constant problems in that
company the website be falling like it
be dropping sometimes no service they
freaking drive later they crash like he
don't even know exactly all the reasons
why it happens and it's because people
jumped on it way before it was even
stable right so now his whole job is
constantly killing bugs because somebody
decided to do this three years ago when
it was just like an alpha you gotta say
something
I feel no deus is more stable now
starting a website with no js' today
it's more stable because people have
already figured out all the errors and
all the problems but even at that
there's a whole bunch of issues there
was a poll that they did talking about
it and there was like a whole bunch of
issues there
like yo this is exactly why I will not
build like a client's application on a
non Jes server at all like somebody goes
in tells me hey could you create an API
that's gonna connect to my phone to my
full application I'll be like okay great
no Jes when somebody comes in and tells
me hey I want you to build me a website
ecommerce website for my business I'm
like I'm not touching and nothing else
but Ruby on Rails or lerigot because
they are proving they have been proven
to work you know and I'm pretty sure
dotnet have been proven to work you know
so anyways guys listen click on the
description guys man click on the
descriptions you got 55% off take

doing this for a while so you know I
just feel bad so let's talk about like
yo man I'm telling people sign up to the
website and it's like I wish I could if
I was to get some sponsors like the
other day
freaking or was a deaf man I've been
trying to hit me up like oh we want to
be a sponsor this and that and I was
like I'm not trying to promote a boot
camp when I know people can learn this
on their own for way less than that you
know what I mean like I could come in
and say hey guys you go sign up to Death
Mountain boot camp at the end of the
video and make the whole website for
free but now how many people are gonna
go sign up to the website to to the boot
camp and spend $20,000 I mean get
themselves in debt like that's not what
I want I want you to come in learn the
things that you need get your job you
know do something good for your family
and for yourself I'm not saying you know
so I'm you know I mean II just to try to
help you guys out there but yeah man we
here we got a couple of cool projects
coming up like I said we got the
Craigslist project that I'm building
right now I'm already way past half
halfway through let me see if I can show
it to you guys started kid I'm checking
the hyper app starter kit I'm doing some
some changes to that tool I'll fix that
up below me
Jake's Craigslist clone okay now we're
gonna do a loan
let me check it share my screen with you
guys so there's the project I'm building
come here duyan run watch the balls 3000
okay let me open up another terminal
because a server you know the node
server dot - yes oops
mister our server port 5000 and now
we're gonna come here C colon face calm
see localhost dowsing all right so this
is the site man this is the Craigslist
clone pretty much you get the whole
website let me bring this up a moment so
you can see you're gonna have a trending
section right here you're gonna have
both the links so you know the different
sections like in Craigslist comm come in
and say let's say for example New York
City for sale okay there's the there's
the sale category let me see
come here bones to be dollars and slash
cars and trucks come in you have all
this stuff all of the different items
well cars and focusing on the cars first
and then you're gonna be able to filter
here be able to change it you could
reset it update it I'm also working on
the next thing which is going to be the
details so you're gonna be able to say
and YC / for sale / cars trucks last
let's say 2012 BMW and then now this is
where we act today I'm basically gonna
do all the CSS for this page which is
I'm gonna open it up for you guys cold
those are projects
Gregson's clone public images so there's
the page that I'm doing next ok so it
has everything has a slider has a
gallery so pretty much when you click on
the image here it's gonna change the
image here and set it up to the location
of the slider
I was gonna have a map and a half all
this information coming in from the
backend and I don't know if I'm gonna
set up a section to actually post in the
classifieds because I don't really want
to connect it to what a title is I don't
really wanna connect to a database I
wanted to delete and static not really
static but just create the dummy data
for the server and then was react when
we do a get request or a post request
basically respond to that but I don't
want to connect to model DB or even my
sequel because I want to just focus on
the react side like this is not an
odious course this is strictly just
react okay so that's one of the things -
like I try to do on the website man Wow
something yeah so that's one of the
things that I'm trying to do for people
on the website it's like we focus on one
topic right if we don't learn PHP we're
gonna do everything with PHP right cuz
that's how you learn
if we're gonna do something for react
then you're gonna do everything wife
react and focus just or react like we
have no js' on this project but no des
is not a factor no des is like a second
everything that's there because we need
a server right so we're just focusing on
react react router just to enforce the
the things that you already have already
learned like you know from the react
cooking easy the real estate app and
then now on this project now you come in
and you actually you know get your
skills up and just continue your
practice and just a lot of people they
think like oh I finished one courses
like bro you just did one project you
think you've really no react like no no
you don't like you gotta build multiple
projects John says am i blocked
Johnny you're right there man we see you
Jason normal you know you don't know Joe
have created a bad habit of ripping off
other designs from dribble and begins
where I will be able to create my own
designs I am working well you have to
understand if you're gonna focus on
design then you gotta focus on this eye
right but right now you're focusing on
learning to code so is that you gotta
focus on the coding first and then later
on try to focus on design and you can
take some online courses on you know the
side principles color theory hierarchy
those things saying but is that you
gotta focus on one thing you can't do
too much man it's like right now if you
say hey man I'm gonna focus on the front
end the back end and design and it's
like bro you do it way too much you're
not gonna be able to do anything so as I
just take it easy if you're over here
building websites from dream will be
hats that's fine because your goal is to
get a job I don't know what's your
ultimate goal but your first goal should
be to get a job as a defender
right the easiest route is gonna be to
become a front-end developer as you
become more experienced you are apply
for becoming a back-end developer right
or even within the same company now they
start throwing you back in projects
right so now you're more of a full stack
you build your projects at home you help
out on your company in the back end and
the front end so now you got both skills
and your next job you can say hey I want
to go and become a full-stack developer
at a company all right play if you come
in and say hey I'm learning I just
learned a few HTML Javascript stuff and
then now I'm doing a little PHP stuff at
that now I'm doing no GS and now I'm
doing with your browser now I'm good
doesn't that and then now that I want to
become my own designer
it's like bro you're doing way too much
you're not gonna be able to learn
anything okay John and you will teach us
how to make that Joe for the website yes
John Bannon if you haven't seen my
website John and by the way I'm gonna
show you right now
so this is one project this is the
Craigslist law so every project that's
on the website is related to each other
so if you go to the website and you
click on the link you get 55% off
automatically you basically pay nine
dollars per month ninety dollars per
year if you wanna save even more right
because if you do 9 times 12 do the math
right
so you actually saved that you save two
months when you do the yearly this is
not for everybody right the yearly I
will definitely recommend to people who
have already signed up for three to four
months and it's like hey man I've been
here for three to four months I love it
I want to continue so get your savings
and sign up for a year you know what I'm
saying so you don't have to continue
paying for a multi and you actually save
money now if we come to the website you
go to coding phase comm you come here
you will see that there's a whole bunch
of courses okay
here filtered by HTML CSS JavaScript PHP
Python Ruby alright so you know you
could just click also see all of them
right now as you can see every single
class here is related to each other if
you go to the timeline you can actually
see you want to start with the front end
right the front end that's what you see
on a website it's the things that you
see visually right so you come here and
say hey how many hours per week can you
make can you develop you know most
people can only do three to four hours
per week so let's say three times five
is fifteen so let's say start you over
three hours per day and you know for
five days a week all right
you decide how you wanna do it you wanna
take the weekends off and not do
anything only two on the weekdays or you
wanna say I wanna do on the weekends and
to three days of the the weekdays it's
up to you right now how long would it
take you to do this it will take you 28
days to finish everything on the website
every single project that you see here
is actually related to each other so if
you come here and say hey I want to
learn a text editor how to use a regular
text editor how to create your HTML and
CSS website right build a responsive web
app advanced CSS sass like for HTML
dashboard this is a project right there
from there you come in C cool all of
this have projects on Sagwa inside of it
but now you do another project so you're
looking at let's say one two three four
five projects before you even get to
start building anything with JavaScript
so you got future-proof JavaScript then
you create your web start what developer
starter kit will go which is what you
will be using all this times here but
you used it and you didn't know what
exactly it was doing so now here you
create your own so you understand what
exactly what's happening every time that
your CSS compiled and your your
JavaScript compile now you understand
how things work okay now you come here
and say create a side project which is
building your static portfolio okay now
from there you come in you have a pod
template engine which makes your life
easier to build the projects okay so
this is another project in there jQuery
has like three four projects inside of
me object-oriented programming is more
like an advanced teaching of like
JavaScript so I think a few more things
that you don't get to learn or
future-proof JavaScript there from there
you have learned ear snacks which is
just es6 es ever whatever they come out
with I put it in here in this course
okay so this is like extra features for
JavaScript now from here you build a
restaurant web back so you build a
restaurant web application and then from
there you have react right so react is
the last thing now the project that I'm
building right now is learn react by
building Craigslist phone okay so pretty
much everything that you see on the
website is a project okay everything
that you see on the website is a project
answer related to each other you get
what I'm saying
so hope you understand it's just like I
created this whole process for you guys
to learn without having to go in there
and say I'm gonna buy this course on
udemy I'm gonna buy this one I'm gonna
buy this one buy this one it's like okay
you follow along by the end of the 28
days which is how many is 15 hours per
week I was per day is 3 let me see
IRA's user five days per week so let's
say 28 divided by 3 28 divided by 3 is
no sorry that's what that's wrong 28
divided by
for there are several weeks okay
yeah I believe so that several weeks
that that I will take you to finish
every day okay so that's that's if you
do it like you know five days per week
right the seven weeks that is gonna take
you so that's like a month a month in
like a month in three weeks you know
what I'm saying so in almost too much
you basically learn all of this stuff
now if you wanna come in and really go
hard you could say hey if I'm not a
college student and I want to work hard
I wanna say hey I'm gonna come in and
learn all this stuff
I don't go to go to school I got a
freakin vacation time whatever it is I
don't got a girlfriend and do this and
that if you go in and you go hard this
is how I did it when I first got into
this thing I went in and I was doing
eight to 12 hours right and that's
because I needed the money if you're
like if you're in a situation like me I
was I needed to work nobody was buying
any different yeah I know what it was
taking care of me what it was helping me
out so what did i do i said you know
what i had quit my job i didn't have
time to do anything else was there I'm
gonna quit my job I hated it
so I came back home and I said hey I'm
gonna work hard in two months under the
front end I learned the back end so it's
like like I was good like you know what
I mean but it depends the type of person
you are
some people might it might take them six
months might take them four months to
finish everything but it depends how
many hours you wanna put it right so
it's all up to you
all right guys so anyways man I'm about
to start heading now we've been here for
one hour in 23 minutes so yeah man ain't
nobody thing about the grove of cool
scholarship I don't even know about no
scholarship what
collecting emails entail collecting
emails that's what interests job doing
40 hours a week
quick construction and got a jacqueline
emails points i just do all this there's
my only taking massive things this
course they are currently about swim
lessons available online yes sir and
that's one thing to like sometimes one
thing that you're gonna notice is i come
in and create the courses right and I
put it live and the reason why I do that
is as I'm building the course there's
certain people are gonna be doing the
course work right they like that a lot
of people like that they say hey it's
like it gives me something to come into
the website every day in you know three
four lessons work you that that same day
and if they have questions they ask me
the questions and send me emails right
like right now I'm building the the
Craigslist project but a lot of people
are taking a question and I sound
building it they have issues and I'm
helping them out right now those
projects from there they're gonna be
there once it's complete is complete
anybody that comes in a year from now
they still come in and you do that whole
project right and they still can learn a
lot for me well one of the main reason
why doing like I make it live as I'm
building the course is for the simple
fact that people enjoy being able to
create the project with me at the same
time so they don't man Joe when I got to
India time Jenny what do I see yeah man
you gotta stop you gotta stop looking
for Jenny web developer I just told this
to somebody who email me and tell me hey
Joe can you look at my portfolio my my
resume in the first thing that I saw he
had there was junior developer Union web
developer and as I know you don't want
to tell
you're a junior web developer anytime
you want to be able to say hey man I'm a
developer I'm a web developer I'm a
software developer mwah game developer
you never want to see hi guys I'm a
junior web developer you know what
developer is it's putting yourself down
and basically telling people I hate he
might not be ready you want to show
people that yo you're part of the game
like you're already in the industry this
is all about first impressions you gotta
understand you get paid a lot in this
industry right this is not like all you
go into construction and the guy goes in
oh you made a mistake with the tiles and
man god damn it he gotta go and put the
tile again no the type of mistakes here
you make a mistake that cost you your
job you know what I'm saying like that's
how it is so it's like they're looking
for the best of the best
constantly so what you want to do is you
want to show that you are a developer I
never played junior web developer I
never searched for junior developer
because I knew if you puma if i put
myself in that situation
number one I'm competing with every
single person who's just starting right
I didn't want to compete with those
people because there's thousands and
thousands of people sending emails I
wanted to compete with the people that
are actually in the game right the guy's
floor already been developers for two or
three years five years I want to compete
with done so when people open up the
resumes and okay says developer assess
all he has to practice he worked at this
company right so those are the people I
want to compete I didn't want to compete
with that pile of like freaking resumes
you know how many resumes are of people
are out there that are insecure because
it's really more about being insecure
about your skills and like a lot of
people are very talented with it and
secure about it that I don't know if I
could do the project I don't know how to
do this so there's like you're competing
with those guys that pile of insecure
developers who say hey I'm a junior web
developer nah you're a web developer
you're a developer you're
the engineer your whatever you want to
call yourself right you want to compete
with those guys you don't want to
compete with the pile of paper that goes
in the garbage you know most of the time
when you see junior developers nobody
reads that that's being honest it
doesn't nothing to why I tell you guys
you gotta build portfolios that make you
look good make you look like a
professional
because when HR person is reading to be
a thing right recruiter could come in
and say hey I'm recruiting to sell you
as a million dollars right but if you
look like you worth two dollars you're
not gonna get the job the recruiter
needs to have something that says hey
this person looks like that legit he's a
super professional that amazing website
look at our animation he has my site
look at how everything is smooth look
out the typography is nice you look like
a professional
you gotta get professional prices if you
look like you're a beginner you're
dealing with the world that's how I
consider it you know what I mean
cold face love you thank you for you
have done No thank you guys man I'm here
man
you know throws a little bit dry now I
gotta get out of here but I just think
you're hanging out with you guys man
Pharrell and at the same time I just
want to help you guys out man
listen do everything that I did if you
listen to me you're gonna be fine in the
next give yourself three to six months
right you're gonna be completely fine
now if you want to faster than that yes
you can get it faster than that
well you that means you really need to
work every single day like full-time I
say if you had a job eight to twelve
hours a day if you really want to get it
done if you want to get a job in a month
you could do it in a month but you gotta
work the whole month like eight to
twelve that's it what if you say hey I
want to give myself chance to learn a
little stuff and I want to be able to
you know perfect my portfolio and
everything that I need to do that's
another - once you finish learning to
code and finish
your projects just building and
perfecting your portfolio it's gonna
take you another month right now saying
that you want a perfect enzyme think
another month doesn't mean that you
can't find a job soon as you know how to
code yes you can friend you can swim
yourself in into a job if this there's a
need for it in your community or
whatever and uh recruiter gets you in
right away but if you really want to go
to a really legit company and you want
to maximize the the amount of money that
you're going to be able to get on your
first job then you need to give yourself
time off to build a heart like for real
projects that you can say hey man this
is like Jane I'm proud of this right so
there you go
can we put the projects we do on your
site and use them as our portfolio yes
the only thing that I'm saying is
customizing change it a little bit
change the images change the things that
you have right don't go in there and
just do everything the exact same way
right don't use the same typography
though you know like when you're
following it with me do it exactly how
we're doing it right I'm teaching it to
you there from there you go into that
project you customize it change the
fonts change that the location like
let's say if a gallery was here right
move the gallery down put the paragraphs
on top like do little things like that
that you make it your own you change the
color of the designs like that's what
you do Joe what do you think about boot
camps for more advanced studies like
Dana science I don't think these boot
camps work man for like data science I
just don't think so I think like there's
too much competition those guys who are
going to school for mathematics this
guy's going to school for computer
science Electrical Engineering
or coming up with degrees you know
prepared right and then it's like now
you have this guy who took a boot camp
right it's like some baby difference
right
I've taken out some calculus to answer
the linear equations one but that's
about it
right that's my my maximum the guys who
have done like Computer Science
Engineering you've done way more math
than me or even some people that focus
on statistics which is really what data
science is those guys are going to get
those jobs way above anybody who's in a
boot camp or way above anybody learns it
online so that's just how this oh yeah
man I'm outta here guys I'm already like
my throat's killing me but I'm out of
here guys love you guys man stay young
guys go to the website click on the link
in my description right now man get that
50 Fox and all you know there's people
who have signed up you know in July
until this day they still enjoy the
savings that they got from that savings
that they got on July like I'm not to
say the number that they got before but
acts around people really got like a
quick scenes you know I mean like and
they've been there for months you know
so anyways guys I'm out here's the
important jump back out again : face
