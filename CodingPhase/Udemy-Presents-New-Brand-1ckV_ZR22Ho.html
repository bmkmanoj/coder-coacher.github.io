again man coding freaks calm you boys
backing out and did it again guys I'm
over here watching this and it seems
like you know me got a new face you and
me got a new color Wow
I mean do I like it no I'll be honest
I'm not a huge fan of red or what is
this like orange II type red colors I
really enjoyed the green I like green
I'm about that green
I've always enjoyed green and I feel
like greenness is more of a color of
opportunity this color I don't like it
at all
that's just me being being honest be a
couple of changes right to this page I
mean it looks pretty much the same to be
honest with you guys I wish they would
just like tap me in the shoulder but I
hate Joe um can you help us out with you
know you to me the design of it because
a reality does the same website there's
the same thing like they changed the
background a little bit let's see let me
see a course oh let me see this one
okay see if this anything changed to the
way how things work no everything is
pretty much the same there's like some
highlighting like some CSS shadows on
the side but that's about it
they pretty much didn't have anything
like that's different you know when you
click here you meet Aaron who is one of
the cofounders of or the founder of you
to me which is great man he his story is
pretty legit it's pretty amazing seeing
Cole steal here it's like we could say
he's like the face of you to me now I
think he's making like 2 million dollars
a year
or something like that or maybe even
more cuz he probably got like some
really good really really good
percentages but you know I was like
watching his videos cause like a little
interview to the CEO and this and dad
talked about the new brands they coming
out with a new app for creators that
seems cool that seems great you know I
mean am i exciting not really there's
really nothing new to you to me like
like you gotta come in and put a new
logo put in the new colors guys create a
new website you to me has like seven to
ten different layouts that's a right
it's not a very complicated website at
all
now the backend we don't know exactly
how the backend is I mean for this
paystub out for some reason that decided
to do this in WordPress they could have
done this and something else but that's
their business all right
um but yeah looking at it I'm like man
they could have probably did in
something else man like this new
branding it's not that great the U is OK
you are I'm not I'm not too upset about
it but it's the green you know what I
mean that's like Facebook losing their
blue it's like face because I hey guys
you know what we've been doing this for
10 years but this year we're going red
Facebook is right now you know I don't
know sometimes I'll be thinking about it
and to me personally I think you get the
wrong creative directors you get the
wrong designers on a project and they
could pretty much mess up something
that's already good you know you to me I
love you guys
you know I love you guys I love what you
guys been doing um you know I have a
career because of you to me pretty much
because everything I've learned I've
learned from you to me anything that's
valuable right of course I learned other
stuff
my own and this and that but things
there are valuable things that are the
foundations I will say I learned in you
to me you know I really appreciate it
and you know it's crazy like I was like
looking at the stats in and it's not but
I pretty much sent about 10 to 15,000
sales now sales but $15,000 to you to me
and you know from me sending out people
so like hey go check out this course go
check out cold steel well do this and
that it's a great course it's a pretty
cool course but now thinking about him
like man like I've been throwing so much
money yeah and you to me like oh yeah I
could have tapped me in the shoulder
about your job like would you think
about this design I would have helped
you guys out man I would have been
honest you know sometimes honesty and
and being real it's not always good but
I'll be honest with you guys man like
you know I like the video the video
player I enjoy the video player but the
color is like a little purple dark
purple you know me I love purple that's
my color but this this I don't know this
faded you with faded red it's a mixture
of red and orange I don't know if I like
it I wonder what do you guys think do
you guys like the new branding on it you
know like I just I feel like the Green
was a staple of hey this is udemy.com
you know what I mean like now having
this red orange e color it just throws
it off I mean I like what they did in
the animations and the videos this is
very well produced quality right but at
the same time it's like I wish it you
know more people come in to you to me
input quality of courses on you to me as
if it was like for this video right if
Oh
courses were like this nice lighting you
know it's like you'd be like wow but in
reality it's not really like that a lot
of times there's people freaking you
know in the middle of nowhere creating
creating courses and and that's cool
sometimes but you know I look at this
video I'm like man this is Lee Jay looks
like Jay but as far as the color I don't
know man like it's very good quality of
videos for you to me.com that probably
their commercials is gonna be better
than hey guys
Pike neuron is where exactly I don't
want to see that guy ever again when I'm
King guys I have nothing against him but
I just don't want to see him like they
burnt that guy off like it's like an
image that you don't want to see no more
but Mandy the green man okay this was
the original one then it became this and
then now is this he's like that's what
I'm saying like there's too much of a
change like I don't know who are the the
people that came up with this idea
because listen if you go to school and
you take design right one of the first
things that they tell you hey when
you're rebranding something you've got
to keep some type of the essence and
whatever makes that company that that's
like right now we say hey Coca Cola's is
turning yellow you're gonna be like wait
what you know I mean but I don't know
what do you guys think do you guys like
this this new logo from you to me or do
you just like not care now you know it
won't really bother you if listen I mean
what do you guys think do you guys agree
with me that if they were going to
release a new logo they should have
released a new website you know I think
their algorithm could be better that's
for sure like just because I'm looking
for like let's say you know even there's
a top courses in web development it's
like you have
two courses from cold steel on the front
pages like the same people on the front
page they could pretty much somehow show
more people like I don't know I feel
like there's a lot of good courses out
there but I feel like they just don't
put put those people in there man you
know that's that's my opinion on it you
know sometimes I see courses down like
wait this course is actually the better
than this other course why isn't it
popular why isn't it you know being
shown on the front page but yeah that's
just my opinion
so anyways leave a comment below guys
let me know what you guys think do you
guys enjoy this new branding that they
have for you to me even though it's the
same website do you like the grain do
you like the red the little U is not
that bad
I kind of like it but I enjoy better the
green alright guys I'll see you guys
