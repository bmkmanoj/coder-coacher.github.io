again Cody face.com alright so let's
start talking about how exactly is that
these people really get money because
you know it's easy to talk about it but
let's give you guys some some more
details and how you guys are actually
going to make your money alright so
first of all we see this website CSS
Mattox it's pretty popular if you go to
the website itself
the guy has a whole bunch of different
tools generated for gradients
border-radius box shadows noise take
noise texture like all of these
different generators and every single
month he makes money out of this right
okay some think about this this guy's
been doing this is 2013 just caching it
all right now think about this we got a
look into the details of this website
CSS Matic how many views he get per
month so he gets 600,000 views now this
is a estimate a lot of times that I've
noticed on the estimates is usually like
thirty thousand or views less than what
is really happening right so it's
probably a little bit more so for six
seventy it's probably seven hundred
thousand okay so as you can see this a
lot of views were in half a million more
than a half a million views per month
right now I want you to think about it
how many times people click on the
advertising you know sometimes you might
be trying to click here and you by
mistake you click there alright that's
it automatically he got paid by me
clicking on it he got paid all right now
especially CRM I'm gonna show you a
little something how much we probably
gave him because we clicked on the CRM
ad right now but let's continue with
this so he has this much views most of
his views come from search results so
meaning Google Bing Yahoo that's where
he get all his views so soon as you
search on Google it shows up he's
in the top page okay so there from there
you can see this other websites that
link to him this other keywords that
usually show up box box shadow generator
box shadow CSS shadow generator you see
like those are the most popular ones
that he has there from day you have
YouTube it shows you how many times he
gets traffic from YouTube because other
youtubers talk about this right
youtubers be like oh man hey if you guys
are designing you're looking for a
generator check out this one or you know
a gradient CSS generator that's it
automatically he got views now more
people are continuing to go to his
website okay now display advertising
he's not paying for anything man he's
not like to be honest like all the stuff
that he's doing this profit man like
this guy's been doing this what since
2013 now this website probably in the
beginning wasn't like super profitable
but with time and the more that people
use it the more popular it becomes right
so the more popular it becomes the more
of a higher place you get on a search
results so if I go here I go CSS
generator let me see what shows up
colorzilla and as you can see he's like
in the top four box shadow look somebody
new just came in missing enjoy CSS so
there's another website see this guy
just came up with this other website
I've never seen this one enjoy CSS calm
like seriously I guys are making money
out of here you know what I mean like
just because you're developer doesn't
mean you gotta just do web development
for a company like you could do so much
other things like trust me guys alright
so now let's go into the money side okay
so when we click on this easy-to-use
all-in-one CRM there's a tool that other
companies write the companies that are
basically they are all bidding to get
the spot here basically
right all those companies they use this
tool called the Keyword planner
all right you guys can also use this all
you have to do is sign up for Google
Adwords okay you gotta put in your
credit card don't worry they don't
charge you anything but it's good for
you to be able to do research you put in
your credit card you don't create an ad
that's it so you never get charged but
then you could use the tools for Google
okay so you come here and then from
there you go to keyword planner all
right now on this keyword planner once
it loads you can search by keyword I can
come here and put CRM all right
now let's look it up let's see all right
as you can see because I clicked us on
the CSS Matic advertising all right now
most likely he just caught a lick this
was you know Street Talk there's how we
call a lick right so the keyword CRM
pays about $10 per click okay not
everybody's gonna click on it right but
out of 600,000 people right so 600,000
views okay let's say 600,000 views let's
say I do 600,000 views probably about
let's say 400,000 are actually unique
visitors unique visitors means real
people different users not the same
people because you know you could get a
whole bunch of views but it's usually
the same people are coming back in and
rechecking it so let's say an estimate
of 400,000 people now times point zero
one which is one percent four thousand
clicks per month right and that's if you
have a one percent all right sometimes
there's websites that if you have to
write placement the right type of
content you might get a higher
percentage this might be times three it
could be three percent so this could
actually be twelve thousand all right so
say hey times three twelve thousand
clicks all right so what happens in a
situation like that
all right twelve thousand clicks you
might think okay every single time that
they click I'm gonna get ten dollars no
it doesn't work like that the way how it
works is let's say you come to Google
and search CRM and that's what happened
to me right so I searched CRM so that
gets cookie tin and then now they keep
tracking me every website that I go to
they give me advertising about CRM but
what if I search something on Google or
I visit a website about let's say BMWs
all right come here
misuk you are ideas sometimes this
keyword planner be messing up okay so
BMW right so if I come to BMW ok the
average is 57 cents per click so if I
click on advertising about BMW cool I
get 50 Cent's no now that's what I'm
trying to give you guys that example
because you might come in and you might
see something like this where one click
might be 10 dollars another click might
be 43 cents another click might be two
dollars and 53 cents another click might
be 789 etc there might be some times
where people search things like health
insurance or car insurance those things
might be like $20 per click now are you
gonna get $20 in every single click out
of those let's say 4,000 clicks that
you're going to get on the website once
they reach it so 600,000 views per month
no most likely is gonna be around $2 -
or let's say 4 dollars right that's the
average even though you might get some
that I gotta be $20 on that 789 the
average is gonna be from $2 to
Oh $4 per click okay now when they just
come to your website and they don't
click on anything you still get paid
because you get paid by impressions
right so when you get paid by
impressions it's actually way less so
like let's say for every 1,000 views
that you get you might make maybe 80
cents or a dollar
all right now impressions means hey I
landed on IGN and I click here let's say
Star Wars right I come here I'm swiping
down I'm swiping down and then out of
nowhere I get an advertising here they
got paid automatically right without me
clicking on it they get paid more if I
click on it but they still get paid
because I saw the advertiser alright so
no matter what is still a win right when
you click on advertising the the person
who created the content gets paid way
more right but just by viewing it you
still get paid okay so this is what's
gonna happen to our website that we're
working on also okay now I'm gonna show
you guys okay cuz we already talked
about Adwords and how you know the
advertisers they pay for for the
advertising and the keywords and how
keywords aren't you know different
keywords and different type of content
like if you were to create a tool for
let's say insurance or let's say health
insurance calculator right let's say an
example searching that service how much
is the clicks on that health insurance
calculated right that's four dollars and
fifty eight cents for every click on
your on your website so if you created a
tool that it's targeted for health
insurance or its targeted for people to
to calculate how much money they're
gonna save on the insurance how much
money they could save from buying
multiple insurance policies you know
situations like that
or like let's say mortgage calculators
and how to calculate your your
investment etc right you guys come up
with your own ideas right but you get
the point if you come in you create
something for health insurance your
clicks are gonna be worth four dollars
and 58 cents right now one thing that
you gotta know when you see this four
dollars and fifty eight cents that's
what the advertiser is paying for per
click okay but then from there google
splits it in half basically so if this
thing is four dollars and fifty cents
you get two thousand twenty five cents
and Google gets two dollars and twenty
five cents all right
always remember that whatever number you
see here you're getting paid half of
that because Google always gets the
other half even though it's your website
that the advertising is being shown
Google's the ones that supplying you
with the advertising okay so they charge
you fifty they basically take their
forty percent cut no matter what okay
now let's move on to a real-life example
now this is what we were talking about
when you come to your website right and
you have everything set up you're going
to sign up for a Google Adsense you go
Google that you can come here and say
Google Adsense and if you don't have an
account with Google Adsense create one
now as long as you're watching this at
this moment the very same moment that
you're watching this go ahead and sign
up now because Google Adsense is super
important people are you know constantly
saying oh man
I got ad blockers I got this this and
that guys you're no longer you're no
longer a consumer you are a producer
right you create so you're supposed to
have knowledge of how all of this stuff
works you're a developer you're your
life now is behind the scenes you're no
longer the guy you know coming in and
clicking all cool there's a Nike ad no
you guys should know how this works
right so also having Google all while
like Google having ad blockers in
general as a you know as a producer
creator it's not good you know that's
why I don't have any ad blockers here
you know it's like because I understand
the value of hey somebody created a
content somebody created a website
somebody created something for me to see
for free so the least that I can do is
give them that view of the you know of
the advertising so at least they get the
impression money I'm not going to click
on it unless the ad is something that I
really want and I still click on that
you know what I mean like people say oh
I never click on that no I still click
on that because they certainly ask them
like old there's a new serviced I've
never heard of and I'm interested in it
and I click on it or my see a sell on
Amazon or I might see a sell on new egg
etc I still click on the hats you know
what I'm saying so for you guys to be
creators into half ad blockers it
doesn't make sense because you're not
one of the people who are let's say a
user you're not a user you're a creator
so you should know the value of the
views all right
so definitely I will say guys don't use
ad blockers because as you can see this
is how people eat this how people make
money and the least you could do if
you're using the free service is pretty
much just giving the ad you know what I
mean okay so um now let's talk about
Google Adsense make sure you sign up you
come here there's the website that shows
you benefits how it works success
stories resources get started you sign
in with your Google account and then
from there you register okay me already
have an account now I'm gonna show you
this basically this is from one of the
websites that I have the reason why I'm
not showing you guys none of my websites
is because you have to understand on
this internet thing there's a lot of
haters there's people who are out there
who want to get you right and they don't
want you to see you know - for you to do
good right they don't wanna see you do
good that's how I
when somebody's not doing good they
don't want you to do good so let's say
an example I have a website let's say
I'm the owner of IGN if a user hates me
right and I say hey man or I'm this guy
CSS Matic I'm just gonna continue
clicking on the on his advertising every
single day like twenty thirty thousand
times you know what happens one day they
do that they kick you out of google
adsense for fraud all right if I
somebody comes here that watches this
video on YouTube and just doesn't like
me right they could let it'll come to
one of the websites that I've built
that's similar to this a generator or
whatever I've built let's just say they
come to my website and they just hate me
they click on this a million times
right Google comes in and Flags me as a
fraud
account when you get a fraud account you
get kicked out basically for life it's
almost impossible to get back on Google
Adsense all right so pretty much I will
lose a lot of money like how I'll be
honest I will literally cry if I was to
lose my Google Ads account because it's
really important is something that I've
built over the years of me working right
so that's what I'm not gonna show you
any of my websites but just know that I
have about six seven websites to make
from five hundred to about fourteen
hundred dollars per month each website
let's just say that okay now this is one
of my lowest websites right I started
this thing this year this is just one of
my websites okay and I want you guys to
take a look how this thing starts going
up okay I started in the beginning of
the year all right started going up it's
all a dollar per day it might not seem
that much right there from there you
start going yeah okay cool so far are $6
$7 and it just keeps adding up right now
we're made this five months later the
website that I'm talking about this it's
some music site it's like a music
generator let's just say that it's a
music generator I don't want to put too
much information out there but it's a
music generator right there from there
you come here and you start seeing it
always starts going up so remember who's
making like $1 $2 in the beginning of
the year starts going up right then it
continues going up alright because the
more views that you get the more that
Google now says hey this website is
valuable people are actually sharing it
people are actually coming back and
bookmarking it and coming back to this
website so this is what happens now they
bookmarked it now we're in the game now
now we're making $30 per day now this
might not seem like a lot but guys I
have like about five to seven different
websites doing the same thing right
I have other websites that's making $80
per day $70 per day while one of them
makes thirty here another one's making
sixty and another one's making eighty
and another one making fifty like it
continues like that right and it keeps
going right and as you can see then it
starts going to a stage where it's like
kind of steady where's like now is
between 11 to $24 right an average per
day on this website now what's cool
about this is that now this website is
being here for a while all right this
website is gonna double up next year
next year there's a website that I built
I launched I've released it to the world
people use every day I pay literally
about 6 dollars per month for the
hosting when I am Ajay um basically the
hosting and I have like multiple
websites on the same server but and it's
just regular like a static site it's not
a no laravel it's just pretty much
static static JavaScript and that's it
okay so now this website is gonna
continue going up by next year is gonna
be making about fifty to eighty dollars
per month then the next year if we
continue
growing at the same rate it could make a
hundred to $120 per month
not per month sorry per day so now we
are talking about let's say about twenty
five hundred dollars per month next year
on this website alone currently this
website last month this is the average
that is making that $568 now mind you a
lot of people here in YouTube I see the
main man you gotta get a hundred dollars
per hour or you know building websites
and this dis and that yes as cool guys
is cool to get high
it's cool to work for companies but you
know this is actually cooler because
this is like you're making your own
money you gotta understand like you
create applications create cool stuff
that people are going to use real users
and then people always come back and
you're making money you know what I'm
saying so now this per month this thing
is making for a hundred sixty eight
dollars like I said in the beginning
you're going to see and don't get scared
when you see this in the beginning you
know in the beginning you might say oh
my god this is from January your first
month right apply you might get scared
you might see there's nothing like oh my
god I put in a few you know I put in
let's say ten fifteen hours saying all I
mean was $73 guys this thing stacks up
with time it continues growing because
if you create a tool that's useful for
people they're going to come back Google
rewards you with more people coming back
to you and showing it to more people the
more useful the tool is you get what I'm
saying
now this guy CSS automatic you know I'm
looking at him he's been doing this
since 2013 man I could just imagine how
much money he's making off this website
alone all right now like I
said this are like micro services for
people for users right you create
services for them like this whole
website is for web designers to get you
know take out noise texture
border-radius box-shadow or gradient
generator and as you can see CRM keeps
on showing up if I by mistake click on
any of these I'm over here I'm trying to
hurry up to whatever I resize the screen
I click about mistake
that's like $5 to $10 just on that click
along
you got what I'm saying like guys sky's
the limit right like what I'm talking
about you can really make some money out
here man all you have to do is find an
industry find a way to give value to
people create something that they gonna
use just a small tool this doesn't have
to be you don't have to create the next
Facebook all you have to do is create a
tool that people are going to use all
the time alright pretty simple you can
even recreate this CSS generator and a
more prettier and more easier way
because this is kind of confusing like
why would a opacity be here location
100% over here if you come in here and
take the same tool recreate it I mean
look at this thing
CSS generator this guy is brand new
enjoy CSS calm I've never seen this guy
I've been doing this for a long time and
I've never seen this guy but look it's a
way more cleaner website you see like
everything's you know the user
experience is nice you know he has
advertising right here so it's like hey
Google Fonz oh oh by mistake you click
here this advertising there hey check
you want to change the background I'm
gonna change the shadows outer box
shadows like this is beautiful so now
this guy is pretty much probably eating
off all the stuff that everybody else
built all right and he's like the
competition now because he created a
better two
something even more cleaner something
better for people to actually use this
is dope looking probably missing what he
built it on he's using Yandex kinetic
Jes I've never heard of this kinetic Jes
look now he created there's like a full
text editor like this is crazy right
this is dope this okay this is a little
bit too complicated but I mean I
understand where he's coming from
like he built like an amazing app for
people to create with CSS and the second
generator so this is pretty cool man you
get what I'm saying so I'm giving you
order the basics of all the things how
to make money with this and how to
create tools for other people or for
other users all you have to do is find
your niche you know there's so many
different ones there's like I see this
all the time when I was looking for a
new house I'm like yo mortgage mortgage
calculator look mortgage calculator org
that simple google has their own thing
but this one has another one you see
Lake looks nice you can come in put in
your value how much is your interest
let's say 3.14 calculate that and it
shows you like how much you're gonna be
paying like this is crazy you got what
I'm saying like you got the advertising
right there a nice place man
you know you could come down here look
at this this guy's making money out of
nowhere like down here he's giving you
direct links to different mortgages like
and this is all done through an API and
you get paid for this all right
look back great data provided by bank
rate you're gonna say like they pay him
a set amount because they click on those
links so if I come here in here and I
clicked there automatically he got paid
you know so sky's the limit
you guys get to figure it out the next
video we're gonna start creating our app
all right so
yeah I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
