guys you guys should really be watching
Facebook f8 all right f8 live right the
conference you know facebook is one of
the top companies in the world right now
and they pretty much super innovative
and created a lot of good tools for us
web developers like react or react
native what else graph q well there's a
whole bunch of different different you
know tools that we should be you know
paying attention to especially you guys
to our brand new developers like you
want to be part of the community so you
know you watch something like f8 you
want something like you know the iOS
when they give their their conference
for mac or
who else does a cool conference
maricon there's a couple of words right
or was it remote remote react conference
just a couple of conferences that I
usually watch when they're live all
right and FA is definitely one because
i'd like to see what the hell they
working on you know sometimes they come
out with some pretty cool features like
you know facebook chat box which i think
is really legit I really think there is
very legit because you know when you
call a company you're like man I don't
want to talk to a fucking customer
service person I don't want to deal with
that so what facebook chat box right
what they do is basically you could
actually just send a message to the
company through facebook Messenger and
then the company responds back to you
depending on whatever questions you you
put in so let's say you're buying
sneakers from Nike and you'll be like
hey nike when is the new jordans
dropping then the chat Bob will go
through the API and go through the data
and will be like okay the New Jordans is
coming out on saturday the 17 phone june
and whatever right there is the best
doors to go by yet so it kind of helps
the customer to bypass all the bullshit
talking to a person and now you can just
do it straight through messenger so to
me I think that's cool right now
in a few hours and I think like in an
hour an hour two hours from now I think
I 1230 it starts for the west coast and
I think here in the United stairwell Ian
in New York it starts at 3-330 around
there right basically they're gonna talk
about react and graph queue up so i'm
pretty sure they're gonna talk about the
new react fiber which if you guys don't
know it's gonna be super fast it's gonna
be I think 10 times faster than the
current react which is already fast fast
to render so you know because of
different frameworks like view GS which
pretty much copied them they came out
with react fiber and pretty much think
I'm a shit on them and it's gonna be
like hey you know we know who Jesus is
copying our shame but here you go if you
like the original now we're ten times
faster than them so yeah that's what's
gonna happen so I think you guys should
definitely check out the conference
because it's like come on guys like it's
pretty legit man stop being lazy if you
want to join the community you gotta go
all the way in man you can't just be
half-ass joining the community like you
really gotta go all out and be like you
know what imma watch a conference so
when people come in and they start
talking about the new react fiber I know
exactly what happened on the conference
and I know exactly what they're talking
about so you don't feel lost you know
that's how you maintain things and you
keep track of things got Shorty's out
here right my fault my fault losing
losing focus you know man I'm a man you
know I can't I can't control that shit
all right listen but yeah man so react
fiber man that's the new shit man
like you guys should definitely check
out facebook f8 for sure let me see
those are right now yeah man they doing
so pretty legit stuff man with VR I'm
gonna watch the VR part later on
probably later on tonight but right now
i'm waiting for the react fiber you know
that's why I'm waiting for I'm on my
lunch break i came out to come chill
with you guys for a little bit you know
like i usually don't on the lunch break
chronicles so that's where we at Rana
you think three o'clock three 30 that's
when react fiber comes on so that's when
i'm gonna start watching it cuz you know
i'm at work guys like i don't have the
luxury to just stay home and watch the
whole f8 but yeah man everybody who's at
home has the free time check it out man
download the app facebook f8 and is
legit man do your thing check it out
guys stop playing yourself like you got
to be part of the community guys come on
dawa a migration has a system like that
that the computer answer all my
questions and told me the day I was
receiving my green card yeah man that's
how it is chat box that's the future you
know as far as like customer service you
know what's funny and kind of fucked up
that I told somebody today about you
know the chat box I'm talking to my boss
and like kind of fucked up but once I
was telling him a body I was like yeah
we should implement that to the company
and he was like oh yeah seriously I was
like yeah and they're like the people
from customer service were like fucking
pissed everybody gave me this look like
like why is you trying to bring some
automation into our job and I'm like in
my head I'm thinking I'm like I'm sorry
guys but I get paid to pretty much bring
in new technologies into the company in
basically bring the company into the
20th century like you know 21st century
I'm here to bring it up to speed because
the company our main man is a great
company guys a very good company but the
developers that have been working on it
we're old developers meaning guys that
used to working pearl guys that used to
work in c-sharp those guys they don't
like innovation they don't like new
products new stuff that they gotta learn
like me I love to shake I love learning
every single day like it gives me a
purpose in life you know like I have a
purpose in life and my purpose is to
create cool things but for four people
that you know the old heads they're like
oh let's say I learned pearl in 1986 and
that's a i know c sharp since 2001 and I
don't need to learn anything else
because I as long as I could do my job
that's it and that's pretty much
bullshit guys like you know you got to
learn and update your skills constantly
you can't just stay stuck you know oh
that's another thing to like in my
company tool because what they do is
they make glasses right they make
glasses custom make glasses they make
glasses for people you know you could
sing your own glasses you know whole
bunch of shit you know and everything
that has to do with glasses and contacts
they basically do it right and you know
the back the back is its all full of
guys that door doing the manual work and
at one point though the owner is gonna
have to get robots for that you know
it's kind of suck because most of those
people's gonna get laid off so it's like
when you hit down the Trump talking
about like oh we gotta bring back jobs
and this and they're like man that shit
is not coming back manual labor is not
coming back guys manual labor is over
that shit only has a good 10 15 years
left before it's done it's completely
done and then what's gonna happen is
that things are handmade like right now
you already see it you know when you go
to a freaking like let's say you go to
the ferragamo store right or you go to
the Gucci store when you go to the
stores one of the reasons why those
things are so expensive is because
they're handmade meaning somebody's
there they're fucking Italy you know
making that clothes making those belts
so that's what's gonna happen in the
future robots is gonna do all the manual
labor and then whatever's handmade is
gonna cause so much fucking money that's
guaranteed you know so it's like if you
guys is out here doing manual work
manual labor guys you gotta get on to
programming because this is the future
and some people might say Oh program is
going to be done by computers in the
future and it's like yes and no because
at one point there's gonna be certain
things that computers can't do
you know they need computers always
gonna need to my head to my case I
believe that computer is always gonna
need somebody to tell them what to do at
least one time so for at least one time
somebody has to create it and that's
what we add you know what I mean like
how I look at it is okay i'm trying to
make as much money as i can for the next
20 years from development and everything
that's related to it because at the end
you don't know if it's gonna be here 20
30 years from that but by that time
you're ready if you're smart you're
already made enough money and nothing
investments that you can say hey I
already have a couple of stores i
already have a couple of businesses if
you're smart now if you over here dumb
and you just like living off your
paycheck in like me i have multiple
income skies like if you guys think that
my my income from my job is so like that
like you're completely wrong man like at
the end of the year man i'm gonna do
something man I'm gonna do something
pretty amazing which is gonna be I'm
gonna put in all the money I earn
throughout the whole year in cash I'm go
to the bank and will be like okay let me
get this in cash and then we're gonna
see how much I actually stacked up and
you guys go home me up accountable
tonight if we make 200 grand this year
I'm gonna put 200 grand on the screen
cash you know we're gonna do some crazy
shit we're gonna do some rappers shit
right now we're gonna do something so
fucking Rick Ross type jay z / i don't
know / future type shit we're gonna put
some some cash on the screen because you
know what man like i mean i'm trying to
motivate people some people was like oh
man you met opulent and you meant wanna
show off and shit and it's not about
that man i rather i want to show off all
the shit that I get from development so
other people could be like yo I don't
need to be a fucking bullshit basketball
player I don't
to be a bullshit rap I don't need to
sell drugs I don't need to do this in
that I don't need to work a bullshit
nine to five job that is not gonna pay
me anything I could live a very
comfortable life just from being a
developer and that's to the point that I
want to prove you know what I mean late
I'm not one of those people that they
hide their money they hide their way of
how they make money it's like people
talk shit about this guy uh what's his
name ty ty Lopez whatever Tyler Lopez
whatever his name is people hate on him
but it's not about uh hitting on him
because of what he does on youtube
people had on him because he don't show
how much money he makes from promoting
shit on youtube and you know that's the
problem that people hate about him you
know what I mean it's not that he makes
money it's the fact that he tells people
like hey join this program in this
bullshit program that only I'll make
money because i'm selling it to you like
that's bullshit you know what I mean can
I stream landscape I don't even know if
I could do it it says rotate device it
doesn't let me you see I'm trying to do
it but it doesn't let me rotate it
what oh Ken back at it again
man this is I don't know guys don't use
I want to say this to you guys don't
ever use wicks or square space in any
type of situation as an example of
anything guys literally don't use wakes
or Squarespace an example for anything
hey guys shit is going to be automated
15 20 years from now everything might be
automated but at the same at the same
time is like fucking you know people 20
30 years ago they were saying by this
time there was going to be flying cars
is there flying cars no right and now
when you use wigs and Squarespace those
websites are not automated those
websites are fucking websites that can
maintain there's people working on those
website right now I've gotten offers to
go work at Squarespace like there's
fucking people working there what it's
automating is for the user to just
upload a picture but who do you think
codes all that shit all that shit is a
person that's doing it those are
templates that's all that Squarespace in
waiks does for dinner automating shit
yeah yeah yeah ties the scammer yep
that's the proud of a time like he makes
money like you know people be like oh
that house is rented his cars is rented
doesn't that and it's like not really
you know because it's least which means
he also he's putting payments on it I
mean I don't know if any of us could go
in be like hey I want to lease a
rolls-royce and I want to put in I want
to pay three four thousand dollars a
month I can't afford that shit so he
gets money he has fucking Ferraris he
got a Lamborghini is he got Rolls Royce
he's doing good for himself but the
problem with that is that he's selling a
product that doesn't work and he's
showing how much money you could make
but in reality the reason why he makes
that much money is because he's selling
it to other people you know what i mean
is like me myself here like I'm not
fucking selling no dream I'm not telling
people go do this thing that like this
are a magic trick to the shin you make
you know you're put in five hours and
you're gonna make a hundred thousand
dollars in one month no I'm not
something that I'm telling you is a
fucking way of life in a career it's
just like hey man your eyes are going to
be Joe Schmo the mechanic or you gonna
be Jane Doe from wendys instead of being
that come join a community of you know
developers creating coaching and you can
make a comfortable living can you become
rich from yes if you create a very solid
product now can you just earn a fucking
regular paycheck yes if you live in an
area with us know developers like no
tech companies there's no jobs for you
then yes you could just earn a regular
paycheck it could happen but it's all on
you you will have to make shit happen
you can't just be like hey yeah because
I took this course online I was supposed
to make 100
no man doesn't work like that you can't
make a hundred thousand but you're not
supposed to make a hundred thousand
there's a difference there's a
difference between you're supposed to
and you can make a hundred thousand it's
like being a doctor a doctor you can't
make half a million dollars but are you
gonna make a minute and half a million
dollars no you're most likely you're
gonna make two hundred thousand and
that's what happens to a lot of doctors
you know I'm telling you because I know
I know a friend of my whole who is
actually a doctor he was telling me that
he thought he was gonna be making half a
million dollars and right now he's only
making 200 grand and he went to school
for 10 years me I went to fucking you to
me for a few months and I'm almost
catching up to him I don't know I think
I did something right you know what I
mean so that's all I'm saying for you
guys soon you guys gotta step it up and
do some cool
cadenza bracero let's see let's see
you're right Joe rock on when I went out
without top ten fuck off what is the
best place to host projects i usually
use Heroku whenever I'm working on

wanted to just push my coat yeah guys

that okay a lot of people are coming in
here they're like okay cool we're gonna
fucking start copying what they doing
right all right cool so you can go ahead
and copy now the kids like okay guys
this is cool man as you can see there's
a thing called super chat if you have a
really important question you know just
you could pay a dollar to dollars father
Hollis ten dollars it's like then on top
of that you asking people hey come join
my my fucking bullshit course for you
know thirty dollars a month in from
there or you could do a one time payment
for 120 dollars or some shit and I'm
like what the fuck like our people which
it kind of pisses me off that people
they don't understand like people like
that like that kid Tai Lopez this people
come to you too
they painful promotion they pay for
advertising to get ahead of other real
youtubers right so now you start seeing
them everywhere and they're paying for
promotion and then what happens is
people think oh this guy's is legit but
what you don't understand is that
there's a machine behind it they fucking
putting money into it to get all those
views guess all those subscribers to
basically remarket you guys and be like
okay now their subscribers now I'm gonna
fucking make a hundred dollars of every
single person and gear they could come
in here and start making a lot of money
you can make a lot of money on YouTube
but now you're just a piece of shit you
know what I mean like if you guys see me
doing that shit call me out on it like I
won't point I'm gonna make a course but
I'm gonna make on you to me where you
can fucking do it do it whenever you
want and get it for ten dollars and all
specials sometimes I might even once I
get my own code from my own course I'm
gonna make a special two for people to
get it for fire on us even cheaper than
what you to me has it you know what I
mean cuz the point is not to be like hey
I'm just gonna fucking make as much
money as possible of this little amount
of people what I want is people to
fucking go out and change their lives
and just you know do what I did I could
have been right now working at the more
I could have been right now working as
an IT worker getting 40,000 a year being
miserable fixing computers and shit you
know what I mean like I could have stuck
got stuck there but I did it I kept
pushing forward and that's what I want
for you guys too so that's what I'm here
so when I see people like that like
level programmer like just spray like
they're pretty much just fucking it up
for people out here like don't come true
like la Luna i'ma put this example this
this guy who I respect a lot learn learn
code Academy right I respect him a lot
because he knows his shit he's not
somebody like here like dare fucking
you know I wanna be developers who took
a fucking Python course online and then
they fucking teaching it to other
peoples and they think that they really
developers know this guy fucking works
for yahooeys has worked for a whole
bunch of fucking companies like large
companies and he's on YouTube putting
legit videos for free and then he has a
course that he sells which he doesn't
even promote for ten thirty bucks so who
the fuck is this kid with no fucking
experience some college kid charging 100
something dollars because people just
fucking want to support they want to
support but now you just fucking raping
them don't rape people that shit fucking
pisses me off late you know what I mean
like I like that shit i like when five
King people come in and they'd be like
oh thank you Joe and they do anything
lake man people is like you know how
much is enough how much is saying hey I
got enough money you know what I mean
like if I touched 300,000 I think I have
enough money right if I make three
hundred thousand dollars a year I think
I'll make I made enough there's no need
for me to fucking rape people there's no
need for me to just constantly fucking
try to take advantage of people there's
no need for it why would I come in here
to you to where people most people that
come to you too that's a big difference
there's people that go to two websites
like oh pluralsight that goes to
directly to your to me that goes
directly to what else even people that
go to teen treehouse those are people
that a lot of times they have the money
to spend and have the money to go in
them be like you know what man I could
go to the apple store and buy myself a
four thousand dollar macbook right but I
know that most of my viewers are not
those people most of my viewers are
other people who are just trying to make
a change in their lives and trying to
step it up so why am I gonna go and be
like man I know these people are
desperate they want to change their
lives let me see how much i could eat
often let's try to get 200 first he
tried way let's try to get 500 he saw
that she wasn't working he said ok let's
try to get 300 she wasn't working and
try to get 200 she wasn't working let's
try to get 120 ok people are abiding in
for 120 let's try to rape them more like
come on man don't do that shit
you know I mean like people are just
fucking crazy and that's just my opinion
guys I know you guys see it don't come
here for that shit but you know it's my
lunch break chronicles this one I say
whatever the hell I want this is my life
videos this where i share my stories i
share the bullshit that I see on youtube
I share the in justices of the world you
know what i mean so yeah man yeah no I
know I'm good I'm good the money that I
make I'm good guys like when i started
youtube I did not come here make this
shit up business this is not supposed to
be a fucking business I'm not doing this
thing as a business if this shit I
wanted to make it as a business I will
fucking write down all the ideas I have
for YouTube I will take my time doing
the editing I will take my time getting
the right shots i will take my time
wearing the right clothes i will take my
time fucking doing the right tutorials
make sure that it has to be SEO friendly
that's if i wanted to make this shit of
business but I use this shade just as a
hangout spot a place where I want people
to just be like hey man he's doing it I
could do it that's all I want
that's all I really want you know what i
mean so
yeah man Matt listen you're pretty you
already could listen with the skills
that you have you could definitely
already get a job as a front-end
developer trust me whoever sees your
your skills they're gonna hire you and
give you at least a junior front-end
developer position and then from there
you stay there for three you know three
to six months and then they'll give you
more money if they don't give you more
money apply to another place you know
