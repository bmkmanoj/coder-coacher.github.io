man live man my into the web
developers lunch break had a lot of work
to do today I didn't even take a lunch
break that's how bad it was your boy man
without without without without guys
were in here live one of our peoples is
that young people
yo man it's a beautiful day outside kids
I'm gonna tell you hey don't don't try
to learn to code today because it's a
beautiful day I'm not gonna tell you
that I'm gonna tell you take your laptop
and go outside connect that
straight to your phone you know use the
Wi-Fi of your iphone real quick
use that shares a hot pot or whatever
you call it yeah man just coat yeah
gonna be somebody who try to game the
system you know there's always going to
be somebody who's gonna
now you know what crazy scheme some tiny
Lopez type you know what I mean
they'll be like
that's one of those type of people's
right so I'm looking into coding freeze
calm today which is an amazing website
guys I'm adding tutorials every single
day and I'm gonna talk about it maybe
later on a little bit more later on
tonight because I'm Mike to a podcast
alright and I want to explain a couple
of things to people right but before we
get into that let's talk about the
people trying to game the system
all right people come in they see oh
cool I've got a coupon for five dollars
right I'm gonna sign up I'm gonna sign
up right
this is scheme this how you know people
scheme all right I'm gonna sign up as
soon as I sign up I'm gonna cancel the
subscription but then I'm gonna try to
download all the videos like come on man
why are you doing your boy Joe like that
man I understand people do it all the
time they do it everywhere they're doing
YouTube you know people don't even want
to buy a song anymore right they don't
want to buy no hablas they don't want to
signup to Spotify they go to youtube and
search for the song they go and download
the video then convert into an mp3
I'm like bro for all that work that
you're gonna do like you might as well
just buy the song you know what
I mean so anyways so I found this guy is
it a guy or girl don't know but a user
right who literally bought into the fire
well the one month subscription which is
five dollars and literally in less than
a minute cancelled which tells me
he was just there to scheming you know
there's certain people that just go in
but I okay cool I see they're using an
html5 video I can look into the the
elements I can go in there and basically
just find out the location of the video
put all that right scrape the out
of it
save the links right save the location
of the video on a notepad or something
and then just download every video and
cancel the subscription so now I got
every video for five dollars every
single thing that he got for five
dollars and that's great man I'm happy
for you for being smart and know how to
use the Internet but at the same time
come on don't don't do your boy Jo like
that you know what I mean like I'm
putting in hours hours and hours and
hours so it's like don't ski me if you
don't like the course cancel it if you

say a minute that she said this person
was in for 34 seconds so this this
person went in body write signed up for
the subscription they they bought a
whole month for four dollars they're
from they're automatically wouldn't
cancelled it it's like all right cool
I'm getting this for free you know

trying to do a little Q&amp;amp;A a little
podcast

hell five hours are we telling people

kid greatness how long we being on the
livestream
you know we we go hard here man

Sun is killing me right now

car accidents I'm sorry that's my ya see
ya seen that from The Simpsons when
a kid the little bully every
time somebody gets hurt just comes out I
know we like for being dumb why you out
here having car accidents man you know
what I mean like
drive safe like yeah I'll be on my phone
yeah be on video well I know how to
drive my drive safe I gotta keep my eyes
open to everybody everybody's around me
I keep my eyes on them why because
people don't know how to drive that's
why we gotta hit him with that
Gayla my girlfriend probably watching
this right now wife is at home probably
watching this laughs she's gonna be like
oh man what the hell you do it and we'll
be like yo I'm out here like yeah that
should be my intro guys were joke
aka : fixed calm yo guys man I'm having
fun today
I had a know last day that
very stressful day it was very stressful
my company
but it's okay because we still have a
fun in life man
it was really good man that when you
bust your ass and like I work hard guys
like you guys don't know me you guys
should know yeah I know I worked 9:00 to
5:00 right
then after 9:00 to 5:00 I come home I
eat for like an hour hang out with my
girlfriend for a little bit and then
from there I come back start making
videos for you guys and then I make
videos on on random topics for
you to write and then from there these
days are coming and I go and I start
doing like you know the podcast or like
just a random live video that might take
five hours so I'm doing man hours a word
right so it's like I work hard for this
people tell me that oh you know
or work so hard and this and I'm like
nah I'm trying to get to places you know
what I mean and you're trying to do
with my life I want to be able to say oh
look what I accomplished when I died I'm
good when I die oh I'll get some rest
you know
for now let's just work let's leave an
imprint of us in this world that's
leaves something you know something
behind is when you die you die that's it
but if you die you make something cool
and people like I'm never gonna laugh I
was like if I was like Bill Gates if I
was like how you call it Elon
Musk like I feel like they wasting money
on like I saw this video where
they were talking about Bill Gates spend
20 billion dollars on trying to you know
kill world hunger or some like that
and I'm like man that is going to
nobody because
no I will do is I will say hey
get people jobs and like that you
know what I mean like I hate when people
be coming out of knowing but I fall I'm
trying to stop world hunger like what
the does that mean you know what I
mean like just do something positive
that people are gonna remember
I'm being honest
Bill Gates giving every single person
that's poor in the world five cents it's
not going to make an impact for nobody
the best thing that he can do is give
air at least a million people
I don't know $20,000 $50,000 in their
hands all right that is gonna leave an
impact people's gonna bring oh you
remember when Bill Gates came in and he
just you say you get 50,000 you get
50,000 you get 50,000 you know like he
comes in he does something like that
people gotta appreciate it but
Bill Gates saying hey we're gonna give
everybody in the world a dollar what the
 are you doing with your money
that's how you know some of this rich
people don't even know what the to
do like I'll be thinking in my arm like
guilt today not use their brains
like you're trying to help every single
person under the Sun which is not
possible so how about you give a hundred
thousand people enough money or enough
education for them to survive and then
for them to help out other people's
it'll be like a chain reaction like Bill
Gates helped you out so now you when you
start making money you help out somebody
else that's what I will do you know I
mean like that's what I will do I don't
know why these people don't use their
 brains it's like when Bill Gates
 passes away or whoever it could
be Elon Musk could be any multi
billionaire and when they die in you
just world
who's going to say hey thank you nobody
because they really help nobody they
gave everybody a dollar that's what they
did you know what I mean
the dollars gonna do a dollar
can I change your life you know
giving kids in Africa one meal
and say we're we fed high
college we fed twenty million kids for
one day what the does that mean you
know what I mean like what the does
that mean
what impact did you leave you
gave them some food for one day he said
okay everybody eats for free but
tomorrow you're gonna starve and you
don't know how to make money or get
 forward again what did you leave
to society you know I know that was just
like a little random thought that I had
maybe I should do a video about that
because I really think like all these
 rich people like they don't know
what the hell they doing with their
money at all they come in and they they
start throwing money to the air they
they buy paintings for fifteen
million dollars I think of a skier
painting got sold for I think a hundred
million dollars some Japanese
guy I think the guy that owned not okay
but I think like Nintendo or some
that he bought a painter for a
hundred million dollars you know how
 ridiculous that sounds like
yeah people from New York City take
trains but not me man I live I live good
I don't need to live in the city I look
good you know what I mean we are here
boy we are here boy we got here chillin

you make sure you soul of man I'm
watching you man I haven't seen you take
taking any other courses when I'm
watching you I keep track of everybody I
keep track of every single person that
signs up for coding freeze calm like I
actually go in there and take my time to
see who actually takes the test who
actually goes and watches the video how
long they watch the videos how many
hours they put in just walk alone who
actually busting their ass your boy Matt
is being lazy me
but I know you already know HTML CSS oh
yeah I should start the lerigot pretty
soon so I decided to start the
JavaScript one
so it's like let me finish that
javascript just the basics I'm gonna
have people with the basics I was gonna
try to teach everything under the Sun of
JavaScript but then I realize I'm like
there's really no point because most
people if they just follow our tutorial
they won't learn anything so what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna teach you guys the
basics
the syntax of JavaScript right and then
from there once you got the basics then
we're gonna start building projects what
time is the livestream I'm gonna try to
do it either 9 o'clock at night or 10
