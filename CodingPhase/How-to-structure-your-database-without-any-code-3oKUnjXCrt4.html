again coding face.com today we're gonna
talk about how to structure your
database without even having to code
anything alright guys don't miss on
anything that happens on coding face
comm subscribe and click the
notification and you get notified every
time that I drop a new video or a new
content so for me what I do is I look at
the features that I'm going to add so
currently right now I'm working on the
toko social network which is pretty much
as a mixture of Twitter with Facebook
and a little bit of YouTube okay
so what we're doing here is we're gonna
break down the features that it has okay
it has messages
it has roles it has posts updates
basically different post types like you
know regular messages image messages or
let's say a video somebody uploaded or
they shared a YouTube video all those
things are different features okay each
user has different roles so user could
be a admin a user could be just a
regular user a user could be an
administrator user could be lets say a
moderator right so there's a lot of
different roles that you can add to a
user so all those things we're gonna go
over right now
okay now everything that we're doing
here you could literally put it into use
to any type of application that you're
building out there okay so let's get
started for me the very first thing that
I always do I use a spreadsheet to plan
out my database okay so personally i
like google spreadsheets cuz i could
actually send this to another developer
and we could both edit this live like I
could send you this link right here and
me and you can actually you know add
different things live as we look at the
screen so this is pretty useful all
right so first of all we're gonna start
with the users so the users is gonna be
something very basic so there's the
users table says
ID first name last name email password
profile image and created I updated all
right something very simple now just to
remind you guys the created and updated
at is just holding the date that it was
created in the day that it was updated
meaning it was edited or changed all
right now so we're having users being
able to follow other users so the way
how we're doing this is by doing a
many-to-many
so there's users that follow many users
and many users can follow many other
users so pretty much is a many-to-many
so the way how we're doing this is we
have two users table and then we have an
intermediate table so in this
intermediate table I'm calling the
followers so what I'm doing is if I have
an ID of one and my name is Joe right
I'm following let's say the idea of
three which is Johnny so let's say user
ID one follows user ID three and then we
say user ID three follows user ID one if
he wants you know sometimes you follow
somebody and the person don't follow you
back you know so that's if they want to
write so in a situation like that we
would use an intermediate table like
this right we will say user ID one
follows user ID 3 okay we also have the
day was created at and the day it was
updated now let's talk about settings
each user has settings that they want do
they want emails do they one
notifications when somebody leaves them
a comment do they want to be able to you
know get notify change their password
change their emails whatever etc right
that's all gonna be on the settings
alright so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to have a table call settings and
this is gonna be a one-to-one
relationship meaning I have one user
okay and then inside of the settings
table I have a user ID so I could say
user ID of one has this setting this
true this is true this is false this is
true this is true this is false
etc right whatever we have that are
settings for that user okay so it's a
one-to-one relationship okay now the
next thing that we have here is post so
we're gonna have the post to be a
one-to-many so one user can have many
post our user can create a whole bunch
of posts right so that's a one-to-many
relationship so the way that I'm doing
this is I'm saying I have a table called
post which is gonna have an ID
it has description type of post it has
the image URL it has the user ID that
created the post and then it has the
date that was created at and the date
that it got updated okay so that's how
the posts in the users are relationship
works okay now in every single post
users are able to leave a comment so the
way how this is gonna work is by
actually coming here and saying hey we
got this comments table and we have to
post t1 right so in the comments table
what I'm doing is I'm saying hey we got
an ID
we got the content which is gonna be the
comment we got the post ID so related to
this post all right and it's also
related to the user ID so we can
actually search this later on if I
wanted to say show me all the comments
that this user let's say user one has
actually made so then from there we will
have all of the comments that he created
now if we want to link all of the
comments of a post we have it connected
to post ID so basically what we have
here is a one-to-many when it comes to
comments and then for users we also have
a one-to-many when it comes to comments
so one user can have many comments and
one post can have many comments okay so
the next thing that we're going to have
here is messages so message is the way
how I'm working in this situation is
we're saying hey
a user can message another user so we're
keeping track of that in the messages
table so we have to send their ID let's
say user 1 and now user 1 sends a
message to user 2 now the message is
gonna be in the message section okay and
then from there we have to read at so we
can actually show to the user at what
time did they actually read this right
and the way how we're gonna track that
is by the time that they go into the
message section so pretty much if I come
here and I have a whole bunch of
messages and I here have this little
icon here if I click in there
automatically as soon as I go in there
now I update the table to say hey the
user ready at 3:45 p.m.
etc right and then we say this was
created at at 2:45 and updated at in
case there's somebody tries to edit it
or change it you can do it through there
too so we keep track of all of that
information alright now the next thing
that I'm gonna do here live because I
just realized I didn't add this is gonna
be the likes
so pretty much we want to keep track of
how many times a post has guy in likes
and how many times in comments has
guying likes so what we're gonna do
we're gonna create a table call X so I'm
gonna say likes okay looks like that and
merge this that's fine
I'm gonna put in ID I'm gonna put in
user ID I'm going to put in comments ID
or comments ID I'm going to put in host
ID and basically what we're going to do
is I'm gonna come here and let me make
this a little bit bigger make this a 24
make this bold 24 Center it okay so that
so we got ID user ID comment ID and then
post ID all right so no oops select this
like that change the background change
the color okay then I'll do that okay
now let's fix this merge just cleaning
it up because I like to see it a little
bit more cleaner alright so in this like
stable what we're gonna have is an ID
the user ID the comment ID in the post
ID so for example if let's say I have a
post right so post ID is 33 so 33 will
be here okay and then the ID of the user
is ID 2 so if you like post 33 then
that's how it was show okay now for post
33 if user one liked it it would be like
that okay now in a situation where I
like the comment what I would do is I
will put in the comment ID here 44 and
then he I will say user ID 1 or let's
say 44 user ID 5 liked it okay
so that's how we're gonna keep track of
the likes now the reason why I'm showing
you this to you guys and so you guys can
understand how to break down you know
all the features that you have on your
website because sometimes you want to
have something that you might say hey
man like how can I build this how can I
structure this hug how am I gonna be
able to relate to the users or relate to
the followers or relate to the poles
like there's the easiest way this is how
I find that for me is super easy to just
come in and just put things in a
spreadsheet and then now depending if I
want to add more
rolls or I want to add more more columns
or I want to add more tables or etc I
can just add it to the spreadsheet okay
and then I plan it out before I actually
do the migrations okay so yeah man I
hope this is useful for some of you guys
and I hope you enjoyed this video
all right guys I'm gonna see you guys
later bye guys this video is brought to
you by viewers like you
