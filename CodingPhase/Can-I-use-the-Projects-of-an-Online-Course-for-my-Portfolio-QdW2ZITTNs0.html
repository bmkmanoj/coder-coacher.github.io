joke back at it again coding fees.com
your boys backing out and did it again
guys today's topic is is using a project
from your course wrong to put on your
portfolio you guys this video is brought
to you by viewers like you and people
that support our website coding phase
comm go check it out over 20 courses in
there that's gonna guide you to become a
developer from the beginning to becoming
a pro so let's get started so it's been
a lot of controversy in the past few
days since i did a couple of different
portfolio reviews and people have been
asking Joe it seems like everybody is
you know quote-unquote on on
each other because they basically have
you know projects that they did in
different courses like the web developer
boot camp they did a couple of other
ones and you know what I don't think
it's wrong I just think like you're
supposed to edit them right you can have
even the projects that you do in my
course right in any of my courses and
put it in there to your portfolio
because that I want you to do it right
I'm building real projects and real
situations that you can use to show hey
I can come in and build any type of
website then gift so use my projects as
your portfolio if you use it but you
have to edit them right you have to
change the images maybe change the fonts
change the background like let's say for
example the Yelp can write from I
believe or coldsteel right I see a lot
of people put in Yelp camp or on their
portfolio it's like no how about you put
in local hotels call a local hotels
right instead of images of camps you put
in images of local hotels right nobody
is going to be able to tell like hey
this is actually the Yelp camp
the only way they gotta tell is if you
call it Yelp cap right so you know it is
not wrong to put in stuff like that into
your portfolio what's wrong is for you
to just basically copy and paste it
right and then you say hey I'm done
here's my portfolio I took a course and
here you go know what you want to do is
you want to be able to say hey I took a
course I was able to understand what was
happening I was able to recreate the
project okay even though you're not
redoing it all you're doing is changing
it up and changing how things look
changing the name changing the images
changing the fonts changing the colors
it just makes it seem more custom
alright there's more accustomed for you
right instead of you just saying hey I'm
just gonna copy what I already did and
put it in my portfolio okay so that's my
advice to you guys yeah it's totally
fine to use other people's projects into
your portfolio as long as you make it
yours okay cuz when you take a course
and reality is you're supposed to go in
there learn everything and be able to
build the same thing that you did on the
course and build on your own okay that's
the whole process of learning to code
and learning you know from online
courses you supposed to follow the
instructor do what he does do exactly
how he does it and then from there
recreate that same project and redo it
on your own and test yourself because me
following let's say cold steel or
Stephen writer or myself on a project
and then I just say okay cool I'll
follow him and then I'm done I know this
stuff no you don't know it until you
basically build it yourself okay you got
what I'm saying like take those those
examples that they showed you and then
reuse that same knowledge for something
else now you gonna have to Yelp camp
write everything that you did on the yo
camp
redo it as for hotels write local hotels
add extra things to it add extra
features
and all categories at tags and all I
don't know location told you know talk
to Google's API for Google Maps and add
the map I'd like the location you put
into address and then the map shows you
pinpoints the exact location of where
the hotel is like it's located so those
are the things that you want to do you
know so it can make the project your own
right and you want to seem like hey I
built this it wasn't just me following
along or something you know what I mean
that's like going to you know applying
to a college right and then they tell
you hanker you you know come in and
write us an essay and then instead of
you writing an essay before saying hey
this is why I want to be in this
university or this College you decide to
say hey I'm just gonna copy this Harry
Potter review that I had that we learned
with the teacher and we created a small
essay about the you know Harry Potter
when we was reading a book and then you
handed it in to the University they look
at you like you're crazy
right you get what I'm saying I hope
that and now that you make sense but
yeah man it's your boy Joe back at it
again coding face.com your boys backing
out and did it again man I can't wait to
this weather it's nice outside so we
could do more videos outside right today
it's ok today is not that bad
alright so here's your boy Joe back at
it again coding phase comm make sure you
subscribe make sure you like my videos
make sure you leave a comment tell me
what you think I also need you guys to
go to my website subscribe man trust me
if you've been going from service to
service to service to service the
service service on service or service
right if you've been going from service
to service out there Pluralsight team
treehouse coke Adam II freak okay I'm
freaking the Harry Potter framework the
freaking the shish kebab calm wherever
you go to learn right and it hasn't been
working doesn't give my website a try
everything that I do it's like real life
experience and stuff that's gonna help
you out most of these people are not
really self-taught developers most of
these people are
you know college graduates that have
done computer science so they'd be
teaching a more technical way the way
how teachers a more real-life situations
and basically just like same way how
we're talking right now just gain your
mind into this and helping you out all
right
so anyway since your boy job back at it
