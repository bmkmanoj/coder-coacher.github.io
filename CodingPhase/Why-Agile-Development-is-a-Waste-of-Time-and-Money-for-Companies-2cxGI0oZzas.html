again man coding face commie boy it's
backing out and did it again guys
alright so today's topic is what is an
agile working now before we get into
this article when you know what this guy
talked about and a lot of the things
that you see here which is a perfect
chart this is perfect this could pretty
much explain everything about agile it's
waiting waiting waiting okay some work
waiting waiting some work waiting
waiting work and then waiting waiting
waiting waiting okay and then I guess
done alright if you guys don't know what
agile is it's a way it's like looks like
a paradigm some I don't even know what's
the right word for it it's more like a
way that people do projects and some I
don't know who created this but people
think that this is the right way to do
it in offices and in projects and
they'll be like hey let's do some
sprints let's do this and that and then
it's like guys every single company that
I know that does agile waste so much
time like I'm not even lying to you guys
it's pretty much a waste of time because
this what happens let's say you have a
website right you have to do a meeting
for that website right to figure out
what's the website about then from there
you do another meeting to talk about
what are the features that need to be
added then you do another meeting send
it out to the designers the design is
going they do their Park they go and
send it back to everybody
now there's another meeting for
everybody to just look over at the
design then they go back and forth send
the send the design some information I
hate change this fix test comes back
there's more waiting now you got a way
for everybody else to be on on time to
basically work on this project and go
over whatever the new designs goes
through right and then from there you
pass it down to the next person but okay
now we're gonna pass it to IT and the IT
comes in and looks at
and say hey this is what we can do this
was this is what we can't do this how
long is gonna take so now it's a waiting
time they're from there if you have
other projects to do you have to weigh
into those other projects get done and
then you jump to this new project so
there's like waiting and waiting and
waiting meetings or meetings or meeting
and it's like man sometimes man all
these meetings take forever we've had
you know other companies that I work for
before we've had like third parties who
are like oh yeah man sorry we use JIRA
we use this we use this and that and you
know our whole motto is agile we do
everything a job and it's like okay cool
so things are gonna get done in a
fashion you know fashionable matter like
you know it's like okay cool by the end
of the week we're gonna see some results
is like nah it doesn't work like that we
have to do a meeting to do a meeting for
a meeting like that's how it is and then
at the end they'll do a little bit of
work something that could have taken a
day and then they come back and send it
back to you and you're like wait it took
you to God like you know it was two guys
it took two guys to do this about two to
three weeks something that takes one day
to get done and it's again but we need
to get approval by this person we need
to pass it to this person to approve it
and then this other person goes in their
key ways in passes to develop like guys
nothing gets done that's why what you
think a lot of companies have to hire so
many developers most of these companies
that are running agile they're they're
basically hiring a whole bunch of
developers because every feature takes
forever to get done not because people
can get it done right away is because
somebody is like hey we gotta do a
meeting for this meeting
we need to do a meeting to get a meeting
for the meeting like that's all you're
going to see when it comes to agile
we're gonna add our environments one of
the worst things that could happen
to any developer and just for the simple
fact that it's just a waste of time
there's a lot of things that you know
you could get done right away but it's
like it's like the office politic it has
to get passed down to this person for
this person to approve it then this
person needs to pass it to this other
person to a program then they pass it to
another person to approve it and then
once it gets to the top the person says
oh no I don't like this so now everybody
does below that person has to start from
the beginning and fix everything and
then everybody got approved to approve
the approval like like is one of the
worst things in the world like as a
developer man you you'd be like
sometimes man I could just get this done
we could get this done as soon as
possible it's like wait we actually need
to do a meeting about this you can't
start coding you can't come in and start
code and start working and saying we
have a process right
we have waterfalls we have Springs we
have you know the whole shebang is like
man is a waste of time man like can we
just get some work done you know what I
mean so this guy he came in gave you a
couple of different little examples
where it was like your other factors I'm
playing work handoffs
waiting etc and then it's like you look
at this pie it's like okay maybe 20% of
the whole time was just to work then
everything else is just a waiting game
all right so yeah man I mean is there a
benefit to it sometimes very rarely but
I doubt it I've never seen a company
that is getting anything done from it
you know cuz there's nothing to say
sometimes you know let's say an example
let's say a a CEO or somebody who has
power in the company says you know what
man we do not know anything about what
development we do not know anything
about IT who do we call let's call
consultant a consultant comes in looks
at the flow of the company
it says hey I can save you guys money if
you guys give me you know $30,000 for
this more if I could set up a whole
system for you guys on how to deploy how
to test how to do this this and that so
the guy comes in gets $30,000 puts or
basically checks and balances for every
single thing in the world like checks
and balances are good but checks and
balances can be abused - all right it's
a way to just basically put everything
on hold nothing ever gets done because
there's always something like oh this
needs to get approved to get to approve
to get an approval link that's how it
works like pretty much anybody who has
done agile they'll have working any
company that's working with these
paradigms and this whatever like
freaking agile like I don't even know
what's what's the the exact work for it
agile methodology right like like
sometimes I'll be like man people come
up with things that you know reality you
don't need in in what development you
don't need it agile like this so many
companies and you know like look at this
company Atlassian right they make so
much money they these are the people
that sell the software for every company
that has been sold in the idea of agile
and all this extra BS I mean bitbucket
is legit I use big bucket SourceTree is
legit but let's talk about JIRA man like
it's like oh man this is a freaking
project management thing now they own
Trello let's see you know you yeah
collaborate chat confluence you got I
didn't do something called hyper chat or
something like that
funny chest something like that it's so
funny funny ass name that they have put
conversations Australian new ways it
seems talked me decided and to do is
like what
you charging people for this stuff like
Google already gives this for free you
know what I mean like there's so many
things here that I'll be like man why
are people paying for this but it's
because I got told you guys
most of the CEOs most of this owners
most of the people are coming in they're
VCS and people who are spending money
and investing money into companies they
don't know anything about technology
they don't know anything about the
process of programming somebody comes in
and be like hi my name is you know it's
Sean John hey my name is Sean John and
you know I used to work for Google and
you know in Google we basically at some
point we use agile and I helped them set
up agile so hired me for $30,000 and
I'll get your company up to speed the
same way how Google does it and then
this little company comes and signs up
and saying cool they sign up to all this
stuff they sign up to about $50,000 a
month of a lysine of products and then
they're like did we really need this a
year two years from that they're like yo
that we really need this then we just
spent all this money for no reason and
it's like yeah you waste the money
there was really no point of signing up
so this whole agile thing like you don't
need it just get people to work get
things done that's it
that's simple it doesn't take that much
for people to to understand what they
job is supposed to be but sometimes
people want to make something that's
easy and simple complicated to make it
seem as if it's like this is work
we gotta make us complicated as we can
you know what I mean it's like somebody
who you know is like it's like some
developers soon like when they do
something like they see something that's
easy and they're like wait we can make
this smarter how can we make this one
line code make it into a 35 line code
because we want to make it more
efficient than too efficient wait what
you want to make it more efficient than
something that was already efficient
like it was already good and you want to
make
a more efficient than what it was to
save you know 500 milliseconds or
something like that you know what I mean
like you start thinking I'm like wait
what like if it works it works leave it
alone let's get work done and let's keep
on moving I've seen this done plenty of
times you know developers are also
guilty of situations like that but the
owners man I'm telling you guys right
now they signed out to all is theirs our
companies cuz they don't even know
anything like a lot of these guys they
you know they go on no unlinked thing
they signed up for groups they signed up
for groups they signed up for you know
little teams and they really think like
they know stuff and as I bro you have to
be part of the community you have to
understand how the whole process of
coding is how it works how how long is
gonna take you know that's all the
things I hate the most when people come
in how long would it take and you're
like we have to do it we have to get in
there and start working on it and then
let me figure it out and tell you how
far we are by the end of the day no but
can you give me like a direct direct
time like you know a good estimate it's
gonna take two days three days one week
I have to get in there and see how long
it's gonna take I've never done it
before they're like oh there must be a
way to estimate this and it's like bro
this is nothing you know what I mean
like and that's the same type of people
that sign up to so agile man and GRI and
all this other stuff like man what a
waste of time and but that's why I
wanted to make this video when somebody
out there who has done this who who has
done our agile before knows what the
hell I'm talking about yes it can get
done it can work some in some cases with
minimum you know minimum checks and
balances that's the thing because the
problem is when now if everybody has the
power to veto things and be like oh this
can we go back to the drawing board and
redo this or whatever like now it's like
waiting on waiting or waiting and
waiting and waiting is
a meeting for meeting to get the meeting
it's like let's get an approval for the
approval just to get the approval like
that's what happens all the time people
that have done agile yeah I know what
