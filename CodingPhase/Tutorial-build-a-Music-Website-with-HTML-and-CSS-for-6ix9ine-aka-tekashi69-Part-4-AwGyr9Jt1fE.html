now the next thing that we're gonna
start building is gonna be this video
section that we have here okay so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna come here
we're gonna open up Adam okay if you
guys see a little difference from the
last video is yes I changed the settings
I change the UI to one dark and I put
the syntax of Seti okay this is I don't
know I like dark themes and the syntax
alright it's pretty simple I also make
the the font bigger because I know some
people were like man Joe make the fonts
bigger man
so I say okay cool let's do it alright
so let's move on so we're gonna build
this this section here so what exactly
does this have so this one section here
right and then we have a header which is
like the latest videos and then from
there we have like four boxes which we
could use CSS grid for okay so let's get
started all right so let me see there's
low low this one section let's go to the
next section so section I'm gonna put in
an ID of let's say media okay close this
tag and you know what sometimes when we
have a lot of stuff here we could just
close this you know make our life easier
see you like we already finished this
two sections let's you know close that
down just like that and then now we have
more space to play with okay so here
we're gonna say we got this media
section we got a header so we're gonna
put in div class let's just say title
name it title which is easier so ladies
videos okay and then we have Dave let's
say class let's put in videos okay and
then close this up okay and here we're
gonna do like this if you download the
Emmet this how you do it so you will say
video and then times four and that will
create all for them okay
I should create like a little small
course on Emmet just for the people that
don't know about it okay so let's
continue with this what do we have in
here this for each video what we're
gonna put let's just go find those
videos from Takashi six nine okay let's
go to youtube say Takashi Takashi okay
now let's put in gum oh yeah
alright so let's get this let me see
where is it click here and bed now we
get this iframe copy this from here we
see it what should we push so this is so
clear so video types yeah that's why so
copy this
we're gonna go into Adam again let me
move this here okay and we got a paste
this here okay save this let's get the
next one which is gotti
okay embed copy this from here and paste
this here all right now let's go back
let's get another one let me see you
know is it Billy
okay get Billy out of here
copy okay put this here let's see what
else
Kota all right
share embed and copy this all right now
we gotta come here put this here now as
far as the way if we just gonna say with
100% on all of them and we're gonna save
that now let's go to localhost 3000 and
as you can see we got all four videos
here okay cool so we got the HTML done
now let's work in the CSS ok this was
pretty easy all right I'm gonna come all
the way to the bottom I'm gonna create
for the ID what was the media I think
that's what we named it let me see
id media yes all right now in here we
got the title we're gonna put in
background black we're gonna say a
fun-sized 1.1 Ram we're gonna say font
weight 300 text transform uppercase I'm
gonna say max let's say padding let's
say a padding of 20 pixels all around
let's say text-align:center and let's
put in a wave 100% max wave let's put in
500 pixels put in margin:0 auto and save
that and there we go okay now we're
going to change the font color to white
okay so we got that now next thing that
we're gonna do in this media we're gonna
come here we're gonna put in a padding
of let's say 80 pixels you see what was
the pattern that we put on on this one I
put 100 pixels top and bottom okay so
let's do that padding a hundred pixels
top and bottom and let's say 50 pixels
left and right okay cool
now what we want to do we want to also
put this inside of a container totally
forgot about this so I'm gonna come here
close this so the reason why we want
this container so all of them could be
in this container of I think maximum
width of 400 is 1400 pixels so all of
them could be in the same line alright
so how was it we did this with a
container okay so we gotta put in
everything that's inside of the media
inside of a container so go like that
now we take all of this
cut it and hold on thing other than copy
I'm gonna copy all of the divs so cut it
out yes
and then now paste that in now I'm gonna
select door and I'm gonna beautify
editor content okay she's just to clean
up the the HTML okay as you can see we
are within the space now one thing that
I I need to do instead of putting the
padding on 50% inside of the media for
left and right that's for the zero we
actually got a do this for for this
section here the video section so let's
come here let's say videos put in
padding:0 top and bottom put in left and
right 50 pixels and as you can see now
it's evenly in there you see straight
line that's what we want we want
everything to be clean you know the same
lines cannot be spread out like you know
if this thing is a 1400 pixels from here
to there this cannot be from here to
here like it has to all be in the same
line that's how you make a website that
looks clean okay so let me see what else
what else do we do here okay you're
gonna come here we got the videos I'm
gonna say display grid
let's play grid okay now one thing that
do remind you guys is if you work on CSS
grid or CSS flexbox always look at the
documentation or what they have here CSS
tricks like sometimes there's so many
different CSS properties that you just
forget right it's impossible for you to
remember every single property unless
you use it every single day okay so this
is something that we're gonna use right
now so we're gonna say for this let's
come back here we're gonna use grid
template columns let's put in 50% 50%
okay
save that and as you can see we got that
all right now the next thing that we
want to do we wanna come here we want to
basically put in grade belief is grid
gap so a great gap is gonna be a 50
pixel okay so now we got the great gap
of 50 pixels now the next thing that we
want to do we're gonna come here let me
see so we got great guy 50 pixels we
want to put a padding top and bottom
actually oh let me look at the image
like how much let's say 80 pixels
so 80 pixels so there you go so that's
what we got so far
okay so that's looking fine you know
when I made this I I didn't say I wasn't
thinking like hey it has to look exactly
like that because I know the the
different sizes of this might change how
things work so anyways let's move on so
now we're gonna do the video now we're
basically editing each video I'm gonna
say border a radius say four pixels okay
whatever it is four pixels
overflow:hidden okay so now that makes
sure that we have you know the little
little circle around basically the
border radius okay and now let me see
vídeo para da I see let me change this
see the iframe height let's put in 100%
okay
in this video we're gonna put in height
of 300 pixels and there you go
so now as you can see we got the border
radius at the bottom but already is on
the top we got everything that we need
okay let me see what else now we need to
actually take the image and make it the
background so let's do that so the image
is actually was a group of piyo original
JPEG so let's rename this to something
like bandana that jpg which makes more
sense okay so now we're gonna come here
for video so we're gonna see background
image URL and then here we're gonna put
in slash / IMG / bandana dot jpg okay
let me call out at the end
save that background size cover okay now
okay so if you actually put in the wrong
place so we're gonna take this we
actually want this to be at the media so
now there you go
okay there you go okay so that's what we
got so far now one thing that we have to
do is you can see like the padding here
is too much because we have padding on
this and we have padding on on the media
ID itself too so what we're gonna do is
on this thing we're gonna actually just
say padding:0 okay under videos alright
and what we're gonna do is on this title
gonna say margin:0 0 and then 80 pixels
and then 0 so we're basically just
saying hey gift is a margin at the
bottom now let me see why today
okay so margin is giving us an error
doing it like that so you know what
let's do it the other way I don't want
to spend too much time on this so I'm
gonna say 80 pixels of padding for the
videos on top 50 left or right and zero
at the bottom so save that and there you
go okay cool now the next thing that we
want to do we want to put in a shadow on
this so we're gonna use box shadow
generator okay so in this we're gonna
say 0 0 and you know what maybe like 5
pixels we're gonna put in blur radius 0
put
zero okay and let me just see how that
looks
okay so for each video we're gonna put
in this this box shadow okay
save that okay that looks fine it's not
great
so let's tweak it a little bit okay
okay hold on hold on
Jesus Christ I can't copy this thing
okay save that something that you're
gonna see we missed the semicolon so it
kind of broke that's what I like the
auto autosave auto beautify unsafe
because if let's say I miss something I
miss a semicolon
soon as I save automatically you see
okay this thing is wrong so I can see
exactly where I need to fix it so I can
save this and I think that's pretty good
all right we could probably tweak a
little bit more but I don't have time
for that all right you guys could
definitely tweak a little bit more for
that if you guys want as far as like you
know the Box shadow okay so we're gonna
move on to the next thing and I'll see
you guys in the next video
okay the next video should be
what else is here day six nine okay
we're here kids
I'm gonna see you guys in the next video
