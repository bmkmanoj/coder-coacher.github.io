again man coding face.com
listen your boy is back I didn't did it
again guys listen
I've been telling you guys I was going
to review this course man your boy
coldsteel one of my favorite two
instructors alright one of my favorite
two instructors in the world one of the
people that I basically tip my hat to
because they helped me become a
developer it's that simple there's no
way around it there's no way to lie to
you guys it's not going to tell you hey
YouTube made me a developer team
treehouse made me a developer a coke
atom II made me a developer no these are
the guys that pretty much like if I
could I would give them like a check
like here man he's 10% him what I earned
now just because you basically you set
me up for life right you know some
people say hey you gonna come here and I
could come here and just give you say
$10,000 in your hand and try to make it
with that but if you come and teach me
how to actually learn how to code
like I'm gonna be completely grateful
about this because from there on I can
make $10,000 whenever I want you know
what I mean so now most of this courses
they're worth a lot of money like I'm
being honest I've actually done
tutorials I've actually done videos and
I know the work that they put into those
courses right especially cold steel you
know it's between coastal Steve and
Grider those two guys they're like that
neck-to-neck for me I believe they're
the best their voice is clear right they
know how to prepare a course they just
don't wing it you know like a lot of
people come on YouTube and do a video
and I'll wing it
oh you know cuz you know you know what I
mean I'm not anymore names but they just
wing it you know when it comes to
tutorial so then I'll explain to you why
things are happening
oh why they are important why you should
learn this course why you should learn
on a programming language or you know
database whatever it is right but yeah
and like I always tell you guys buy the
course from coal steel door what
developer boot can that that one right
there changed my life like I learned
HTML CSS bootstrap everything from that
course and you know where I'm at now
right now
Colt just basically created on your
course right and I feel like he's going
on hiatus he's been living off you know
that first web developer bootcamp
because it's not good even you know
years later that course can still be
shown to people and people gonna get
something out of it right now think
about this my C chord which is one of
the best languages to learn in the world
right now because everywhere you go they
need somebody who knows my sequel right
or even regular sequel you know it could
be regular sequel server it could be
Postgres like once you know one sequel
language once the equal database
basically from there on all the other
ones are easy you pretty much can
understand but the number one is my
sequel and before I even start this
whole or review on the course I wanted
to show you guys just were proof right
so automatically you're gonna see this
thousands of jobs out there right that's
just the 75,000 and up right that's just
like the 75,000 up but at the same time
there's so many things like database
tell of a developer intern junior PHP
web developer entry-level software
developer like my sequel pretty much is
like your door you know your your door
to getting into this industry it can be
one of those stores right of course if
you know HTML CSS if you know JavaScript
if you know databases right so if you
know these things you're pretty much
going to be successful like it's not
just knowing the view
knowing just the front end you also need
to know a little bit of the back end and
know a lot after my you know my secret
databases like these just to be honest
with you guys if you wanted to do
WordPress you need to know my sequel if
you wanted to do Drupal you got to know
my sequel those are like the places
where you could literally step outside
and you got to trip over jobs because
they're everywhere WordPress is a
million jobs on WordPress right now this
is a very specific group like of you
guys that ya love nodejs right but at
the same time MongoDB is not like one of
those technologies that is everywhere
now everyone is using no sequel at all
everybody uses sequel not no sequel
sequel which is my sequel PHP Postgres
on there's a whole bunch of other ones
right so pretty much your boy Colt
created a new course and I'm just giving
a little background before I even start
into this right so this thousands of
jobs on this day right if you come here
and you start looking around see that my
sequel and just sequin general is the
most powerful and most popular language
out here right now
right everywhere you go the jobs for you
so everybody needs to know it at least
the basics right now if you keep looking
down and we keep going we say hey let's
keep looking at this thing right just
some sequel alone you can make 50,000
right and that's not even nothing crazy
because you could come here and you can
see that my sequel is fifty five percent
of the industry using arena right and
then you have MongoDB twenty one percent
almost nobody use it remodeled a week
like you know it's great it's something
cool is something that we love you know
because it's closer to JSON right but at
the same time it's not it's not really a
industry standard the industry standard
is my sequel so your boy Colt steal
created this course
welcome to the ultimate science about
proper boot camp I know it's too a
mouthful the title
my name is cool I'll be an instructor
for this course so in my experience the
first couple minutes any course times
the first day of a college lecture it's
all devoted to introducing instructor
talk about the syllabus prep TAS and
exercises and turning an assignment and
you'll actually get to cover much of the
content is terrible but this is a MySQL
course I want to talk about - well as
soon as possible
so here's a promise me to make you I'm
going to talk about Who I am and
background care about that I'm going to
talk about what the course covers that
doesn't cover show you the projects and
assignments all that pops up in just the
next four minutes and then by the next
five minutes but assessment of this
course we type in sequel code we will
have to install anything on how to get
set up we have this nice work around at
a browser where you'll be able to
actually run code immediately okay so
that's my promise to you with that then
I'll shut up I'll start talking about
myself Who I am in the next video and
then move on little business or what
yeah so anyways that's just if you don't
know that's close to you that's my boy
you know he basically got just an
amazing course here guys man like let's
look into this thing right alright so
right now of course you're gonna see all
the checks on our through because
there's a lot of stuff that I already
know so I skipped through it
I just basically start going you know
video by video see exactly what he has
and I could basically tell which are
good which or not but pretty much like
not even lie to you guys like every
video is good I don't skip through every
single one I was like going he's
basically breaking down that took
me a long time to learn and broke it
down in a very simplistic way alright
and you know there's like so many cool
things that he teaches you how to insert
data which is the basics you know how to
create a database basically crud
commands you know gives you a little
challenge to get you started you know
aggregating functions
revising data types
the power of logical operators right
other stuff am I seem crazy my seem
foreign but all those things are are the
foundation of my sequel and once you
learn these things you're gonna be set
like you're going to be able to use Lera
and you're going to be able to use
WordPress you're going to be able to use
Drupal you're going to be able to create
apps in ojs with my sequel because if
you already took the web developers
bootcamp which you know already is good
now imagine this what he did here was
give you basically no js' revising no
js' again but showing you the way of how
to build a website with my sequel you
know Instagram he basically gives your
Instagram database Claude working with
lots of Instagram data which sounds
funny but yeah is pretty much it it's
like working with big data and
understanding it you know giving you a
full web app so not only are you
learning my sequel you also learning
everything from nodejs and just to get
you started right away
now I will say guys like there's a giver
right I'm not even lying to you guys
like this is straight up giving if you
don't have this course and you love
nodejs you giving yourself a disservice
right now because number one you have to
be able to be open to different
technology there's a lot of people going
to always the mean stack it just stack
whatever right guys my sequel is the
number one database in the world
Perry's right now not saying that it's
the best I'm just saying that it's the
one that everybody has right so when you
gotta go for the first job they're going
to ask you hey do you know my sequel
that's the first thing they're going to
ask you after you give them a little you
know a little background on yourself and
hey I know HTML CSS in JavaScript a
little jquery know a little bit react or
angular
then from there they're gonna ask you
him what do you know about the back end
and then you're gonna come in we are no
Mongo TV and no js' and then we have an
old man that's cool but at the same time
do you know my Seco soon as they hit you
with that
you're gonna be able to say hey yeah I
know my secret or I've actually worked
with no sequel database and also my
sequel database which is you know just
regular sequel and yeah guys like come
on man like I'm not I'm not gonna
freakin lie to you guys man this is one
of my favorite instructors out here
that's one of reasons why I basically
always put his course on my videos and I
don't know him personally I haven't got
the chance to talk to him
I've told two other instructors also -
sniffing Grider and stuff like that but
I haven't had the chance to talk to cold
steel I don't know him personally so
it's not like hey this is my friend and
I'm promoting his course know there's
somebody who basically taught me how to
become a web developer will create
another course that is amazing and I'm
ready to just tell the world about it
now you guys are getting a preview of it
all right there's so many cool things on
this course that I'm going to tell you
like those guys like you have to buy
this course now right now udemy is
having a sale for the last date is today
for $10 I think after that is going to
be $15 or $20 right and then they might
bring it back up somewhere at the end of
the month for another $10 right but I
will say like this see you guys if you
already started the what developer
bootcamp or you completed it this is
where you graduate this is where you're
going to get your skills that's going to
have you ready to go out to the world
and basically start getting this money
man like I don't know about you guys
like I don't do this stuff for fun like
I love creating my own personal projects
but at the same time lights got to get
paid when I say that I learn
technologies that's going to put
in my pocket I don't learn things just
to learn it sometimes I do sometimes I
put in a little extra on something
called a crystal leg but 99% of the time
I only learn things that is going to put
money in my pocket and this right here
my sequel it already paid itself a
million times and I had to learn this
the hard way
I had to learn this thing the hard way
the way how I learned this thing was you
know going from Kolkata me then from
there from coke atom e checking online
on on what is it w3c school with the w3c
school oh let me see
tutorials or something like that where I
was like missing my seat we'll see if
they still even have that page w3 school
this how I learned this thing I had to
come here and read this thing try for
myself go to the next day then you know
look at this go to the next night like
that guys to be honest it was hard
because it's like I'm learning by myself
not only is it hard because you're
learning by yourself in your house but
it's also hard because now you're going
from page to page to resource to
resource to basically learn a technology
or programming language or whatever
right but in this course you get
everything you know from how to install
it how to use it on the browser how to
create it create your database how to
maintain it like create your own crud
deal with big data like there's so much
good things in this course that you know
what am I like you guys you guys know me
like I don't I don't play around when it
comes to the courses you see what I've
done when I review a course I've
basically said the truth about it when a
course is pretty bad you can find me
saying is bad go look it up look it up
in my my channel there's of course out
there where
it was bad and I gave it a really bad
review now this this is where the good
things is that guys straight up alright
