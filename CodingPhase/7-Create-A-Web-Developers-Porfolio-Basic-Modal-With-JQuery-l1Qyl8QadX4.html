make sure you subscribe alright so what
we're gonna do now is because people
want to see this they want to know a
little bit about jQuery right so let's
ask me jQuery so what we're gonna do is
say jQuery CDN and yeah let's get this
minified version and just come back to
here and X let's add this at the bottom
so right before the closing tag off the
body we're gonna add script SRC
so now we should be having jQuery right
so what this does is it loads jQuery for
this page now let's say right now you
want it to the list script
let's change this title jumbo so we're
gonna take a fact we're gonna start with
this document doc ready and then I
started documenting this dot ready we're
gonna do function and basically here
we're gonna do this let's play around
let me see if I could change the
earthquake and body no CSS let's say
back
let's see if that works
yeah you see I changed the background
with jQuery all right so let me explain
what's going on here
so what this is saying is when the page
loads and it's ready basically run this
script so what this is saying on the
body tag change the CSS background to
FFF which is white all right so that's
how jQuery right pretty much works right
now we're gonna comment this out and
let's see let me sorry gotta save it all
right let's get back to it okay
all right watch if I do for for this
thing maybe I should create a motor
all right so motor was like you know
it's like a little pop-up but instead of
open up a new window is just like a you
open up a little pop-up inside the page
so that's create this right inside here
what we gonna do is we gonna display
image SRC
what else we're gonna for now we're
gonna take this we got a hard coat it
and basically put this thing through
here alright now in the CSS we're gonna
basically say moto slash container and
then we're gonna say background RGB RGB
a and that was our saying zero zero zero
zero and then here we're gonna do 0.7
all right
sometime we're gonna say position:fixed
top:0 left:0 and what this is gonna do
is basically is going to basically have
this box let's say for example with 500
pixels and then height 300 pixels so
what that does is it creates a box here
and then it places this top:0 left:0 so
it's always in the top left corner right
but what I really want is to be the full
screen so I'm gonna do where 400% height
100% all right so now the model is
actually the whole background see model
container is now the full width and the
full height of the window all right now
what I'm going to do is say
little container model and I say hey
with 500 pixels high 600 pixels margin:0
auto okay Auto yeah so what that
does is basically sentence the image
sensor to the motor so I don't know if
you guys see it even though the image is
there it's inside of the motor the motor
is actually just 400 pixels you see it's
just this box so it is actually Center
but the image is bigger than the the
motor itself so now let's do this let's
make this image where 100% you see so
now it always fits inside now let's do
this inside the motors to a padding of
15 pixels out of this we're gonna do
order size nice box sizing border box
and what this does is basically is
telling you calculate the inside of the
of the border box so it's basically
saying like hey whatever padding and
whatever margin you put make sure it
stays contained to this whiff right so
the whiff is 500 now you're gonna see a
change right now look how this change
right here you see when you was doing
the padding what I was doing it was
adding extra extra space to the box
itself but what you what you wanted to
do is just basically say hey I only want
this box to be 500 pixels so we're
border border sizing now whatever
pattern you put in is gonna be only
inside of it so it's always gonna be 500
pixels and whatever padding is always
inside so it's gonna come true on
constraint everything inside of it at
that size all right so let's see let's
take this height and let it be the
height of the image
let's say the pixels okay no what else
can we do okay model containers so I
want this to happen display box display
block play none and only show up what
that's saying is don't show up unless is
it's gonna say display block so what I'm
gonna do is modal container active
so let's play blocked so what it's
saying is if the modal container has the
class active then show it if not don't
show don't show the display back
so now disappear right now like let's
say with jQuery we saying I say box
right so let's do this class box
remember if you want to target this is
basically what it's doing is saying okay
I want to target this box this class so
anything with this class is gonna be
targeting I can also do an ID which will
be like that or you know like that box
so let's say my box
let's go what was I doing
but yeah a class active but this is not
what I want I want this click and then
in here you're gonna say you're gonna do
a function and we're gonna target the
modal model container oops
remember the class modal container dot
class active
let me see if that works oh it's not
working why is that box that sometimes
you got a search like jQuery click there
might be something that I'm missing
right now okay why isn't it showing it's
weird
I mean you know it's always gonna be
little like that
you see I'm actually adding the
container so it is working late look
look on the side here model container it
doesn't have the class active soon as I
click it now added the class active so
jQuery is actually working
now why is not showing up we gotta look
at at this thing
why isn't this working oh wait sorry
about that song if you put it like this
like separated the classes what this is
saying is model container and then this
is the child so anything that's inside
of model container call with the class
active then turn it to display blocks
but if you want to say model container
like me say a div with model container
and active then you have to put it
together so that model container dot
active so now it should work you see so
now showing up right cool
now if I wanted to close it just for now
to make it easier let's say
model so for now if I click a model
again I want the model container to
remove class active now when I click
again it's gonna disappear you see and
if you look here it removes it removes
the class active all right this is the
beginnings like super basic jQuery stuff
but you know just for you guys to know
get your feet wet
you already know make sure you subscribe
in the next video I'm gonna fix this up
and make it a little bit better you know
using jQuery okay guys subscribe and
sign up oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
