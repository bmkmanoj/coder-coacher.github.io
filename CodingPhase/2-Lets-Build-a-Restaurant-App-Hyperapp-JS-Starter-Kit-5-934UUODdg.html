do is we're going to come to github.com
slash coding face.com just like that and
then here we're going to find a
repository is right
you're gonna search for hyper app and
you're gonna look for the one that says
hyper app starter kit you're gonna click
in there you're going to go download or
clone it if you guys know how to do it
that's fine if you don't just regularly
just download it as a zip file right so
I'm gonna download it as a zip file for
you know for keeping things very simple
alright so we're gonna go to LA with
down those projects right we're gonna
look for hyper let me see or is it okay
hyper app starter kit - master we're
going to double click into that and then
we're going to drag this into wherever
we keep our project folders right so for
me I like to have things inside of a
projects folder all right it just makes
my life easier and I know hey this or
all the projects that I'm working on ok
cool so I'm going to drag the dare I
have it there cool
now the next thing that we're going to
do is we're going to rename this I'm
gonna say hyper restaurant
save that you're going to open atom
click file open and there from there
we're going to go into projects and go
into hyper or is a hyper restaurant open
it and then once we're here we're going
to
nobody terminal okay give me one second
open a new terminal here if you guys
don't have this terminal on Adam
it's called platform your ID so you
could have that there
cool let's say hyper restaurant and
we're gonna say npm install you know in
case you guys don't have all the things
in store yet they are instructions here
you know it's like hey install node
download atom install all the know
packages and p.m. install install go to
npm install gulp CLI that's G and that's
it and then you're gonna say NPM run
watch so we're gonna do that now once
this thing finished downloading all the
no packages then we should be fine now
let's look at this this image that we
have here okay let's go to the desktop
where I have the image of the restaurant
okay let me open this up for you guys
cool so the way how I'm gonna do this is
we're gonna have one app right the app
itself is the whole website okay and
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna break
it down into sections so I'm gonna have
one that's gonna be the header alright
this area here we're gonna have another
one which is gonna be called top section
here we're gonna say our story that's
another component we're going to create
another component for this which is
gonna be a special menu we're going to
create another section here called
quotes this one's gonna be call reviews
so every section we're basically
creating a new component for it alright
now here it's gonna be called our news
and then down here we're gonna call it
contact us okay and then we have the
footer of course so there's a lot of
different components that we're going to
create but in reality is just one single
app one single page okay so it's gonna
be pretty simple now let's come here in
this to NPM run watch there you go one
thing that I will say please guys if you
