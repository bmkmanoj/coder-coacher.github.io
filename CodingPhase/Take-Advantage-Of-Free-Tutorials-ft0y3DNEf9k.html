did it again yeah
hey guys put on my seatbelt trying to be
safe out here what I mean yeah so oh
what's today's topic well today's topic
is men take advantage of the free
tutorials man that I do right now I know
a lot of y'all get like oh man
I'm already learning HTML CSS JavaScript
PHP and I'm learning Java there wasn't
no js' and I'm learning this this and
that
right well guys if you look at my
tutorials right all the rocky stack
tutorials guys you're going to learn
everything the basics everything that
I'm teaching you guys you literally
could take one line and put it into
another programming language and you're
gonna be able to do the same shape you
know so it's like you're gonna learn all
the concepts that you need to build a
force that weapon and
turkey sandwich you already know one
honey mustard how you know yo Andre how
you know Mustang yeah
that's exactly what I'm ordering
hey you guys probably like oh man
whining order turkey sandwiches all the
time well this time that you guys might
not know
I I definitely have some
stomach issues I can't eat everything
everything that I used to eat that I was
able to eat when I was younger I can't
eat that alone yeah this guy's crazy
[Laughter]
yeah man
people crazy right now this is
just like we just parked this right
here like that whoa parking guys I'm
parking I need both hands for that I'm
in the parking lot the one that you guys
hate because there's no service out here
I'm sorry but you know that's how it is
the lunch chronicles man this goes
you know they not great quality but they
great quality at the same time none of
us that's my boy playing around with me
on the parking lot
he's honking the horn like crazy acting
like he was gonna hit me but I know he
wasn't but yeah man I can't like I was
saying I can't eat everything all the
 that I used to eat I can't either
no more
I'm either gonna throw up or it's just
gonna up my stomach so it's like I
just eat stuff that I know I could eat
you know turkey sandwich it's plain
simple because it's like when you go to
like let's say you go to McDonald's that
 it's like frozen food it's not
organic it's not you know it's
not like real meat it's frozen
meat from a year ago you know so I'll
try to keep my healthy right now
guys
but yeah man going back to the um
you guys should definitely take
advantage of the free tutorials man that
I'm doing like I guarantee you guys you
guys gotta be better developers after
you watch it I guarantee you guys gonna
learn a lot man and this thing is
getting better because right now the
basics of understanding how to make the
views you know how to make a route which
you need that for every other language
out there every other framework when
you're going to use it on Express you
need to know what the hell of Rao is you
got to understand what the hell a
template engine is I'm teaching you guys
that you know but it's up to you guys if
you guys want to do it if not yeah I
just got to be in here under watching
the videos why I get to create cool
and you be at home still trying to
 learn from clean treehouse
and still trying to learn from coke
Adam II like you knows like it's up to
you if you want to listen to me you know
sometimes you just you gotta stop being
lazy and just be like yo you know what I
 with Joe I know what are you
saying let me just follow what he's
doing you know
because I don't do this tutorials for
five people to watch I'm making it for
every single one of you guys to watch it
and do the tutorials not just to be like
okay I'm gonna make the tutorials and I
know only five of you guys is going to
do it because everybody else is either
lazy or just don't want to do it you
know what I mean so I want you guys to
 do the tutorials man I'm not
doing this from my own front you
know because if I wanted to design for
my own fun or like just for me I will be
working or coding face.com
and a lot of you guys keep telling me
man I'm trying to register I'm trying to
click join and it's not working and it's
because I'm doing tutorials I'm trying
to help people out to learn new but
it's like nobody wants to learn nobody
wants to put in that work so I might as
well just build my website you know I
don't even know why I'm wasting my time
making tutorials if none of you guys is
gonna do it you know so yeah I gotta
step your game up man I'm trying to help
you guys
yeah man what do I think about web game
development yeah it's legit
I'm trying to learn this this library
called phasor pH a ser fazer Jas and a
scene from what I hear it's supposed to
be the best library to make html5 games
so I'm trying to learn that actually
that's one of the courses that I bought
on udemy this week I bought that one I
bought on another goal class because I
still want to learn a little bit more
about gold I took another course which
is on only lick sir
I bought a course on your lick sir even
though I'm not a huge fan but I have to
also learn it even though I'm not a fan
of it I have to learn it because I don't
know a year from now somebody
might come to me but I hate do you know
elixir I don't want to be like the only
person in the world but I don't know I
don't know elixir you know so I'm
learning it what else I think I bought
another course about how to make
how to make a you t'me course for
somebody somebody that I respect in the
game
so I bought a course from him on how to
make a proper udemy course because
that's the thing I want to make a course
but I don't wanna make a course just for
 like this thing is going to
take me a whole year to do I'm going to
take my time I'm gonna put as much
information as I can into one course and
then I'll sell it a year two years from
now you know but I want it to be legit I
don't want to just you know half-ass it
but I oh hey guys come over here and
 buy a course for $10 and it only
took me two days and then I make like
200 grand out of two days I
think that's like you know that's
cheating your viewers that's cheating
the people who buy courses cause that
 happens to me all the time
I'll buy courses on udemy and I'm like I
got a returning because it's
 people didn't put in time people
don't even make a slice that makes sense
so it's like if I'm gonna create a
course it has to be like the best of the
best I don't want it to just be half-ass
yeah here Thailand the food in Thailand
is pretty good man
I haven't heard of the Y's them I never
heard of it so I can't explain it I got
a look at it I'm gonna look into it and
then I explained it to everybody I come
back make a video on it
yeah man check out those tutorials it's
literally I put it on the first thing
that you you're gonna see you click on
my channel right you click on my name
where it says coding phrase right there
as soon as you click on that then you're
gonna be able to see other videos and
other tutorials demo so just watch that
you know take a time and right now it's
up to I think four videos four videos in
every day I'm dropping a new tutorial I
think it's going to be up to 20 to 30
different videos so the series is going
to be a long series and each video is up
ten minutes so take advantage guys
definitely take advantage it's free
plus I'm putting in my time and
I'm explaining it not in a way of like
hey these guys are our developers
because that's the thing where a lot of
tutorials are a lot of people mess up at
is that they create this videos and this
tutorials in a way as if the person
already knows what the hell you're
talking about
and that's why people get lost I used to
get lost all the time when I used to
watch a tutorial on YouTube or I used to
watch a tutorial on a course I would be
like why are people talking to me as if
I'm already a developer like I know what
the hell is going on like I didn't know
what the hell was going on when people
were talking about Oh use this method
and use this you know get this code to
the API and this is this and that and
then you're like wait what the hell now
I got a search was a method online now
that I search what's the API now I got
to search a whole bunch of terminology
instead of explaining it to me as if I
don't know anything you know so that's
the thing that's why I make my tutorials
I call it dummy proof like even a
three-year-old co-learning
because I explained it in a way that
anybody can bear and of course you know
what I mean so yeah hell no I'm not
trying to milk you guys like I want to
make a course and I I sort of got watch
when I make a course most likely I'm not
even going to promote it here because
you guys are a different crowd of people
that I wanna you know the course is
going to be for you know it's like if I
make a course it's got to be more for
other people that haven't found me you
know like I might say okay guys I
created a course go check it out if you
want if you don't want to it's fine but
I'm not going to target it here on or
promote it here on YouTube because I
have other places other avenues so I
always feel like if you guys come to me
if you come to me on YouTube it's
because yeah I want to see me I want to
talk to me I want to get my my input and
certain things you're not coming to me
to buy a course you know it's like the
same thing I'm not gonna promote either
boot camp which I never went to I'm not
gonna promote a course that I never took
i'm not going to promote courses that
are not going you know like when i tell
you guys check the description check the
courses that made me into a developer
that's because those are the courses
that made me into a developer I'm not
putting it up as if it said oh yeah I
found a good course on udemy guys and go
check it out
no because if I show you guys my my
udemy account I have like 40 different
courses there and do I put 40 courses on
my description no only put the ones that
made me into a developer that's it not
the courses that I took in general
let me see what people say
please structure your coding tutorials
videos you will get more subs guaranteed
yeah I think you know it'll be different
that's the thing is like I feel like the
the people that are gonna watch my
tutorials are not other developers it's
like if I'm already a developer right if
I already working in the industry I'm
not going to watch some guy on YouTube
you know like I already know how to
 look at the documentation you
know what I mean the people that watch
on YouTube most likely are people are
interested in becoming web developers
are on the way to become a web developer
so I'm not going to to make my my
tutorials where it's a to structure
because at the same time people want to
see you know they want it in a way where
it's different you know what I mean like
for me I hate watching a tutorial where
I know the guy has one screen here and
then he has another screen where he has
all his code already ready I hate that

because it's like I'm not learning like
that it's like what he's doing is
copying and pasting stuff that he
already did what I do is I go in I said
okay today I'm gonna create a tutorial
about views so then I go in there and
basically I do a tutorial I don't just
go and start copying it and pasting copy
and paste that's what they do it and
that's not that's not my style you know
so I can't do that I'm not trying to
copy and paste code you know song
yeah man we definitely definitely gotta
talk later on you know tonight I'm doing
the know you know the mentees mentorship
program experiment tonight at 8 o'clock
p.m. we're going to talk to the guys
let's see where they act you know that
project like I said a project is a big
project because there's a lot of pieces
to it it's not just the views this up
sorry there's a lot of pieces to it
that's the views then from there you
gotta also build their interaction with
either jQuery or framework and like all
of that stuff it takes time you know
especially for people who are just
beginning but I hope that you guys at
least got you know got the views in so
this week coming up we could just work
on the JavaScript side but yeah man like
if you want to contribute to Conan face
calm I think the best way would be to
for now give me ideas or if you see a
page is missing like okay like right now
I know there's not an in about page and
I know there's not in you know a
frequently asked question like a FAQ FAQ
on page or you know stuff like that like
or ideas that you guys might come up
with like you could go in there and just
create it the code is then you know you
can literally go into the code you're
gonna get hub comm / - gee which I'm
gonna move that that repo from there to
the coding phase calm or github account
because the jsg I'm gonna delete that
it's like that was like my personal
account when I was like first starting
so I have a whole bunch of
projects in there but the corn face.com
is more legit so I'm gonna move it there
so if you guys want to help out you know
you could definitely jump on that
well mning I think go back to Gary Choi
I think I don't know I think they are
structured in a way where you could
follow where pretty much I'm showing you
everything that you need to know like I
don't know what more structure you want
out of that like your phone if I show
you if I show you okay here are the
folders right then you're looking at the
folders if I show you hey there's the
fire where you basically edit to change
the view you're getting the file where
to change the view I don't know one more
where you want for the tutorial you know
here man so let me see what else
okay Gary chaw he says okay his :
tutorials are really hard to watch and
I'm pretty smart so I don't know what
other people who think okay which oh are
you watching which is it look forget
about the nodejs
tutorial forget about the node.js
tutorial take the the one that I just
made right now right the nodejs tutorial
was like super like beginner status that
was like all the way in the beginning
when I was just starting to learn how to
build this whole thing how I'm gonna
make the videos that video is definitely
not structured the new tutorial of the
rocky stack which is pretty much is just
react Krystal camel and yarn simple
follow that Gary trust me take your time
take your time today go in there going
to my channel
the first playlist that's there is going
to be the rocky stack take that watch
that later on tonight I'm doing the part
2 of the views and tell me again if you
don't like it if whatever you don't like
you let me know but I'm telling you this
tutorial is way better than all the
other ones because I basically broke
down everything into small pieces
small videos is not no longer doing a
long-ass video it's more just
doing one thing at a time so you could
actually understand it and I repeat
myself again at the end of the video so
you can understand it so you know what I
mean so take your time go watch it
yeah that's the thing man you wanna I
don't know I feel like I want to teach
people in a way where it's just dummy
proof you know like I don't want to
teach them I don't want to think in my
head of it oh people are smarter than
this and they're gonna be able to get it
like this no I want to think everybody's
done even though I know nobody's dumb I
want to think in my head everybody's
done so like that I can explain things
in an easier easier way where people
anybody could get it you know what I
mean I don't want to show people like
you know start going to big words start
throwing big concepts together
when people is like I don't understand
what the hell is going on and then it's
like I don't know if you guys have been
through this where you watch a tutorial
and you know in between the tutorial you
got to keep doing a whole bunch
of Google searches because you got to be
like oh he's talking about this but I
don't even know what the hell he's
talking about
so then now you got a search on on
Google so like let's say an example
somebody's talking about tuples right
they talking about tuples and you're
like wait what the hell is a tuple now I
got to go online and search what what a
tuple is but the guy that's teaching you
the tutorial doesn't even explain it or
show you what the hell the tuple does he
just says hey by the way we're gonna use
a tuple here and then he just starts
building it and you're like wait what
the is a tuple now I got to go
online and search for it so that's why I
don't want to do you know so that's what
I'm saying
what is a comfortable math level for web
development I will say algebra if you
your pass algebra you're fine
you know now if your dinner with more
complex things like you know dealing
with the canvas or dealing with you know
video games or dealing with stuff like
that what you need to do calculations
then calculus but a reality is very rare
that you need anything no need to to
know anything past that you know even
calculus one I think calculus one does
that's a good level for web development
okay guys don't worry about it man
everybody has their own opinion
if Gary I agree with Gary 100% my first
tutorials as far as like nodejs it
wasn't the best because I didn't explain
a lot of things but don't get turned off
by that tutorial I'm actually thinking
about taking it out maybe deleting it
but I don't know then some other people
tell me they like that tutorial and it's
funny because I created that tutorial
right a lot of people told me they liked
it and then I stopped making the
tutorial no js' because nine of people
were taking the course and now it's
crazy because now it's picking up and a
lot of people are taking that that
tutorial and I'm just like I haven't
finished it it's not a finished project
it's more like it's made way it's not
even teaching you the whole the whole
stack of nodejs because at the time I
stopped it because I was like oh
nobody's watching tutorials and it's
like the same thing with the rocky stack
right now I feel like I'm putting in so
much work even though it's ten minutes
it takes about half an hour to do those
videos you know so when none of you guys
watch it I'm like I feel a certain type
of way I'm like why am I wasting why am
I wasting half an hour to an hour doing
this videos when I could literally come
here just talk to you guys get more
views get paid more because of the
advertising from YouTube then mean
wasting time in an hour making tutorials
you know what I mean
tutorials don't pay so the only thing
that I want for people is just to watch
the tutorials if the tutorials is bad
then tell me it's bad I know the nodejs
tutorial is not complete but this new
tutorial that I'm doing the rocky stack
it's a legit tutorial guys like
you're gonna learn so much and I'm
telling you and everybody has their own
opinion you can say whatever you want
you know
don't milk us
don't you know milking is like when you
know let's throw it out there
clever programmer
that guy's a milker he just comes on
YouTube he doesn't care about the
community he doesn't care about
collaborating he doesn't care about our
answer and back to to the viewers he
doesn't care about working with any of
you guys he doesn't care about doing
anything for free for you guys he's here
to basically get his money promote his
 course for five hundred
dollars which makes no sense
when he don't even have experience to be
charging $400 but he's charging $400 and
then he's paying for promotion on
YouTube which gets him more views and
more subscribers and it's like you know
what I mean like come on man he's just
here milking people and then he's just
selling his course as you guys can see I
don't sell no courses I'm creating a
website coding phase com that's gonna be
a hundred percent free I'm not here
milking nobody
I could literally people send me
messages all the time like Joe could you
create your own courses and selling you
to me I want to support you I want to
buy your course and then what do I do
I'm like bro I'm not going to create a
course on udemy because I'm not gonna be
taking people's money when I feel a
hundred percent comfortable and I have
the time to sit down for like a month to
three months just in my house working on
a course creating the slides creating
the good explanation giving you guys
good resources then I'll create a course
but how can I charge people $10 $20 for
course when I don't even have time to
create a proper course you know it's not
right you know what I mean so that's
what milking is milking is just
people coming in to YouTube and knowing
that there's people that are
trying to change their lives and like
you know what there's a market for that
so let me try to make money other out of
those people it's like people who are
realistic they they're here to milk
people to like let's say right now
you're thinking on I want to become a
real estate agent now you search on
YouTube oh I want to become a real
estate agent now there's some guy
selling you a webinar online is
like a you take my webinar for $300 I'll
teach you how to sell houses how to buy
houses with zero down payment which is a
 lie so that's one of the ways
that people mail people people come here
to try to learn how to become what
developers they're like okay I'm a milk
um I'm not charging 100 dollars for
course imma charging $500 for a
course and then what do they get back
out of it just me being able to email
them back so they gotta pay me $500 a
month for that you know so that's
milking Oh what else is milking oh let
me see what else what else is milking
people that make music right they make
music and they come to YouTube and
they're like oh yeah hey guys I make
music here's some cool beats but for you
to basically you know to make beats like
me you gotta buy my drum kits and my
drum kits are $50 each it's like people
are on YouTube because they want
to see free content they want to see
free they're not here to
have this like a commercial you
know so that's what milking is
nah all you really needed for web
development guys if you guys are still
talking about web development and you're
talking about math all you need is to
basic I mean do you know how to
add numbers do you know how to multiply
numbers do you know how to get
percentages that's what development
anything beyond that is more events like
JavaScript work or advanced back-end
work where you will maybe use stuff that
you might need from like that you might
have learned from algebra or sometimes
you might have learned from calculus one
but besides that you don't need
anything more than that
oh yeah man
I miss you Missy what I what I what I
what up I'm reading everybody's comments
let me see them I see
Ruby on Rails Ruby on Rails listen man
if you want to learn Ruby um that's why
you gotta learn them and don't thinking
rocky stack guys Ruby's dying out it's
not that yet but new people are not
learning it because it's a slow language
that's why I'm learning you know all
this new technology like you know I'm
teaching you guys crystal Lang and and
working on your shape because I love the
syntax of Ruby but Ruby's slow
so if I love those syntax I'm gonna use
crystal language is the exact synchron
syntax as Ruby but yeah man
yeah exactly that kid is the tie
Lopez of a programming like
straight up look it up
yeah Kota faces free man
yeah no definitely right now there's not
that many look when you learn crystal
Lang you're not learning it because you
know I want to get a job on crystal lane
right away if you know crystal Ling you
could apply for Ruby on Rails and not
Ruby or rails Ruby programming or
 jobs you can apply for dumb
python jobs you could apply for a hope
gold for languages a golden job
sorry hungry but I'm hungry and
I'm hot in this car
oh yeah
so it's like you're doing it for
yourself guys trust me let me know which
I think check this tutorial out look it
up I'm gonna see you tomorrow man well
I'll see you later on tonight
your estimate estimate that's an office
Don come back okay all right man take
that you know he's trying if it doesn't
work not easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
