stay up y'all today I'm dropping a video
today guys
listen I'm dropping a video like a three
four o'clock right in this videos about
five youtubers that I'm watching right
now because you guys know I stopped
watching all the youtubers who do code
because mainly I just I can't take it
I'm not one of those people that they
could come here and just like
watching and watch other people do what
I do and like copy my or copy and
gives a little bit I can't so I stop
watching every other youtuber because
also I don't want to get influenced by
nobody so and I stop watching people for
like two weeks already so I made this
video about the people that aren't
watching right now the people who are
I'm actually looking at and there's a
couple of people who are pretty cool man
a couple of youtubers that I feel you
guys should definitely check out because
as you guys can see like all of you guys
I know you guys are like self-made
people who are trying to better yourself
in life and I think this channels are
legit
you know you dig you dig yo Clarence
what up Zachary what out it was good to
see new people in here man I get excited
when I see that yak what up yak from
Russia yak was the P stop where is the
piece done let me know what a piece that
is man that's all I know from Russian
man he used to have a russian chick she
always somebody want some piece that
that's all she always say man greetings
from the Czech Republic
you dig my people from the Eastern
Europe we ain't here man we got a pretty
good diverse community I love it
finally starting the coke course there
you go
gotta go away man yeah man so what's
good guys man talk to me
when's that video coming out is coming
out this week I was supposed to do it
yesterday right and I kind of messed up
this will happen I kind of messed up the
videos it was a release yesterday um
going over Colts new course right but I
messed up I messed up twice I uploaded
the the video where it says is react
killing angular right which is my last
video so I messed up that's messed up
once right this is another mistake the
other mistake was that I uploaded that
video with the music still playing in
the background it was supposed to go
under it and fade out like all my other
videos so now I got a real bloating I
know people's gonna be like oh my god we
saw this video already as I get I'm
reloading it for other people okay right
and then the third mistake was because I
uploaded that video I was supposed to
release it release this arm the cold
steel review course
alright that was supposed to come out
first before the angular 1
so the react is killing angular it's
supposed to come out today and then the
other one that I'm doing about the
youtuber is supposed to come out
tomorrow and then the cold steel course
was supposed to come out yesterday but
you know your boy overs out here you
know I'm a human being I made mistakes
it's okay cuz you still love me and I
love you guys back man you know
okay guys group hug group hug right now
everybody get a group hug there you go
pat in the back group hug
but
guys man I'm messing with you guys man
but yeah that was my fault now the music
was was dope but I think it would have
been good if ever came down a little bit
lower you know
yo Zachary man you gotta you gotta do
this man I'm telling you guys listen I
did a video I did a video which I didn't
release this week which it was about me
having a whole bunch of money in my hand
right and then I didn't release it
because I didn't wanna I thought after
watching it the first time I watched it
I said oh this video is legit I'm out
here with like you know five racks which
I just got those five racks from a
client that day because I'm doing a new
website for a client and I wanted to
show you guys why is it good to you know
become a web developer and it's like you
know it's like I was going to start I
was going to come out with like five
racks in my hand cash because you know
some people don't pay you with checks
some people don't pay with credit card
they want to pay you a cash so I was
going to show all of that but then after
watching the video I realized it was a
little bit just a little bit too much
you know even for myself even if I say
yo it's a little bit too much I overdid
it I kind of overdid it and I was like
man I can't put this to the internet man
if I put this into the Internet people's
gonna be at oh my god this guy's all
about money because it was literally all
about money the whole video but the
point of the video was to motivate you
because you know I kind of broke a
record this month man I broke a record
with earnings from YouTube broke a
record from earnings from my other
websites
I broke a record from the earning some
gain from my job know my job I'm getting
the same pay because I'm
salary even if I work overtime but
everything else plus another five racks
that I just got randomly from a client
it just broke I broke my record you know
as far as how much I earned in this
month right and I was like I was like
man I got five right so I got my fitting
racks on this other account another ten
racks on this other account I was like
I'll be doing it and then I thought
about it I was like man
I can't be doing this on the
internet it's like yeah I could I could
come in here and try to motivate you
guys but man there's so much money in
here guys like I'm broke I'm broke
compared to a lot of guys in here man
plus another thing that I wanted to tell
you guys I'm gonna make a video about
this is just because you become a web
developer and you work for a company it
doesn't mean your hustle stops there
right yeah because you got hired doesn't
mean that your hustle stops there right
think about it like this
what if Mark Zuckerberg woulda just
stopped
where he was at he was okay I'm in
Harbor already and I'm gonna work for a
company and that's it right no he had a
skill and that skill he made it to work
for him he created a great website and
all of you guys can create your own
projects your own product your own
website your own software as a service
because once you get the skills guys you
could work for a company but at the same
time have a side hustle make money on
the side
don't be stupid like a lot of people who
are like oh they get burnt out that I
own man I only do call that work
that's stupid do do coat in your house
to create new projects create new
websites like codifies comma keep
bringing it up but I'm telling you guys
like that's my baby right there that's
the you know that's the golden
goose that's the golden cow like
that website alone right now is going up
every single day so now we get a 500
people that come to my website every
single day without the website even
working right it's not working it but
still get 500 people that go to my
website every single day now when I
finish this website and I'll make
everything that I want to add to it
right once its life and I say guys
register at that moment my earnings is
gonna go 75 percent up now because you
guys are gonna pay for it but because of
average
because of our different promos that I'm
gonna get with other companies so all
that stuff is like money is gonna go
like this this year it's like it's
climbing up every single day right but
all of this comes from me learning how
to become a web developer and that's
what I want to teach to you guys it's
not the fact that is like oh I coming
here and flash some money or are
coming here talk about what I got
no it's to motivate you guys because
guys I was broke like you guys
don't know what it is to go to be in
school right and then the only money you
have is to go to school you don't even
have money to come back to your house at
one point I was to that like that my mom
gave me five dollars
no my mom gave me two dollars right the
MTA costs four hours to get on the train
right get on the train and come back I
went to school I had to be on the train
and be like yo can SWAT somebody who
swiped me in looking like a bum like
this is like straight-up real story I'm
there looking like a bum asking people
yo can you swipe me in can you swipe me
and can you let me in because I didn't
have two dollars and fifty cents to get
back home of course that was a long time
ago that was when I was like 19 years
old but I still hold on to those moments
because those moments remind me of like
I don't want to get there I don't want
to go back to that time I don't want to
be depending on other people to give me
money I don't want to be depending on on
luck cuz people like us we don't have
luck we make luck meaning we don't wait
until that old man you know I'm waiting
for this lottery ticket nah man I'll
make the lottery that's how it is it's
like you got to come out here and you
got a think positive him but I this
 like I'm out here and I'm I'm
 I'm the lottery ticket nobody's
gonna give me this lottery ticket you
know what I mean so for you Zachary
then take this and just
bust your ass man I guarantee it in like
two three months man you you're ready to
start going for job job interviews right
now listen to this 85 percent other
people that graduate from boot camps
should possibly get jobs right and most
of those guys are not even prepared and
I'll tell you because I interview a lot
of people that come out of boot camps
they're not big print they're not
prepared at all most of the times when
we do hire them is because we just need
an extra hand now if you a self-taught
developer go in and say hey I'm gonna
learn how to code eight hours a day
seven hours a day six hours a days
whatever time you put in at the end
you're going to see that pay off
because you're gonna get a job and then
from there if you're smart and you say
hey what is it what is the service that
people need there was a article that I
saw the other day of some kid making
millions because he created a website
for people to be able to walk dogs you
know like have a dog right it's like if
I have a dog and I'm like man I go to
work I can't have my dog in my
house pissing and all day right
so then this kid comes and he created a
website that basically he could send
people to come to my house pick up the
dog walk it for me and then they
get paid I think it's ten
dollars a day
now imagine that if the guy has multiple
clients now you know you haven't
nationwide now you're talking about
thousands of clients and
everybody's paying $10 every day
you know how much that kid is making I'm
talking about millions of dollars man so
sex guy is the limit like this thing is
like sky is the limit guys man
