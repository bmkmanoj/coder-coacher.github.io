again man : face.com today we're gonna
talk about MPM and why I switched from
MPM to PM PM now to be actually even
more precise I actually switched from
MPM to yarn and now from yarn I'm
switching to PM PM
now one thing you gotta know about NPM
NPM is like the originator you know for
no modules and package manager okay for
JavaScript and for most of the tools
that we use for the front end okay when
you use react we use a web pack you
usually download them directly from NPM
okay now you probably already know that
okay so then from there yarn came out
and it's part of Facebook and Facebook
was like you know what we created
something that's gonna make your life
easier it's actually faster and that's
great you know
thumbs up for them but they still
haven't solved the issue of being
efficient right because every time you
do a download of any library out there
right every single time that you do that
you come in and you download a package
every single time that you say npm
install all right so let's say you have
low - version 4.0 and this other project
that I'm working on is also downloading
low - 4.0 right every time that I do npm
install it downloads over and over and
over again if you guys have noticed on
your computer every time that you do my
web developer starter kit or you do any
type of project that you download off
the internet from somebody you pretty
much got a download like a hundred two
hundred sometimes I've seen four hundred
megabytes of packages inside of now or
node modules so it's like I don't know
about you guys I care about my my hard
drive I care about my space um I'm
working with I believe it's like 200 and
something gigabyte hard drive for my
macbook and every time that I come in
I say hey npm install it downloads
everything but once I reach a certain
limit I have to always delete the no
modules from older projects that I have
now what p.m. p.m. sauce is basically
saying hey instead of you having to
download it in every single project
right
we're basically only going to download
the things that you don't have already
leader in your global area so p.m. p.m.
basically downloads let's say an example
react right and once it downloads react
it downloads it once and every other
project that needs it it just links it
to that but it doesn't download it over
and over and over again you're
definitely gonna get a boost but what I
love about it is the fact that it's more
fishing it's not just every single time
you download something then you say npm
install if you already have that version
on your computer why do you keep on
downloading it over and over again now
I'm pretty sure MPM and yarn will add
this later on in the future but
currently I'm going to be using PM PM
all right so I'll see you guys in a
little bit so what we're going to do is
we're going to install it with NPM we're
gonna say NPM install alright and it's
gonna install all of them alright all of
the packages that we need and I want to
use this thing as an example because
this thing has react has hyper app I
mean not really react it has a gulp
it has hyper app has no sass it has what
pack what else it has like a lot of
packages here all right but you're gonna
see a big difference between the files
that npm downloads compared to the files
that PM PM downloads all right cool now
I just did this npm install right this
thing added 1,300 packages in a 154
seconds guys this thing took forever
right now most of the time that it took
it basically was with no sass and that's
fine you know installing
no size takes forever all right but
we're gonna look into this folder okay
we open this node modules folder and as
you can see this thing has so many files
so many different dependencies that we
don't even know what the hell did it
install what the hell did it down low
like this is kind of ridiculous all the
stuff does is basically downloaded now
I'm gonna show you guys the difference
I'm gonna delete this go here delete and
I'm going to do p.m. p.m. install all
right and we're gonna see a huge
difference right
and one thing that you're gonna notice
is I've already downloaded PM PM right
but it's looking at all the files and
saying hey how are we using this because
I've already downloaded this before so
it's already in a global space okay so
since it's already in a global space it
doesn't need to download it so now the
only thing that is really worrying about
is dealing with no sass okay now there's
like something that no matter why like
you still got to go through the hell of
no sass I'm pretty sure this some way to
get rid of this thing at some point it's
really annoying and I think that's why a
lot of people are also switching to like
something like post CSS but besides that
that's saying all of our packages have
been downloaded before so instead of it
downloading them over and over again
like it's just downloaded it once and
it's even less files then the one that
NPM was using ampion downloaded 1300
this thing was like hey it's 1100 and we
already downloaded them so we don't have
to download them again and there you go
so you can see it tells you exactly the
the projects that well the packages that
download it for this project
okay and then when we come here into our
known modules it's a more manageable
folder like it's not 1300 files inside
of this you get what I'm saying like now
this thing is a more you know more
manageable folder and it's like you
don't feel so bad
every time that you install a new
project it's like hey if I already
downloaded this I don't need to download
every single file over and over again
only give me the files the ones that are
brand-new and then I could literally
come here and say p.m. p.m. run watch
and I have everything working same way
that I did before with NPM and goofy on
everything works exactly the same
application is good all my files is
there my web pack is working my gulp is
working so yeah alright guys this is
pretty cool I'm gonna show you guys how
to install it it's super simple so you
go to github.com slash p.m. p.m. / p.m.
p.m. all right and then to install it
you can literally use am/pm write you
quite a use a standalone standalone
script where you copy this into your
terminal and put it here and just say
okay
paste that in or you could just say npm
install global PM PM alright you come in
you paste that there and then once that
is installed PM PM install - G p.m. p.m.
which is just to upgrade it ok now
what's cool is like if you already
downloaded something why do you need to
download it again you get what I'm
saying like it shows you like hey if
downloading a couple of things but you
already have these modules you already
have this proud of this packages like
you don't need to download them again
alright so
you see it's basically updating it and
that's it guys p.m. p.m. version one
point twenty three point two alright
