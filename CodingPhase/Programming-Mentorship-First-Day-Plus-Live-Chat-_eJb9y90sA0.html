cool man good to meet this guy's man you
know I April bath Andre Tommy matt i
trow so yam and this was pretty pretty
cool man this thing was supposed to be
just for people was opposed to be three
people somehow it became a whole bunch
of people listen guys more than 300
people send me emails which I kind of
feel bad now because I kind of chose the
same day I should have left this till
next week and I woulda gave chance for
everybody else to you know have a bigger
chance of being picked but I kind of
just picked the same day you know how do
i do without planning it but at the
same time we still got a pretty cool
group you know we got Matt in here yeah
man man this is definitely a cool kid
young kid doing his thing and you know I
always seem him here in the live chat
and I'm really glad that you know he's
one of the ones that I got picked
because now I get to meet men and I get
to chill with him and help him out
whatever he might need over this month
yeah so right now it's going pretty good
a couple of people having a meal back
like that's why I was like let me know
if they working on it or not but I'm
gonna say three of them hit me up that
they already started you know I'll help
one of them are with the navigation I
help another one out with how to make
the page the image full screen and yeah
I mean hopefully you know our next
Thursday they have everything all the
pages done and even if they don't finish
all the pages it's fine it's definitely
fine because the whole point is not for
them to just you know rush through this
thing and be like oh I just want to
build a page right away I'm just gonna
go on google and copy and paste a whole
bunch of and I understand the
concepts all right I kind of wish I had
the time to just sit down with dumb you
don't want someone and be like hey man
that's what you got to do here that's
what you got to do there there's the
reason why like I can't do that my my
whole point of this experiment is me to
motivate them and give them projects
that's gonna help them
get to the next level it's like Beth
Beth she she's pretty much brand new in
this like you know everybody else has
had some type of experience and baphu
but never definitely branding developer
like you know she hasn't been able to
get her feet wet and Industry she just
or even started quoting it she just she
wants to do it but she hasn't she hasn't
started yet you know what i mean so
that's where we at right now and i'm
gonna help out I'm gonna tell her
exactly where to go to learn just the
basics of HTML CSS and it just get
started you know what i mean so that's
where i'm at that's what I'm doing today
hopefully hopefully you know I could
help them out get to the next level if
if they're completely beginners I want
them to just be able to create a page if
they already know how to create a page I
wanted to be comfortable so be able to
create any design that somebody can
throw at them with HTML CSS after they
get that then I want to be able to say
hey guys I want you guys to create this
on on JavaScript bar or jQuery whatever
is going to be easier for them you know
and then at the end of the project you
know the the end of the fourth week is
going to be more about less you know
let's see if they could put everything
together everything that I showed them
throughout the month you know let's see
who who who makes it out of this you
know like I don't know hopefully nobody
quits hopefully nobody disappears
hopefully everybody's here next week at
eight o'clock hopefully they don't
forget because then that's gonna suck
for you know the other 300 people who
who applied and didn't get picked you
know so hopefully they take this
serious and yeah man like come on like I
wish I had somebody to mentor me when I
was just a brand new
a brand I just started you know like
somebody is gonna be there and whenever
I have a question I could just ask a man
he's gonna help me out so yeah man let
me see let me see what's in here yeah so
that's what I'm trying to do right now
man you know what really sucks though is
like now realize and realizing like you
know all this this past month right this
past month most of my videos have been
helping people out or motivating people
out but because I haven't made videos of
like you know keyword you know keyword
driven videos or like that you know
cuz I've been trying to just help people
I've been trying to help the people that
is already on my channel my channel
hasn't been growing how it was before
you know so it is kind of hurting it but
I think this is going to be cool because
I'm gonna reference everybody who asks
me questions or or ask me anything i'm
gonna be like hey man go to my channel
there's a playlist call the programming
mentorship experiment and watch that you
know so whenever they have questions
because this next four weeks is going to
be me helping these guys out but anybody
could actually go to the playlist and
watch what's going on or get the files
and pretty much download them and coat
them themselves right and learn from me
learn from what I teach these guys and
they're from that you know what i mean
so but i definitely need to get back to
the things that make my channel popular
and you know get more views getting more
subscribers because i'm sorry guys but
you know like i can't be having the
weirdos winning out here you know what i
mean like like we definitely gotta gotta
do this thing right here like i gotta
get this channel to grow more because I
definitely need it's either you guys is
going to help me out by help me promote
this channel just
your friends or whenever you on Stack
Overflow promote this channel or
whenever you are on get ur promote this
channel for me like you know tell your
friends share it on Twitter share it on
Facebook if you guys don't do that for
me then my channel is not gonna grow at
all because I'm focusing more or helping
people my channel but then it's not
driving more people in more Outsiders in
because I'm doing a lot of videos that
are for people that already know what's
going on in my channel and I'm not
making enough videos that's bringing new
viewers meaning top programming
languages or the top programming
language to learn in 2017 what
programming language you should learn by
2018 like like that gets you the
views say like that is what people are
searching online and that's how they
discover your channel you know a lot of
people have been telling me hey I'm
getting um I'm coming from Christians
channel um who else Aaron betas channel
and like they tell me they hate I i
found your channel because of them right
and that's really that's really good
because you know they're helping me up
right now I'm helping people out here
which is kind of hurting my channel but
thank God that I got friends here on
YouTube who still mention me on their
videos here and there and like you know
remind people I hey if you haven't
subscribed to Joe make sure you
subscribe to him he's doing something
pretty cool go check him out so if it
wasn't because of them right now my
channel would definitely be dropping cuz
I'm seeing it this all I think a
twenty-seven percent drop compared to
last month so and that's not because I'm
not doing enough videos is because i'm
not doing keyword or driven type of
videos so that's the thing guys so I'm
definitely this whole month I know this
thing is gonna hurt my channel but it's
going to help me personally to help
other you know other people's and stuff
like that but in my channel is
definitely gonna drop I
because I'm gonna focus more on helping
these guys out and you guys is gonna see
this on youtube like a and that's an
experiment right but we cannot let this
channel drop guys we definitely need
this channel to get more viewers more
subscribers and more people to watch it
so I'm gonna need your help on this I'm
gonna do some dislike so how you
called a philanthropic where it's
like I'm helping people out for
free and I'm focusing more on them to
help them out so people that watch this
channel cool take this as an experience
from this experiment that I'm making but
I'm gonna need you guys to help me up I
want you guys to whenever you see a cool
video that I drop or something cool go
sharing I'm ready go share it or
was the imager go share it on I
don't know on get earth share on
facebook share you somewhere because if
not then my channel is not gonna be able
to grow for this month it's gonna hurt
it I know next month I could bring it
back up but it's like come on man look
out for me two guys come on you know
what I mean but yeah man I'm trying I'm
trying to definitely step it up this
year and this month is just gonna be
about helping this guy's man is six
people just like you guys that want to
get into this industry I'm gonna get
them up to a certain level there's no
way that I can teach them everything in
one month because programming doesn't
work like that when people come in and
be like hey guys you can become
a web developer in one month two months
three months four months five months man
that's I'll be honest with you
that's just that's just a lot
of keyword you know to to show
up on the viewers you know but
the reality of is that this thing
takes time and everybody is completely
different what might take me one week to
understand it might take somebody two
days what might take me a whole month to
understand the concept it might take a
person one week so that's just how it is
it's like it all depends what type of
background you have how much time you
put into it and that's just how it is my
soul with this guy's I'm just gonna get
them to the next level if they're here
I'm gonna get them here every week every
week I'm gonna get them one more level
up and then from there you know to be
able to be a real good developer then
after that that's gonna be on them do
they continue making projects every week
the same way how I gave them projects
you know if they do that they're gonna
be golden man they could learn a
web development and two three months if
they do it project-based every week is a
new project that's it
okay so let me look at the the chat it
says my boy man says Hey Joe do you
think it would be a good idea for at the
end of each other's project for our code
to be linked in the description again so
that others can check it out on how we
each of us did and any differences yeah
I think that'd be cool that would
definitely be cool I'm gonna try to get
everybody's code online I'm gonna put it
on all my gear up I'm gonna put on my
get up I'm gonna take the coach from
everybody's everybody's code at the end
of the weekend I'm gonna put into my
github is a coding face.com I get up so
its coding face DLT calm like c om and
there i already started i think it's
called mentor I don't know if it's
mentor mentorship I already started it
basically I'm gonna put it everybody's
code so you guys can actually see how
they're cold looks on the first week or
how much they got done on the first week
yeah man
you know this guy this I'm not even
gonna answer this kick getting
fake man you gotta be a retard
straight up this guy is completely
 retard he has to be just like
somewhere just like being just a retard
in just its fine don't even paint on
mine but yeah man and no I'm not begging
for views i could get views on my own
i'm literally if you look at my thing
literally before i started helping
everybody out here my channel is like
this skyrocketing this month has gone I
think it's like twenty percent down
because I've been making more videos
about people in this community already
you know I haven't been making
videos like hey here's the top
programming languages for 2017 like
three to four times how other channels
do it they make the same
 three or four times I don't repeat
my channels I you know I don't repeat my
videos so you know what I mean I'm just
saying like if you like the channel if
you like the community that's here and
you know that you're getting something
good out of it help it promote it helped
get in and getting it out there because
this month I can't really do it I can't
really go on my way and promote how I
usually do it it's gonna be more of like
you know the community is gonna help
each other out from that's it
yeah man g-g-g-gia
yeah man don't worry about it just keep
going i know i know it's hard man also
two guys there's something that i'm
gonna make a video about and it's just
going to be quick everybody thinks like
here in the US yes is one of the best
countries in the world but at the same
time there's a lot of portunities in
other countries don't think just because
you didn't get a visa to the United
States there's just because you didn't
get to get into the US doesn't mean that
you could live comfortably in other
countries right so if you're a developer
and you could work remote you're really
going you could work remote from
wherever you're from India Pakistan you
can work from China you could work from
Colombia you could work from Argentina
if you guys can make a decent amount of
money remotely trust me you're gonna
live way better than anybody here in the
US here in the US a lot of people work
you know check to check you know is
paycheck to paycheck in other countries
if you have something just just a good
amount of money you can live
comfortably you know what I mean or like
let's say you live in another country
let's say you live in a poor country and
you're like okay man I didn't get I
didn't get a visa to the US man Europe
is right there apply for jobs and apply
for jobs in Europe or apply for jobs in
Asia there's a lot of countries
in Asia that are getting a lot of money
this Japan there's Singapore
there's a you could go to China China's
 growing Rana like don't think
it's just the United States you could go
to other countries and do this it's not
just the US you know what i mean so
don't let nothing stop you don't think
just because you living in you know
whatever zimbabwe you live in
zimbabwe and you're like man I didn't
get a visa to the US now my life
is no
just go to another another embassy apply
for another visa and go to another
country or you could go to Spain you can
go to Italy voter Germany who go to
England you could go to there's a whole
bunch of countries out there man it's
not just the US and also but yeah man so
this video is just about that just to
let you guys give you a little update on
and what's going on with the mentorship
program on the experiment that I'm doing
and yeah it's not like how this 88 what
is his name getting fit he's like man
he's over here begging for views man I'm
not begging for use I get thousands of
views already I just think the the
subscriber count is going down because
I'm not making keyword in intensive
 videos which is what everybody
else does everybody's like if i can put
what development on this this and that
or they'll be like how to teach yourself
code in three days how to teach yourself
code in a week how to teach yourself
code in a month how to teach yourself
code in two months so they do the same
video constantly so whenever people
searching it shows up it's not because
I'm over here begging for music just I'm
not trying to repeat myself you
know because at the same time when I
subscribed to other youtubers and they
do that that pisses me off I'm
like man why the this guy always
gotta repeat himself it's like people
already know this let the you know
creating new content create new
like people that get to find my channel
they know I create something new they
know what I do every single day they
know what I come here and basically and
preach they know what I'm going on in
I mean I just don't wanna repeat
myself I don't want to be one of those
people you know I don't want to be a SEO
junkie like that's the truth like this
people are just like if I become an SEO
junkie you guys need to call me out on
it be like yo stop being a SEO
junkie like stop making the same videos
constantly you know call me out on it
you know when you start seeing me doing
that then you guys should black man's I
say this this channel we came you
know but for now i'm still dropping just
legit videos every video is different
every video i'm talking about something
completely different you know what i
mean so that's what I'm saying
Barbara come on you can't be slacking
you can still cold man you telling me
you can't take two minutes well five
minutes ten minutes you just sit down
and just coat it doesn't take that long
and I just like i like i like oh
with people you know I just out here
trying to help people out like
not saying I'm just tired today to be
honest with you guys I'm tired today and
i was like thinking you know what man i
feel like just taking a week off which I
don't want to do but I feel like I want
to take a week off and just like work on
this uh you know this people that i got
for this mentorship program because i
think they deserve to get help you know
what i mean but then at the same time as
like man this is gonna help it's gonna
hold back my my channel itself so it's
like I'm 50-50 on it it's like you know
do I make videos about the mentorship
program help them out or do I just be
like hey I just do my own thing and then
I'll see them on thursday and then help
them out just on Thursday you know so
it's like I don't know I'm in the air
right now so right now I'm definitely in
the air your boy Joey a I do this the
trick is to tell yourself to go for 15
minutes then once you get started suck
you in yeah it's true
that's what happens to me like I always
start on something new and next thing I
know I'm like man I've been doing this
 for like half an hour you know or
an hour you know so that's how it is
yeah yeah yeah
yeah I'm trying to do more tutorials man
I'm trying I'm trying trust me it's just
um I got a lot of going on you know
I got a lot of and I kind of put
something else on top of me with the
mentorship I might I might put the
podcast on hold and I might just start
bringing in like really good interviews
from people that are really legit out
here I might do that yeah so it I gotta
see I got a plan out I'm gonna do
like a 360 on on this channel this week
I'm definitely gonna do a 360 on the
channel I'm gonna try to stop cursing
but that for now I'm gonna try to
start here stop cursing right cuz this
is like the whole point of this channel
was to be talking to people the way how
to talk to my friends I do curse a lot
and I curse a lot with my friends when I
my work I'm not cursing like that but
yes you know I'm kind of 10 imma stop
cursing what else I'm gonna plan the
videos out more I might I might just
take videos make videos every 23 days so
take my time making a video I'm gonna
try that for this you know for this
month of just try to do more quality
than quantity alright and see what
happens I just want to do a little
experiment to which the channel see what
what what really happens you know see if
the the channel grows more because the
whole point is it's not like I'm all
over here like oh my god I need to have
a million subscribers I don't I don't
need a million subscribers because I
know my subscribers is there more active
than everybody else's subscribers like
 people got 50
and 100,000 subscribers and they only
get like maybe one percent of the views
like that'll make no sense when I drop a
video I automatically get at least you
know fifty to sixty five percent of the
views to watch my videos so that means
my viewers are actually more more low
you and more focused and which is
another thing that's funny which I know
for sure is these people are making less
money than me and got more viewers more
subscribers than me which don't make
 sense because it's like what the
hell are they doing with if you have
80,000 100,000 subscribers what the
are you doing that somehow my channel
which is has only four thousand
generates more money than yours there's
something that you're doing wrong you
know what I me and that's what I ask
myself I'm like man so I am doing
something right which is I got more
quality subscribers I got more quality
subscribes more active people that
always come back and I see their faces
all the time so in that sense is good at
the same time our kind of would like to
be back to where I was at last month
where you will search web developer as
soon as you search web developer my
video shows up in the number one or
number two spot all right or whatever is
being at the top it's always good to be
on the top is always good and but the
only thing that it does make me feel
good is that I know I make more money
than these people like that's the only
said that that makes me feel good I'm
not okay i'll make a video every single
day my subscriber count is not growing
because i'm focusing more on the
subscribers that i do have and they're
more lower than everybody else for
whatever reason i get better ads than
the ones that have a hundred thousand
subscribers and I make more money than
them um people do support the channel um
so I'm actually doing better than them
money-wise but then viewer wise is like
man I need to step it up and
just get my subscriber count up
cuz I should be your right now I should
be if i were to kept doing what I was
doing in the beginning there was a lot
of keyword um a lot of keyword intensive
 videos my would have been
 like 10,000 15,000 subscribers
right now which is what a lot of the
other competition which I hate that word
competition with the others all
youtubers are actually doing this they
dropping a lot of videos with a
lot of keywords and that's it you know
so it's like do I take the money as a as
a way to say hey man you're making money
you're making more money than done that
should make you happy or having more
people watch me make me happy so it's
like I don't know that's why I'm in the
area you know what I mean because it's
like I know if I if I start getting a
whole bunch of subscribers a lot of
subscribers is not going to be genuine
it's not going to be people that are
quality subscribers people that is going
to be here on the comments all the time
people that's gonna be here joining
coding face calm people that's gonna be
you know helping each other out because
I see you in the comments every time I
look at the comments oh I see ya on the
chat there's people helping each other
out which is exactly what I
build this website for a I build this
channel for because I wanted people to
help each other out but at the same time
I'm like mad I kind of want to get that
million subscribers I kind of want to
get that little hundred thousand
subscriber so it's like what do i do
don't say hey the money and the low you
subscribe is better or
popularity and the subscribers
are better I don't know goddamn YouTube
anyone play league of legends man you
know what I play I played on how you
call this game Paragon whoever wants to
play me on Paragon let me know add me i
am tracks a and tra cks on PSN uh-huh go
ahead and add me man yeah Lisa that's
the thing do they know they and their
viewers most likely they don't I know
everybody that's in here everybody
that's here I know who they are I see
them all the time yeah I could
definitely keep it 100% without cursing
so yeah that's what I'm gonna try to do
it I'm gonna try to do i'm gonna try to
knock curse I'm gonna plan out videos
more and but you guys going to have to
understand videos is going to take a
little bit longer how they used to take
in the beginning where I used to edit
videos I used to bring out my good
camera out I used to set up the right
room the right lighting so that's what's
gonna happen again I'm gonna make one
video like that every 23 days so me
coming in here dropping a quick video I
think that's got to stop for a little
while just so I can I could figure out
is the the channel better off like that
or how I'm doing it now like this you
know what I mean we try to we try to
take this to the next level
let's pop encoding phase what up what up
j-rock
yeah I know that's what I'm saying like
nobody here that's one thing where
people gotta appreciate that that's
why I say okay guys just help me out and
help promote the channel like if you go
to ready and you see like a
somebody talking about our web
development just when I hey man just
check out this channel this guy's pretty
cool just promote it like that or if
you're on Twitter be like hey man I just
finished watching want a Jones video and
then you put the link or if you are on
facebook and be like hey man just watch
on Joe's video about this this and that
and just share the video that's just
gonna help out because you know ain't
nobody here doing for free those
 people go tell or whatever
 shetty programmer or go tell
somebody else go tell them hey could you
mentor me for free those guys is gonna
be like now I need 500 500 just so
 tight like that's how they do it
man you know so it's like I'm doing
for free I just want I want to help out
other people out you know so just help
me out by promoting the channel and be
like hey you know I used to work for
Japanese company but left in 2014 when I
moved to South Korea now we're against
