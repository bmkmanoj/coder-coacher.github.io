again coding face.com your boy is
backing out and did it again so today we
got some new news coming from Google ok
so they basically introducing to you
guys now this new app domain so
basically it's a more secure home for
apps on the web so this is cool for us
as developers because now we could have
a DAP meaning hey if you created a
social network hey you're creating a
dating site hey you created a you know a
game or whatever right
like literally now you can buy a dot app
and what's cool is that not everybody
has this domains so if you guys have an
idea of like a game you want to build
the application you want to build and
you say hey man I want to get the domain
guys go get it now because I'm pretty
sure soon it's gonna be taking so let's
say even the coding phase that app I'm
pretty sure is available for now right
so I'm gonna buy it
but you guys should definitely look into
this because it's pretty cool I like the
idea of a domain for a app specifically
because we're so used to the word app
and application and yes general public
already knows about the word app soon as
they hear the word app they know okay
I'm gonna come in I'm gonna see either
an application or it's gonna be a
landing page for an application for my
phone so it makes sense all right now
what's cool about this is that Google
decided to make this that app domain
mandatory to have HTTPS now the reason
why this is happening is because Google
is trying to push this agenda to make
sure that all the websites on the net is
actually more secure okay now does this
help completely
like your life as far as like hey my
passwords is gonna be secure the people
are not gonna have to do be able to do
sequel injection people are not gonna be
able to do this this and that
no it doesn't help with that what it
does is let's say you are in a Starbucks
and we're all using the same Wi-Fi
somebody can literally go and connect to
the Wi-Fi and then get all of the
information of everybody meaning
everybody that's connected to that Wi-Fi
and they go into a website that's not
secured they could get your credit card
number your you know whatever you put
into forms all your information they can
get it if the website is not secure all
right now one thing that I always tell
people is whenever you're gonna put in
your credit card or your information you
want to make sure that I'm gonna show
you right now just like encoding
face.com when you come in you'll see
that this little thing right here up
here it says secure that means they're
using HTTPS which has a certificate
which is valid and and pretty much is
like okay it just lets people know that
if you put in your credit card number
nobody can really take this if they are
on a Wi-Fi connection okay and like I
said for me the most important thing
about this is the fact that basically
we're gonna have a tap that app I don't
know why I've been wanting this for a
long time I was wondering like why don't
they have it that app like that I Oh
seems more like the technical domain for
me like if I wanted to go to a website
where they will talk to me about a
framework right I will expect it to be
in a dial but if I want to go to a
social network or I want to go to a game
um a website for a game right basically
I would expect that to being a dot app
so this is pretty cool guys go check it
out
really go to get that app and you will
see if your domain is available you
could come here and say hey let's say
singles that app probably somebody took
it
oh sure somebody is not a taking that's
hot
alright guys anyways man I'll see you
guys later
this your boy Joe back at it again
coding phase dot-com this video is
brought to you by coding phase common
all of its members make sure you go
visit a website is the only place where
you're gonna learn how to become a web
developer with real projects take it
from me you're going joke back at it
again cone freeze calm keep it real keep
it trill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
