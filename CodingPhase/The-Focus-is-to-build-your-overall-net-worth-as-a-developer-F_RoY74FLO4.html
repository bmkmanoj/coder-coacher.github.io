again man coding face.com out here in
the Rocky Mountains of damp out chilly
you dig listen one thing that I saw
today on the comments that's pretty cool
because it feels like people understand
what I'm trying to do here it's not
really about saying hey I have this
income as a developer it's not really
important to say hey I'm making $100,000
who cares about that right
who cares about if you work for a
company how can we make you into
entrepreneurs I can't I'll make you guys
it's people who are independent people
who are basically if tomorrow you don't
have a job he's still making the same
amount of money as you were before you
even get hired you get what I'm saying
like you you have to be independent out
here man
you see a lot of people ask me Joe how
did you do this like you know you don't
even have 10,000 subscribers before I
didn't have 10,000 subscribers and I
basically want a full-time youtuber in
creating content for you guys how does
somebody do it right it's by setting
themselves up for success right when I
came in here I said you know what I love
doing this I love creating content for
you guys I'm gonna come in here and I'm
gonna you know work hard you know work
harder and give you guys good content
but at the same time I needed to set
myself up right I worked you know for
the company you know save my money just
in case that money I still haven't
touched that money alright but every
single day I make money online you know
in different ways I have you know my
website where I teach you guys how to
code teach you guys how to basically
become an
developers not just developers that's
gonna get higher II like yeah you could
get hired anybody could get hired you
know like once you know how to code once
you know HTML CSS JavaScript and you
understand the backend doesn't matter
which language it is it could be PHP
Python Ruby or else it really doesn't
matter which one but once you understand
the whole concept of it yeah you could
find a job but how can I make sure that
you guys become successful right I
myself I'm not a millionaire I'm not
somebody who I could say hey man I have
you know half a million dollars in my
bank account
but I'm halfway there you're gonna say
and I'm just so regular do all right now
how how can I teach you guys the same
ways that and the same things that I did
you know it's like that's what I'm
focused on you know so I really
appreciate the fact that a lot of people
here understand what I'm trying to do
it's not just about learning to code is
learning how to basically use those
skills to work for you you know not you
working for a company and just say hey I
work for this company I give all my
talent to them and they make all the
money how can you make money to you get
what I'm saying that's what I'm all
about
well yeah man I hope you guys really
enjoyed concert that I'm giving you guys
out here
I hope you really enjoy this new series
that's coming up man this new series is
all about how to make just side income
right you know at first you might see it
hey it's only $800 a month not her $2.00
a month but you got to think about it if
you scale it if you start putting money
into promoting it you could get it to be
three thousand four thousand dollars
right and then what if you have four or
five different applications like that on
the internet making you four five
thousand dollars per month then now
you're completely independent now you're
completely creating you know your own
money like you using your skills to work
for you instead of you putting your
skills to work for somebody else
you're insane
I think is really good too to work for a
company because you get to learn so much
especially when you in a team when you
work in a team it is really good because
there's things that other people know
that you don't know and basically it
expedites you're learning right makes
you're learning way faster then you
learning on your own basically you're
gonna come in and you're gonna learn on
the job but you're still working for
somebody else and there's nothing wrong
with working for somebody else it's just
you know drives me to keep on learning
how to code learning how to create new
stuff because I'm like I know where it
could lead to you know we seen people do
it before we seen Mark Zuckerberg create
just out of some BS PHP app you know
Facebook right what is Facebook right
it's an application you know when you
think about it he just built that on his
own you know before he had the big teams
we've before he had the big money behind
him it's just him by himself we can all
do that right it's all about having the
skills that having the creativity we all
have ideas that we say man this thing
could work but how do you build it you
know that's what's important that's what
I'm here to tell you guys how to build
the stuff so I'm really glad that people
understand what I'm trying to do here
it's not this website and this channel
is not just about hey guys learning to
code hey guys here's how to get a job
like yeah you're gonna get a job
I guarantee after you basically come in
and you take the courses that I have
you're gonna get a job no matter what
you're getting a job now at the same
time you're also gonna learn how to make
money on your own right you know making
money on your own it's like something
like you know what was that old saying
when people used to be like man give a
man a fish you feed him for the day give
a man oh you know teach a man how to
fish you know it's a lifetime thing you
got it on sale like for you guys to come
in here and
earn everything and then at the same
time know how to apply your skills to a
really cool stuff that can make you
money that's what it's all about right
like this certain things that I learned
over the years that I had to do research
I had to follow other mentors you know I
keep bringing up levels die cuz I really
enjoy the fact that he's just completely
independent he could go anywhere in the
world and still make a minimum of fifty
thousand dollars minimum fifty thousand
dollars per month well I'm not talking
two per year talking about per month
right or his own like who does that you
got on sailing there's people out here
working every single day and a job and
their whole life is just that how about
we we start becoming entrepreneurs and
and building new things you gotta
understand that's what I'm all about
right I'm all about making money man
like it or not you know you know nothing
like the whole world's about money but
at the same time it just gives you a
certain freedom and I feel like we could
all have that you know cuz not
everybody's gonna come here find this
channel right now everybody's gonna
really put in the time not everybody's
gonna do the work but you gotta
understand you know we got what eleven
thousand people about to be twelve
thousand people on this channel out of
those who has really you know went to
the website subscribed
probably I think about like two thousand
people right even for the free courses
not everybody that's here really takes
advantage right so what does that tell
you right that only like maybe ten
percent other people ten twenty percent
of people really go hard and then out of
those people that go hard
half of them you got to think about it
maybe a dowsing or maybe five hundred of
them are really gonna continue with this
cuz after a month and a half they get
stuck enough you know NPM server or oh
they get stuck going on you know doing
our npm install and they can't get it
through and they're like oh man I can't
install the gulp I can't install the the
server if you gave up from that part you
lost already you get what I'm saying
like
you don't understand programming is
about debugging programming is about
dealing with errors programming is about
dealing with issues problems if you get
stuck in the beginning you give up you
lost already you know so that's all I'm
saying for you guys all of you guys that
are really sticking by and staying right
here with me trust me it's gonna pay off
and everything that I'm teaching you
guys is because I already been through
it I'm not coming here to give you guys
vs you guys know me by now I'm just
giving you the things that work and the
things that I know that anybody can do
right
so you already know Superboy job back at
it again coding phase comm go check out
