tips for new developers focus on your
portfolio you know once you know the
basics of HTML CSS start building your
portfolio okay and then from there start
building pages that look like for real
business ok stop doing little you know
little projects like on tutorials from
YouTube and thinking that goes on and
your portfolio you know something like
the 69 video that I did that could go in
your portfolio because that's a music
website that's a website that you could
have given to an artist you could give
in to a client right but when I say
something like let's say oh creating I
don't know like on a freakin JavaScript
watch or filtering through through
images or like a search result type
thing that connects to our API and all
you do is just show them like oh here's
the top contacts or whatever I've seen
something like it so really dumb
projects online on YouTube and people
put that on their portfolio like now man
your portfolio is literally your resume
okay when you are a developer that has
never worked at a company you want to
basically show them like hey I mean I'm
in the game like I'm not some guy that's
trying to be a developer I'm a developer
you got a saying and also stop looking
for junior positions right if it comes
your way and you see it apply for it but
don't be like oh man the only jobs that
I could get is for junior positions like
nah man you need to apply to all every
single job out there because even though
it's a senior you'll be surprised at the
things that they want a senior developer
to do like things that you could have
done yourself you get what I'm saying so
it's like you never know what that
company really needs until you send them
your your project your portfolio you
something your resume and they're from
there let them decide if you're good
enough you get what I'm saying like I
applied for everybody every single
company out there I apply to every
single one right let them decide if
you're good enough for them don't let
yourself stop you from getting that job
you get what I'm saying so yeah ok ok
good ok ok ok
I'm lucky appeal moving Center lovasco
says how much are your courses if you
buy a course separately most likely
you'll be like $15 if you use the link
from my description which saves you 50
percent right if you buy our individual
course but if you just sign up for the
monthly plan you literally get it for
$10 so you pretty much have access to
all of my courses for $10 okay you can't
go wrong all right everything that I put
in there is real stuff that you would be
doing at a real job you know it's not
like me coming in and putting easy stuff
to be like oh yeah you're ready now it's
like we're building full applications
stuff that pretty much is like you're
gonna be doing at your job so you never
want to go to a job and you don't know
what the hell you're doing you want to
be able to say hey anything that they
throw at you you already done it on my
website so
you gotta be ready trust me I wish I had
a place like my website when I started
that's being 100% honest with you guys
because when I started with the places
that was here team treehouse Cole school
calm and if you ever gone to those
websites all they teach you is the
basics then how really teaching you how
to build websites they're not teaching
you like complex things like they teach
you that same thing that's in the
documentation here so if Lou
he's a if statement he is a for-loop
he's a freaking for each loop like
here's a everything else and here's a
freaking a switch statement like they
teach you the same doesn't the
documentation like you could literally
go to a frico camp solo learn and look
at the documentation because that's what
they have right what you need is to
build real projects that are at the same
level as any job that's out there you
don't need somebody to teach you the
basics like the basics you constantly
relearn it I mean haven't you ever taken
like a course online and then every
single course reteach you the same
over and over and over again like they
do that all the time okay do you think
it's necessary to do a boot camp if you
fail you what if you fail you if you
fill your portfolio do you think is
necessary to do a boot camp if you fail
your portfolio I don't know that
question doesn't really make the most
sense to me but I'm gonna answer it
there's what I think that you're trying
to ask so you go to a boot camp even if
you can do your own portfolio and do
your own projects on your own no I don't
think you should go to a boot camp boot
camp is for somebody who let's say like
this somebody who who believes that they
can't do it on their own
and that's not - this any of the people
are here that have gone to a boot camp
but the reality that's that's what it
comes down to right it really comes down
to the fact that you go to a boot camp
if you feel like you can't do it by
yourself right if you need somebody to
hold your hand if you need somebody to
be there in a room with you then you go
to a boot camp if now if you know that
you want this and you sure that you're
gonna do your work it's like the same
thing at school like if you go to school
you can go to school in and you know F
around mess around but if you really
want it you know you could be successful
if you go to college or whatever alright
if not if you play around and you over
here after girls and you know your
friend tells you man there's a hockey
party on on Friday let's go let's leave
school early let's do this and that then
yeah of course you know I'm doing
with your life it's the same thing so
what a boot camp man I wouldn't tell you
to go there man at all because if like
if you can actually learn on your own
and save yourself fourteen thousand
dollars twenty thousand dollars trust me
you don't want to start this Korean
negative right because you got to think
about it like this sometimes even I
think General Assembly tells you oh you
don't have to pay until you know until
the end of the year or like they'll be
like oh you only have to pay twenty
percent of of whatever you earned right
so what they do is they say okay your
salary is a hundred thousand a hundred
thousand dollars right now they tell you
well you always twenty thousand dollars
because your first job was a hundred
thousand dollar job right they don't
take into account that after taxes and
reality you only earned about seventy
thousand dollars alright so now you old
twenty thousand right they don't care
about hey this is after taxes then okay
hey I didn't really make a hundred
thousand dollars this year you know
after taxes they're like nah man you
always twenty thousand dollars that's
how much you always you gotta say so
it's up to you man I think is really
good for those peoples are switching
careers like let's say you was on
somebody who was working in marketing
and you work already in companies or
anything you already you already
established you're not like somebody
that's coming in
out of nowhere like if your Joe smooth
the mechanic then going to a bootcamp
it's not gonna help you it's gonna be a
waste of time for you if you are low
Cindy the marketing girl who works at
coca-cola and now decides to be hey I
want to become a developer and a half
you know 50 grand in my you know my bank
account that I saved over the years and
now I want to do a switch a bootcamp
might be good you know what I mean
because you actually switching careers
but you have that money on you plus you
already have that backing off like hey
you already worked in a major companies
you got what I'm saying but if you're
Joe the mechanic and you know know
Johnny from footlocker like going to a
boot camp is you start a negative kick
like you should never start anything
negative you know you never heard of
that idea you know that advice with that
people tell you all the time like you
shouldn't open up a business if you have
to open up the business on a loan like
automatically you already lost you gonna
say like if you start on your business
and you're starting your business on a
loan like somebody's already loaning you
money it's like man you already started
off on the wrong foot so it's the same
thing as a book cat you getting into
this career negatively where you know -
and your bank account it's never good
plus a lot of you guys already have
student loans like there's the craziest
thing I've seen some something like
interview where this guy is like oh yeah
I went to uh I don't know what school
was it it was like one of those I relief
schools right and he was doing computer
science for whatever reason this dude
felt like he needed to go to a boot camp
and I'm thinking in my head I'm like bro
like you already went to Ivy League
school like what are you doing like you
know what I mean the dude went to uh
after you know going to this Ivy League
school getting a bachelor's of computer
science he decides to go to a boot camp
like to me that sounds crazy that to me
that sounds like
like somebody who's not ready for the
world you gotta say like somebody who's
like they do everything they can to not
go to work there's people like that you
gotta say like this they they latch on
to that's the idea of like you know
coming in and and just like literally
coming in and just literally just like
staying in school forever like some
people they don't want to grow up you
gotta say and sometimes it's just
insecurities yeah a lot of people don't
want to go to work that's the the truth
yeah and you know some people are more
privileged than others and hold on to
that shame like god I know people who
have changed careers like three four
times they've gone like three different
bachelors like who does that you know
somebody who's like papi and mami you
know what I'm saying like if you have to
pay your your bills you gotta pay your
your and you gotta take care of
your life you like you know how here
trying to get three bachelor's degree
like now you're trying to get one
bachelor's and move on from there and
that's I start working but some people's
like that man oh yeah man so any other
questions let's see yes ten bucks a
month
the links is in this description it's in
the description right there I got about
I think like 30 courses in there now you
can take if you really calculate how
much each course cost and I actually
sell my courses like super cheap
compared to other people people sell the
courses like a hundred dollars fifty
dollars
there's people out there for one course
are charging $500
you know I basically I settle for dirt
cheap because in reality to me I'd
rather have thousands and thousands of
people take my courses than just me
coming in and be like all cool
I made my money or five people because
those five people paid $1,000 each I'd
rather have 3,000 members of my website
paying $10 each instead of me coming in
and saying oh only 10 people learn for
me you know those are the privileged
ones that could pay you $1,000 those are
the room
the real MVPs like I'm not like that man
if you know me I'm a family man I'm just
a regular do everything that I do is
literally to help other people and at
the same time leave a little sign for
myself right I'm not out here trying to
do it big like OD like oh I'm trying to
get mad money like nah man listen all I
care about is to maintain the same
lifestyle that I've always lived since I
became a developer right anything above
that it's a plus that I'm not looking
for you're gonna say so I come in here
and just definitely help you guys out
okay imma see tips on building an
e-commerce site how far should I go with
it when it comes to back in only adding
the ability for some so onto a product
to a cart no I mean if you building an
e-commerce site what you should do is
number one you have to be able to add
products right be able to add products
what a admin section so first of all you
gotta have user authentication user
authentication for the users they're
coming in I'm gonna buy products and for
the administrators okay it has to have
roles okay after that then from there um
you gotta create a cart system you gotta
create a session based cart system I
don't know if you understand what that
means that means you know how you go to
websites where you could add things to
your cart and you haven't even you
haven't even signed up to the website
yet that means you're they keeping track
of you through your session and then
once you sign up then they merge your
sessions ID a session ID with your user
ID and then now you're basically
getting that same cart but you like you
actually got a bill all of that one of
the main reasons why I haven't built an
ecommerce website because look right now
is bring almost like three weeks I've
been working on a social media site and
the social media site literally has been
on hold because I had to take my
computer to go get fixed the screen of
it is getting replaced I'm picking it up
tomorrow so we're back doing the social
media website but yeah so I had to put
that on hold and literally that project
is so big and that's just social media
that's just having followers that's just
having you know direct messaging you
know putting post uploading photos like
those are the things that's not even I
haven't even done the admin section like
that's three weeks in okay now when
you're building on e-commerce the main
reason why I haven't built up ecommerce
yet and on my website and I keep saying
I'm up doing imma do it but in reality
I'm dragging my feet because building an
e-commerce website from scratch it's a
lot of work right meaning is gonna take
another month to do so that's like one
of those courses that it just takes
forever so for you guys who are building
it on your own what I'm telling you
right now ecommerce website is a project
that you gotta do like it's gonna take
your whole month to do this is not
something that you're gonna do it like
oh I'll do this in the weekend now
you're not gonna be able to do it in a
weekend there's so many different
features that our ecommerce website has
that it's pretty big right so that's why
I always tell you guys build an
e-commerce website cuz once you build
that like you're set you're set for life
you're gonna be able to build any type
of website that anybody throws at you
right that's a website that has a lot of
features and it's gonna use every single
freaking little memory that you have or
every type of knowledge that you have of
what what development is you're gonna
say like it's a lot of work so
definitely you're gonna have to build a
lot of things man it from the car too
during the payment gateway if you're
using a company like let's say damn I
forgot was the neighbor at this company
you could do something like PayPal so
keep it simple if you want to keep it
simple to stripe and PayPal just to show
the person whoever it's watching or like
what was going through your code they
could say okay there you stripe right
but sometimes you gotta connect it to a
bank connecting it to a bank like let's
say Chase payment center like it's it
takes forever right like that's a
process that could take you like even
two weeks just to get approved by the
bank so it's like it's a lot of features
it's like you gotta write down every
single one and go one by one one by one
one by one one by one and then not only
that that remember you gotta build the
front end so not only are you building
the the backend logic that it's the
website but you also build an every
single page meaning the home page the
page of all the products the page of the
single product the page of that the cart
the page the page of the payment the
page of the admin section the arming
pages will what I call the admin layouts
and then inside of the Amman layouts
then you have to do a products page to
add products there and then from there
you have to create the edit page to edit
the products and different it's a lot of
shame man you know sometimes people
think like arm being a developer is easy
you could do this in one month like now
you know the basics you're not a
developer until you build something like
an e-commerce like it takes a lot of
work you know you can't just go to
freako camping but like hey guys show me
how to do for loops like that's not
that's not becoming a developer you know
how to code you know how to program you
know the basics of programming but you
don't know how to do web development you
know and sometimes even on you know guys
who graduate from school where a
computer science degree they think like
oh man I got this it's like most of them
they don't even know what the hell
they're doing with what development
because there's so many different things
and then on top of that
say god forbid you decide to do
something like you know using react a
front-end framework right so now not
only do you have to worry about the
backend you also you also have to do the
front-end right and you got to deal with
issues were free Act you're gonna bump
into a bunch of bugs are you gonna do
react routing you know or you're gonna
use the react router or you're gonna use
the the backend servers router you don't
say like there's so many different
options and different things that you
can choose from and which way to do this
thing like it's a lot of work now one
thing that I do advise you to do is use
a framework don't try to go in there and
try to build from scratch meaning
try to build a user authentication from
scratch trying to do all your sequel
statements from scratch you're gonna be
there forever like websites like an
e-commerce website takes a long time so
what you want to do is build a website
with a frame were like laravel nodejs
with Adonis's
or you want to do it where something
like Ruby on Rails and now if you're a
Python guy then use Django but you can't
just be out here trying to do all that
 from scratch because major web
sites there's a thing that people don't
don't take into account to major
websites get done with a team right when
you're doing everything yourself it's a
lot of work it's like one feature could
take you one week you know what I'm
saying like you're not even not even
doing the whole website just one feature
alone is it could take your whole week
it's not I'm missing you breathing Kevin
M you got a question if the clients
still willing to pay at the same price
well you use WordPress theme instead of
building from scratch or do you take
pride in doing it from scratch HTML CSS
JavaScript listen if the client it
depends what you're doing
if the let's say for example a client
comes to me and tells me hey man I want
a simple website you know I need this
done as soon as possible
and you say okay we need a designer
right you need to approve the design
they're like listen I don't have time
for that so then you say okay you don't
have time for it so then maybe we could
use a theme so then you show them a
couple of themes that they might be
interesting and then see which one they
like then from there you see does it
have all the features that you need okay
most of the themes have a lot of
features so you got to make sure you
read and make sure you try them out then
from there you tell them okay we're
gonna do it with WordPress and then from
there you just get your project done
whatever it is that the client wants
right when you build things from scratch
that costs money
you gotta say like almost nobody wants
wants you to build any different scratch
right when you dealing with Frese
freelance and inclines that you find
online or Craigslist Elance or oDesk
whatever like fiber you know people
don't want you to build from
scratch because you're putting in a lot
of hours you know when we come in here
we talk oh we want to you know some
people be like oh they look down on
developers who use WordPress and it's
like broke you don't even know what the
hell you're talking about you get the
same because they don't understand that
if a client needs something quick
instead of paying something like wicks
or Shopify or whatever they're paying
you as a developer to build something
for them that's a little bit more
customizable customizable then building
it from scratch right so you're making
your money and you're good you're gonna
say like instead of them having to pay
something I Shopify or or the freaking
what's the other
Squarespace or whatever at least you're
making your money you don't know saying
so don't pay no mind to what other
people think
so yeah man let me see what else but
yeah so definitely do not you know we
all take pride into into building stuff
from scratch but it's just like I said
the other day man do you think of what
development of programming as a religion
or do you think like hey this is a
career this is a way to feed my family
there's a way to make money you know if
you start thinking about it like this is
a religion it's like oh man I want to
build everything from scratch nah man
you should build everything from scratch
once once you do it once that's it you
should never build it again unless you
get them paid a lot of money you got on
saying like you should only build the
e-commerce website once once you do it
that one time you should reuse that code
for every other client that you bump
into you never rebuilt you never build
that from scratch again you know
you only you do it once so you can
understand how things are done and you
can understand why you're doing certain
things all right but if you know damn
well like you could use something
another platform that's gonna save your
time then you're gonna use the other
platform you know saying so if you you
want to be part of the religion of
programmers or you want to get that back
so let me see
yes goes goblin definitely I would say
go and build a ecommerce website from
scratch man build it from scratch and
you're gonna build you're gonna learn
everything that you're gonna need like
once you build the whole website you're
gonna be like I'm a damn good developer
that's say like you're you earn your
stripes like most people don't even
build this from scratch I'm telling
you right now I sing a lot of developers
will be like man I could create the
fastest sorting bubble you're gonna
say I got the fastest that
could go through an algorithm and you
know spit out freaking ABCs for you like
nobody cares about that right what they
care about is can you do the job you
know so if you build an e-commerce
website from the ground up you're gonna
be set because any type of website that
a client is gonna throw at you either
using you know my sequel migrations or
even if you decide to use MongoDB like
you're gonna learn the database really
well you're gonna learn how to work with
your your programming language whatever
programming language you chose to build
a project like you're gonna learn it
really really well so definitely go
ahead and build it Joe can you explain
the web starter kit what's in it and how
do you make one hi Jose Montero
literally there's a course on my website
where I go into the whole thing about
the web developer starter kit and we
literally build it from scratch so my
advice will be go to the website and
check out the gold course right we use
gulp and we build our own what developer
starter kit from scratch so go ahead go
check that out man
so let me see what else sorry guys you
know I'm just I'm trying to answer
everybody's questions so I'm going one
by one from top to bottom is their
framework like Larimer for no J yes yes
I'm I'm agreeing with you Express seems
very limited it is Express is just
pretty much like the basics of of like a
framework and then everything else you
gotta build it from scratch if you over
here trying to build a complex
application
you shouldn't have to rebuild the whole
website from scratch you shouldn't have
to freaking reinvent the wheel so you
need something like no GS like Adonis
yes sorry a dynasty yes which is the
framework that it takes a lot of ideas
from Maribelle and take some about our
ideas from Ruby on Rails and it's very
modern like all the things that's in
there like you could use try and catch
you could use um async functions like
it's very modern it's not like an old
old framework like it's literally like
up-to-date with what's going on with
JavaScript so it's legit okay ecommerce
is heavier actually work for an
e-commerce we you only have one
developer and it's a lot yes it's
definitely a lot man I would say use
ghost goblin if you want to use a
database I would say use my sequel some
people might say hey I want to use
MongoDB because it's gonna be easier yes
it's gonna be easier but that's not what
you're gonna find in real jobs right
there's gonna be some places where
they're gonna use MongoDB but the
majority of the companies are going to
be using my sequel or sequel server or
some type of sequel language you know
non language database like Postgres or
Mario DB like this there's gotta be
something out there that they can ever
use its own type of sequel but like I
said
you should definitely learn it with my
sequel so you could be ready like you're
not fooling anybody you know if you
wants to choose MongoDB like you're not
fooling anybody like MongoDB is almost
like JSON and JavaScript objects that's
easy of course it's gonna be easy right
it's gonna be easier to build but you're
not challenging yourself you're not
building something that is gonna impress
anybody
you know MongoDB is not when I see
MongoDB like I see people come in and
they build a website like a very simple
website and then I oh they build a
little application with no Jes Express
in MongoDB like I'm not impressed
like literally anybody that knows a
little bit of JavaScript can build no
Jes with experience in MongoDB website
like you're not impressing nobody with
that right but it was gonna be
impressive is when you build something
with my sequel because it's like a do
you understand how database works do you
understand how relationships work right
there's no way that you can use MongoDB
and in certain types of applications
when you don't even know the difference
between MongoDB and my sequel like why
would you use my sequel over MongoDB or
why would you use MongoDB over my sequel
you gotta say so you definitely should
do it with my sequel as far as like your
ecommerce plus that's actually the
standard like it's rare to see any
MongoDB you know any website so that's
our e-commerce with MongoDB like almost
every company I've seen literally not
even almost every every company I've
been to that is the e-commerce they use
my sequel or sequel server so you gotta
say see what else
shoot freelancers do the hosting for the
clients if you're smart yes that's how
you make your money right as far as like
hosting you should have like a shared
hosting
like a VPS have like a VPS and then put
all your clients in there but it depends
on the client so for example let's say
your client comes in and they have a
website that's gonna be very heavy with
the traffic okay so you don't want to
put that in into a VPS that's gonna
slow down everybody else's website right
what you want to do is you want to have
a dedicated service just for that
website right so if a dedicated server
costs $100 you know full power maximum
RAM etc right or something like Linode
or something like that right what you do
is you paid $100 right
but you charge the client $150 $160 they
don't need to know how much you're
paying all right that's your your
freaking job to do it you get what I'm
saying now some companies are smart some
companies they know about this already
they're like okay we're not gonna pay
you we're gonna pay I want you know AWS
or whatever we're gonna do it directly
if they want to do that okay
whoop-dee-doo but if they don't know
about it and they don't have somebody
that's gonna maintain the servers and
this this and that then you gotta tell
them hey man we're basically we can do
the hosting for you it's $150 a month
okay
same thing if it's a very small website
of every small blog and they need a
hosting you've been like listening we
take care of the hosting for you if
something breaks or whatever is gonna
happen we're gonna know the servers so
we're gonna charge you $20 a month okay
so it goes $10 on on on GoDaddy it's a
cost $10 a month or Namecheap but you
keep that extra $10 you're gonna saying
be smart
oh yeah man I appreciate it
Leon rap man man yo whose means is this
word whose means does come get your meds
hey Joey should learn should I learn
first JavaScript forest and then go
learn HTML CSS no of course not
you need to learn HTML CSS first right
if you don't learn those things you're
not gonna understand the Dom right if
you don't say how HTML works you're
gonna go in there and try to do things
in the Dom with JavaScript and you're
gonna be like wait what what is this I
don't even know how this is a child of
what like you need to use HTML CSS if
you do if you want to become a web
developer your first language should be
HTML yeah I know some people be like oh
it's not a programming language it's a
markup language so shut up okay let me
see what else
Joe do you do Joe do employers care if
you recycle code instead of from scratch
no nobody cares right and also too it
depends on the situation if you using
like something that's owned by another
company like let's say you created like
a project and you build it from scratch
and then but you did it for a specific
company you can't go to the competitors
and rebuild it again with the same code
you have to basically recode everything
from scratch but using the same ideas
that you already learned okay don't try
to do that don't try to copy and paste
literally the code from something that
you did in one company to another
company now now and that depends on the
situation like I said that's like let's
say I build on this thing called the
Tryon which is for my last company where
basically you could get some booze you
could choose the glasses and put it
under the person's face by choosing
where the pupils is that and then
automatically allocate the eyes and
placed the glasses there
I can't go to war be partner which was
the competitor to the company that I was
working for and use the same code that I
use they're amusing at Warby Parker
because you literally could get sued you
could get sued and the company could get
sued and then shits gonna be ugly you
know what I'm saying but in a situation
where somebody comes in and tells you
hey could you build me an ecommerce
website you can reuse that ecommerce
website that you built a long time ago
or like a week ago whenever you built it
and reuse that code and put it for a
client and then you could take that same
code and put it for another client like
that's logic you know things with logic
and it's something like that like our
e-commerce in the backyard like nobody
cares about that nobody could see that
anyways in the code but things in the
front end you gotta be careful with what
you copy and paste in the front end
because people can go through your
JavaScript very easily in and realize
that you copy their code do I need to
memorize everything in HTML CSS or just
understand how it works because at times
I have to look up tax yes you're right
you don't have to constantly remember
everything like even I myself right now
right so this day I'm not super
comfortable with CSS grids so what I do
is I have the documentation there and a
half high collar CSS tricks
documentation on CSS grids right on my
tab if you ever watch any of my courses
or tutorials I do that all the time and
the reason what I do that is because
there's so many different CSS properties
that you can't remember every single
right especially when you're learning
and you know multiple programming
languages it's impossible for you to
remember every single one of them the
people that come in and tell you oh I
know every single CSS property is
because their lines you know people
don't remember this thing this is not
about memorizing this is about
understanding the concepts and
understanding what exactly you want of
course later on as you use things the
longer you use it the more that you use
it you're gonna learn it and by memory
right like there's a lot of stuff that
with Flex boxes right I used to keep a
window open for the documentation for
that right now because I I use it so
much now that pretty much I I know
exactly what I want
like if I'm using a CSS flexbox and I
want to Center something right in the
middle I already know that all I have to
do is align items Center justified
Content Center that's it you know the
same so it's like it's more right here
CSS grid are having used a constantly so
I still have to look at the
documentation look up there just to see
the properties because I know the
concepts I know what I got to do but I
can't remember the exact same property
for CSS so it's like I'm constantly
looking at the thing so yeah so let me
see I'm keep reading keep reading keep
reading
see guys don't forget if you have
anything that you want to donate you
wanna support the channel support what
I'm doing here you know literally
there's the super chat right there you
click down there or you have you see
that little dollar sign you could donate
your boy a dollar two dollars whatever I
don't even know if you could do cents
like I think like 50 cents or something
like that you know donate to the channel
man what we do is we take that money we
bring it right back to the people we try
to give out free things so that's what
I'm doing I'm here you know what I mean
and if not if you say hey Joe
I don't want to support it's fine let me
earn it and go to my website and sign up
for the courses there legit courses and
literally I help out everybody that
comes in to the website to email me I'll
try to go and help you out as much as I
can okay so let me see what else what
else I'm reading yes you definitely
gotta try the Adonis J yes man
Louise mentok or go check that out on
the website man that's what I did I'm
the nodejs course it's pretty legit
where do you guys get templates from if
you're not building from scratch I'm
actually gonna do a review on template
monster template monster is pretty legit
and they are actually supporting the
channel and actually sponsoring us
pretty soon I just haven't had the
chance to do the videos but we're pretty
much we already talked about it we
already have that set up you know but
definitely man okay let me see what else
so of course now for Lopez what up let
me see
how much to charge for basic HTML CSS ID
Oh a basic HTML CSS website and I got a
landing page a very basic no JavaScript
no nothing fancy
literally like two hundred dollars two
hundred three hundred dollars
that's a depending also to how busy you
are because if a client comes to you and
tells you hey man I want you to do it I
don't want nobody else I want you to do
it right if I'm a stop everything else
that I'm doing I'm gonna charge him five
hundred dollars even if it's a very
simple website because that means that
I'm gonna stop what I'm doing that you
know if I create a course I could
probably earn I don't know like five
thousand dollars from that course if I
create a live streaming video from here
for you guys I could get I don't know
thirty dollars all right something like
that right for an hour so if I'm gonna
come in and stop everything that I'm
doing for a client it has to be
according to how much money I would have
gotten in that one hour or those you
know four or five hours that's gonna
take me to build the whole HTML site you
know what I'm saying
for you it you gotta do you gotta put it
depending on how much your time is worth
you know what I'm saying cuz HTML CSS is
so easy that you could do that with your
eyes closed but how much how much is
your that time worth to you you're gonna
sound like nobody's gonna give you time
back okay let me see what else I'm
breathing or reading and remote jobs if
you're looking for remote jobs go check
out my new channel called Lottie
basically I'm going over all of the
things on how to make money online if
you want to learn how to basically get
money online and do what I do
like I literally bring in money online
since I don't know when since probably
like 2007 okay
now the time that I could say
professionally and I really started
making money was probably 2014
2014 I've been making at least $3,000
minimum a month right
right now we're way above that like if
you go watch my video on Lodi which is
the name of the channel it's bright my
um my channel you click on the link of
my channel here and you basically you'll
see right on the top it says hey
channels that you need to follow
subscribe to this new channel Collodi I
literally go into this and I'm gonna the
next video I'm doing is breaking down my
whole income right so everything from
like how much I make on YouTube how much
I make from the web site how much I make
from everything that I do okay and
that's not even the maximum this month
let's just say the number that you're
gonna see on that video on Lodi that's
the minimum that's like the minimum that
I've gone from you know per month right
now the maximum sometimes I've been
doubled in that okay in one month
alright so go check that out it's pretty
cool it's pretty legit so it's a nice
nice channel that I'm building up it's
actually gonna be more professional than
here because what I did here on Cody
face calm I do a lot of live streaming I
do random live streams random topics and
this is more like to be honest it's like
my social media account to be honest
with you like I started thinking about
this I was like you know I use my
youtube channel as if this was
Facebook or this was you know
Facebook or Instagram where you do a
live stream you hang out with your
friends you you share your thoughts you
know but my other channel
I'm keeping it legit 100% your straight
business like I'm not doing
collaborations I'm not doing a drama I'm
not doing none of the BS it's just
literally good content okay and it's
gotta be short videos that you could
come in and watch the whole video from
start to end and get everything that you
need without having to spend half an
hour or an hour to learn everything okay
but we're still doing everything that
we've been doing on this
channel okay oh let me see I'm trying to
read Bradbury and Bitcoin on the super
chat yes a big hole was the very first
person that supported this channel for
me he's always gonna have you know a
nice little spot right there deep down
inside you know he helped out a lot man
Kelvin Davis thank you so much for the
super chat man I really appreciate it
or Nick poor man a really appreciated
man we here for you guys man yes Kelvin
Davis knows this for the people man
listen everything that you put into the
pot I literally come in and take half of
whatever it is there I let it okay 100
there's me putting everything out there
I literally have to take 20%
automatically so that's for taxes cuz
whatever we make through here it's like
this YouTube takes 50% basically 50% of
everything so it's like if we make $30
we really get $15 okay then after that
after that 15 we basically gotta take
20% pay it off for the taxes and then
from there the other half is for me and
then the other half is for for you guys
so literally buy t-shirts and Angus give
out you know different things like I
don't even know it depends on what
people want sometimes people want
t-shirts some people want hoodie some
people want stickers so yeah and I still
haven't forgot about Ramsay Jordan your
your is coming through boy Joey you
should get tired MacLeod Golan course or
if not do you know I know Josh should I
get Tom McLaws golden course not man
don't get that course I'm being honest I
feel bad
because Todd McCloud is like a super
cool dude
and you know he actually hit me up
because I did a review about the course
and I pretty much it on it and it
was really hurting his pockets and you
know it kind of it's kind of crazy
because you know whatever I do here on
YouTube with a small amount of like
subscribers that I have my subscribers
it's lower my subscribers is literally
the vein of the industry all of you guys
are here you guys are very important you
guys don't even know how much but when I
come in and I say anything about any
youtuber any instructor any developer
out there like it ripples throughout the
whole industry and people hit me back up
like man like y'all you know my channels
hurting my you know my pockets hurting
them I'm hurting my you know you hurting
my my family
dah dah dah which I don't mean to right
I don't mean to be like put a stop to
anybody's thing it's like even the whole
thing with whatever the other kid you
know freaking Logan pause a baby cousin
you know whatever his name is
pause a little cousin right that's what
we're gonna call him um basically you
know channel started people started on
subscribing I was like I don't want to
stop nobody shine right but same thing
happened with Tom McLeod like the course
to me it's one of the the most horrible
courses that's out there like you can't
like the course is built for somebody
who might have like I don't know you
know computer science degree who it's
like or maybe even a master's degree
like it's not for the general public
right and what I mean the general public
just a random guy who's trying to learn
gold name like that course is not for
the random person like is teaching you
computer science from like scratch
before you even start doing any golang
and it's like like this is not what I'm
paying for
you're not saying like if I want to
learn you know get computer science 101
I'll go to college and do that you know
what I mean but I can't be mad at to do
it because he's actually a college
professor you don't know saying so
that's the style of teaching but but
it's not it's not good for people that's
trying to learn online you get what I'm
saying it wasn't like I was trying to
hate on the doors just I took the course
and I was like oh my god like it is more
than I think like more than six six
hours and you still haven't built
anything with goldang that's meaningful
you gonna say like when you're learning
online you want to learn things and you
want to see you know something that
shows in your screen you want to be able
to see something that it's cool you want
to create something you get what I'm
saying so if you're one of one of the
people like me like you need to be you
know see the results like you're gonna
say like that course is not for you man
and it's hard I don't even think there's
really done many good a goal and course
to be honest I haven't found one that's
good out there that that teaches you
going in an easier way or in not even
just an easier way in an engaging way
because you who anybody could teach
golang if you read the documentation but
the problem is how can you really keep
people engaged in a language that's
difficult and at the same time not only
that is difficult but there's so many
different concepts are brand new for
people how can you keep them engaged
most people don't know how to do that
you gotta say go Joe how often do a
junior front-end developers work on
algorithms not that many like sometimes
you might be working on algorithms on
the first day when you go for an
interview that's it like ain't nobody
doing it doing freaking algorithms like
that's not a job that's not a job
position are you gonna saying when you
get higher there's not a position
at the office like here's the algorithm
guy like nobody's there there's not a
position for that
algorithms in reality is is its to test
how you actually think how you will
solve a problem okay but that's not how
how you're gonna be building
applications like they don't be like man
how let's build the the greatest
algorithm right now like it doesn't know
how it is man let me see what else Joe
is it harder to learn a job if you don't
have the typical corporate look or you
look non-traditional um is it harder um
probably you know what I'm saying I'm
pretty sure there's jobs where I go in
and they'll be like no no if we want to
have this guy you don't I'm saying you
might look a certain way in you know
people this is the thing man nowadays a
lot of companies they want to have a lot
of minorities on it just to click click
that little checkbox right but a lot of
times you also have to understand this
it's like if I go into a company if I
build a company right and five guys
coming right four guys are from my
neighborhood and then one guy is from
another state let's just put it like
that right I'm gonna choose the one of
the guys that is from my neighborhood
right that's how it's gonna be right I'm
gonna because they're all quantified
they're all really good developers right
but when it comes down to it if they're
all even who am I gonna pick the one
that's actually from my neighborhood
that's how it is all right now when it
comes to jobs is the same shape all
right who are you gonna pick right who
who's gonna pick you basically write
this kind of e companies with you're
gonna go in and you might be more
qualified in
Little Billy Little Billy is from let's
say little Billy is from freaking Boston
Massachusetts and the person who's all
whose are interviewing both of you guys
is from Boston Massachusetts who you
think is gonna get picked Joe from New
York City or little Billy from
Massachusetts you know what I'm saying
you get what I'm saying like that's how
it is that's just real life that's how
my life is right but what you want to do
is you want to make sure that you're
more qualified than Little Billy because
Little Billy is already comfortable
he knows he's from Boston and the guys
from Boston so the best way to do is say
hey man I'm so much more qualified than
Little Billy that if you really want to
get your money's worth
you gotta hire me and that's what I do
you get what I'm saying like that's what
I do I go in there and you know I
freaking I make sure I'm qualified like
anything that they could throw at me
they say have you done an e-commerce yes
are you good with HTML emails yes are
you good with JavaScript yes are you
going or react yes are you go with
angular yes I you drove you I'll say yes
because anything that they'll throw at
me I literally could go in there and
learn it in that same day right because
I've already put in that time and that's
what I tell you guys you know what I
mean so that's just how it is so is it
difficult it can be difficult but when
you got to think about it like this when
you are the minority in this world you
have to go the extra mile
you have to it's still like you know not
to go too deep into it because I don't
like to talk too much about this
because also to some people they feel a
friend day or whatever but the reality
of things is when you are the minority
you have to be impeccable you can't be
half-ass you can't be okay you can't you
know
you know what I mean like little Billy
could show up and around and do
what he does but you you know them well
like you're the only one in that company
that is like you so was that being said
for you to get into that company and
you're the only one you have to be the
exception you have to be you got to be
the Obama of coding you going on saying
like you can't go in name like yo what
else we're here what up now you win
they're like Obama you got I'm saying
but so that's how it is man word what's
your favorite anime encoder phase has to
be Dragonball Z all time now at some
point I like Naruto but Naruto fell off
Naruto started being like it was so
repetitive and like it's always the same
 now it's on sound scary and I'm
like I'm not into this geisha you gonna
I'm sorry I'm not into the geisha that
was going on in Sasuke and Naruto and
now it's Uzi
Sasuke can I kiss you sounds kicking
cannot suck you all sounds good
why you don't care about me Sasuke like
bro like after a while I was like yo I
can't be watching this there's narrow
its location you gonna say like that's
not for me I love Gundam I'm I'm a
Gundam head you gonna say like I'm
really about that life when it comes to
Gundam I'm really about that life I've
watched every single episode every
single movie every single show that has
ever came out from Gundam I've seen
every single one of them so yeah
but but yeah man let me see cover
warfarin or cover your tats if you're a
large company small agency don't care if
you're in a small agency people don't
care and if you're in like larger
companies it is what it is man that's
you know there's certain things that's
out there like in the world you get what
I'm saying like like let's put it like
this like this a lot of up
in the world but you can let those
 up situations and the things
stop you from getting to where you want
to get to you gonna say so you could be
black white Hispanic Asian Indian I
don't even know if Indians a race but it
should be yeah I don't know who else
whoever's out there purple Australian
black I don't even know what's the name
of those guys freaking of black
Australians but where were you from man
you gotta understand life is a certain
way you know and everybody has their own
teams okay you know there's the blue
team there's the red team okay for you
to get into the blue team and you're red
then you have to be better than
everybody in the blue team okay so
that's how you're gonna get into the
blue team if you're ready if you're a
red player you get what I'm saying so it
is what it is but are you gonna let that
stop you no because what you do is you
strive and you become better than what
the blue team anybody that will be in
the blue team right so that's how you
got to do it man you can't you can't let
nothing stop you you can't think like in
your head like when I wake up man I know
there's a lot of fucked-up in the
world but I just don't let it come in
and be like man you know when I first
came in on started doing like you know
what develop me right there was one time
where there was a situation
that was like weird it was kind of weird
there was me and some other kid let's
say little Billy
me and little billy I was way more more
prepared than him and he was like we was
both sitting down he's like man I'm so
nervous it's like it's a have you ever
like have you ever done this on my game
and I've already worked in a couple of
companies just isn't that and then we go
away and we both do the same interview
next thing you know we come outside you
know they say okay thank you
that I answer everything perfectly
everything was good everything was legit
somehow little Billy's the guy goes like
okay Little Billy you know you come back
in and you know we'll continue from here
on and I'm like come on man come on
little Shaun you had to pick bit Little
Billy like we know what it is you get on
saying like we know how it is man but do
I let that stop me nah man I
continue because then soon as I didn't
get down fortunately in the next company
I got all four 105,000 okay so it's like
you gotta say sometimes things happen
for a reason you know so it's like you
keep it moving you move on to the next
thing you know things happen you know
sometimes if you go into companies like
that you wasn't meant for it you don't
know saying that hey that wasn't the
place for you it's like you dodged a
bullet so don't worry about it if you go
in there with tats and you tatted up or
whatever you could be whatever color you
are or whatever you feel like you feel
like you you're gonna stand out and
you're not gonna be part of the norm
just know that when you go in there if
they really care about their business
and you're better than whoever goes in
there then they gotta pick you that's it
people care about money the most so
you're gonna be fine
it's transcribing good for some income
side job that's a good question that's
definitely a good question for for Lodi
I don't know if that would be good
let me get comfy let me get comfy out
here man so let me see what else what
else we got in here
robber fish thank you I really
appreciate it man
Rutherford says coding face thank you
for everything is because of you that
I'm not a reactor front-end developer

could put you know the little bug in

you know like I told you guys I'm using
this channel as my platform like as if
this was faced with my YouTube is
literally where I come in here drop my
tutorials teach you guys the things that
you guys need to learn talk about code
and we have to
channel Collodi guys go subscribe to
that man click on my channel and go
check out I just dropped a new video
over there go check that out man
Little Billy wipe is mop you for coming
out the interview where if you dropped
out of college so you still mentioned
that you went on your white on your
resume I don't know I think that could
be mmm I mean it depends it depends how
many how many credits I've seen people
putting how many credits they they've
got from college you know like if you're
almost done if you have 90 credits and
you've got okay
I got 94 credits from college then
people know like King he's almost done
with it but it's hard I don't know it
depends on you and that's another thing
yeah Ramsay Jordan said it you know you
go avoid it cuz you're gonna have to
explain why you didn't finish it in
that's true say some people thinking are
they might want to be like oh why didn't
you get to finish I'm like bro I need to
get that back you gonna say you know I

24 and you know how you sound when you
met you man secure you like you don't
even know if you're gonna get the job or
whatever you like I'm 24 and the guys
like Oh freaking do you have kids are
you married that I'm like no got a
girlfriend oh and there's not and I just
I don't know it's like cringe cringe
worthy like I was like why is this guy
asking me this like I was like I
don't know if the guy was gay or some
 that's in my head I started
thinking like if if I do start asking me
personal questions I'm thinking in my
head you gain automatically so so I'm
like I'm not into this shame so that's
why my head but then I started thinking
my oh wait I know why he he asking me
this right so after he asked me all
the he tells me oh you know I
usually like to hire I'll never forget
that this was crazy too he's like I
usually like to hire guys you know guys
who are married and have kids and the
reason why they do that and they they
want people who are married and with
kids is because you need the job right
so if you are somebody who who needs the
job they love that there's employers
like smaller businesses they love the
fact that you have kids and that you
have a wife because now they got you by
the balls right so what they do is the
guy was asking me all this information
he tells me at the end cuz we usually
like sometimes we we we have to stay in
late we have to do this in that and and
I'm like oh that's why you was asking me
so you could pretty much grab me by the
balls and and have me like oh you can
leave you have to finish the job today
staying here until you know whatever
hours because you have a kid and this
and that
back then they have a care and have
nothing so I was like you know me like
if when you're free and you don't have
no kids you don't have enough
you don't have no responsibilities you
could literally be like you I'm out
of here I quit the job but when you have
responsibilities it's hard to leave a
job it's hard to to come in and and just
be like oh I'm not gonna stay in late
because that's how they freakin that's
how they get you man
like those companies that ask you all do
you have kids do you have this and that
like they do that on purpose because
they know that they could get you
shoutouts a croissant man what up
croissant
yeah
freaky yet his kids retarded skeletons
retarded skeleton girls like goals don't
I dropped out of a Community College on
the second day because I couldn't find a
parking spots why I said f this yo let
me tell you a little quick story there's
a crazy story right I'll never forget

thermometers fit right um it's a
negative 8 I'm outside waiting for the
cue 39 and no matter fact I walked all
the way to like this street called
I think 48th Street or something like
that 48th half I'm waiting for a cue 39
mind you I was liking junior year of
school high school I'm there freezing

mom never bought me no freaking jacket

hand-me-down Rocawear jacket right which
was like super light right I'm outside

nothing you know and it was crazy I'm
outside just they're just like oh man
this is bad I know that I'm like
girl this is bad right now
I'm freezing my hands is freezing I'm so
cold
literally it pulled the bus comes now
the bus comes I get in I'm India no lie
like a tear came out like my eye and
froze right here I'll never forget but
you know how you soak so cold man this
 is bad I don't know how the hell
that was so cold that day my ship
froze right here I had to remove it like
this I had to go like this son remove
that off my face bro the the trip
is like half an hour trip to get to
school I used to go to Grover Cleveland
High School look it up nobody successful
out of that school the only person that
became successful at school was um Rosie
Perez the actress
ain't nobody poppin in that school like
- school was like straight loser status
right oh and so in pepper came out of
the high school that's a and my boy cue
from worldstar that's it three people
right I want to become the fourth person
somehow I know somebody add me on on
Wikipedia to the Grover Cleveland High
School go add me Billy yo Joe Santos
Garcia I don't know internet celebrity
or whatever I want to make it somehow to
the top the top four spot from that
loser school like nobody makes the out
of a shame so I go to this to to the
stupid bus we drive whatever literally I
come out of the the bus stop my hands
hurt so much and no lie after waiting
I waited for like an hour for that
stupid bus to get there and then when I
came and got on the bus another hour
another half an hour to get to the
school when I came out the bus
I literally this is this how crazy I was
in high school I can't believe I did
this waiting an hour and a half to
get to school on freezing weather
where I should have just stayed my ass
home
I looked at the other side of the street
it was a two-way street and the bus the
q39 that goes back to my house was
coming right there bro I looked at the
high school like this and I'm saying
q39 going back home
or go to school freezing my ass off what
I did I cross the street I cross the
street you took the bus back
home like I literally took an hour and a
half
freezing my ass to go cross the street
and go back to the crib like that was
crazy
like now that I think about it my your
how the hell how the hell did I freaking
do that I should have never even
freaking went to school man
like that's just crazy man let me see
reading this all day man like yo he's
gonna get off in 30 minutes I'm about to
get off so me man I'm seeing
a word it was so cold Yankees hat had a
Yankee hat words son now for real man
that's one of my dreams man and I always
said it one of my dreams is literally
show up on a Wikipedia I know this
sounds so dumb even talking about it
but even showing up on like the school
grounds because they have like a picture
of like Rosie Perez in the school right
next to the principal's office and they
have they actually have it on the
Wikipedia for Grover Cleveland High
School like only notable or wasn't
notable alumni from Grover Cleveland
High School freaking Rosie Perez and the
bitch from so in pepper
that's a a nobody ever made it at that
school like you know like it's a
straight loser school like you go in
there it's like you already know look it
was so bad my school was so bad that the
Irish drop out from school was actually
like 60% like 60% more than half of the
people dropped out of school and what
happened was 30% actually graduated on
time that's how bad that school was when
I was going down man it was crazy
let me see what else what else so I'm
reading this thing should I have called
in a Sigma Eugene what up you know we
gotta go edit that wiki page yo for real
I never wanted I was like y'all I'm not
gonna do it but that's like one of the
things where I'm like that was like one
of my bucket list you know to get on on
freakin groan clear high school Wikileak
not working Wikipedia page as some type
of like alumni you know cuz nobody makes
it you don't know what it is man like
you know people come in here and they
have like sad stories and this this and
that but it's like my life is a sad
story
and then it's like somehow this days
that I'll be in my house I'm like you
know how did I even make this how
did I even make it out of that like
and I'm still somehow struggling to
continue striving for more and push it
forward and I tell you guys I'm like yo
you got should a lot of you guys come
from even better backgrounds than me
like you know what I'm saying like you
got your freakin work hard and just like
get all the done man like I'm gonna
be here a little really sharing all the
 that most people don't even share
you know like you should take everything
that I tell you is literally for your
own good I don't do nothing here but try
to help people out and literally tell
you guys the things that I made mistakes
on because it's like I learned a lot of
 from mistakes you know so it's like
if I already made those mistakes listen
to me so you don't have to do it and you
could get where I'm at or even beyond
this like sooner than me you know like
what am i is five it took me five years
to get to where I'm at right five six
years
you guys if I had somebody like like me
well should I be telling you guys on
YouTube and the courses and tutorials
and all this
if I would have had somebody like this I
would a guy all this down there
like two years all right
but our main mistakes
I mean mistakes throughout the whole
career and different things like you
know like right now like I'm thinking
about like why wouldn't why wouldn't I
go to title right why did I take the
title job instead of working at 39
dollar glasses calm like that's that was
my last job right when you think about
it that's like saying hey man
would you rather go work at macys.com or
will you got a rather go work at spotify
you're gonna sound like why would I
choose macys.com so it's like those are
dumb mistakes that you make right so
it's like when I come in
I'll give you an advice and tell you hey
man if a bigger company that really has
a big name that you can grow up or grow
in that company choose that company even
if it's farther from you instead of you
choosing the smaller company because
it's closer to your house or you could
get there late in this this and that
like out of my mistake you should learn
that lesson you don't know say so that's
why I share it with you guys because
there's a lot of that I did that I
know what a freaking save me what a
necessary time would have made my career
go faster
you gotta say like there's a lot of
you know it's like this new channel to
that I'm building Lodi everything I'm
building on that channel you're gonna
see how that channels gonna blow up in
one month right and one month we're
gonna see a huge different right but
that's because I learned from one year
of making mistakes on this channel right
of not understanding how the algorithm I
mean it's not even that honest and
I didn't do more research I wasn't
looking into this as like oh I want
my channel to grow I was just creating
content right you know so that's just
how it is you know what I mean so it's
like ah you wanna actually learn from my
mistakes so like that you don't have to
do it you don't say sometimes I wish
people will share the things that the
mistakes that they did so like that I
wouldn't have to do it I wouldn't have
to go through those mistakes man no but
you know the Wikipedia thing that's
definitely something cool but definitely
wanna make it to like the high school
the high school alumni thing that they
have over there somehow I don't know how
well I want that that spot because it's
just like it's something that I thought
about when I was like freaking freshman
in high school I was like it's like this
literally it's like a huge wall of like
space for alumni it's like people who
have maybe out of the high school and
there's only two pictures they're like
you know how bad that is for any
student that goes through that school
like that's a bad feeling that means
that makes you feel like like you
go to a high school that nobody makes it
out of you got on saying like nobody
makes it anywhere in that high school
you have a whole wall it's like it's so
crazy I wish I had a picture that
they have a whole wall of like literally
just like two pictures there and they're
like yo the to alumni store - the only
two people that have made it out of
there and have either become celebrities
or have done anything meaningful in this
world like everybody else is like no
people just drop out and that's it
we're man
yes sir low-income areas that have less
tax money so that means fewer phones are
playing to the area school system yes
sir that's how it is man
David quarter David was the cortes there
at Cruz what is it
you complain a lot I love your concept
but you always complain it's getting
ridiculous
 happens move on stop talking about
it bro like what you need to do is you
don't need to be here man like you gotta
understand my channel is my channel my
channels literally just like a spot
where I share my thoughts you don't know
same like I share my thoughts on YouTube
this isn't this isn't a professional
channel this isn't a business channel
this is literally my thoughts what I'm
going through what happens throughout my
day and at the same time I sprinkle a
little bit of sauce so you could learn
you got what I'm saying you know ain't
nobody complaining out here when people
come in here I'm sure my life I'm
sharing what happens you know
complaining is like oh man I'm crying
because this doesn't die nah I mean you
never seen me out here like that
I'm literally sharing sharing either a
frustration or something that has
happened throughout the day or whatever
situation might have happened I share it
you get what I'm saying like that's how
it is you know what I mean that's what
the channel is about is Co coding fees
who's coding fees your boy you get what
I'm saying like this isn't what you
wanted this to be is like the
programming tutorials channel this isn't
that you get what I'm saying like this
is the coding phase channel you know
what I'm saying like is literally
actually just name it Joe Santos Garcia
now thinking about it going back into
time if I would've just changed it I
would have just made it into Joe Santos
Garcia and that's saying because this
channels really more about me and me
sharing my thoughts and sharing my
my experience as a web developer and
sharing my experience that aren't things
that happen since becoming a web
developer you gonna say Mike you can't
be mad at me because of a you gonna
say I guess my channel like you don't
need to be here I think it's kind of
ridiculous and say people people want
you people want you to give them
constant just constant constant constant
constant constant constant constant you
could go find that on Lottie go
subscribe to the new channel called
Lottie where we're doing it as a
business we're doing it as a
professional channel coding face is
literally my thoughts collie face why
you think I do so many live streams here
you gotta say like this is not like who
does as much continent to me who does as
much live streams as me who shares as
much as me like I'm sharing my family
I'm sharing everything that happens in
my life nobody does that
right nobody does that
everybody else tells you lies over here
on YouTube everybody tells you oh I'm
happy all day with a smile every day
like that's fake that's not real life
man you know what I'm saying this days
I'm happy this days I'm upside this days
I'm stressed this days I'm freakin
pissed off this days I'm hurt there's
days I'm I'm you know and most of the
time when I would get pissed off is
because I'm hurt you're gonna say like
you freaking help out clowns out here
and clowns come back and become snakes
you gotta say so those things hurt you
because you're like man how can you help
people out and then they come and
backstab you or they come and use you
like you know how many people hit me up
constantly let's do this and that collab
let's do this and that and I don't do it
with nobody you should work with this
person like there's people that come in
here and create accounts or fake
accounts to say oh you should work with
this other person and then you find out
that they're that's actually their
account
you know like of course I'm gonna sound
like I'm freaking upset it's like that's
how it is
you gotta say or when people come in
here and be like oh isn't gonna like Oh
freaking Sam monkey that I like you
don't know all the type of I
gotta go through this YouTube
like shut your mouth son like straight
up like this is the problem like same
thing like the other day some dude left
a comment on on a guy who who came he
did like a presentation it wasn't the
best presentation in the world but he
went up there he did a presentation on
the Meetup and then the guy some guy
comes in it has the audacity saying oh
man
this this or this presentation was so
boring and so easy to do the guy should
have should have stayed at home like
you're a clown you wouldn't even have
the courage to put your face out there
most people don't even have the courage
to even come up on YouTube do anything
you know most people have icons on there
on the freaking pages on their freaking
YouTube accounts because they're scared
to even after their faces out there you
got what I'm saying
like that's how it is I'm comfortable
you gonna say like I'm couple of - what
I was doing and comfortable of my skills
I'm comfortable how much I make I'm
comfortable warm where I came from I
came from the bottom - to where I'm at
like I'm comfortable in my crib I'm
chilling right now just on just by
chillin right here this is already
making money automatically I have other
websites that's generating money but
I've been doing nothing you know what
I'm saying like I'm comfortable I got
this on my face this how
comfortable I am you get what I'm saying
like I got this this on my face
you got a saying on YouTube just
chilling hanging out haven't shaved
haven't nothing with the freaking marble
shirt chillin in the crib you got our
same song that's comfortable you wanna
say you can't be mad at the fact that
somebody's that comfortable and it's
like sharing knowledge and literally
just coming in here and just saucing it
you know what I mean something it is
what it is Tyler bangs like yo lol yeah
man that's the problem most of those
people their new subscribers man that's
like this doula man something had me
pissed off the other day he leaves a
comic this is how crazy how crazy people
are do watch one of my videos he drops a
crazy comic he comes in talking Shane
his first comment is talking about

his thirst comment is sucking me off and
I'm like yo bro how how dare are you
coming here your first thing that you
dropped your first impression about my
channel my videos it's talking then
you watch the video then you realize oh
 this dude is dropping knowledge and
then from there the next video you come
back kissing my ass and then after that
you come back on the next video and suck
me off and then it's like that's why you
don't leave comments until you know who
the hell is the person that you're gonna
leave a comment soon you gonna say
that's why you don't open your mouth to
people unless you know what the hell
you're gonna say you didn't come in and
be like oh show up to some of those
house and be like oh man this somebody
needs to watch their dog or some
you know what I said it's like we go to

like who the am I to tell you to
wash it go watch your dog you gonna say
like it's like I don't and how did you
make sense but it does sound funny
though
so yes dude comes in drops a crazy
comment and then I just left the
comments are your bro just keep it
moving move on and go do something else
and then

I agree with you so much this is a great
this is a great video I love your
content seven minutes ago

you should never drop it I don't even
like to drop comments on people unless I

negative comment on people but if the
 is that bad then I'll leave was
somebody yell bro you gotta you gotta
step it up that's it I don't come in and
talk to you about them I don't talk not

livestream now the title wasn't
something that that was accurate let's
just say it wasn't accurate so then I
just told him like a bro just change the
title like I wouldn't mind even the
video if it's up there it's just a title
you gotta see the title pissed me off I
like bro like I don't even want to put
like private conversations not between
me and Tyler but between me and the
other person and I was like yo bro like
dudes is out here wrong and then they
kid they talk and then they kiss my
ass and then it's like how the hell am i
apologizing when literally they
apologizing to me and they kissing my
ass so it's like you know so that's what
happened with me and Tyler and we
freaking cool because it's like
Charlie's been here for a minute

only people that always comes through to
the live stream so you know my hat's go

Krusty the Klown and she is like nah man
like we need we need actually no
accurate titles right but let me see
yeah man I'll try to drop look I try to
drop in just a real life man a real
knowledge
for my experiments man you know I mean
passing
yeah Israel even I myself look that even
I myself is rare for me to leave a
comment like you know what is sometimes
people get so pissed off like let's say
like the freako camp
whoa if you watch go if you guys want to
have fun go into the freako camp videos
right the freako camp videos oh my god
they be going so hard you know what I
mean they be going so hard it's never
funny like people be pissed off because
people don't know how to separate like
real life and like the Internet all
right they don't know how to separate
are you here to learn it and get hired
and get money or are you here because
you're part of a coding programming of
religion you're gonna say so you talk
about something like free coke amp which
is free and people lose their they
like oh my god you can't talk about free
coke amp the is free and this is
named like look at the video
like nobody was talking shared my free
coke amp or even the creator of free
coke and whatever like this is me just
telling you as an advice because I spent
a year doing all this all they said
that I learned was overkill meaning I
was learning that I didn't even
need to learn on my first year
you gotta say like why would I
I tell you to go into free coal camp and
wasted time and learning a whole bunch
of that you don't need and then
trying to memorize without even
building any pages or any
projects like spent mad time in there
like you understand like those people
don't understand that I'll be
looking at that I'm like young how
the hell this people don't understand
that what I'm telling them it's just a
real-life shame like just being honest
with them people don't want look people
do not want nobody to be honest with
them right people don't want people to
to come in and tell them how it is
people want to live in this fake world
in this fantasy world where they think
they gotta become developers by
following a map where they think they're
gonna become developers in two weeks
like it doesn't work like that like you
get to learn programming basics that's
it but you're not a developer yet like
ain't no company gonna be paying you a
shame for knowing how to do a four loop
like nobody's gonna pay you for that
 you know what I mean like a company
needs you to come in and give them an
extra hand they don't need you to come
in there and be like hey could you do a
for loop we're gonna pay you $100,000 to
go do a for loop like nobody's paying
nobody for that
you gotta say like free coke Amber's a
great place to practice is not a place
to learn as I people get that mixed
up man
things like they lose their dose
like I had to do like two three videos
in the freako camp I was like yo and
people don't get it then I kill man it's
like poor freako camp is free but you
shouldn't even say anything about free
cocaine business and eyes like and those
like you don't like free coke camp
because you're not smart and I'm like
I'm doing the little emoji from the girl
from there's an emoji like like are you
stupid
like bro like I'm in my house and in PJs
man you know what I'm saying like I'm in
my crib in PJs man like I'm chilling
like you really really think like that
 is gonna help you and that is
a part of your religion go ahead go go
freaking doing go stay your freako
camping just don't do any projects don't
build anything just keep following the
map why does Adam suck I don't don't
suck man Adam is good man I don't know I
don't know what type of Adam you guys
have you guys have to uninstall it and
install the latest I had
is legit man vs cold is cool tool vs
cause a great editor right but it
doesn't even have half of the packages
that Adam has right because Adam to to
make packages for Adam is so easy that
they constantly do new packages people
add packages even you guys go add
packages to - Adam right now right and
just solve somebody's problem right like
it let's say if you if you wanted to
create a a package for automatic
semicolons right in PHP you could go and
create that right now
okay I'm freaking you know how you call
this an MVS code they don't have that
shame they don't have as many packages
because it's from Microsoft so Microsoft
number one makes it super hard to even
create any packages and you have to sign
up to their turf a lover's API and a
whole bunch of like it's
ridiculous vs code is fast but if you
really focus on on like oh I want a
freaking text editor that's fast then
you might as well use sublime tree if
that's what you feel like you're like
man I need something that's faster than
Adam and I don't care about the packages
then you might as well use sublime
tricky sublime three years way better
than then vs code so but it is what it
is right
the thing is that when people jump on
something you know what I mean like like
this is the thing and this is another
thing that you guys got a freaking
understand how it works in the web
development community there's something
called marketing okay there's something
called marketing right people don't talk
about this but just like any other
industry you come up with a framework
all you have to do is I'll align
yourself with a bigger company and all
the sheeps of what developers choose
whoever is connected to the bigger
company okay
angular it's not even freaking super
good like that right but people like it
because it's aligned to Google right :
is aligned to Google Dart
it's aligned to Google so people choose
those technologies because it's Google
okay
same thing with react reactors Facebook
but the only difference is a reactively
giant-man but going back to like vs col
vs co is Microsoft so Microsoft what
they do is everybody knows that if you
the majority of people are on Windows
right so what they've done is they
basically they've reached out to a whole
bunch of different blogs a bunch of
youtubers and be like hey man tell
people that this is the best text editor
talk about this that this is the best
text editor by now it's so engrained
into people that no matter if you have
proof that young this thing is not the
best text editor out there nobody's
gonna be able to change their minds you
gotta say it's like even view Jes where
view genius came out ugh nobody cared
about it soon as laravel basically
forced people to install of UJS even
right now you download laravel you have
UJS already as a freaking a dependency
on your project like of course lara
freakin view is gonna grow if you have
the major framework freaking promoting
another framework of course it's gonna
start growing right you know this this
is a framework called
mark ogs right
if laravel was to take that Marco Jes
and be like okay Marco das is the best
thing out right now then you will see
how Marco Diaz becomes number one or
even hyper app guys it's all about
height man like sometimes you got a I
don't know you got a is the same
Jordans and and whatever like you know
what I mean like if everybody uses it
everybody thinks it's the best thing but
it's not my people get paid for this

yes
I don't know about that man
so what'd you say man Lee already me and
anyone know this real tough candy having
a real tough time on her new job
self-taught its heart roll it's a hard
road um it's a hard road for whoever it
is whoever it could be a college student
could be whatever uh background you
coming from it's gonna be hard the first
job is always gonna be hard I don't know
if that's the first job she's been
working at other things before other
companies you don't know how there's her
stack is you going on sailing she might
be working on on a stack that's
difficult just because you think like oh
everybody's job is easy that's not how
it is every company has different type
of business logic and you might fall
into a company that has a very difficult
business logic you know like when I was
working in my last company I
hated that job because it was difficult
like it was difficult I wasn't getting
paid as much as I wanted to and I'm like
yeah I could a guy in are way easier job
in the city but because it was like a
few blocks away from my house I took it
now was it like that was it difficult
yeah it was difficult because you have
to deal with glasses like if you guys I
don't know if you guys have glasses or
not some of you guys have glasses have
you ever looked at at the prescription
for glasses it's like man numbers that
you have to put in right when you're
building a website for that type of
product is difficult you get what I'm
saying it's a lot of man so
definitely what I would say is like you
know you can't you can't hate on all her
sharing that hate maybe the business
logic that she's working on might be
difficult man that happens all the
time you might go like
you know you might be a junior developer
jumping into a company that all you have
to do is fix up menus like literally
spend six seven months
fixing website menus and that's a so it
is what it is you know she might be
having like a difficult time because
she's doing complex work not every every
company is the same but yeah
hey Joe always take the train in the
morning I was wondering you know by
creating some type of SoundCloud or
podcast with your dropping jams pieces
or even live Q&amp;amp;A s yeah I want to do
that
this kid Jacob's heart is supposed to be
setting that up we set up a podcast
thing I forgot what's the name of it
some podcast he's doing that he's
gonna be the one in charge of that like
taking this type of videos and putting
it there as a podcast so you could get
it through iTunes it'll get a little
google play you could go through
everywhere man
you think the New York City market is
tough you mentioned you had five years
of experience Bart are only making any
5k I live in Queens I know you're around
the New York City area
JEP SATs 1990 um basically the reason
why was making 85k was because I chose
to move to Long Island and in Long
Island you gotta think about it even
though Long Island New York that's like
thinking about it like it's a city
outside of the city so it's not really
you're not getting paid the same money
that you're gonna get in the city in the
city you could get ninety thousand a
hundred thousand one hundred and twenty
thousand easily right but if you work
outside of the city
then you you're getting paid like you
know like ten thousand dollars less
that's just how it is
all right and and that's how it is all
over the country if you live outside of
the city or you working in a company
outside of the city you're not making
the same amount of money as if you're
working inside of a big city like LA San
Francisco Atlanta Miami
what else Dallas Austin you know what I
mean like you're not gonna make the same
amount of money if you're not inside of
the big city but that was like my choice
it's to be honest with you like that was
my choice I was getting our offer of
$110,000 to go work at title or I could
have worked at this other companies 39
dollar glasses calm and that was
like ten minutes away from my house
title I would have to go to the city I
would have had to commute hop on the
Long Island Rail Road go an hour and a
half almost an hour like a an hour let's
say an hour to go to the city right and
I didn't want to dilash it even right
now I don't want to de lesson there was
a recruiter who was trying to court me
to go work at at the city from here from
where I live at in Connecticut for
$165,000 so go work in New York City and
I was like I'm good I'm not gonna do a
two-hour commute I was talking to one of
my my girl's cousin who works in he
lives in New Jersey I don't know if you
saw the lives from yesterday I was out
there in New Jersey yesterday I was
talking to him and he was telling me he
works all the way in New York and he
takes a bus a two-hour bus and our 45
minute bus ride from his house all the
way to New York City and I was like I'm
not taking it now we're never you know
an hour 45 minute ride to nowhere you go
pay me half a million dollars I'm not
going over there like money to me
money is not there's no money out there
that's worth two hours of like traveling
and commute like I'm not going tonight
 you know what I mean like so that
was my personal choice I chose to stay
in the smaller company instead of
choosing a bigger company which would
have been cool because then that would
have been like you know I would have
been a nice little stamp on my resume oh
yeah I work at title you
and people will suck me off on YouTube
hurry you know it's funny when you think
about it it's like how many guys have
you seen this on on YouTube that come in
and out of nowhere blow up because they
put in what is it they'll be like a day
in the life of a guy who works a
software engineer who works on Facebook
and now out of nowhere they get like a
hundred thousand subscribers or like
there was a kid who just started popping
up on my timeline who was like a day in
the life of a harbor computer science
major and I'm like you know like people
suck off like people who who work at
this type of companies or work at or go
to schools so this I release schools
like like literally like people suck him
off like straight up it's like this just
like all day sucking sucking them off
even if they might not even giving you
good content or whatever right so to me
I'm like if I would have came in here
but like oh yeah
Joe Santos Garcia are working a day in
the life of software engineer at title
right come in do a little video come
pass by like office jay-z Shawn Carter
record that little piece right there
like even though I never bump into jay-z
that will get like a million views
and like that's how it is man Google
developers they go freaking Google
developer a day in the life of Google
developer is like Oh or whatever right
like people suck em off so bad like
people act like is is that difficult is
that are difficult to work at those
companies guys all you have to do is
just literally prepare yourself you know
I wanted look I wanted to challenge
myself I wanted to get into to Facebook
and then actually at the end the night
I'm actually thinking about doing this I
might do it for Lottie right am i I
don't know if I should say this year but
because then somebody will cut this out
from the livestream and put it online or
whatever and my shake but what I
wanted to do was I wanted to do apply
for Facebook right okay hired by
Facebook and then call them up and be
like I can't make it and then I just
what I want to do that I'm planning
I don't know if I should even say that
because I know somebody's gonna probably
gonna they're gonna probably
take this clip and put it out there and
be like oh now Joe can't get hired by
Facebook because he was gonna quit no
matter what but I'm still thinking about
doing some I just like get hired by
one of those big ass companies and then
make the video that would be like a
viral viral video and just to
just to prove to people like yo this
 is not hard like people
reacting like is like oh my god
googoo Facebook Amazon like it's not
that hard guys I'm telling you
ahead of time
Jax chefs case like yo are you drunk
nah man I'm just chillin I'm hanging out
try buried try bury what up side thanks
for the support man appreciate it
yeah like ain't I don't mind that people
do those type of videos but I think it's
kind of ridiculous like the amount of
videos that people are coming out with
is that great now I don't know if you
guys remember that was like a wave of
videos of like why I quit from BuzzFeed
and automatically you could say why I
quit from BuzzFeed and automatically you
will get like a million views like who's
interested in this you gotta say
who who's interested in why you quit
from buzz for you like that is kind
of ridiculous
ya know that's what I mean I came from
the bottom man I used to working and
queen sent some old man I used to work
at Queen sent some oh man right there
money exchange on Queen sent some oh man
and it was sad man I got fired from a
money exchange and then ended up at the
freaking at the parking lot booth like
that sad you know nothing like there was
a moment I want you guys look I was I
