at it again man coding face.com
your boy is back and out and did it
again guys listen today's a special show
a special video were basically
critiquing a website that somebody sent
me this k James sent me an email he's
like hey man you know you should go and
check out other people's websites and
and critique it in and you know see the
things that you would do a little bit
better or the things that you know they
can't improve on it right so we come to
his website his website is James Vincent
designs calm which is pretty cool and I
like the color scheme I like the the
gradient from was like a teal to like a
darker blue the white color so it's I
like that off the bat is pretty good all
the colors are are pretty nice orange
and blue looks good too
the shadow I don't know about the shadow
so it's like it has a double shadow like
it already has one shadow but you
shouldn't have a blurred shadow in the
background if it already has a shadow
but that's my taste
all right here definitely fixed the
icons make them a little bit bigger make
them in the same space as the the links
that you have here this links like this
I like them it's pretty cool
also too one of the main things that I
would say keep everything in the
container if you're going to keep
everything like this like in this space
make sure it continues so you're
supposed to continue all the way down
like that so all the content is supposed
to be inside of that container the
maximum wave of it should be from here
to here and then everything should be in
this content area in the center all
right also this is like you know just
keep it in the center keep in a
container keep it organized because
it'll just makes it look clean you know
right now you have this stuff like in
some
type of container right and then you
come down here and there's no container
in this area all right let me see what
else we could say about this this is
fine this black black on this doesn't
look good
so I will say make it like a white or
like a light gray let me see what else
also to try to stay away from music like
black colors when it comes to the font
itself try to I mean this isn't exactly
black but let me see see if we could
find a good color for it because you
want to be like a dark color but never
use black because when you use black and
white is just it looks a little bit off
and then for this you could may actually
come in and make it like you see like
this is black you should use like a
color like that because then now let's
contrast on the page and as you can see
it just it looks better and also to like
I said if you keep everything inside of
a container inside of here
it is going to keep everything more
clean also give yourself a space a
bigger space between both of these all
right before all between the rows
because it's like if you come here looks
a little bit more cramped you could
actually give it more space spread it
out a little bit more let me see what
else oh yeah and you got a couple of
good projects here I mean of course I
could I could tell that you're starting
off I don't know if how long you've been
doing this if it's been a while but it's
definitely good that
you have some some other websites
besides just yours cuz then it looks
good and this looks like a business you
know what I mean the design is not I'll
be honest is not 100% they're like you
know you be like oh man it's a great
design but at the same time I can see
what you're you're going for you're
actually creating websites for real
businesses like you know and that sign
that's that's good you know it's not
like sometimes people come in and they
create portfolios of like hey here's a
here's how you do a for loop or here's
how you do an algorithm nobody cares
about those things people care about
this they care about real businesses
what type of websites have you built for
other businesses and that's what they
care about even if they're not real you
still need to have those businesses
there so you definitely don't good in
this part you know of course as you
progress as a developer you start making
better and more refined work and all
that stuff is gonna come with time also
tools is this way I always tell people
you know sometimes it's hard to be like
hey I'm gonna be a designer I'm gonna be
a development developer doing all those
things and learning both things at the
same time could be hard like you have to
choose one thing at a time
right if you're going to become a
designer focus a lot more on the design
side of things and at the same time like
let's say it's not wrong for a designer
to come in and use somebody else's
website meaning about somebody else's
template right now if you are excuse me
if you are a developer and you're
basically you want to show your skills
as a developer you need to find really
good designs out there so your work and
standout right because what's important
for people is that when they see your
website the
oh man this this guy's designs are
pretty legit pretty pretty crisp like
you don't have to go ahead and copy
everybody's things like you know to the
dot but just you go to different sites
right and like let's say like this you
come to somebody on dribble comm you
look out there they designed it the
typography the spacing that they have on
things the we have the menus are like
you don't have to copy it you know every
single thing on it but you take
inspiration from me
you take inspiration from it and you
start looking at at what they have like
let's say an example a landing page
because that's what your page is is
really more like a landing page so look
at this look how it is start looking at
how the spacing you see what I was
telling you like a lighter gray on white
it looks nice it looks clean right you
know then you have a darker color which
is now black it's dark but it's not
black all right then you keep going see
you have other colors in there to make
things stand out like you know it just
makes your website looks more legit and
you see how everything is all aligned
beyond you know between this certain
space is I go it's like it's called
container it's like you say hey the
maximum width that you want this to be
is let's say 200 pixels so it would
never go beyond that case right now I'm
on a 1080p screen right so my screen is
bigger then somebody was in the laptop
so if they see this and their pages is
like humongous now at least you have
everything inside of a container so it
won't be what's happening here like what
you see like this images they look good
at this with right they look good this
with but because you don't have a
container by the time it gets to this
point the images is just going okay you
know they're just spreading out
completely right because that right now
they're probably
with 100% and each one of these is let's
say is whatever is it's twelve divided
by by four right so pretty much when you
you extend it it looks like that the
images don't look properly the the
pixelated so like I said just keep
everything in a container and you should
be fine and like another thing so just
go to dribble comp when I say people go
to dribble comm check out what other
people have I'm not saying take the
designs that they have and copy it just
look at the what they working on right
cuz dribble comm has the best of the
best guys like literally the best
designers in the world come here and
they post they work here so you pretty
much looking at you know the top of the
crop right so you want to come over here
and look at what they have and get ideas
of what they have and see how the
typography is how the color schemes are
and build something close to it
not exactly but build exactly how you're
gonna build your website whatever you
want to put on it but take certain ideas
like you know like you see like this it
has a you know one desk that's like
probably like wait 300 this was probably
front way 600 and then over here has a
little line then here the color is like
a lighter a little darker gray and then
you see the button it's a little bit
like a off purple and then the color
itself is like a blue blue purple like
you know what I mean like just go in
there get inspiration yeah this is
pretty good man I mean you're getting
there I like the fact that when you
scroll a changes to an active section so
that's pretty cool you know so it shows
that you know your JavaScript you know
you understand the Dom so that's pretty
cool and it's just a lot a lot of little
things that you've gotta tweak you tweak
it
everything's gonna be fine all right
I'll see you guys later man
coding phase comm James thank you for
