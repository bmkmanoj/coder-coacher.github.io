back at it again man coding face.com
listen your boys back I didn't did it
again
listen alright ok so I know a few months
ago well back in the beginning when I
first started I did create a video where
I was talking about oh man I want like
elixir I don't think that's needy I
don't think that it's really a language
that you should learn well I was wrong
and I'm happy to admit that so basically
after talking to one of my friends and
he showed me a great reason in a great
way that he uses elixir I decided you
know what I'm gonna buy a course from
Conan fees.com well it's not really cold
face commies udemy.com um I just
happened to put in the link on there
right so he told me about it and how he
uses it is for multiplayer games right
so he has I don't know if you guys have
you use a slither iö slither at the IRA
so this is a super popular game that's
out there where you come in it's a web
game started as a web game and then now
it has actually become a game that a lot
of people use through iPhone or you know
Android whatever so it's a multiplayer
game and they got thousands and
thousands of people on it right so my
friend was telling me that one of the
best ways to use something like elixir
is for situations like this where you
need to have a whole bunch of users you
know fucking currency and you know whoa
websocket oh sorry I'm trying to play
this but the whole point is doesn't
matter right okay so what he was telling
me is the way how he uses is for his
video games right so he creates games on
html5 uses face at the i/o and he uses
Phoenix elixir Phoenix as the backend
for and I took the way how he uses it
and he has thousands and thousands of
users at the same time playing the same
game and it doesn't crash is great for
concurrency guys now this is something
that is not the use let's not let's not
say it's not useful this is useful but
not useful for everybody right it's for
special situations special situations
like let's say you have a chat room
let's say you have something like
YouTube's live stats there they're super
chat so let's say twitch or like let's
say something like Netflix where you
have thousands of people watching a
video or a movie I think it would be
great oh you know something like a lick
sir alright and it's pretty fast now
what I did was I basically say okay I'm
gonna give this a try and I actually
bought you know the complete elixir
Phoenix land boot camp from you know
your boy Stephen Breyer I don't even
know this this one I never noticed that
he already had created a course for this
and you know me
I bought all the courses that Stephen
Grider God I've tried all of them I've
done the react native I've done react
and redux I've done the es6 I've done
the Mongo
I've done dumb what's the other one
um and meteor I've done so many courses
from him that pretty much I say you know
what if he's messing with it then it
means something it means that it's a
legit language is a legit framework and
it's worth checking it out right so
after that I took my time so I actually
go through this whole course I built a
blog I created a blog with tags I
created a blog with a chatroom and I
realized is not that bad
the syntax I'm not a huge fan
right I'll be honest I don't have to lie
to you guys I'm not a huge fan of the
same things you know but at the same
time for what is four and it's a great
way to have an introduction to
functional programming I think this is
the best course out there all right a
lot of people is going to be like oh man
oh you know we still trying to learn PHP
we're still trying to learn nodejs
that's fine guys you know sometimes
these videos that I release are not
meant for everybody that's a beginner
it's also meant for people who are
intermediate or a little bit more
advanced right because a reality if
you're a beginner um the complete
lecture Phoenix boot camp is great for
somebody that's intermediate or somebody
will understand what programming is at
least right a lot of you guys are
complete beginners you don't even know
what a variable is right so that's why
you have the the nodejs boot camp and
you know you have all the PHP courses
that are half of my description but this
right here there's a sample special this
is something cool because like the other
day I was actually feeling like stagnant
I was feeling a little boy with web
development and that's why I've been
using a lot of crystal Lang because it
basically pushes me to become uh you
know more of a critical thinker in
creating something that nobody else has
created right now with a lick sir since
this functional programming is not
object oriented it's pretty much like
starting from zero like yes I know what
variables are I know what loops are but
at the same time there's so many
concepts are brand new to me with this
long programming language in this
framework that is actually exciting it
has me excited I'm like oh shoot cool
it's like I'm a new right I created that
video you know a few months ago what in
reality was a pretty much hegemony and
the reason why was he any money
it was because to my knowledge there's
not that many jobs for elixir feeling
sorry because it's one of those
languages and one of those frameworks
that it's only for certain you know how
many people you know how many websites
need to have a thousand users connected
at the same time in a multi-page or you
know thousand users on the same chatroom
not that many right
so for me that's why I don't know and
this is worth studying this is now worth
especially because sometimes you see
things on the internet where everybody
starts jumping on the bandwagon like
everybody jump on the lecture I don't
jump on nobody you know that way I take
my time I gotta find a use case of like
for me to actually use it for me to
actually take my time and learn this
thing cuz I have limited time right it's
only 24 hours in a day and sometimes for
me I gotta have 25 right so why would
you wanna you know why would you want to
learn to stay well if you want to
basically like push yourself right and
you want to say hey I want to learn
something new I want to learn something
edgy write something cool something
that's very powerful I would say learn
this course length I actually put it in
on the channels so if you come to the
channels on Kona face comm slash
channels is there elixir you click on it
actually put in the link to it and then
from there you're going to have the
course now this is like a semi review
semi personal opinion on it so meat is
the best it looks of course because the
last time I try to learn elixir I was
like man the person who was explaining
it to me and teaching it online I was
like man this looked like shit
this looks horrible the same Texas ugly
arm there's really not that many jobs I
don't know what this is useful
um that's it right but now coming back
months later and you know seeing how one
of my friends uses it I realize I'm like
yo this one is very powerful this thing
is pretty cool
you know pleasant the fact that it's
functional programming which is a brand
new paradigm is good it's a good way to
push myself to go to the next level
right sometimes you know as a developer
that one of the best things is that we
always learning always keep on learning
and we're like you know once we feel
stagnant or something we got to learn
something else because if not it gets
boring so for you guys that are looking
to learn something new in you're looking
to step it up this year or even for
beginners you know if you're beginner
it's fine you could take this course
it's not like you not gonna learn
anything you're gonna learn a lot of the
web there's a lot of things in the web
like WebSockets you know things from
Ajax not like freaking requests you know
JSON you know like a lot of stuff that a
lot of courses don't go over and they
don't explain to you why they're
important and how do they work in HTTP
protocols like they don't explain those
things but seafood right it breaks it
down you know he explains those things
in easy way the money waiter you know
the blue cheese way so I would
definitely advise anybody that wants to
learn and mixer or also push themselves
this year to know take it to the next
level because some of us yeah I really
want to become engineers see I just
don't want to become a developer meaning
just a web developer what developer is
just some guy that comes in does HTML
CSS and JavaScript that's all he can do
now for you guys for the longevity of
your career you want to become an
engineer
meaning you want to be able to pick up
any language that's out there any
paradigm any database and be able to be
dangerous way so there's a gray
introduction to that so I will say guys
check it out it's going to be in the
description I'm going to put the link in
the description to this course is going
to bring you to this page you know the
moment you click here is going to take
you to the course alright check it out
alright guys I'll see you guys later
Matt um it's the complete course by
Steve Ryder one of the best instructors
on udemy and trust me guys
she's demand all right guys I'll see you
guys later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
