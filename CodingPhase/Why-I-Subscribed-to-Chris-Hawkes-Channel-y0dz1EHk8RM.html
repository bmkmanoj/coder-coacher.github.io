back at it again man khodam face calm
listen your boy is back I'm out here man
I'm gonna fire it on YouTube right now
right you better lift me up boy bout to
blow up oh yeah listen guys I made a
video a few months ago when i first
started when i was just literally custom
people weird and i'm in a video about
why i unsubscribe from you know chris
hall and this really is actually going
to be about why i actually went back and
subscribed back for chris hole and I
have nothing against a guy I feel some
type of way after my boy cyber sound
asking a question I hate Chris holes
made a video about the same topic that
you did and I'm like bro I haven't
bitten it freakin channel like three
weeks or something like that so how can
I even you know I feel like he was
shocked said I got copied a or something
that was like bro I having a business
channel and god knows how long and there
is the reason why one because you don't
collaborate with other developers and
also true because he just sounded super
cocky like hey like I've been here for
four years hey this guy's is you know
they just started so doing and
that's awful maybe probably does not
help me set it but a lot of people
actually feel the same way you know and
after that video i wish i could find the
video that you said no but then that he
said but I'm girl Uncas missile launched
months ago and yeah my like I was just
like whatever man like that guy
right I don't even know him like that
but you know I know the division was
actually going to blow up like that you
know and I just delete it you know and I
don't care you know in this sense was
like you know have some people that I
here on YouTube tight oh there's like
one of my top videos there I'm gonna
keep it because they bring it in views
right bro I don't want negativity in my
channel I want top activity because I'm
here to just you know showing up to the
world and show love to the viewer is in
you know whatever bullsh am I feel like
about other developers
other you know youtubers it's like it
doesn't really matter you know what i
mean is so but yeah but crystal sent me
a message and he was like you know super
cool and he actually saw the video when
i talk about my sister passing away and
you know he's going through such a
similar and it's crazy because one of
the reasons why i subscribe to him was
when i first started doing this because
I was like you know what I I've always
felt like I was training with most
developers in the sense of like a lot of
developers are are weird another in my
head i think they weird the freaking
dollars they don't freakin dinner social
you know what i mean like and that's not
me you know i'm super cool super funny
super like positive right and a lot of
time but I don't get that for a lot of
developers they like super like enter to
themselves and should I down like super
dark and I'm like ah you know what I'm
feeling like I'm out here like what I'm
sure without a shred said you know what
i mean so is like i'm super like height
all the time and yeah so one of the
reasons why subscribe to his channel at
first was because his channel just seem
like a cool dude just like super cool
and as a fan I really like that because
I was like damn and I do guys just a
regular guy just like me who somehow
it's doing the development and it's just
like me curses on his video a little bit
does the same at me it's into music
and you know like he is so that you
don't use his sister going through some
stuff tool and you know that you
know hit the heart cuz I'm like that man
like he just brought me back to you know
to my sister and everything and you know
I hope that nothing happens to this is
very you know his family I hope that you
know he's good and yeah man we just want
to stay positive man so like also to
like I kind of misses his channel and
like I went on his channel for a little
bit and I he's talking about roll up and
Oliver own
he's talking about a world like I was
just about to make a video about that
but you know probably not because he
already made it but um yeah that role it
is legit if you don't know about all up
to watch this video I'm gonna put it
below on a link somewhere well yeah man

positive out here man you know it's like
