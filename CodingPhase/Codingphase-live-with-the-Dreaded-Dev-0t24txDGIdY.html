everybody in you know what I mean in a
scumbag yeah we go around listen man so
yes so what we were saying before for
those of you guys that I missed a lot of
most of you guys didn't even get to hear
anything so yeah basically the dreaded
death was telling me that he's from
Florida he basically came in he has a
year in in this field how long did it
take you to become a developer um say
like I learned how to code and I mean
that loosely like when I say I learned
how to code I mean that loosely two
months and I would say by my third month
I had a job already so like I literally
applied everywhere on indeed even the
jobs that were like you need 10 years of
experience like I took I don't like 700
jobs in like two three days and like
even some of those jobs were calling me
back like the ones that like yo you have
five years of experience I was like nope
but like can you interview me anyway so
I can like right now some notes for the
next one so I was bombing interviews on
purpose for the sake of having the
experience to go to the next one you
know I was taking notes the whole time
man and I helped a lot yeah no that's
fine that's how people the time was like
when you you want a job you have to
actually go in there and actually just
say hey I'm gonna apply to every single
job that's out there I'm not gonna be
scared you know is that you can't be
scared you cannot be over here like oh
my god I'm rebooting I'm just gonna
apply to the big companies it's like now
you apply to everything everything
everything I first job was like a small
agency like I'm talking about like you
had a map you couldn't even see him in
it and I mean obviously then what
business right there weren't anything
big they were in business for years
before I even applied so yeah man and
you know what I took it man cuz you know
what sure I could have waited an extra
week or so to get like the job I really
wanted but man I like I said I didn't
have I was homeless I needed money ASAP
so I took that Jonathan we
here yeah man that that's why I was
sending people to is like man look my
first job I was getting like 13 bucks an
hour bro like in that was cuz I I went
in there I was like yo it was even like
no agency wasn't like no what do it was
like straight up a company that needed
somebody that know a little bit of HTML
CSS to edit products that's it right but
nothing fancy but it was just like hey
it's the first time going in there I'm
self-taught
yeah I had a little degree from you know
administrative systems and like
that but it wasn't
programming it wasn't like computer
science and I have no background when
Rachel they came in they they basically
took me in and literally in three months
I said piece you know I was your side of
it bro you know sometimes you you you
take these jobs in you think is like
you're gonna be there forever it's like
nah man you a developer man you a rock
star out here you know what I mean that
people want you you got the skills and I
want you right now like I keep getting
recruited from like other places and
stuff and like they the job I'm at now
they found me through LinkedIn so like
they gate they gave me a chance man so
like it's not it's one of those things
where I have loyalty to them bro but I
have jobs that are like I'm willing to
pay like relocation fees and all this
 I was like oh man what do I do
they're offering like 10 15 thousand
more a year like yeah Nicholas but you
know what ask developers like I don't
think I've known any anybody that's been
on a job for like two three years we
usually like bounce around from job to
job and I know that sounds weird but
it's a good thing in our case you know
what I mean because we learn more and
this is usually you get more money
it's good yeah every time that you jump
to a new company you know companies want
you because the more that you know the
less that they gotta train you the less
that they gotta you know be on top of
you they just say okay we need an extra
hand and that extra hand is here he
knows what to do he knows what his job
is
we gave him a task and he can build it
when you developer and you just start at
the beginning you can't really ask for
too much because you know damn well you
need somebody to guide you you need
somebody to be the head of the you know
of the development team if you're not
you can't go in there by yo everybody
give me one hundred twenty thousand if
now I ain't working here you can't go
you can show her your balls like that
like so quickly walk away I'm gonna hire
somebody else cheaper you - exactly
exactly somebody some dude is just like
it's like man listen it's a blessing to
be here so soon as that do comes in your
job is gone you know the world words
exactly and it's crazy but yeah so what
I was asking you before to was I mean
you planning on getting was that you
wanted to get into now you say you
wanted to get into more like artificial
intelligence yeah like machine learning
data science just kind of get into more
things like that cuz I would love to
work at NASA one day are like some word
big like this and walk in the hell is
this guy wait about that I don't did
that long or like I had to have like a
nice I newscaster haircut I had a shave
out of wear a suit every day from that
job I grew these things and like
I got a beard like that was that here
I'm pretty is that that's like a uniform
you feel me that that's literally a
uniform of life conformity and like just
being real like not uptight but like
that's not my personality yeah it's like
beep you of your originality your
personality you're just a code monkey
you go in you know those guys that you
see like you know those companies you
know a lot of times is usually like
dotnet like try to stay away from dotnet
if you don't want to be in that type of
environment stay away from that name
because most of the time those guys are
like super uptight those guys is always
like you know some poor guy is the head
of the department has been there since
1972 and it's like you gotta put on
three three little you know you put your
ID and you gotta put on your your 3d
ends right here and put your little pen
down and you know a little slack you
know they they give you a casual Fridays

my man
as though Friday's is like a polo who's
like what and don't wear a belt it's
like oh cool and we're casual today yeah

that's like a perk some companies like
oh yeah we have casual Fridays here and
it's like brown like you need to stop it

like we had a little fridge

bunch of Red Bulls and like a whole
bunch of monsters and died I never

you exactly is like hell k coolers like

mommy don't let that little a that and
your girls like what I'm happy that you
and in the game now you out here you in
YouTube you into the world this is like
you know it also brings in that you know
that extra flavor extra sauce out here
you know I'm out here you know saucony
now you got you you know your
notification was a the code gang you got
called a whole lot of coach wait you
forgot it we just got a stew going on
you got your stuff going and we're just
making a big ass soup and word all you
guys are gonna eat it and it's gonna be
real yummy this is doing a mofongo out
here on YouTube in like yeah you home
that's was like I'm home now is like
yeah
I was telling people as a young
sometimes you know is a coding channel
man but at the same you got a you got a
have fun with it you can't be out here
like a robot you can't just be doing
tutorial I mean that's that that's the
best way to get your channel to go
stagnant as you see when vlogs everyday
doing tutorials look you got a spice set
up my dude like I see that like that and
the ones that do those are your loyal
fans but you're gonna stop at like 5k
and that's where you're gonna stay yeah
that's it
that's cool if you want to stay there
that's lame bro me and you we going up
going listen I'm telling people man I
was watching who I was watching today
traversing media right reversing media
there's one thing that I tell people
look if you're trying to come into the
game into YouTube and you think like hey
man you're gonna dethrone traversée
media with YouTube is not gonna happen
kids know if you think it if you think
you're gonna come in here with tutorials
and you think I was like that's all
you're gonna be doing out here you it's
not gonna pop for you like most YouTube
like YouTube already chose perverse
media he's like the new boss when the
new Boston came in like no matter who
dropped it or tutorial
you're not going above him find you so
you gotta come in here to make yourself
be found you gotta come in here and
create original content and just share
your personality and if you want to talk
about coke cool talk about code if you
want to mix it up do a little bit look
how Christian does it he talks a little
bit about cold yeah a lot does his
livestream does this is Ariel oh you
know his drone shot is wrong you know
you know that's the whole cinematic
scene like can't be mad at that you know
what I mean like he'd be coming in here
do something totally original
right that's one thing that I like you
know I was like the who else are the
real tough candy are real casted arrow
ah who is just a couple of people here
who I feel like after I came out
everybody is like coming in and like
really just showing their personalities
and just like it's different flavors now
on YouTube and not just the same
tutorials like nobody wants to see that
this is you know look I ever like my
whole thing is inspiring to people to
code because if you want to learn to
code you got a broad privacy to go to
you fill me in it come in here like
trying to start tutorials bro like that
guy has so mom that guy is YouTube that
God will send YouTube after you yeah the
privacy your traversée however you say
it dude thank you yes but it's like you
gotta come in and use it just be
yourself you swag it out
you gotta come in here with your own
sauce bro that's all you have to do man
you come in here with your own stuff and
that is what it is
you know how yeah you know I was gonna
say oh yeah so I wanted to give you some
pointers man cuz right now right now you
HOT and is appointed to everybody on
YouTube everybody who's trying to come
in into YouTube so YouTube works like
this your first two or three months you
go they give you all the views because
you're brand new so you know you're
brainy Channel they give you attention
but you gotta be very careful because
the moment that you do like one little
thing that they don't like they'll pull
they're looking usages drops now I tell
you what ah to experience cuz that
happened to me right sure the content
that you have right now try to keep it
like that and your channels gonna grow
steadily
when I came in here I was like yo I came
in I had my the content that I'm doing
right now but then I started doing just
kumbaya I started you know bringing
in a whole bunch of other youtubers or
people started taking my sauce people
started doing everything that I was
doing so then my channel started
dropping and I had stuff like my
personal life where I was like I was
tight with my job I was like yo just
talking about my job talking about
different topics that wasn't really what
was my channel originally what there was
so then you two will just pull the plug
so you gotta be careful and also - you
gotta be careful when you make a video
who now really pissed off too many
people because that's a of banning and
the leading videos it can really mess up
your channel Wow Wow it has the momentum
like once here already you're already in
the game you like a hundred thousand
deep like you do whatever the hell you
want they care but you know if one you
know like right now you drop a video
videos will get like two thousand two
thousand views or five thousand views
right the moment they say okay cool
we're not gonna notify the notification
it's a rat you know what I mean so it'll
drop so it's like you gotta be careful
with that so that's my my only point
that's why I'm growing my Instagram too
though cuz like I got that on block like
the whole Instagram thing like I've been
playing around with Instagram for like
year so I kind of like know how to grow
one real big so like if it ever came
down to that like you know what I mean
like I hear you on that that video that
I dropped bro it wasn't even enough for
like 24 hours they got a shitload
abusing me
I'm video had like 600 comments like 3
hours it was everybody arguing and
bitching with each other and I do I was
and I was mad as hell when I made that
video brush him - made that when I was
upset I was snapping but you know what
I said what I had to say YouTube they
like it a whole bunch of people I didn't
like it when I was like we got it
we good you're right but I appreciate
the foreigners bro you've been in here
for a while man you know I listen I'll
try to save you the headache because
it's like the worst thing is like I
appreciate it I'm already oh I'm on a
bad list I'm gonna balance with like
nobody gets my notifications like it's
rare people get a notification like I
have like how many subscribers I don't
even know how much like 15,000 mean
you're almost at 20k and 15,000 right so
out of those 15,000 almost nobody gets
the notification is rare oh it's like
right now you on a good roll so try to
keep it like that your content just be
careful with it just to not piss them
off because if they pull that plug is
gonna be a headache and definitely build
up your your your your social media
that's why I started
my main website that's one of the
reasons - because at least I have
everybody's email where I could say okay
when I'm about to drop something I send
the email out or if I have like a
important live stream I sent that email
out so it's a more direct connection
with my my subscribers instead of
leaving it to YouTube algorithm
if they decide mug is not gonna hurt me
know so yeah definitely not so I always
let Instagram know where I'm gonna be at
first because you know I got five like
fifty five hundred there so like you
know I know at least like two like two
thousand of those people I know will
always tune in for sure okay for some
reason does someone or notify anybody
because I get that a lot like hey
YouTube didn't notify me of this YouTube
thing all right cool check me out on
Instagram cuz that's where a
instagramming gonna shut me down and if
they do that I'll start my
Instagram if it ever came down to that
so yeah definitely man if we can um so
as far as like you - I mean who do you
watch out here like other youtubers are
or like even udemy courses or like
people that use watch so for sure so
I've been watching you for years but
I've been watching you when you were

literally like working right now while
I'm on this so it's cool it's cool I
love working from home man that's the
best 2017 man so yeah
you work at home huh Accio work later
you see it man this is it I got this is
we nah we work from home bro and I got
an office that I can go to but it's in
downtown so I'd rather just saved a
20-minute Drive you just chill out
lucky you bro it's so hard everybody so
pull that look that's like damn near
impossible for a new developer like I
had to like jump through some hoops to
get to that you know sometimes you know
I always tell people to like you know
you might see somebody get something
that doesn't mean that you're going to
get it you know somebody might be like
hey man hey you know somebody hit me up
is like you I live in you know I forgot
that the country it was somewhere in
Africa it's like y'all live in Zimbabwe
right so the dude is like you're living
Zimbabwe how how do I stay motivated to
even do anything when I know that this
people win in America getting a hundred
thousand dollars like that's millions of
whatever his currency and I was like yo
bro
like stop worrying about what's going on
in other places what's happening to
other people like you know you got a if
you love this thing and you you you got
a job be grateful you you're able to pay
your rent survive you able to make your
money you know I was like whatever I'll
make here New York is not the same thing
that somebody's gonna make absolutely
order or in San Francisco's like
everybody has different prices and it's
all according to or the way of course of
living right so yeah
worrying about what other people is
doing you know what I mean like just a
focus you're gonna be good at the long
and even at that if you feel like you
could get you could get more money than
plan yourself out and say okay I'm gonna
become a professional in this and become
somebody who's well known here in my
country and then from there I'm gonna
apply so go to the US or go to somewhere
here and get a visa you know what I mean
it you gotta be smart
it doesn't matter if you live under a
whole you know what I mean like you
still could commodity you know know that
that's real like I get paid what a
junior developer makes in California and
I live in Florida so like total is
ridiculous because the cost of living
over there it's a 1.2 million dollar
houses like I need 50 K here's weird you
know what I'm saying cuz that's not
adjusted and you know it could happen
but you can live in Africa and get paid
with somebody in like New York you're
really good at what you do and then
that's when you can start making the man
that's when you can start like showing
your balls and be like I need 150 K you
know what I'm saying but people are sort
of look at the are a cool I'll just hire
the guy that'll do it for 20k yeah
exactly yeah in the UK you're looking
about in dollars for star in genie death
roll you looking about $35,000 Oh -
Stein that's your starting role in the
UK this is this is the north as well so
that's why that's why I lived in Norway
for like a few years I was a dead there
cuz Norway - just the moon making it's
like when I was having similar countries
in the world bought the salia matches so
in the UK in the UK you
I know another girl told me this - she
sent me an email about this Tiffany
basically her name is the Jones here on
YouTube she was telling me that in the
UK is like 20 pounds 20,000 pounds or
something like that 20,000 pounds that
yet you're making as a junior developer
Steinar maybe 25,000 it's kind of you
star in journey from end well yeah
that's crazy
I mean well how's the cost of living I
mean do you still is it crazy like hero
is like so you talking I'm trying to
adjust five dollars so you're probably
looking at an apartment in the city
you're probably looking about a thousand
dollars of all your bills and stuff
included oh that's cheap so you make
you're making making double you making
double what you you earn so you you rent
is 50 percent of your salary yeah I mean
that's how it is that you know it's like
you live in New York and it's like
automatically half of your whatever
you're making is almost your whole rain
especially if you want to be like you
know a hipster and you're like oh I want
to live in Williamsburg and I want to
live right next to to Manhattan you know
it's like I wanna live in city you know
I mean is like you go in there you
you're gonna end up paying twenty four
hundred dollars per month and even at
that right you might be coming in after
taxes maybe you were like six thousand
dollars you gotta add how much it costs
to buy food and then you want to be you
know want to be super hipstery and be
like I'm gonna go to Whole Foods and
then you go to Whole Foods and Whole
Foods is like $1,000 per month on food
so next thing you know you you spending
your whole check so that's what
sometimes I'll be laughing sometimes you
know some dude I was like talking to
some dude at home I guess he thought he
was like starting on me and he was like
y'all is oh yeah I work our Facebook and
this is now I'm less bro how much you
paying for it and they you know two
thousand eight hundred dollars on my own
cake I'm picking half of that you know I
mean I'm making more money than you that
you get on Facebook
plus I have my side business plus I have
my youtube plus I have a whole bunch of
 and hope a lot of coke you
know what I do is like you're talking to
me about like you know like you're
making almost nothing when you're living
in San Francisco you know what I mean
like my whole goal is to even I live
right now in Connecticut so what I'm
paying I'm paying half of what I was
paying in New York my goal is to move to
Arizona mark my whole thing is I come
closer to me huh I'll try to move it
give me $1,000 for a house it was like
listening Arizona
over there with we like $800 man you
like everything off me you know what I
mean listen I'm trying to downsize mana
look my whole goal is to just be all
over the world man but the only way that
you're gonna do it is to downsize all
right you know the craziest thing that
I've done is just okay I got my car
whatever but from that that's like the
last thing that I'm like spending a lot
of money on everything else that's a
dope-ass car though
I'm downsizing everything you know I'm
downsizing everything because I want to
be mobile I want to be able to say oh if
I want to go to you know Thailand I
could return if I want to go to Paris I
could go to Paris whenever whenever you
you have like you know you're
financially free and you're not tied
down to anything you're good you know
you actually better than everybody else
was out here was like oh I'm making 300k
a year but all your expenses are
$280,000 you know it was like that's why
Paris is an absolutely shithole don't go
yeah montec thing going on boys like get
some of those reefers you'll be fine I
don't know I mean I don't know you know
for me it's just my whole plan is just
downsizing on every demand there was
this guy I wish I would have remember
his name this just developer from San
Francisco I forgot his name I'm gonna
try to find out for you guys in the near
future but basically this guy him and
his wife were both engineers right and
they worked in San Francisco for about
ten years they work hard to saved all
their money by the time they were 32
they retired so they may all the money
that they need it they paid off their
house they they got everything that they
they they ever gonna need they got the
housing
and then they have you know smart
investments where you say okay if I have
$300,000 I could put this into certain
investments where you're gonna come in
and get paid you know $2,000 a month for
$3,000 a month and that's it you live
for you know I mean like with to $2,500
you moved to any country in the world
you live like a king no matter what you
gotta say so sometimes you got to have
those time caviar that's actually one of
the things that are that I'm awfully
impressed even with Trinidad when we
were talking a while ago I want things
he said is that with his check he um I'm
not gonna say cuz I wasn't an interview
by didn't upload here but um he saved a
lot he barely spends any of us check and
that's a mistake I made because I went
from making like nothing to where I am
now and well I I spent all that money
and you seem so I don't regret it now I
could be okay but I mean like I just
seem like what he did when he when I
spoke to him impressed me a lot and
shows me how much control he has in the
he knows he's going that's why I really
see this guy's gonna blow up evenly as
smoke nervous knows right now while I
talk the killer don't spend all that
money man you have to be wise you have
to be wise yeah that's true I went half
my life most of my life not spending
money and also not even making enough
money whether I can save money is like
oh my god man it's a got some serious
about it gets addicting man you check
your bank you get paid every week so
it's like oh my god is getting higher
[Laughter]
when you jump from like just from
nothing it's like having all that out of
nowhere not even you to YouTube not in
my Philly oh my gosh that's crazy it's
just like there's so much freedom and
that's something that you that's what
you want no matter doesn't matter who's
the president right now man it's what
you do with your own life that's that's
what's important you know what I mean
bro yeah man so we got company new
people's in here we got Rob Rob say what
up where you from Rob from pretty much
on my hour out of LA so like a river
Oh what well part wait what's the town's
anymore the town was the heart

ain't even smoking
where you from treat I'm half Scottish
and half Australian a about people's
yeah so um let me see who else we got
here we got Karl Karl oh oh we gotta go
you you're no longer special guests you
good remember remember your coding phase
you know that me whenever I'm not here
people told me is that yo you look so
much like me they actually you should
just come and replace me
that's my substitute you know I saw Tom
Cruise doing his a doing his uh his own
stunts no I haven't seen it oh man you
gotta be checking that out I think it
was Rappaport they posted it up but
leave it up to Joe though to get the
dreaded dev and Chris Shawn and burns
chord all the film all of the ones film
what Hector man we finally get to hear
each other that's that's why we here man
this walk orders you know dropping jams
with coding face you know what I mean we
we ain't here we dropping gems just this
regular conversations you know just
talking you know and just let ideas flow
and let let conversation flow you know I
mean whoever wants to talk about
something go ahead start it up hey Joe I
get help with the starter kit actually
cuz I'm stuck and I want to get back to
the project
who was wrong with it for the Pokemon
game you have us run yarn which works
and installs just fine
but when I run yarn watch to start up
the server it doesn't work it just so
just do on screen and NPM do NPM run
watch yeah I try them I'm p.m. - didn't
work and it's the same starter kit yes
and your email about the screenshots all
you need to get out have phones boy
somebody got the but the laptop on mute
man you scroll over the screen you see
em you thing alright so um basically I
don't know you gotta send me the
pictures you I mean I wouldn't be able
to help you out right now
you gotta send me a picture of like the
errors that you're getting to my email
you know send you a more detailed one
but is it absolutely necessary for the
Pokemon battle game I mean you don't
have to you could literally do it on
like rebel that ite or or anywhere you
know so it's just basically yeah it's
just automatic refresh is everything is
just regular JavaScript there's now you
I don't even think this es6 on it so you
could do that with JavaScript I'm gonna
do that cuz I stuck with the terminal
and I'm scared I'm doing a like computer
the you the terminal course I was Jenna
I'm not sure I think I think there was
just a slight update maybe on that
WebKit that that Joe has if you're
running if you're running a
p.m. run watch I think I think the new
commands in there from an update I think
it's just MPM start and tried that I
mean do you download it you using a
starter kit from before like then you
try downloading the new one new starter
kit ok so I mean right now we wouldn't
be able to debug it anyways yeah I'm
trying to MPN start check your NPM check
you into the light dispersion as well
yeah yeah cuz that uh that command Joe I
mean basically that's predetermined by
you right I mean gone like you basically
say what you want to we want to type in
yeah yeah exactly like I mean people
could even change it you know it doesn't
have to be a member and watch it could
be and began Joe you know whatever so
but yeah man any other topics anything
you guys want to talk about or any
questions for the dreaded dev special
Richards I think I would have to commit
to the us that I think and then when you
say disrespectful it just sounds
better way with insults so listen man
there's no video there's a video that's
just hilarious to Indian doing in London
fighting each other right and the guy is
like one guy was selling the other guy
like hurry up and move and then the
other guys in the car he's like don't
tell me to move but it's the most
hilarious thing cuz the guy goes like
bloody bloody
you've bloody bloody he is
buggin out man you never seen something
like they both it's so funny cuz it's
like they both can't understand each
other but all you hear is bloody bloody
and it's like
Larry's right now what yeah man yeah I
definitely gotta check that out you know
go to worldstar you might see a couple
of cool stuff that's where is late you
know what I mean yeah man any other
topic let me see what's going on in the
chatroom man
seems like nobody here nobody here has
anything started up I mean you guys have
any questions for dreaded hey I got a
question for you Joe
eighty go ahead question future what are
you gonna eat what are you gonna name
your second child man
oh no hopefully you get a name her Chris
Zoey I'm joking he was like people
holding me accountable for that like now
I got enough and now I got a knock up
wifey up now it's like hey man Joe is
fake you know how people be on YouTube
like Joe is fake Joe is mine you was
never gonna have okay I subscribed you
know oh I got a question for the dreaded
dev hey yo so YouTube tell you how many
people flag that video that they make
you take now no didn't tell me anything
they sent me literally their damn
privacy in terms and then they sent me a
link to their to their uh what is that
 called the copyrights though I had
a look into it and like you know how
YouTube is they're not really gonna tell
you like why they do right so like I had
a look into it like the first thing that
came up was like if enough people flag
it in a short amount of time
YouTube's gonna suspend the video
whatever that means I guess those shows
up my thing but when you click on it
says remove so I'll say man and you were
say you were saying you were talking
nothing but positive things about women
like what do you think they're really
what you guys know me though like I snap
on all my videos and sometimes I better
me but it is what it is and honestly it
was I'm pretty sure it was just a title
cuz like I had a lot
Nell's on Instagram that I follow be
like hey what the hell is up with that I
just
notification I had to be like can you
please just watch it I promise you're
gonna love it
hey bro let's see I got like four or
five hundred comments within the three
hours it got a bunch of lights maybe
three dislikes but everybody was arguing
in the comments it was women arguing
with men men arguing with women really
should I do
and yeah probably probably a lot of
people with Paul today so it probably
was muted that pulled it down so ya know
I'm pretty sure a lot of people
supported it I didn't really think about
the fact that it was actually going to
be international women day later it's
not like I thought you did it because of
women's oh perfect timing
honestly man I was about to turn off the
comments on that video after a while so
like I'm almost kind of like I said what
I had to say that people that watch the
ones they obviously a piss people off
mission accomplished
now do you read all the comments because
yeah I've started to I mean I know in
the beginning is a yoga you want to read
every coming now I'm starting to like
y'all I don't even want to read comments
like I spent like an hour and a half
doing that every day and like you know
for me that's why I was like in the
beginning of y'all every day I will be
like getting upset cuz it's like
there'll be a hundred videos that a
hundred comments that people will leave
like good stuff and they'll be like one
dude that just be like yo who the hell
is this like this dude talking like
you don't even know me Madhu so you
would make a video about and say yeah
and now put him on blast and then was
funny to me was it'll be a couple of
times people show retarded sounds like
make sure you got your hair for hand
you know Priam eutteum sorry sorry tree
cuz you got to put on your headphones
man cuz if now then it doubles up yeah
but yeah so people be being here you
know dropping like the crazy is crazy is
like comments or even like with this
other do philippe man they just do was
like his life was around there about
like yo man how can i how can i make
this kid man
today he's like we having like the most
beautiful livestream I hope you'll drop
like the dumbest comment ever on there
and I'm like yo bro like why you do this
every day like if you don't like the
channel move on you know what I mean
this is a great right now you know you
you bubbling up it's the beginning you
know just my advice to is like yo if
once you start getting upset just like
don't even look at the comments man this
is what I mean there's gonna be a point
where it's gonna be so many comments
every single day that when you read all
of them but all yeah cool god 70 good
comments and then there's gonna be three
comments that's gonna be like yo f you f
your mom if you're right here if your
your everything you know what I mean so
it's like that's not worth I've been
lucky in the fact that like most if not
all of them are actually really positive
comment I don't think I've ever had
anything that like kind of what's a good
dish other than like that one video
where everybody thought I was
naked I wasn't everybody thought up a
neo that was really literally just
wearing pink shorts and they kind of
match my skin he was he was they kid
hears naked he's not there but it's okay
hey I mean I somebody that was watching
Joe all the time like let's say I think
it was about maybe like a month two
months ago right Joe and that's best
when this guy you know these infamous
people and that's the crazy thing they
became infamous and famous Joe because I
would hop on right and I'd be like all
right let me check out Joe he's gonna be
talking about some
now I hop on Jose like man who is this
guy he's talking all this mess like he
knows me Bob and I'm like yeah the
problem is like this look this is a big
difference about like there's a lot of
people that come on YouTube just like
how can I say is like they just they
they don't say nothing no matter what
right because all they hear like
whatever for the money in for whatever
right when I came in here I came in here
like y'all I'm gonna come in here I feel
like I've been like the Jesus Christ of
this whole I came in here people
shut me down people talk so much
about me I'm you know I'm the Rosa Parks
of YouTube
I can't make I said we're not talking
like robots you know what I mean so I
came in here and pretty much the amount
of hate that I got was kind of
ridiculous and there from there there's
a lot of people that just like oh man we
know how to push his button cuz he reads
all the comments but not anymore kid
like you want to get in contact with me
me email me
you know what I mean like like eight
eight ain't no trolls on the email you
know what I mean like I ain't got time
for it you know I mean so that's how it
is but now I'm like yo yeah I've noticed
it and I think it's dope you know I mean
I saw the gradual progression that's how
you get super angry at these guys and
then yeah now you definitely see a calm
job you know it's gonna see anger Joe
though I would want to get your bad side
using the first time Joe saw me Joe just
saw me the first time he said man who
just I think he is looking like me right
now boy a real man I mean I love you too
Bob to be honest like this my holiday or
the day like I do a lot of stuff
throughout the day you know but I love
when I come in here and hang out with
everybody and that's the thing is like I
come here for the love you know what I
mean like I don't make no money from
YouTube like this doesn't even pay my
bills if I also leave from here
I probably to be honest I probably would
be better like my you know I could have
other things to do you know but I love
the people so much it's like I love
seeing burning here I love seeing you
know uh the Ramsay you know I got
Barbara there's so many people like that
always here at JCCC Rodri like people
like soon as you drop a video they dare
you know what I mean like that's like
your day once you know what I mean so
it's like I feel like even if when I
don't drop a video in a day after you
BAM I let people down does that even
drop a video you know I mean but that's
cuz that's just how I am but people are
you know on the internet period it
doesn't matter who it is they people
just live for that they were like yo I
ain't got nothing in my house people got
an island a fridge and they're like man
this dude is he good let's mess with it
you know what I mean
people was out here trying to get jobs
and it's like I'm throwing away jobs I
don't even care about jobs why this
guy's good why people want this guy you
know what I mean it's like the hey be
real so I was like I'm the same person I
react to it
you know I I don't know I come from the
streets man that's the easiest way to
put it it's like if you say Sara bomb me
i'ma come to you and press you now
that's the truth
you know what I mean even if it's on the
internet you know if I bump into
somebody that I know is I yo
it'll be like one of those situations
where this see like damn good guy slap
the shadows do some do for some Facebook
post thing I end up on the doors like
that free Joe man frico free calling
face you know you know but that's just
how I am man but now we good we gucci
now let me see hold on treat you back
you got your your headphones let me see
let me on mute I'll mute you real quick
let's see now you got a-you got I'll
mute yourself now - yeah yeah you get
hey y'all I got a handle you nobody
knows the real you know dreaded they're
already know Chris I don't know if you
can hear me but like what's too
way to retain I'm gonna unmute this
after I finished so that it's something
is anything but it was fun you have
headphones you're good yeah here
you'll hear you hear yeah do that or
that
okay yeah like to retain information cuz
I find out I'm going through like
Codecademy sorry no no free code camp
and treehouse and I learned things and
then like when it comes to actually
applying them to outside of the context
of the tutorial I just kind of go blank
and I don't know it's like it's really
hard to even remember the things that
were covered and I guess what's a good
way to I don't know get over that well
what I will say is first of all you
gotta take things in two steps right you
gotta take things in two steps
I don't know exactly where or whatever
you are right if you're on HTML CSS the
first thing that you gotta remember is
how to break down a layout right you got
a first look at let's say a design you
break it down you say okay first of all
every page has an HTML tag as a head tag
has a body tag right and there you want
to put in your header you want to put in
your content area then you want to put
in your footer right so as far as HTML
CSS that's how I learned things I
basically I basically started doing
things in order I never moved down below
the header until I got the header
perfectly right so you always want to
practice that right you want to first
break things in in order before you even
try to move on what happens to people is
that they try to watch a tutorial and
they do it with the instructor and when
you do it with the instructor he just
showed it to you that's like watching
Netflix isn't somebody asks you Oh what
happened in this episode you know it's
like you know it's like a Pokemon
episodes like who's that Pokemon and
yeah is like you saw the pictures you're
gonna remember you gonna say only this
Pikachu you know what I mean but if you
come in freakin two three episodes
before later on somebody asks you what
happened on episode 2 what Pokemon was
that you never like
remember that so it's just the same
thing as its coding is the same as
coding man you gotta go in there one
episode right you do one video and then
you do with the instructor and then you
do it on your own if you can't do it on
your own right after the video that
means you got a re-watch it again
because you didn't understand the
concepts right and then you just keep on
practicing every single time like that
and then everything that you that you
see on a video you're gonna be able to
learn it and it's gonna stay in your
mind but if you just say oh I'm doing it
with an instructor that's not gonna stay
there that's gonna be forgotten
you know by the end of the video you
know you're not gonna remember what
happened that's true
any advice dreaded death what would you
say um just that really I mean if you're
not getting it right away right after
the video when it's still fresh I would
just go ahead and you're free watch the
video and there's no shame in like not
getting it you feel me like a lot of
people get down on that and we watch the
video as many times as you can until you
get it I mean this is this is a marathon
this isn't really a sprint you know just
just stick to it and that that used to
get me real down and depressed it's like
oh man I just learned all this but like
did I really learn it and just keep
going until you are usually on go to a
different resource to like if you don't
understand like whatever you're using to
learn on like I'll check out YouTube and
check out like fun fun like whatever I'm
stuck on and that helps to like checking
out different resources yeah that's
definitely good because sometimes you
might get stuck right like let's say
you're watching a course for somebody
that person might have the best HTML and
CSS part of it right but then once you
get to the JavaScript it sucks and
you're like you're not getting it you're
not understanding and you're like oh
this part right here is the part that
sucks up the whole course so now what
you want to do is you wanna check out
other resources and say okay I'm
making the four loops right if that
person does not teach it to you in a way
where you want to study and you watched
it like two or three times and you still
don't get it
check another resource check on YouTube
check or another udemy course or look
online just blocks people be forgetting
about the blocks my blogs are one of the
best things because they actually break
it down sometimes when you read it is
better than actually hearing it from
somebody telling me like you know they
break it down even better so I usually
go to this website called Oh Scott style
which is pretty legit and yeah so
definitely try it out tree how how much
time you actually spend in on your study
as well and how sort of how frequently
you doing are you taking gaps in between
how is your source studying going well
I'm kind of traveling at the moment so
it's not completely consistent but at
the moment I've been for the past like
maybe a couple of weeks I've been doing
it every day yeah it's not I mean I
really really been doing it for that
like a a month or something okay
consistent consistency will help yeah
consistency is the key thing how long
are you away for how long are you
traveling for and when will you be
traveling for like a year and a half
it's just like my full time alone nomad
it's out here nomadic that's awesome so
well you now treat I'm sorry they'll be
you'll have a free code camp study
groups near you as well they're
everywhere
jump in that freako cup study groups and
see if they have a meet-up so I want to
cook a little quiz and I'm the guy who
makes the whole time so just get out
there and you have people because if you
have a problem then you can say to these
guys in person what the am I doing
wrong and sometimes it just takes take
start face-to-face to kind of go oh yeah
when it clicked you
good also I mean where is it that you
feel like you have a shanina's I'm sorry
where is it that you feel like you have
an issue or you're still not least come
LCSs is really query actually yeah like
I'm trying I'm on the like project
section of free code cab we have to
build a portfolio and I'm trying to like
remember it so that the navigation bar
like automatically Scrolls and I don't
really know how to do that
you know I know that I shared it I mean
listen um have you tried any courses out
there like cuz to be honest this my my
point of view freak ok I think Rico chem
has great community yes how rich of said
people made of speech each other but I
don't think that free cocaine is the
best place for somebody to learn from
scratch but me Rico campus more like
replacement crashes but you are already
turning that is that is trooper I'm
actually happy you said that a lot of
people don't that's like something that
you used to practice your skill instead
of kind of like learn even though you
kind of can't learn practice what you're
learning from somewhere else if that
makes any sense yeah like I don't knock
it
it works for a lot of people there's a
lot of people out there you know they
got like what like 300,000 or like a
million people who are members of free
cocaine right it works for a lot of
people okay
but there's people like me and you treat
that it just doesn't work right so the
the best advice that I could tell you is
if it's not working for you try taking a
course send me an email and I'll give
you access to my website and you'll
learn all of that stuff you know I mean
send me an email coding freeze at
gmail.com you know because you're here
in the live stream I'll definitely help
you out you know what I mean and you you
should be good you know and when you you
become famous you come on super legit
developer out there you know you buy me
a coffee
hey I think with free codes come good
and bad in certain ways the free code
camp doesn't hold your hand as
not just somebody of us so we've say
codecademy which will do the beginning
that will literally hold your hand and
go this is what you do especially with
free code camp when you get along with
it the beginnings kind of okay but when
you start hitting even the JavaScript
able to start with your head
cause that's when it's kind of down to
you a little bit more so don't feel
don't feel like I'm not getting
this because it ain't giving you the
answers you're having to kind of work
through and I think that can be the
hardest thing trying to think like a
developer because you you want to know
the answer but you have to turn the
switch that goes right ones and zeroes
see I start thinking like a developer
and that's the hardest bit to get
because it's something that just comes
with practice and it's not nothing you
can just get the answer to so don't be
worried and I think I think Joe you
might have had this neo description
actually the can't steal web developers
boot camp that's the course that made me
like finally starts understand
JavaScript at least the basics yeah
there's another one too as JavaScript
understanding the weird part that was
really really good
yeah that's by Anthony Alice saya that's
like that's like the ultimate that's the
holy grail of like JavaScript course
we're sure that that won't brace down
everything boy I think I might take that
one max yes good one for out your cold
steel oh yeah yeah yeah I think the
whole thing about that course it's like
looking at a I don't know it's like
looking at a cyclopædia in that I don't
know if that makes sense because it's
not like it's not as a beginner you know
I don't think people need that cause
because it's just so advanced is I got
first I think the the coal what
developer or coal was it what developer
Camp Bucca okay we can't
from cold steel and then from there what
I would do is try soon as you finish
that start building web sites meaning
start going in look at the design and
try to build it yourself if you feel
like you can't do it just try to build
one section of it you don't have to
build a whole website you say okay
I don't know how to build a whole site
all I know how to do is the header and
then you take it one step at a time and
you google the things they say how to do
a drop down if there's a drop down found
out online how to do a drop down and
then from there you find there's a
tutorial for that you build your drop
down you say oh how to put links align
to horizontally now you find that and
then you figure it out it's like there's
so many little things day you just got
to break it down section by section
because if you think like oh I'm gonna
fill Facebook the whole website the
website of Facebook might be complicated
because there's so many different our UI
things in there that you might be like I
don't even know how to do this I don't
even know how to create this this
drop-down when I hover on top of this
element because you don't even know how
to work with the box model or
positioning you know what I mean like so
many different concepts do you have to
take it one step at a time you know
that's my only advice and I think we for
jQuery as well it's something when I was
doing the JavaScript the problem was I
didn't know what JavaScript could do so
if you don't know what something can do
then you can't do what you need to do so
for instance so for instance like a a
calculator app which is one of the free
code camp courses if you if you didn't
know dares I think the function is
something like some there's like some
sort of method called some and it will
equate everything in an array but if you
don't know that exists and you've got um
sum up a number in a variable here with
something coming in then you kind of
like I don't know how this works cuz you
don't know what methods you don't know
what program and that programming
language can do so that's the hard thing
being so new that you don't know what
something
hande so then you cannot say even find
out how to do something because you
don't know what it can do also too I
think talking about JavaScript one of
the problems that that comes with
JavaScript is that personally myself I
don't think for somebody who's trying to
learn how to program for the very first
time
javascript should not be their first
language as a you know as a developer
like learning to program right because
there's so many different concepts that
you got to understand like javascript is
not only just programming you got to
understand the Dom you only got to
understand the objects object-oriented
programming there's so many different
things that people just don't understand
the basics of like what's a function you
know what I mean like people are barely
getting was an array or how to loop over
things and how to start thinking like
how you say as a developer like when to
use if and else statements when to use a
switch statement when to use a for loop
or or wire loop when to use or for in
loop like people don't know that so it's
like when you go into web development
and you try to just jump straight up to
like JavaScript sometimes that that can
you know hurt people because they'll be
scared to be so be developers cuz this
thing is hard is it's like you have like
30 different concepts in one freaking
language and on top of that the language
doesn't even work properly because it
was built on the way quite Ruby so nice
to like if you want to go ahead and just
pick up a programming language right off
the back pick up Ruby or like something
like Python man like because once you
learned that like you'll know like
functions and loops and all that and
then lava script is easier and then
great to learning like react and all
that other so Ruby's awesome at
Ruby's beautiful yeah one of the things
that I struggle with I'm sure others can
relate is like a lot of the courses I'm
taking you do a lot of console logging
you do a lot of things in the console
and when you're done with the course
it's hard to think like well how do I
apply that so like a real
that's like where I'm at right now I
kind of want to like start learning by
building projects instead of you know
well that's like this concept with like
math class like a lot of math the stuff
you learn on math you'll never use but
the basics of it it's what teaches you
like how to like balance a checkbook and
somebody you're never going to do
trigonometry or you like and that's what
I feel like some of these courses will
go in and they'll teach you stuff that
you may or may not use that as teaching
you concepts that are going to
strengthen what you learn later on I
feel yeah like I'm trying to learn how
to do like simple things like build a
light box build like a slider you know
stuff like that
well also too like things like a slide a
building a slider right you got a that's
where JavaScript could be like a
headache and the reason why I say this
is because so do a slider you gotta
understand the box model you got to
understand how elements work on HTML
right so like let's say you gotta have
like a slider right there's an image
here right and you click on the right
button and then that slides it to the
left
you got a either understand all the
concepts of how I'm gonna lay this down
with regular HTML and then how I'm gonna
use JavaScript to say hey I'm gonna put
in an event listen to an event on this
right button that's gonna make this move
to the left side - 200 pixels - move it
to the left side you're gonna say like
there's a lot of concepts it's not
something that you're gonna be able to
just pick up from one day to another the
easiest way for you to understand things
is just take one thing at a time and try
not to skip things like the color I
don't know understand if you sing the
console or the terminal as the console
and the terminal are different console
is for debugging yeah yeah the terminal
is really more for you know if you want
to work with things like no Jes you know
like the web developer starter key
anything that's modern back in the days
people didn't use this like people will
use the term
just for dealing with the server right
whenever you have something like a UNIX
server and that's a linux server and
that's a but now it's a everybody needs
to know the terminal because everything
that's being built it's around that you
know so it's like you got to know how to
move this idiot charger just like starts
smoke just started pouring out of it no
no this is my computer charger
I've only got like 10 percent charge
left as well so for part because this
thing isn't playing up this is like a
don't don't buy a fake Apple charger no
[Laughter]
I bought enough the guy when I was in
Norway and he sold his second hunter but
the price was kind of good well the dope
they don't have the circuit protection
protection so I can fry your whole
company so yeah you gotta be careful if
you go away cuz I don't have much
battery left if I randomly disconnect
this because I ran out of battery just
gonna say I know where we you go I won't
feel bad at the computer nobody blows up
crazy you know be careful straight up
disconnected just plug it back in
it's like this like window situations
with five ten years from now is like oh
top ten deaths on this to live like some
guys just haha you know so you gotta be
careful with that man
well yeah so any other topics you can
eyes my half let me see if anybody has
any questions on the chat room let us
know we got 93 people then we got only
93 people in here man and 94 come on can
we get a hundred can we get a hundred
people over here 96 come on man can we
get it come on send send this link to
your best friend send this link to your
little sister send this link to somebody
can we get a hundred can we break the
record the record has been 96 we haven't
being able to go higher than that and we
just break the record busy obviously
what's the questions that people have
reading reading reading reading reading
feels like Joe be under on his feelings
means now I'll be on my feelings is just
I be just real man it's like don't do
stuff that you wouldn't do a real life
cuz if you do some crazy to me a
real life I'll slap the SH out that's
the real life situation all right so you
please catch these hands in real life in
real life now catch if you wouldn't do
it in real life then don't do it on the
Internet you know it's like have respect
you know I have respect for everybody I
also have respect for for for me too you
know because if you're not gonna do in
real life man then don't type it you
know I mean this is out here those got
the heavy fingers you know I mean how he
just working out those gangster typing
muscles you know oh yeah man
was good was good so yo was this kid's
name Rob so what's good man so you from
out there close to a lay where you up to
right now me as far as like learning and
becoming a develop are you just starting
are you already working well you I had a
gig and then some happen I guess they
started investing in something else or
whatever and then they write up you know
what I mean so that had that was like
for like out here and yeah I was just I
knew like up to like I didn't even know
JavaScript so I was just messing with
HTML CSS and then like messing with the
Dom with it with the websites and like
they had they had a word WordPress right
so so I was messing with the WordPress
and then they had PHP so he was the work
the webmaster over there was you know
trying to teach me some of that like
that and then all of a sudden they
invested in something else and then you
know their investment dried up and then
it was like hey well we wanted you bless
we can't have me anymore because you
know that's cool you know I take these
girls what I got and then right now I'm
just coating my my personal website and
then I'm just I'm on that like 24/7 like
my portfolio so I'm on your channel
trying to check stuff out you know and
then any recommendations you got I'm
looking into your channel I'll wet
dreaded dev and another cat so you know
I'm just trying to learn see you I can
go with trying to get trying to kind of
like take the right things from the
right people we know what I mean yeah I
feel you on that I mean from what I hear
you know you building a portfolio right
now again you stuff done listen yeah
yeah so that's what I'm
Oh what I'm stuck on is actual like I
read the book was it was like the manual
the missing manual of JavaScript and and
jQuery right so I read that I understood
it and then you know I took all
everything I can from that and I just
kept on going over it and then I see you
I see your channel I don't know if you
can hear me yeah here yeah hey I'm cool
and I saw that you told I think her hard
candy or I'm not sure what her name was
mm-hm but uh you know like hey like just
take course like the future-proof
JavaScript or whatever right so I'm I'm
thinking well should I take that course
first or jQuery like like I'm trying to
put these discussions look if you know
if you there's a thing you could go out
and find the best resources that it's
out there right now you can follow what
I tell you from somebody that is
self-taught you know my website has a
timeline pretty much you go in there and
you say okay I already know how to work
with the terminal I already know how to
use a text editor I already know how to
build a website from a design HTML CSS
once you're done with that it's okay I
know the basics right with that just
with that alone you could get a job a
very entry job a lot of people think
like oh you need JavaScript a lot of
times they just need somebody to come in
and edit stuff in just HTML and CSS
right now if you know in such a rush to
get a job there from they'll say okay
now continue to future-proof javascript
right and then from there just follow
along everything that I have on the
timeline everything that's on my website
is basically one thing depending on the
thing that was there before right so you
need to take every single one in order
right skip whatever you already know
like if you're
we know how to do functions cool you
don't need to see that right you just go
through there skipping right if you know
all the basics of JavaScript who get to
the end of it at the end of it there's
like two three projects that show you
how to use JavaScript on a very basic
level right there from there jump into
jQuery cuz there's no point of view
working with jQuery if you didn't
understand why they created jQuery
right when you write a vanilla
JavaScript
it can be very verbose and half a lot of
code a lot of lines of code right
jQuery was created to make your life
easier as a developer and making more
more easy for a new person to come in
and say okay if I click on this element
on this div then I want this to change
the background change the CSS so that's
what jQuery was created just to make
your life easier every framework every
library that comes out of there is just
to make your life easier well you need
to know JavaScript first before you even
jump to anything and then everything's
gonna be confusing right so just follow
the timeline you go to the website you
put in on the coupon code from YouTube
is like 10 bucks with 10 bucks that you
put in you could cancel a at the end of
the month if you want literally you
could go in there and knock out like
four or five courses I see a lot of
people that go to my website that I oh
they think like they're getting such a
bad idea by buying a specific course and
say oh all I need is JavaScript but then
you realize that you needed more than
just JavaScript you needed uh you know a
little bit of an advanced CSS you know
flex boxes CSS grids you know all of
those things that make a modern
developer nowadays or even web packing
gold print all of this extra things you
go to the website and just freaking you
do it with ten bucks you knock it out
the way you know if you feel like you
need it or another extra month okay it's
enough for 20 bucks you basically you
got everything that you need it and then
now you can start getting your job you
know I've seen a lot of people that
basically they went into the web site in
two months they already started getting
jobs and getting opportunity right so
just by following the things that
I've told them what I'm showing you
because in reality I'm just a
self-taught develop I'm the same person
is you and same person as everybody else
that's in here the only difference is
that I already made the mistakes I
already spent time going to a coke Adam
II free coke and I'll coach school comm
Pluralsight you to me I know which
courses on udemy are good which courses
are bad who's a good instructor who's
not a good instructor so at least when
you go to my website you bypassing the
research it's just like here here's the
things that you need to get the job and
then from there you just move on and
continue your career as a developer and
the more that you you get to learn the
more experience that you're gonna be
pumped right and by that time you don't
need know what I mean like you know
radio a good developer you know how to
find the right resources for you you
know right yeah and that's what I felt
like well what I well I went to the U
your you to I was like whoa like even
sounds like he like he talks like me and
I mean like he's a cool dude and
everything I feel like I could buy with
him oh so wait like what's going on and
then I see some your channel and then I
was like whoa like this guy is into the
same things I am and stuff and he just
like he knows more than me I know that I
was like alright let me like let me soak
up some game you know what I mean yeah
exactly that's what I tell people all
the time is like listen I'm not the most
expert - I don't never want to come in
here be like Joe Santos Garcia expert i
XYZ no Joe Santos Garcia so regular do
that know how to get in the game I put
in all this freaking years and then now
coming back and I'm just saying hey man
don't you don't have to go through all
the roles that I went through you don't
have to go through what a mistakes that
I already did follow this and you're
gonna learn this super quick without
having to spend $20,000 in a boob Ken
right I had what was anyone I think is
blocked dial they wanted to hire me as
an instructor on a bootcamp I'm like yo
I'm not gonna work at a boot camp you
know I mean like I could lose that
online and like basically help out
thousands and thousands of people you
know what I mean and just like and be my
self if I would have to work at black
eye oh I would have to be like hi guys
yeah today we're gonna learn a little
bit of Python it I don't want to do that
I'm going to go in there like that cuz
it's like I wouldn't want to be able to
watch this you know if I was just
coming in here like that
I wanna come in here hey you wanna feel
like is your boy listen it's your boy
I'm from down the block you know I mean
I'm from two blocks away you know so
it's like no matter what listen to what
I have to say I'm not an expert I'm just
a dude that I already went through what
you were about to go through and then
I'm just giving you the game like you're
here do this do that is the same thing
as if your cousin Buddha came to you and
what I told you hey man don't listen to
this don't listen to that do this and
you're gonna be fine
that's you know yeah cuz most most dudes
like or whatever this mess they're not
in the industry you know what I mean
like I can't go to my cousin because
there are like you know construction
workers whatever you know what I mean
step ass or whatever I'm over here yeah
no thank you for this kind of action
that one good thing you know I mean yeah
man appreciate it you know thank you
guys for showing up and for dreaded
death for hanging out with us for this
small most people will be like y'all I
see we've been here for like two hours
you know do start going like this to me
like yo but yo freaking now listen
so everybody's watching we got 87 people
in here 87 people survived you know I
mean like we've been here for how long
like two hours yeah two hours strain
like you ain't here or reason Michael
you're here to change your life you here
to to basically better yourself this is
something that's gonna change your life
axe Krishan extra to death you coax me
like this thing has changed our lives
like you know we was right
do you got a saying like we're not like
oh this guy's super smart do this and I
is like Gil is just regular Zeus I said
I'm gonna apply myself I've got a work
hard for the next few months in there
from there a year from now you're gonna
be like yo now you're trying to put
somebody else on you know what I mean
later yeah I'm just a dumb ass with a
GED I just want to say that out here you
know I'm saying like it's all in it
especially you know saying like me
Joker's everybody talks on the bottom
row we come from like lower than that
 you're not good at the back
all right so what I will say is you got
a you got a you know look the front end
is now for everybody right this guy's
that that come in and they hate working
on the front end
they hate having to you know serve
multiple browsers and have to maintain a
code for a whole bunch of different
versions of the browsers nobody wants to
be doing right so I mean some people
like it some people don't right so if
you feel like you you are more of a
back-end developer then which you should
do is you should say hey okay I really
want to become a back-end developer this
is what I want to focus on then from
there just focus on the back-end man
like as long as you understand what HTML
and CSS is right you need to know even
if you are back in developer you need to
know at least the basics of how to
change or how to convert a PSD or a
design into HTML CSS okay once you know
that you know the basics of how to edit
things then you can focus just on the
back end all right even on JavaScript
you don't have to be an expert at
JavaScript you don't even have to do
JavaScript you just got to know how
things work with JavaScript as far as
Ajax and so back-end developer all you
have to know is that a user or a
developer is gonna set up a JavaScript
that's gonna send you a JSON data to
your back-end anything you gotta know
how to basically deal with that data is
coming in and save it to your database
or display it back to the user on a page
that's a right if you feel like you're
more comfortable in that then what I
would say focus on on a language like
PHP focus on PHP at first right and then
from there focus on my sequel the
database then from there you want to
focus on a framework like laravel right
and then from there you could say okay I
like I like PHP is cool but I'm
interested or no js' I'm interested in
you know golang I'm interested on Python
whatever
you're interesting you can do that on
the side right while you're still
getting a job but focus on PHP because
PHP will get you a job like this and
then from there you could just focus on
whatever you you really love you know
what I mean cuz all you need is that
first job once you get that first job
you could jump from the front end to the
back so you know so that's what I will
say for you definitely focus on anybody
else down in mice for him yeah I think
there's a lot of people and I was saying
this today to a friend nobody's gonna
hire someone who's who's okay
like don't spread yourself too thin
thank you you know I don't know I don't
know how baseball or football works in
America but you don't want a team who's
who's comfortably fifth place the fifth
place at basketball the fifth place at
baseball the fifth place at football you
want the team who's winning
everything so don't don't be I'm pretty
good at that and I'm pretty good at that
me the best at something be a
 expert be that guy someone comes
out and goes you're the guy for
back end you know you like joe said
you've gotta have a certain level of
being able to do something on the front
end but there's positions for only back
end so yeah my advice is don't spread
yourself too thin if you good at
something just be the best of it
yeah we need Richard Richard needs to
you know narrate everything that I do is
like like like your dough is getting his
cup drinking right now you guys drinking
for the best cup send me an
email I need you to do my intro
yeah man but like I said guys um yeah if
you want if you're more leaning to to
the back end don't force it you know I
seen people who try to force it too much
but like oh man I need to learn react I
need to learn Java scripting to learn
this I need to learn back in it's like
hold on like if you're good at
programming and you feel like you
understand how databases work you
understand those things then focus on
the back end that's what you're gonna
shine right there's no point of view
trying to be okay at something and then
whatever you was actually really good at
you you know you leaving it behind cuz
he was trying to be okay as something
else it's like if you're good at this
focus on this you know what I mean so
that's what I would say do PHP cuz it's
just the opportunities are there you
know like somebody left me a comment
it started to bring it up but people
always listen don't comment some guy
says um what was it that you say he says
like matter fact I'm picking it up this
is what I do
let me see where is it made all right
let me show my screen
all right we got Luke Franco here so
Luke Franco says PHP in 2018 you buggin
bro you're smoking crack no tell him to
learn Java or Python and I'm like yo I
don't know that Luke Franco yeah I'm
like lol yeah like those companies are
hiring self-taught developers with no
experience bro do your research
I'm not talking about which is better or
who has the most github stars or what is
cool with the hipsters well there you go
I'm talking about jobs so you research
don't talk to me you know I mean so a
lot of people might come to you and tell
you hey
PHP is their PHP is dissing that listen
as a self-taught developer PHP is a
blessing because you got understand you
are some this how companies and this I'm
just gonna put it out there for
everybody that's here this is me being
rude you are just some random dude
coming out of nowhere applying to a job
nobody knows you nobody giving you a a
reference nobody's giving you nothing
right and you're like hey man I just I'm
showing up with a clock a calculator on
my portfolio and I'm showing up a game
and I'm showing with a you know a match
game or a tic-tac-toe
you know what I mean so it's like
nobody's gonna hire you at those
companies with that right you got to
come in with either degree that they can
say okay this person came from freakin
Stanford this guy came from MIT is like
they know they got a great education
they're so automatically they're giving
them the benefit of a doubt right so
they sell King we're gonna give him a
chance right but you're so random dude
you know your resume is saying hey are
over a driver your resumes saying of a
freaking of retail I may seize your
thing says I used to sell shoes that
Nike and freakin footlocker you get what
I'm saying that you come in as a regular
dude right oh there's to be 100% honest
with you the best chance for you to get
that first job is PHP PHP most companies
they're like man it's a blessing to even
get somebody to come work here right so
they want you to either do WordPress
that I don't want you to edit a little
bit of the legacy code that they might
have their you know they might have some
HTML CSS and some jQuery which most
companies the newer companies are not
even using but you as a developer that
is just starting you go in there you
soak that up you work there for three to
six months and they're pieces you know I
mean you gotta deuce you know and just
move on to the next company because now
you have down your resume you you know
you're going to like a major company you
know you gotta go apply to Facebook
right
first thing that says is like uh six
months ago working at footlocker they
don't look at you like your bro you
crazy even applying over here that's
just being honest you know nobody tells
you the truth out here people want to
tell you listen you work hard and you'll
get there right away it doesn't work
like that when you're self-taught you
got to work yourself up the ladder you
know you got to put down your resume see
look at the portfolio that look at the
companies that I did look at the small
businesses that I I built their website
look how I changed you know they now
they have more income they used to sell
only on a retail on their store now they
have an online store because of me I set
up the Shopify set up their WordPress I
set up their a social media like you
want to show that you can do everything
right so you could get that you know
those good jobs it's not gonna come to
you in one day like it happens right but
it's the same way how people say people
get the lottery is like it happens but
does it happen to you are you waiting on
that you know what I mean like let's be
honest you know so work yourself up and
then for me you're gonna be fine
you know people talk so much BS about
PHP and this and that but it's it's an
opportunity to get into the industry
that's how you got to think about it
it's cool to say arm I'm focusing on
nodejs nobody's gonna hire you with no
GSE and say I'm just focusing on ojs you
have no projects you got a calculator on
you I want to curse so bad you got a
calculator in your portfolio you
 before you got a one of
was this guy's name was boss a clock a
JavaScript clock and your portfolio you
don't even have a full website on your
portfolio you think those companies that
are higher you know so it's like give
yourself the chance and say okay I'm
gonna take two to three months to learn
how to code right you gotta go in and
work for a company go to six months
after that we won work on whatever you
want well you need that stand that stem
doesn't come from you sitting down your
house waiting for that dream job that
stand comes from
working period si that's my that's my
little rant of the day you know I mean
you're right about that man
people gotta realize though that like
PHP is on like seven even like eighty
percent of websites and people hate on
PHP hell I hate on PHP - I don't like
using it I hate using it right but I'm
trying to get into a job bro that is one
of the easiest way to get into a job
just go ahead you're gonna just be
working on legacy code all day
you know it's not gonna be part of
you're not gonna like it but you get
that foot in the door and like you said
six to eight months later bro you now
have I'm not the guy that you now have
experience you go in and then work on
whatever the hell you want while you're
making money may lot of people just sit
there and they want to get perfect at it
and bro just make money and then just
get good at it later you yeah I mean for
you I don't think we we talked about
this um what's the stack that you guys
are working on liming from your work I
know you do the front end well yeah
what's the stack that they work on mean
it means meaning stack so as Mongo Mongo
DB node and anchor in JavaScript a cool
yes so it's like there's a whole bunch
of different avenues but it's like you
know I I know for a fact it's not like
me guessing I know for a fact going to
become a back-end developer like let's
say on the mean stack or even or and
let's say I've seen somebody telling me
oh I want to be an elixir developer I'm
like bro you do you understand the
competition that's out there for those
jobs you know what I mean yeah it was
like you the best easiest way to say is
I must start with the front end right
but if you say I want to start with
something with the back end PHP is a
blessings like this WordPress you could
start with WordPress that's not even
doing anything you get sixty thousand
dollars for that that's like you go in
there you go in there and get a couple
of themes a couple of plugins you get
him paid you know what I mean like and
then once you you you build on your
portfolio you build up you know
everything for you to actually go out
there and in the world and you move on
but don't listen
man Internet is like a bunch of people
that just choose you know oh there's the
last thing that I was gonna say this is
my last piece of the Ring Jesus Christ
man a lot of those developers should be
freaking ashamed of themselves
um some people that have been seen
talking about Oh learn this stack learn
this thing learn Java this which you
should focus on learning on Python in
the job that they work on it's actually
like PHP like part of the game is that
you don't say like you got a job in
there and then now you don't like PHP
you're like you've been working there
for five six years now you under
internet some of people don't learn PHP
PHP is dead and spaghetti Cohen this and
that and then as I grow like you got a
job on it why are you messing it up for
new people coming in you know what I
mean so I was like doesn't make sense
but yeah man right I think WordPress
WordPress is like jQuery as well it's
clear it's not the cool thing what
WordPress isn't call but if you can make
a theme so you're gonna use something
like under scars which underscores dummy
if you can convert your HTML CSS
JavaScript into a wordpress template
that is gold for you know you might be
doing small businesses or even just
friends who wanted a website then they
can go in to the WordPress back-end they
can change the heading themselves they
can add their own blog posts they can do
all that stuff so WordPress isn't cool
but a lot of people can use it it's very
usable for the client and the same of
jQuery I think jQuery is getting a bad
rap nowadays everyone's like doing in
vanilla JavaScript it's like alright
yeah but if you're gonna do spilled
something quick you know everything can
be done in JavaScript but if you're
trying to make something quick and you
gotta think of the animations and stuff
that jQuery has one line of code you
don't yes people like people like yeah
but you've gotta have the jQuery library
but so why nearly every nearly every
website has two jQuery library anyway so
everyone's browser has jQuery cached so
it's not like it has to call off to the
see the end and pull back that jQuery
yeah cause chances are 12 free what free
websites ago they had jQuery so it's
already there so I think people like to
hate on stuff a little bit too much when
it's like WordPress not cool but very
very useful jQuery not cold very very
simple and easy to use
yeah I mean anybody else got anything to
say any other topics guys we've been
here for like two hours man we've been
here for literally two oh sure we broke
the record we got to 100 we got to 100
up in this should be like an alarm up in
here like finally has come coding listen
man I want to thanks to the dreaded dev
hang down for two hours you know it's a
trouper you know actually dreaded Devils
here for like two hours and a half
because the first stream first stream
was like yeah OBS was not playing oh he
is is like listen man I'm a quick I'm a
click-clack on your on your hole bitch

people that find me a lot of times they
never gonna be able to find you or the
people that find you they're never gonna
find me so the only way to really just
conglomerate this whole community
