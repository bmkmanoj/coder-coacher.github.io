back at it again man listen today we're
just gonna talk about you know my
youtube channel man because right now
i'm here to actual help i need help from
you guys right so basically right now
we've actually been growing and you know
subscribers and reels so it's actually
going pretty fast I think we could
actually grow even faster if I get
better content and you know better
topics and you know maybe editing the
videos better because I know a lot of
times I'll be like mom I'll be like yeah
or whatever like you know is like you
catching your thought so maybe you know
I'm I start you know editing the videos
i usually just do the videos just 10
whatever like i get home straight from
work and like i'll get an idea driving
from long from work straight tool to the
house of it okay you know what i'm gonna
close this video today a but the same
time i'm getting a lot of views and it's
a small percentage of the people who
actually subscribe and i believe is
because of the quality that's why on
Monday today Saturday Monday I got a
branding camera coming in brand new
microphone I got a whole room that's
going to be set up just for recording
videos for YouTube um you know I'm gonna
I'm gonna clean things up you know what
I mean so at the same time I wanted to
have you guys give me some ideas and and
let me know what do you guys think I
need to improve you know I definitely
not into along you know as far as like
my speech and you know speaking to
people and explain things and that's why
I think I might just start you know
scripting things up now like superscript
it because I feel I have to have to type
of videos videos where I want to have a
point that you guys could you know co
understand and get as much as that's
possible in one video get you know get
the idea of what I'm trying to tell you
guys and then there's other videos
I just got to be myself when it's just
like hey I'm just talking like I will
talk to my boys you know what I mean so
that's what I think that's where my
channel is gonna go from now on and I
wanted to know like exactly what do you
guys think like the subscribers like
right now I have like 600 650 I don't
know is that me 600 something
subscribers which is you guys and I
really really want to know what you guys
think what do you guys think that I
should start doing I know some people
told me that should do or more tutorials
like really simple tutorials for like
beginner and I think I'm like I might
start doing that too but I might do that
once a week why because tutorials take a
lot of time and you know right now like
how I'm moving into this new house I'm
gonna have a kid I'm gonna get married
soon or there's a lot of stuff going on
in my life that is hard for me to just
say hey I'm just gonna do tutorials
every single day so but you know when I
give you guys that vice or give you
resources or I talk about a topic it
takes an hour it takes like usually like
an hour to get them done so i imagine
with you know editing the videos and
doing everything is going to take me
like a extra hour and a half I try to do
two videos of that day but lately I've
started to notice I can maybe two videos
a day is a little bit too much because
you gotta understand i work full time
it's not like I'm home and I'm you know
I'm learning money from this thing like
I'm not earning anything to be honest
with you guys especially when you know
like the camera that i just bought is
like sixteen hundred dollars so a
thousand six hundred others like you
know and then on top of that i gotta pay
for a server for the website that I'm
building for you guys so we could have a
community of people who are encoding
phase you know subscribers and you know
whoever wants to come in being our
community so
that's another like eighty dollars a
month like like I don't even earning any
money to like when you know also to when
you guys buy a course from you know the
top five udemy courses that i use to get
to where i'm at right now if you guys
still don't know about that go check out
the links below on the description kind
of five courses that pretty much like
the best one i've gone through like 100
courses on you to me and most of time on
there pretty much shake I just return
them back if you feel like um you know
of course is garbage or you're not
getting what you need return the dragon
your get your refund man well yeah if
you really want to check them out there
right below I usually make things like
maybe like twenty percent of the sale
and then out of that twenty percent like
to say is the course is fifteen dollars
that probably make I don't know all
three to four dollars and then from
there I'll take that money and I split
it up so I could buy courses for you
know Indian subscribers and African
subscribers and Asian subscribers and
Latin America subscribers who really
don't have the money to being spent
fifteen dollars like fifteen dollars is
almost like a weakest of people's you
know work like then I'm making no money
so what I do is I help them out um so
yeah so right now if I wasn't treated
like a business like I'm literally minus
you know all the way through like I'm
always minus no matter what but as
because I love doing this you know what
I mean like I'm not here trying to make
money online here trying to become a
super youtuber like if I wanted to do
that we'll do something else this is
more of like me trying to help people
out and you know having friends like you
know having like people who who are
considered friends like you know as my
