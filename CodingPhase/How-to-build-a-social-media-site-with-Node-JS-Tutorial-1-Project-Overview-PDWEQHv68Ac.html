again coding face.com
I hope you guys enjoy the next video
that you're about to watch this is part
of my nodejs course we're building a
social media site with no Jes is gonna
have all the cool features like chat a
user authentication and following other
users basically posting statuses all the
cool stuff to any social media site what
happens should have so basically this is
what we're doing I'm showing you guys
the first part of the project which is
creating the views and then all of the
logic will be part of the course okay if
you guys haven't seen this yet it's a
full course for North Jes so everything
that you need to start building
applications is here you know we go over
the basics of how to install know how to
get everything going we talked about
nodejs basics which is like Express GS
building a small little server then from
there we start talking about Adonis I go
deep into the framework so definitely
check it out alright guys I'll see you
guys later bye alright guys don't miss
on anything that happens on : face comm
subscribe and click the notification and
you get notified every time that I drop
a new video or a new content alright
guys so what we're gonna do now is start
building our first major project in ojs
okay and there's gonna be a pretty cool
project because it's gonna be basically
a social media website I have this
design that I found dribble we're gonna
take some parts out of this for
inspiration alright we're not taking
everything from this which is basically
using it for inspiration and we're going
to create our own styles for our website
okay so this is one of the things that
we're gonna be building and yeah let's
talk about features what exactly this
website is going to have is gonna have
user identification which means a user
courage
sir sign in and go to their account okay
simple the basics of what development
right we're gonna have statuses which is
what we see here somebody could come
here and put a status okay we're going
to have a feature to follow so you see a
user here or you search for a user or
you search for a tag let's add that tool
so let's put in hash tags
okay so we're gonna have hash tags so
let's say you search for a hash tag of
what development and you find a couple
of people writing about what development
or sharing cool stuff about web
development you're gonna be able to
follow them okay and we're gonna have a
chat system which is what we see right
here okay so yeah the name of the
application is going to be called talk
but in Japanese so toku so I know you're
probably thinking hey Joe why are you
naming the Japanese listen I don't know
I don't even know why I'm naming it in
Japanese it just sounds cool toku so
tokuda i oh let's say okay so we're
gonna call it Tokido IO and we are going
to start building this okay now
the requirements for this what are the
requirements number one you need to have
no js' installed okay I am NOT gonna go
into this how to do this all of this
information you can find it on the
internet or if you own the course the
complete course of nodejs
right you are going to be seeing this in
the beginning of the course okay
you also need to be installing Adonis GS
okay so dynasty yes it's just a
framework for nodejs so once you install
nodejs make sure you set up adonis yes
like i said all of this is in the
beginning of the core
now the next thing that we are also
going to use is my web developer starter
kit so to do this we're gonna go to
github.com slash coding face d-o-t calm
so it's coding phase calm just like how
you see it right here corner face calm
you're going to download the starter kit
and you're going to keep this in your
download section and we will open this
later on okay
this tool basically work with our assets
Adonis GS has a couple of things as far
as managing assets in setting up sass
and you know this isn't that personally
I like what I have already built so I'm
not going to be using what Adonis
jeaious has I like my workflow that I
have between gulp and web pack and I use
webpack s needed just for JavaScript I
don't use it for my size I don't use it
for my life reloading I don't use it for
any of that so let's get started with
initializing our project ok if you
already have everything installed like I
said no J yes Adonis and you downloaded
my web developer starter kit you open up
your terminal ok click allies click CD
into projects ok
that's where I have all of my projects
you guys might have in your desktop it's
up to you where you have it ok so the
next thing that I'm going to do is I'm
going to go into let's say Adonis new
then we're gonna say so cool okay so
Adonis new we'll create our project
ok let the download the dependencies
that we need for this project let it go
through
okay once it's installed we do CD and
then we go into toku we go into Adonis
serve that's that's dev okay so now we
basically have everything that we need
in here we go to localhost 127 33 33 or
you could go say local holes 33 33 it's
the same thing alright and there you go
guys
we have our first steps set up and I'll
see you guys in the next video I'm
really excited to get this done this is
gonna be super legit this is something
that you could definitely use for your
portfolio and will show to any employer
that you understand how what development
is done alright guys I'll see you guys
in the next video bye
guys this video is brought to you by
viewers like you and people that support
our website coding phase comm go check
it out over 20 courses in there that's
gonna guide you to become a developer
from the beginning to becoming a pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
