question is from L Smith Webb is a hey
Joe what is your opinion or a new
program starting out and building a

everybody number one you need to start
making websites this idea that you got
to join freako camping you're going to
join Koch Adam II and you gotta
do all these little and you
think that's going to help you trust me
guys that's not gonna help you at all
what's going to help you is the fact
that you have experienced one experience
of building any type of site that
anybody can throw at you so you got to
be able to be comfortable with HTML CSS
so if I say hey here's a design that I
got from the designer and I want you to
build it for me can you do that that's
number one number two experience from
working with clients it's very easy to
create a website and you for yourself
you're like oh this is amazing website I
put an amazing you know new font icon
and I put an amazing flying
little text coming around the page trust
me guys
most likely your page looks like
right so at least when you work with a
client a client will be honest with you
you know but I hate I don't
like this could you change that can you
all you know make the forum a little bit
flow better or you know make the text a
little bit smaller like you can only get
that from working with people the fact
that you get to build a website for
somebody that's the only way that you
can do it that's all the way that you're
gonna get that type of experience so
