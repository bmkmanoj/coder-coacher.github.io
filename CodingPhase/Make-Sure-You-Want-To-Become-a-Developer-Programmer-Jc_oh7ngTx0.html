back at it again man : face calm listen
your boys back I didn't did it again
alright guys so we're going to talk
about the front end the back end and a
little bit of the full stack right so
I'm gonna start this up with a message
that I got from one of my viewers who
was telling me his story and all the
things that he he had to do to become
you know a permanent resident of here
the United States so I'm gonna give you
a little background he came from India
and he came from India and in India they
wanted him to be engineer his parents
but when he got here he decided hey I'm
gonna study computer science right so he
always liked computers it was like
making like little websites but he never
really focused on it he focused more on
Java on Titan and you know databases my
sequel so now he's actually you know
graduating he's like man I'm bout to
graduate but now I feel like I did the
wrong thing I feel like I sure became a
designer I should have learned more
about design than you know computer
science you know computer science theory
you know in general right can I make the
story law so now he's like that I feel
like I'm gonna have to start all over
because he wants to learn more about
color theory and you know ux/ui so what
I will say is and I want you guys to
take this as a very good example for you
guys is you have to do the research and
you have to do like some soul-searching
right and figure out the things that you
like if you knew from the beginning that
you like design like you're into those
things you like how to look y-you know a
cute clear clean interface right that
means you you really enjoy the front end
so if you kind of know that at one point
right
you should have focus on that and I'll
tell that to everybody here because
sometimes we think oh we're gonna do
something because of the money we're
going to do something because of what
other people tell us hey there's the
right choice hey somebody might come in
and tell you hey the right choice is for
you to become an engineer but in reality
you don't like that all right you
probably don't like being an engineer
you don't like being a chemist you don't
like being our architect whatever right
what you really liked was creating
designs building you know building
designs building pages for clients
that's what your passion was in so I
want everybody to take this as an
example because we keep doing that to
ourselves we keep coming in and choosing
careers because we think oh this is the
top paying career this is the the best
career for me this is you know the lord
that's going to give me the most jobs
yes Gauss is very important but also too
you got to make yourself happy you know
how many people have been and in
different type of careers even doctors
guys who go into school become a doctor
you know taking 4 to 15 years to finish
write become a surgeon and then when
after the first surgery they're like man
I don't want to do this all right you
know so it's like some people say hey
that's life and I say hey that's wasting
time wasting time or something that you
could be doing you know you could be
doing something fun something that
you're gonna enjoy right so I want you
guys to do some soul-searching this week
I want you guys to look into what
exactly what branch of Technology you're
going to get into some of you guys you
like the idea of project management some
of you like the idea of content editor
some of you guys like the idea of being
a designer
some of you guys like the idea of social
media social media marketing right so
look into that nothing to leave this
alone but also look into something
that's going to make you happy don't do
this because there's a steady paycheck
don't do it because you're gonna get
money don't do this because it's gonna
open a lot of doors for you and yes it
can open a lot of doors but what does it
matter if you're going to be upset
you're going to be sad you want to feel
like you basically going to become what
you wanted to become in this room you
know what I mean you know so it's hard
man it's hard because it's like yeah
becoming a developer is almost a
guarantee that you could live a very
good life right but at the same time
it's like if you're not happy doing it
why are you doing it why are you
sacrificing so many hours you know to
study this you know it's like this guy
he studied so much even in India in high
school he was in learning Java and then
later on in college studying computer
science and he did it because his family
was something hey you gotta become
either engineer or you gotta become
something with math and science you know
the guy really just wanted to do designs
that has nothing to do with math and
science so now almost years that he put
in and reality he could have been
putting it in until practicing his
skills his trade right so I want you
guys to take this time look into your
soul look into what you like the things
that you liking the things that you
don't like like nothing even for guys
who who like databases and who like
programming more than the front end make
sure you then focus more in the back end
get the basics of the front end get the
basics of the back end but if you like
the back end more focus on the back end
focus on the database focus on
programming
right if you like design if you'd like
to have things clean if you enjoy you
know finding the best way for a user to
interact with your website then focus on
the front end all right but that's
that's the answer that only you can can
give to yourself you got to find it
within yourself to figure out which way
which branch which route which is going
to be your way right which one all right
so I'm going to leave you guys with that
it's a quick little video for all my
youtubers or all my friends or my my
family once you got to stay up and guys
like I said if you want to become a
developer if you want to learn this
check out the courses I have in my
description right now if you go to my
website : face comm you can pretty much
get all the courses that I created for
ten dollars right or you could buy other
people's courses on udemy through my
links right that they write down the
description very good instructors you
know I'm not saying hey only buy my
courses I will say go check out other
instructors you know I feel for or what
I'm giving you guys I'm giving you guys
