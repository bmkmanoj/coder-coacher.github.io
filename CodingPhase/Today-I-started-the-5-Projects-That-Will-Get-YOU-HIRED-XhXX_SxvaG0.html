coding face.com
your boys back in I didn't did it again
hit him with it okay we back cool guys
man I'm excited right now I've been
talking about these five projects for
literally God knows when I've been
talking about this for a long time I've
been talking about this since I first
started go look at my good look at my
first videos man back in December 2016
almost a year ago right I was talking
about this projects I'm like guys I'm
gonna do this I'm gonna start building
this for you guys we're gonna go over it
and I've been telling people hey
building on your own but at the same
time it's like it's not everybody's
fault that they don't do it right
sometimes you need that motivation
sometimes you need somebody to guide you
somebody to hold your hand and help you
cross the street and get you out here
successful you know and get you a job
that's why people see it man I'm all
about the money man when it comes to
this thing I'll be honest man I'm not
one of those guys that come here and be
like oh man I'm about you know
stimulated my mind and this and that
nah man I only do things that is gonna
make me money in the sense of like hey
am I gonna be able to get hired with
this right am I gonna be able to somehow
become successful right that's what I'm
all about right I'm all about helping
people get that money there's no point
of view being super smarting let me say
right now let's say somebody comes up
and they come up with this amazing
formula there's really no point of
keeping it in your house
right you have to share it to the world
you have to go out there and okay
hey man I'm the best scientists in the
world I got the best formula of whatever
right there's really no point of saying
hey I'm super smart but I'm not using my
skills right so that's what I'm here for
guys and I just want you guys to really
get out there
so right now as we speak I'm basically I
just finished the react course right
it's called react quick and easy
learning react like this like I was kind
of surprised I was like oh yeah sure
like I just broke down like all the
things that you know when I first
started react I was like man this thing
is hard this thing you gotta do HTML in
JavaScript which was weirding and I was
like oh my god this thing is hard I
don't think I'm gonna be able to
understand it and it took me a while
right it took me a while to understand
especially after learning Redux or
trying to learn Redux not even know
Redux at that moment and I was like man
how can I learn all of this stuff right
especially when I was like man I'm not
even that great at JavaScript yet you
know so I was trying to learn so much
but now I'm looking at this and I'm like
you know I just broke it down like
literally like are you saying karate
chop
hit him with hit him with the the future
karate chop that yeah and we did an
amazing amazing course right now this
react course is I'm putting it on my
website I'm releasing it here on YouTube
for everybody to to get it because you
know it's like we also want the people
from YouTube to get it right there's a
lot of people that cannot afford to sign
up to the website and that's fine that's
why I'm giving it to you guys so you
guys could check it out here on YouTube
too right of course the people that are
on my website they have it right now
live is there so its life already the
course is there put a react right now uh
I'm releasing this this course this
react course is pretty quick and short
short and sweet let's like pretty you
know pretty damn quick
it's like one two three four five six
seven eight nine so in nine videos I go
over all the basics of react basically
you hit the ground running now right now
as we speak
editing the videos that I'm going to
release to YouTube alright so I'm doing
this right now as we speak I'm actually
about to edit the video release it to
the world and put it on YouTube too
right now I've been talking about this
five projects man we're talking about
the real estate we're talking about
digital agency we're talking about a
restaurant we're talking about your
portfolio and I always keep forgetting
the last 108 commerce alright so those
five projects right there those five
projects are like the things that you
need to get hired alright so now we got
there now we can finally man I told you
guys for a long time and I said wait
give me some time I'm gonna start it I'm
gonna start building it I'm gonna start
doing it but first I have to you know
build build all of these things first I
got a first building I gotta first go
through the process of of building
things so now now we good G that we we
good now we could actually start
building those projects right because so
be honest what you guys is gonna take a
little while to complete everything I'm
talking about a month two months of me
just going hard every single day to get
this there's five projects in there's
like me getting hired by a company and
be like
different companies and every single one
telling me hey hi we have this new real
estate company we want you to create a
website hi we're a brand new Italian
restaurant could you build our website
hi this is my name is Jane Doe and I
need my portfolio website cool I'm like
hey my name is Bobby Simmons whatever
and I want a website for my store and
like I'm just building all of this stuff
right I'm building this as if I'm doing
it for a client so that's what I'm
saying guys like I'm trying to see war
how is this video okay yeah so we
basically gone hard man like I finished
all of the react videos now this is all
like all the things that you need to get
you started with react so this is gonna
be exporting while me and you talk here
on YouTube now guys what you see right
now is me
basically launching this course so y'all
can see I ain't playing no games react
hey save let that little thing right
there go and yeah let's get back to this
live feed man I'm just excited man I'm
just really excited about this it took
almost a year guys to get to this point
it took almost a year all the people
that follow me from the beginning that
ya know what I've been doing from the
very very beginning we started with just
you know giving you guys why you should
become a web developer then from there I
came in
gave you guys for three months a whole
bunch of free courses on udemy right
then from there came in I did the
mentorship program right did the
mentorship program then from there we
basically we started doing tutorials on
my own website created that now we
basically putting everything together I
just wanted to create all the resources
for people who don't know anything
because I know a lot of you guys already
know HTML a lot of you guys already know
JavaScript so yes I could have just
jumped in and created the fire projects
at any moment but what happens for Jane
Doe what happens to little Tiffany who
is a waitress and she's trying to become
a web developer was it gonna be fair for
her to just for me to just create
something that was advanced and not give
her a guideline a timeline a road for
her to get to that point to create those
five projects right wasn't gonna be fair
for her no it wasn't so that's what I
did took me nine months to get to this
point we did the HTML course we did the
JavaScript course we did what else we
did everything with the terminal with
the es6 we did got everything like I
don't know what else I mean we even
started laravel the lateral course was
not it's not finished that's fine that's
gonna get done with time but I want to
get this five projects in for you guys
because five projects are the key like a
lot of you guys know how to code let's
be honest a lot of you guys know how to
code you're already under on the right
path right but what's one of the things
that people keep following and they keep
bumping into that same wall which is
what projects do I do
what should I do where do I find a
client where do I going and you know
like
what do i do do I focus on algorithms do
I go through the whole free cocaine
thing he or do I go to coke a day me do
I go to teen tree house do I do all of
this stuff what exactly is it that's
going to get me a job all right
now this five projects that we're going
to build together me and you basically
you can go in after we build it you can
go in change all the images around right
change all the images around putting
your images the images that you want
images that you feel are our images that
you want for your projects right make it
your own you know you could reuse the
same components into other things right
there is something that I learned from
all over the years like once you build
something once you have that code
forever pretty much right so the things
that we're gonna go over you're gonna
reuse over and over and over again
because you don't need to build things
from scratch anymore that's like that's
one of the craziest thing somebody told
me hey man do you create your you know
your validation every time that you use
react them like no I did it one time
like almost two years ago and then from
there I've been copying the same
validation you know component throughout
my whole career as a developer you're
not supposed to be rewriting everything
that you do sometimes you come in you
tweak it you make it you make it your
own way for for that project whatever
specific project you working on but you
don't go and do things over and over and
over again like when you go to a job and
you say hey they actually hey can you
build a validation form for this
whatever let's say a contact form for
example right if you come in and you
build it in less than an hour because
you already have done that before
P
was gonna come in but I know sure this
kid is he's doing his thing right he
knows what he's doing
and that's very very important that is
super key because you're not supposed to
rewrite the code constantly you supposed
to like let's say there's certain things
in JavaScript there's certain things in
web development certain things that you
only have to do it one time once you do
it one time you have that code forever
right so there's five projects man I'm
just excited man I'll be honest man I'm
just excited because I'm about to kill
the game with this like this is this is
like legit guys this is legit legit
legit legit like I'm gonna show you guys
the project that we're gonna be working
on the very first one is the resting
I've been telling people you gotta do a
realistic and the main reason is because
you have a real estate website right you
see all of those things here all of this
stuff here is going to take major
JavaScript it's not gonna be like some
simple things oh yeah it's just two
three things now we're talking about
really filtering data and creating the
pages and rearranging everything
accordingly to whatever people choose
here and if you come in and say hey I
want this to be four hundred euros you
supposed to see only the one star at
four hundred euros all right so it's
like all of this stuff is gonna rerender
itself we're gonna have a dummy data a
whole bunch of dummy data or maybe I'm
trying to figure out how the Zillow API
cuz I I heard that you could connect to
this little API so if we can do that for
free then we're going to do that we're
going to connect to the Zillow API and
get live webs or live apartments live
houses pretty much so we could just hit
the ground running man but there's gonna
be a cool project man there's gonna be a
very cool project I'm excited I'm
excited on what I'm gonna build with
this thing because it's gonna it's just
gonna help people out man
like right now I'm uploading to YouTube
the the react course which I broke it
down I'm being honest I broke it down
like straight dummy-proof
like straight idiot-proof that's how
they call it that's how they call it in
you know basically in the industry
you say hey idiot-proof you want
something idiot-proof that's what I feel
that's my my strength right my strength
is not to come here and break things
down super complicating super complex
like let's say fun fun function right
he's a great youtuber but what he does
is completely different than what I do
right I come here and I break it down in
an easier way where I can say hey guys
see this button see this function this
is what happens when you click that
button simple right
sometimes people need that sometimes
people need simplicity right something
that they could come in and be like oh I
got this other course from somewhere
else could be Steven grab it could be
coal steel could be coaching treehouse
whatever it is that you're using right
and sometimes you bump into this walls
where you're like man I don't understand
this person right they're talking to me
in it's like a different languages it
goes over your head right my job is to
break things down so you don't have to
go to the things that I want meaning
whatever I had to go through to learn
react you shouldn't go through that
right in that sense like I should break
it down to you in a way where you can
say oh things make sense you know what I
mean like you could just come in but oh
sure
react Mac react makes sense
kate's you know like you know what i
mean like that's the idea behind it I
always tell people I'm not here to to
give you the big words I'm not here to
be act like I'm the smartest guy in the
world now I'm here to take something
that's difficult and something that
people think in their head oh my god I
cannot be a developer I can now learn
this and just break it down but like so
you know two plus two that's four that's
it that's programming that's how I like
to break things down I like to just
bring it down put it to you know human
base levels of just like hey anybody
could come here you know the other day I
had my my nephew Justin and I just
pretty much broke down how to create a
functioning basically like an on click
event right and he's I think 9 or 10 and
he got it two minutes later he was
making his own functions and making his
own button and creating his own little
alerts right when I first started
learning JavaScript to me all that stuff
was flooring I still didn't understand I
was like wait what you put a thing here
in the attribute that says I'll click
and you gotta put in a little thing with
two little parentheses wait what what's
going on here right it took me a while
to understand it but now it's like I
come in break you down to somebody but I
think this how things work this is how
easy it is don't worry your body I
gotcha
and man we just killing the game right
now so literally right now I believe the
the video just finished we got it we're
gonna do this live right now guys we
just we we that hype right now I'm hype
this is what you call hype all right
when you just hype and users like you
don't know how to act you're like oh man
it's like a kid who just who knows is
that he got the the newest PlayStation 5
under the tree
just can't wait he's not going to sleep
that's how I feel right now so it's like
pretty much we're gonna upload this live
it's already on the website literally
it's already on the website if you are a
member of my website go right now go
check it out it's life now the people

all right let's see let's put it let's
put in the tags you go in it's live kids
man this is my process there's hard cool
things when you guys see my videos this
my whole process I come in putting some
tags you know putting the the title on
the tag putting a couple of the the
people from YouTube to make sure we get
a low love because if not if we don't
put everybody else on this thing then
the algorithm I don't even like putting
nobody on my tags but it's like I have
to because I pretty much
I'm blackballed right I'm blackballed in
sense of they don't because you know
your boy curses Allah and your boy I'm
pretty much I'm a dog when when it comes
to web development like yo you you're
Doug raining outside you can't we can't
be showing you out here so I have to put
in a couple of other youtubers to be
able to catch people's attentions if not
I wouldn't even be shown there trying to
put me under the rug kids they like hey
man so we got okay we got react react
Jes react quick and easy let's see what
else
react EDA react components how to learn
react how to make a component how to
write JavaScript see what else how to a
web development job oops
okay how's it gonna work going on my job
where to get what development policy
react Redux react versus view react
versus angular let's see what else react
vs. everything best framework and javac
spirit and I think that's enough that's

you know you would think like though
they'll give you an award for dropping
eight nine videos
nah they'll be like nah you gotta drop
that one video of per day you know
they'd rather you drop one video for a
day instead of you dropping five six
videos in one shot like they don't care
about that they're like nah we don't
care about your your commitment to you
to what we care about is consistency so
it's better to drop a video drop one
video per day then drop ten videos in
one shot so that's what we're doing
right now man we we uploading right
after we uploading we we puttin it on
on a timer everyday well tomorrow is
gonna be one released at 12 o'clock so
the next video is gonna be a 2 o'clock
then the next day is gonna be a total
o'clock then Monday is gonna be a 4
o'clock and then every day from the week
is gonna be one video at 4 o'clock so
yeah make sure you like this video make
sure you leave a comment leave something
man just show love man you see me here

right now
all right I mean it's not a wrong it's
just it's always funny so let me see let
me see who else is in here okay so we
got silver blade we got Jason Francisco
Caballero we got Kate Ellis over here
like this doing the Uzi
we got CP we got alibi cheater buddy
what is that
Oh so look for friends okay my people
from France okay let me see we got
Zachary Taylor Joel you're never
responded to my email my DM I haven't
seen your email or your DM I haven't
looked at my emails today I haven't
checked in like two days
I don't know man people always try to
take the sauceman of the udemy courses
Joe recommends I'm finding Cole's class
while good does have some flaws anyone
else feel the same way I mean everybody
has flaws man and I've noticed that and
it's fine nobody's perfect
you know what I mean like you take a
course right you take like Coastal's
course I and you might be like oh man
the certain things that he don't explain
it right or he don't go to and F into it
and it's like sometimes you can't go in
depth with everything under the Sun cuz
then you gotta understand this guy's
there's like the number one thing that I
want everybody to take out of this video
cuz you know me I'll come in I do a lot
of crazy antics and do a lot of crazy
stuff on this channel right but take
this one little comic in this one little
gem there's a gem right here guys you're
not going to learn everything basically
from learning from courses right there's
certain things that you're only going to
learn by experience no matter what
nobody can come in there there's no
course that's going to simulate every
single thing under the Sun there's
nothing like that there's no course out
there course is what they're supposed to
do is break down difficult topics and
break it down for you in a way where
it's easier for you to understand it or
easier for you to be able to start
thinking in a certain way or easier for
you to start looking at a documentation
and being able to do whatever changes or
whatever you need for your project to
get done alright because everything is
going to come from experience like let's
say right now um let's say an example
right let's say you wanted to build
a fake Spotify right you want to create
y'all um audio player you want to create
your own video player there are certain
things that no course is out there it's
going to teach you right there's no
course out there that's going to teach
you how to make a video player from
scratch there's no course out there
that's going to teach you every single
thing about the the video or the audio
API there's no course like that right so
how are you going to learn it the only
way you're going to learn it is by
experience going in there and building
the project and bumping into blocks on
the road to completing your project and
then pretty much once you're done then
you realize oh sure I learned so much
now I know how to build a video player
from scratch and you know whatever
whatever it might be right but this
really no course out there for that or
like let's say an example in my company
they use chase chase banking system so
we had to create a payment gateway that
connected to chase that connected to
Apple pay that connected to PayPal that
connected to a whole bunch of stuff
there's no course out there that teaches
us hey this is how you connect to Chase
API there's nothing out there like that
but from the courses that I've taken in
the past now I know how to dink in a
certain way to find the solution to any
problem that there is out there you know
when you take a course I want people to
understand this you take a course
because like I said you want somebody to
break down a difficult problem and teach
it to you in an easier way or you want
to be able to find stuff through a
documentation and be able to create
whatever or find a solution whatever
you're building never think that
somebody's going to come in and go like
this to your head nobody's gonna grab
you and go like this see ahead and say
thing now you learned everything
nobody's going to do that for you
the only thing that's gonna do that in
touching the top of the head right there
right on the back of you you're here the
back of your head the last little here
and it's gonna touch in clay thing and
make everything make sense is experience
right why I'm also excited with these
five projects course that I'm gonna
build what because I literally I think
it's gonna be the most difficult thing
I've done in a long time create all five
projects which are gonna be as if I'm
building it for clients and at the same
time explain it to people on what's
going on and break it down in an easy
way where you guys gonna be able to
learn it is it gonna be a challenge yes
it's gonna be a challenge am I gonna be
challenged the next two months yes okay
but at the same time my payoff is gonna
be that a lot of you guys he's gotta be
able to do this on your own from now or
after you see that you know what I mean
so does Cole Cole steals course have
certainly no flaws yeah Steven Grimes
courses have flaws this Stifel grata for
some reason keeps using this this dumb
example of cards he used it for a new
goal goal and course he used it for what
was it the elixir course he used it for
a couple of different courses and to me
is the wrong way to teach those topics
right but at the same time it's like he
has good things in other other parts
like you know he knows how to break down
with his the way how he explained things
is really good I like how he creates his
diagrams
it makes things to be easier to
understand it
alright I feel like for me
have certain flaws which I know you know
like if you're looking for me to come in
and explain to you something like super
and F like go really really down the
rabbit hole like somebody like I said in
the beginning like somebody like fun fun
function that's not me you know what I
mean I'm I'm more of the person that you
look for after you like say an example
you went to teen tree house you try to
learn react and you're like oh my god
this thing is so hard so difficult to
understand right you went through some
where you went through a third party it
doesn't matter who it is you're sending
your head this is too hard that's when
you come to me I break it down to you in
simple words in real situations and
break a problem that was difficult and
so easy easy problem you know easy PC
you know what I mean like that's my
skill but like I said I'm sorry I went
to like alone alright it was not looking
right it's just a long explanation but
yes everybody everybody has flaws
there's no course out there that's
perfect and nobody's going to be able to
teach you everything under the Sun the
only thing that's going to teach you
that is experience make a snapchat brow
I have a snapchat but the problem with
snapchat is I don't like the idea that
it disappears I just don't like it I
don't like the idea
I like Instagram you can follow me on
Instagram go to coding phase search
coding phase on Instagram and you will
find your boy right I don't like
snapchat because you can't you can't
save it it's not being saved it's like
you do a story and that's it it
disappears
let me see when I was I'm reading
everybody from sir from selling dope to
selling coke Ron mom you crazy
let me see who's from Houston am I the
only one a my people for each town you
dig yeah you know about the sauce twins
right that's that's my peoples right
there man you know hey let me see okay
just hit the like button man for oh you
just hit the like button it's not gonna
hurt you it's not gonna blow up hit the
like button okay
preview to the course yo yo yo we are
gonna MPM the ish out of the modules the
5 course is going to be on YouTube or
coding phase it's on the website
brah keep it low-key what the venom is
now high that's what a lot of developers
are self taught it's about discipline
yes
sup joke killing it brah
what up let me see who's in here
experience is the best teacher yes sir
experience is going to teach you
everything you learn you learn you
called you research you take the second
look at what you learn you code etc are
repeat yep will you recommend a master's
degree in website development nah nah
man I don't even know I don't even know
if there's a web designer was it website
development masters that sounds shady
you know like somebody comes to me you
know it's like somebody comes to me and
tells me like you know like yo you want
to take this masters of web development
somebody comes to me and tells me that
you're right now this this the meme that
I'll just I just give them like y'all oh
yeah somebody comes to me and be like yo
I see a commercial let's say I'm online
right and I see a commercial from like
University of Phoenix and University of
Phoenix is like or deaf Mountain and
that Mountain comes to me like hey guys
we are offering a what site development
masters this is warmer this i'ma look at
them boy if you don't you for real
matter right we got to put that we gotta
put that one more time somebody comes to
you with somebody comes to you with with
a freaking University of Phoenix website
development master or boy like I'll
believe in that because you don't need a
master's for this man you don't need a
master's you don't need to be a master
in this thing you need to be witty with
your brain understand how to read
documentation know the basics and that's
saying oh and that's where everybody
goes well now but for real that's all
you really need you know that's all you
really need right now you don't need
nothing too crazy man man like I just
broke down this thing literally like I
just thought about it I'm like yo I
cannot believe that when I first started
learning react I thought react was so
difficult right I broke it down in this
very simple example right we have a
component here have a component here and
then above this there's a parent
component right there is data being
passed down from the parent component to
this component into this component right
we're also passing down a function right
when you come here you click
automatically this rear Enders which is
the data there's the only component
basically the only element that has this
data right so daunting that re-renders
is this nothing that you see here at
re-renders everything stays the same
except until we get to 50 when it gets
to 50 this on the background changes and
then as you can see we click it one more
time and one more time and every renders
right here sorry you are dead now of
course what you're seeing right now is
the final product of the react course
right now you're probably gonna think
wait this is so simple right
why will somebody get paid a lot of
money to basically learn this right well
when you look at react from afar and you
look at it from a certain angle you will
look at any but my god it's so much new
stuff this es6 this classes there's
arrow functions there's you know JSX
HTML and javascript like there's so many
things that in your head you're like oh
my god is it so difficult but when you
put all those things to the side you're
like wait this thing is dumb this thing
is so easy a caveman can do it and
that's what I just did in this this
course man like I just broke it down
literally from here
now when we're gonna jump into the fire
projects which are going to be very
complex you're gonna be like holy shoot
I just learned react from watching nine
videos and I know this stuff alright now
when we jump to the five courses the
five the five projects there's gonna be
more complex things that you're gonna be
a holey shoe all the stuff that we learn
in this little dumb course the little
dumb tutorial of react it's pretty much
what react is all about right so I'm
amazed I'll be honest you know how how
you just like you do something that
you're amazed and you're like holy SH or
and just pat yourself in the back like
that's what I'm doing right now because
it took me a long time to really
understand react from like the top to
bottom
and like now I just broke it down like
you know you guys don't get it you guys
don't get what why this day man you know
when you you do something that's
difficult and just break it down to like
like this this tiny little thing that's
what I just did man I'm I'm hyped right
now right now I'm about to just boy I'm
bossy don't from the three-point line
man from half-court
that's how hype I am I like from
half-court like this in the end we hear
kids we don't do something amazing right
now this is crazy
oh man all right I still gotta upload a
whole bunch of videos how many videos we
got let me see let me add another one
and more video we got the setting of
Iron Man we got a quick quick pic
quick peek under the hood let me see
what else
yeah man this is crazy
we did that impossible
I've seen people create like react
horses are like three hours long four
hours long and I'm like go I broke it
down in an hour
like maybe 45 minutes like don't think
you guys understand why I just there
right now think that's crazy and of
course I mean I've been doing this for
like three years I've been messing with
react for three years so by now I should
be ashame of myself if I didn't know how
to how to work with react in three years
thank you know what I mean like I should
be ashamed of myself but luckily I know
what the hell I'm doing you know so
that's great let me see this one is
going for scheduled for Sunday Sunday
12:00 p.m. all right cool now let me see
who's in a chat room right now let me
see let me see the missing agent want to
see if you know your only way to show
that is so I what what Steven grad I saw
everything good yeah yes let me see yes
yes so if you don't want to build
performing just want to show them that
you know you know to a degree go for it
fam I've been a front-end developer 12
12 years nobody has ever asked me for
the group
that's so true let me see how long will
it take you to take to make the fire
projects I calculated two months so from
now to September to complete the
complete projects complete all five
projects probably two months let me see
the only thing hard about react is when
you start using Redux yes hello Redux is
used every day man Redux is the best
state management system ever trust me
guys it really saves you let me see
after getting familiar with Java
Scratchy where do you recommend going
for react or PHP I mean it depends what
you want to go if you want to become a
full-stack developer jump to PHP if you
if you're already in the zone of
JavaScript just learn react it's gonna
take your date to learn it that's it if
you learn react Redux is some months
unless you you're having headaches yep
how much do you get paid from freako
camp who I don't get paid nothing from
those guys
I wish them I don't think they even make
money anyways I don't know do they make
money I don't think they have
advertising or anything so
how much JavaScript should I know before
learning react well do you know
functions do you know objects if you
know those things then you're ready for
react that's it when I tell you to learn
react yes jump on react as soon as you
can ok anyone recommend a good angular
course what's that guy's name the
Russian guy
there's some Russian guy on udemy who
well pretty much he makes all his money
from angular his courses are pretty good
his accent is kind of annoying but he's
good
he knows his stuff I mean he works
full-time with just one thing that I
tell people II you know if you work full
time making courses like your courses
are supposed to be amazing cuz you got
nothing else to do all day in your house
you know I mean quick peek
all right let me see pushing over this
stuff live right now kids go to my
website and our kids if you haven't
signed up coding fees calm guys pretty
much it's the best deal literally we
don't know how long we're gonna have
this file out a deal I'll be honest with
you guys like right now we keeping it
because it just is attracting a lot of
my youtubers YouTube subscribers to to
jump on the website but once I get back
into my advertising through Google
Adwords and Facebook ads and all that
stuff it's going back to 1015 dollars a
month so what I will do is I will sign
up now for five dollars keep it for five
dollars because once you have it for
five dollars and five dollars forever
for you right now if you cancel it then
you're gonna have to probably sign up
for the fifteen dollar one or whatever
but keep it at five dollars you know
you're saving yourself so much money we
drop in courses all the time we drop the
new stuff all the time like useful
things like that's one thing that you
know I said from the beginning if I was
to start making courses or start making
anything like it has to be things that
people are gonna use I don't want to be
here like hey guys check out how to make
you know charge you $15 for making a
validation on jQuery like that's not
even worth $2 you know what I mean cuz
you get that for free online you know
you could go on Google and find how to
create validation with jQuery like
little things like that that's easy
anybody could do it but the whole plan
is to basically break down difficult
hapax and break it down in a way where
anybody can learn it you know what I
mean kids and it's good because after
this this course pretty much this react
course that I just did like I'm not
making let me see I'm almost done with
after all the courses that I need to
make on the site so I'm just gonna work
on for the next two months on those five
projects and that's it and I'm not
making more videos for two months
besides that because you already have
everything you already have how to do
HTML CSS sass react JavaScript missing
jQuery because some people want to learn
jQuery but it's fine I probably do loud
before I start making videos
okay my first component all right
cold let me see who's online where my
peoples is at yo Tyrone Calvin man yep
take advantage man yeah let me see I'm
just see though I mean max yes I think
max yes he is not rushing he is German I
don't know
he saw Russian to me yeah but he's good
I like I think he knows his I mean
yeah I mean curse that's it
there goes done there goes the whole
feed as soon as you make me curse I
can't I say the whole feed becomes
nothing Google automatically blocks us
and starts you're gonna see the the
viewer start dropping quick you know
what's your thoughts about Python Python
it's cold man but it's not gonna get you
money man I'll be honest with you guys
man I'll be honest like this guys coming
out of college like four-year schools
guys coming out with masters that are
doing Python I'll be 100% honest you're
just not gonna be able to compete with
those guys because most of those the
well the degrees ended jobs that are out
there for Python they looking for people
in it with a high level of math and a
lot of you guys don't have that right
because you haven't done computer
science you haven't gone through
calculus once or three linear equations
like you guys haven't gone through
all that stuff right so when you go to a
job and you go in and you but hey I
learned pike down from you know from you
to me or hey I learned Python from Chris
Hawks like you know to those guys that
doesn't mean nothing you know you're not
gonna get hired I'm being honest it's
just that simple so don't waste your
time with Python and not saying that I
mean if you want to learn it you can
learn whatever you want you know it's
like me it's like I'm learning I'm
learning constantly a crystal Ling am I
gonna get higher for crystal angry no
probably not
maybe five years from now but not right
now so in reality I'm learning it for no
reason what that's like if you guys you
guys who are it depends when like you
guys are brand-new developers right you
guys a lot of you guys haven't even got
a job yet you guys have even worked a
digital agency which is like the lowest
forms of like development right because
all you're doing is like work pressing
and doing BS jobs right so for you guys
to get into the industry learning Python
is a waste of time I'm being honest you
know I see people go to was this guy's
name
clever programmer and I'm like actually
so many people dear
down like man you guys should not be
here you know what I mean like I see he
has like this huge use community of like
Indian Indian followers on his channel
and like men do they understand that
there's no money for them on Python like
the I don't think people understand that
like there's no future for you in Python
at all so it's like if you're going to
jump on something like if I if I live in
in India right now right if I live in
India and I'm like okay I want to get a
job in the United States there's three
thing
style do Larry PHP know at least angular
or react and then the third the thirteen
will be at least no no js' right those
three things
PHP of JavaScript framework and giving a
react and then from there the third one
would be no GS and then probably even
before I even do any of these three
things here right I will have to learn
WordPress because if you're an Indian
worker right and you're working from
remote most of your jobs are going to be
on WordPress so for you to be wasting
your time and your talents trying to
learn Python it's like the worst thing
you could do now that's just an honest
opinion you know just being honest with
you guys you know now let me see
fan production says were you ever an
interesting app development yes but then
I realized that that wasn't for me that
wasn't you know well friend and
development be outdated due to robot
evolved I don't know you know people
keep saying that every year somebody
comes over like man 20 years from now
there won't be no more jobs because the
robots already gonna have him and it's
like you know what twenty years from now
you know where I'm gonna be a I'm gonna
be chilling I'm gonna make all the money
that I care for web development now so
20 years from now I'm like 49 years old
I don't be like web development what
that's what i'ma be saying and that's
the truth guys like
look it up there's so many people that
are retired by like 42 or 43 or they
open up their own businesses or they
have other side businesses out there
like really do you think do you think
your plan should be like hey you're
still going to be doing web development
20 years from now that sounds crazy like
you know by that time you should have
already evolved into something else you
should have already evolved into
software development form applications
or whatever or even programming the
freaking robots or you know what I mean
like you shouldn't that would be stuck
somewhere like web development is your
first your first love right it's the
first girl that gives it to you right
think about it like this
what developing is that that that first
girl gives it to you the first time
right do you remember her not really I
don't remember who was who was my first
I be honest do I remember that girl no
did I get some skills from her yes and
we moved on to bigger and better things
you know I mean so that's how web
development that's how I look at it I
love what development but web
development is not a place to stay 20 30
40 50 years we are developers we're not
stuck to web development we learn how to
program we learn how to you know
problem-solve we learn how to build new
things you know five years ago the
people even think that there will be
Facebook BOTS you know what I mean like
now people have to create Facebook BOTS
you know or Twitter bottle or whatever
the people ever think that they will be
making those type of smaller
applications are a software-as-a-service
know you evolve we don't know what's
gonna happen in 2025 2030 but I know
that somebody's gonna have to be
programming something even if is hey
let's program
the UI for the for the fridge to turn on
the cold water somebody's gonna get
higher for that
alright somebody's gonna have to program
that so stop worrying about if what the
velum is gonna be here 5-10 years
because if you're thinking like that
you're thinking oh man I'm gonna stay in
web development 5 10 20 years like I
don't know what you you gotta get your
priorities straight
man you know what I mean like the way
how I look at this thing is I have a
plan I had a plan when I first got into
this thing I say you know what I'm gonna
learn how to become a web developer I'm
gonna like coding I like talking about
code I like doing this stuff and I'm
gonna make this thing work for me right
when I go to a job interview I don't go
thinking in my head oh my god I want
this job no in my head I'm thinking I
don't even want to come to this job
because they're gonna give me the job
and I don't want to work for them every
job that I've gone through the past four
or five jobs every time that I go to the
first day on the interview I get hired
so now it's like I haven't even had a
vacation in the sense of like I haven't
had a time I got three months expands
like you know of three just chill relax
I haven't had that because what
development has been so hot that I'm
constantly it doesn't matter if I quit
the job tomorrow the next day I'll get
another job the most I've spent without
a job has biggg has been a week in three
days you know what I mean like whatever
that means hot and it's still gonna be
even more harder because everything is
connected to the web you know what I
mean like no matter what the web is
everything now the internet it's
everything now I remember when I was
young I was sort of my mom like y'all
tell my mom oh please mommy let me
borrow some money
I could put Google Adsense back then
when I had gotten an invitation from
Google themselves back in 2001 look it
up there was like nobody using Google
accents right I had a website yes it was
some little kid stuff Dragonball Z
whatever I had a website of half a
million people going to my website at 14
years old fourteen-years-old half a
million people going to my website every
month right and I asked my mom let me
get a credit card so I could put in
basically it was a neighborhood critical
it was a bank account so I could connect
my website to Google Adsense and she was
like now they're gonna steal my credit
card and this and that
and then now it's like everything is
done through the internet and they're
like now she who's like she's always I'd
the other day like oh yeah like wow you
was into this since back then I'm like
yeah dummy I've been saying this for
years like I've been doing web
development I bring into the web for
years you know what I mean like this
thing is not gonna stop now at all this
thing is only going to go up and the
people that come in now like it's a a
good window that's gonna close at some
point it's a good window that's gonna
close the people who are any those other
people are gonna make a lot of money you
see how years ago man years ago like you
know the 1800s was the people who owned
the farm the people that own the a mail
is like the same people that created the
factories in the beginning right when
you got those people I got into it at
that moment dear their families are
still multimillionaires
til this day right you get into the
industry now you're already earning two
to three times more than everybody else
in the United States right I'm talking
about 120,000 hundred forty thousand if
you learn goldang you're gonna earn a
hundred eighty thousand
you're like this close to a doctor a
doctor spent 10 years to learn this to
get to where he's at and then he starts
earning money so for 10 years he's
behind if me like the same example me
and a doctor okay who who who became a
doctor and in the same example go head
head-to-head right I'm 20 now he's 29
he's been going to school since 20 years
old and then I've been going to school
from were like 20 to like 24 and then
I've been coding and making money since
24 years old
I'm 29 he hasn't made no money in all
this time right and then by the time he
starts making money I switch up and I
started you know working as a go length
developer making $180,000 right I'm
already making 140 sunny right but let's
say I get another 40,000 all right let's
say that right I'm this close I'm this
close to getting that 300,000 that he's
making a doctor makes like about three
hundred thousand dollars a year and it's
a continues to get there I came in did
in six months and I've been earning
before him he even started earning
anything so this goes to show you guys
like this is the future right now let's
say an example right all of the stuff
that I'm doing right right now you guys
I talk to you guys like you guys are my
friends like you guys know me right
let's look at it like this my website is
coming up every single day more people
signed up more people are following
YouTube is giving me more more
subscribers Google is giving me a better
SEO ranking every single day I'm pretty
much becoming and something that you
call an authority in this BS industry
right
all of the stuff is done because I got
into web development if it wasn't
because of web development where would I
be Raina I will be working in Queens
Center Mall in the parking lot or I will
be working in in our money exchange that
I used to work on over the in Queens
Center Mall earning $12 an hour maybe
now after 10 years I would have been
manager earning $18 an hour you know
what I mean like you can't come into
this thing thinking five years from now
this thing is gonna disappear five years
from now no you're a developer you're
not a web developer you just happen to
do what development now you don't know
where you gotta be
two years from now all the skills that
you're learning from this you transfer
it to other things everything that I've
learned from what development in
companies that I've learned I've worked
for
it's everything that I do here
everything that I do in YouTube the
marketing the you know getting people to
sign up helping people out those are
skills that I learned as a web developer
because everywhere I went people always
ask me Hey Joe what's the latest thing
that's out there was the latest
framework I come in I break it down for
them everybody comes in junior
developers asked me all the time
how do you do this how can I learn this
I come in I'll break it down for them
and everybody's eyes open something's
like oh sure it makes sense I'm not the
most articulate person there's like oh
the most well-spoken person in the world
I'm not again I repeat it's like it's
like you know I look at fun fun function
right as like an elite when it comes to
web development I just don't know who is
that for what audience that is right
he's an elite LLC
Oh basically I would say a man's man
like you know like somebody like you
have a friend that could break things
down for you that's my whole niche right
so that's what I do man and all of the
stuff is thanks to web development I
mean you guys is gonna see you you know
what I do man you people who have seen
me
yeah seen the growth man and this is
just nine months you guys I wish I would
have been documenting the the growth
that I did from when I was working in a
more till now so people could have been
like oh shoot this kid is right

like that right or you might see
somebody here from the comments who
right now are your peers and next thing
you might see him oh look at wow
those look at whoa whoa
working at Facebook Wow I remember
seeing him on coding phase comms
chat room things like that happen if you
don't get into it then you just have a
cool story you know how many guys um
like those guys that used to play like
let's say an example I used to play one
of Ron James you know how many of those
guys have stories like man I used to
play LeBron James man I used to bust his
ass like you know and their head is like
oh yeah I used to play with him
well the Bron James got money in his
pocket he perfected his craft he really
went hard those other guys it's not
really about people think it's like it's
like a natural talent it's like oh you
were born to be smart no it's the work
you put in if you come here and you
think that five years from now this
thing is gonna disappear this thing is
gonna be gone or robach is gonna come
and scratch my back and and everything's
gonna be done cuz the robots got here
who you think is making the robot how
much you think he's making you want to
be that guy or you want to be the guy in
McDonald's pressing buttons on uh on a
robot stomach you know what I mean like
I'd rather be the guy chillin making it
you know I mean it's like I bringing it
back to you know like the 1920s nineteen
times you know those guys that started
the was it then this relize system I
forgot the name of it but they started
you know building factories in and
putting things in on the line and
building like you know for they're like
those guys til this day their family are
living good because a few people came
into the game it's like right now look
at Mark Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg made
one of the dumbest things in the world
Facebook the he he did he get stuck with
Facebook know they're building a whole
bunch of other stuff
that's part of that company so pretty
much from a dumb idea that he came up
with because he knew how to program any
of us at that moment some
came to us I'm like can you build this I
would have any I could build it did I
build it no he took the opportunity ran
with it
built it somebody believed and they put
some money behind it promoted it right
look where he's at
that's for a web development that's not
from computer science that's not from
nothing that's from PHP what development
guys now that's all I'm saying you know
what I mean like don't let nothing stop
you really go hard man you don't want to
be another story out here of like oh man
I remember when I used to CEO Philippe
Valente Gomez on on coding phase calm
man he was in the chat room where he had
now he got his own companies chilling
making money you know you got freaking
uh Matt you know Matt surprises me all
the time and now because he always shows
love but I'll be going through his
github and I'm like yo this kid is
working he's building stuff constantly
like his age a lot of those people don't
are not doing that you know I wasn't
doing that I was you know I was blowing
the backs out at that age man I was
chilling I wish I would've had my mind
right and was focused man so that's what
I'm saying I want you guys to really go
hard man you know I'm really just trying
to motivate you guys man I hope you guys
that that you guys take this and you
know take this as motivation man you
know what I mean I see
this is what I'm saying though so we got
coolie
we got Coolio coolie is like he's trying
to G check the G so he's like yo
surgeons make 500,000 even so primary
care Doc's make four hundred thousand
per year though I see what you're trying
to say though bro are you trying to G
check the G look it up man how much does
a brand-new doctor primary care doctor
we're not talking about you looking at
statistics statistics wise if we go into
it and be like hey how much is a
developer in San Francisco making he
could be making 200 something thousand
plus bonuses and I'm not even throwing
those numbers out there like that
right I'm just throwing the regular
real-life situations a guy living in
Minnesota type of you know numbers you
know what I mean like I'm being honest
if your surgeon
how long does does that take you to
become a surgeon
that's like about 15 years sometimes
even twenty years day if you're trying
to really specialize and say that's a
long time to just be sitting in a
classroom
why have you noticed that when you go to
a hospital they have like the BS little
doctors little interns they got to do
intern for like three to four years in
the front the doctors how old are the
doctors doctors like the legit doctors
the guys are making the real money how
old are those guys those guys are like
40-something years old they've been
studying their whole life to make money
right to make that five hundred thousand
