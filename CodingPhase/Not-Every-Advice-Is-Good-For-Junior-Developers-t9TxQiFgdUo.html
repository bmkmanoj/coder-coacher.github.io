back at it again coding face.com
listen guys today's topic while I Drive
from Queens to all the way to Long
Island where I live all right there's a
topic not every advice that people give
here on YouTube Facebook Twitter and
medium or any other format or any other
blog out there is for junior developers
you gotta understand that you know like
today you know another developer who was
in here in the live chat room was like
hey PHP is not good PHP is this and
you know I don't want to become the PHP
guy defending PHP all the time but at
the same time I want to be able to give
an advice that anybody can take anybody
can can actually get something out of it
you know because most of the people that
are looking through their mediums and
you know medias and blogs and YouTube's
in whatever they're looking for answers
they're looking for the right place
they're looking for the right resource
so a lot of times even other youtubers
or other bloggers they give an advice
whether it be like hey man you know PHP
is super dead but somehow PHP is 80% off
the web so how can it be dead right and
then on top of that what people don't
talk about is that you know
like no matter what you do there's
always jobs for PHP out there I
don't know why you know to me personally
if it was up to me I will switch to
something else
like I love Ruby I love crystal lang
ah you know I love JavaScript not for
the back end but I do love JavaScript um
but yeah and when I see that I'm like
you know it's cool but then at the same
time what sucks is as a brand new
developer you think like oh this is
garbage this is and like you're
like you never get to murder PHP and
then when you go to a job interview and
they actually do you know WordPress do
you know you know Drupal do you know
alarum oh those are the positions that
they give to junior developers so if you
don't know PHP you're basically missing
out because somehow the guy is going to
be smart enough it's going to say okay
these are the skills are they looking
for for a junior developer there's what
they're hiring so you got a better
chance because now you know exactly what
what you need to take all right but if
you listen to everything everybody that
comes here and goes in front of a camera
if you listen to everybody that writes a
blog or everybody who writes a comment
you don't know their background you know
like sometimes like for me I can say PHP
is and PHP I wish I could work on
something else and I probably could
if I wanted to but at the same time for
a brand new developer they said it's
actually a blessing you know because
nobody in the industry wants to work
with PHP meaning anybody who's a
developer who has been coding for more
than three years doesn't want to work
for any web site that's on PHP right so
what does that leave that leaves you
guys who are brand new developers brand
new junior developers the opportunity to
take those jobs you know because all the
other guys they want to act like they're
too good for that I oh I'm so good I
want to work with nodejs well I want to
work with Java I want to work with you
know Ruby on Rails or I want to work
with you know now crystal Lang whatever
it is right everybody once you become a
seasoned developer you have those
choices you have those options but
regular guys like you and the other guy
next to you you guys don't have those
options you guys need a job in your
first two or three months if you're a
developer and you can't find a job in
less than a month you did something
wrong and that's the truth guys it
doesn't matter what state you at what
setting you from if you can't find a job
in one month you did something wrong and
it's that simple
no matter how you look at it no matter
how somebody you know points it out and
be like oh this there's no jobs in my
city no it's not that there's no jobs in
your city you study the wrong thing and
this happens in every single or career
there's people who you know somehow
they're still studying for graphic
graphic design right
knowing that right now there's no jobs
for graphic designers this only jobs for
user interface
you know UX UI design
or web designers those other people are
getting jobs so if your your are
freaking if you're a college student and
you're studying graphic design there's
no job for you because there's barely
anybody printing anything or there's
barely anybody doing graphic tees like
those jobs are are gone they're not
coming back you know what I mean so this
happens to it and web development and
programming in general there's like
people also to who you know they study
engineering or they study a specific
type of engineering and then don't take
no computer classes and then when they
graduate they end up in a job
that they hate or they can't find a job
and they're like man I can't find a job
now I got to go to a boot camp and study
programming when it's like you gotta
 a computer science degree
you got an engineering degree what the
 was you're doing all this time
you're telling me that you was taking
all those classes and none of your
elective classes you took programming
class you telling me you we came up you
graduated with an engineering degree and
you still can't find a job because you
didn't take no programming classes this
is what happens to people so when I tell
you guys learn PHP is for a reason it's
because I've been down that road
I was stuck being a front-end developer
for like two three years because number
one I was like too scared to touch the
back the back end I thought I was like
oh I'm good I already know JavaScript
I'm gonna hear but number one you don't
get to grow when you only know
JavaScript and you understand the the
JavaScript ecosystem that's all you know
you can't deal with other types of
problems you can't deal with scripting
language you can't deal with that
happens in jobs
you know so I'll tell people like you
gotta be smart you got to look around
your area and think hey what type of
jobs they own you know what type of jobs
I'll hear in my neighborhood you know be
smart use your brain
don't listen to everything that is out
there on the internet because somebody
might give an opinion that's bias like
me I give you an opinion that's gonna
help you in general it doesn't matter
what setting you from it doesn't matter
where you live it doesn't matter if you
live in Alaska it doesn't matter if you
live in Florida the advice that I give
you is a real or real advice I'm not
saying real like some people somebody
left me a comment like the other day is
like Oh programmer by day gangster by
night which to me sounds ridiculous and
sounds dumb as hell because where do you
see a gangster just because I wear a hat
and I speak a certain way doesn't mean
I'm a gangster you know what I mean and
I'm not trying to be that a gangster
design That's not me you know what I
mean so now just because you say real
when I say real out of me like all this
person's real like you know it's like
trying to be funny with it no I'm saying
I'm just being real and honest with
people I'd rather tell you the truth
then you go out here and span you know
you go to a boot camp and you will study
for Ruby on Rails right you go to a boot
camp and sign up pay $20,000 you
graduate and then you figure out that
when you graduate you can't find a job
because in Ruby on Rails
they only hire senior level developers
because there's a lot of people that
want to work with Ruby on Rails it's
like literally the best framework so
senior developers from PHP they go and
apply for positions in Ruby on Rails as
a senior developer or from JavaScript or
whatever or like from any other language
like this people wore
we've been coding for 10 years in Java
or C sharp and they hate it and they're
like you know what I'm gonna apply to a
no js' position so now you who is a
junior developer you're you're
not going to get that job because that
other ten years behind them you know
what I mean
now when it comes because that means
there's always going to be a job for you
you know like PHP is like the first
language that you should be working on
you know after HTML CSS and JavaScript
PHP is the next language that you should
be working on because there's so much
opportunity on it for junior developer
I'm not saying for mid-level developer
I'm not talking to for senior developer
because once you touch mid-level PHP is
boring
you're like you already know this you
know what I mean you want to challenge
yourself and working in a cool
environment getting oh cool I want to
work on no Jess oh cool I want to work
with you know Ruby on Rails that's when
you should you do the switch but when
you're a junior developer there's no
other place that's gonna give you that's
gonna give you any more opportunities
like it at all
there's no other programming language
that's gonna get you working right away
look right now I want all of you guys
I'm gonna give you guys a challenge this
is your homework for tonight I want you
to go on Craigslist right now and or
even if you're right now you can
whatever after this video I want you to
go on Craigslist there's a section where
it says jobs right on that section
there's another section that says web or
engineering I think it's something like
that web we're engineering right you
click that right and then there you
search PHP right you're gonna find a
whole bunch of jobs
now you search nodejs there's not gonna
be that many jobs there you search any
other programming language there's not
gonna meet that many jobs there now why
do I bring up Craigslist Craigslist is
like the last resort for company when a
company puts an ad on indeed.com
dice calm monster calm whenever they can
find a person to fill that position they
go to Craigslist because they know on
Craigslist they're gonna find somebody
right away it means those are people who
are ready to work that same day if
you're in Craigslist it means you're
ready to get a job that same day
sometimes there's not going to be
quality jobs they're going to be quality
jobs meaning you're going to have a
 you know benefits and all this
other but it's going to get you in
the door of the industry it's going to
get you working that's what's important
the most important for you guys is to
have a job that's the biggest barrier
that you're going to have you can get
any other like you know none of the cool
jobs you can get it if you're not from
like a real prestigious school like if
you want to NYU or you went to UCLA or
you went to Harvard or you want to
 Duke or you want to one of those
schools if you go to a prestigious
college right and you study computer
science there don't expect to get a
 an amazing job straight out of
college straight or straight out of boot
camp or straight out whatever because
that job isn't that dream job is not
there for you
now if you're somebody who's out here
and you're trying to work and you say
you know what I have a goal to work at
Google I have a goal to work at Facebook
then you have a different trial type of
grind you have a whole different way to
get there than somebody who went to an
Ivy League school your grind is to have
a very solid portfolio a very solid
resume to say hey I worked for a
you know I work for MTV I've worked for
a Viacom I work for Time Warner I worked
for what else Yahoo I work for whatever
other company out there I work for AT&amp;amp;T
that's your way in to those big
companies because once here you already
have a job and you have to experience
then they're gonna look at you if you're
thinking that you're gonna get there
right away and you're putting all your
eggs on that basket you're like yeah man
once I finish this bootcamp once or once
I'll take off and I finish this courses
I'm good I'm gonna be golden that's not
going to happen kids we have to be
realistic here it's not going to happen
there's got to be people who are gonna
get it and that's going to happen to
them but that's like look that's like
people winning the lottery that's not
the norm so you got to get out from this
idea of like living in this fantasy
world where it's like oh I wanna my
first job is going to be doing all the
cool technologies that's out there it's
not gonna happen to you
you know at all like it's just not and
that's just me being honest with you
guys because I rather tell you the truth
then me come here and tell you guys like
hey guys anybody could work at Google or
anybody can go and work at this in this
like it's not gonna happen for you guys
and I'd rather tell you it's not gonna
happen not because I want to hate on you
I want to bring you down it's because I
want to give you a realistic approach if
it happens it happens and I congratulate
you know I may be like yo
congratulations you do your thing you
busted your ass over this years now
you're here you know what I mean
but the reality of things is a lot of
you guys is not gonna get that so what
can you do you can say okay I'm gonna
bust my ass for the next two years
I'm gonna build a solid portfolio I'm
gonna build a solid resume of companies
that I've worked for and then I'm going
to apply to those big companies and then
they're gonna look at you seriously
because you got understand you don't
have the competition is too strong this
guy's coming out of MIT like how can you
compete with somebody from MIT like like
I see people like oh I want to study
Python I wanted that's what I want to
study do you understand that most of the
 college graduates from MIT
that's what they come out with they come
out with a bachelor's and in
computer science where basically you
know a focus on Python how can you
compete with those guys
you know what I mean like no matter how
you look at it when you freaking grab
when you finish your courses and you
finish everything and you'll be like oh
you know what I didn't want to study I
didn't want to study PHP I studied X Y &amp;amp;
Z and now I can't find a job and then
you go and blame it on the instructor or
you go and blame it on somebody else and
but I all Joe lied to me and
told me I was going to get a job and
right away but it's like you didn't want
to study the that's going to get
you that first job you got to understand
this industry is all about number one
connections number two who do you know
in the game number three do your name
ring bells meaning do you have a very
popular repo something a project that's
on github that super popular look at
this guy what's the name then I
was a time every month whatever his name
is the guy who created a Redux he's
working for Facebook now this guy came
out of left field this guy came out of
nowhere from Europe it's like now he
working on Facebook and he's like one of
the head people who who work with
Facebook creative react and the new
react fibre how do you think that guy
got there it wasn't by just being at his
house and taking a couple of courses he
busted his ass and built a great
portfolio started doing projects got
himself out there that's how you make it
you know what I mean so it's like for
you guys is the same
you guys got to grind it out this idea
this dream that people have that they
think like oh I'm just gonna you know
I'm gonna become a programmer I'm gonna
end up at at Google or whatever
or whatever XYZ company and they think
that it's going to happen for them just
because they know how to program no
there's a whole bunch of different ways
that people make it in there you know
yeah I don't want to like bring you guys
down or tell you like a don't think that
you're gonna reach to the top it's just
I think there was a I think that was
like an interview from this kid was his
name
Carmelo Anthony right from a long time
ago the accident do you think you're
gonna go to the NBA he said no I don't
think I'm good enough to make it to the
NBA
he was already like on the top of his
game in college and he still didn't
think that he was gonna make it you know
so he was already planning out he's like
yeah I finished my degree you know I'm
ready to once I graduate if I don't get
drafted I'm going I'm getting I can get
in a good job and I'm gonna be good I'm
still gonna make money I'm gonna live my
life I want it you know so he didn't
have all his eggs in one basket he
wasn't saying oh my god if I don't if I
don't become an NBA player I don't know
what I'm gonna do with my life
this happens to people all the time they
plan out things and they'd be like oh
they're gonna become you know there's
great programmers and then they don't
plan out for me I'm the type of
person I'd rather think negative so then
when the positive things come I can be
happy for it
you know what I mean it's better to be
and think negative about things instead
of you thinking positive all the time
and like oh yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna get
this this job of nodejs right away with
no experience no real projects no
portfolio no real client and you're
thinking that you're gonna get that
nodejs job it doesn't work like that
and also when I tell you very PHP is
because that's the easiest way for
somebody who has no experience who's
never worked in the industry who's
coming out of left field and doesn't
have a degree in this it's like the
easiest way all you have to do is get
that first job once you get that first
job you good you get that first job
after that you get another better job
and that's how everybody else does it
you know so that's why I tell you guys
man I want you guys to I want you guys
to succeed and be good man I want you
guys to to have a really good a really
good career in this because I know you
could do it I did it I grinded it out
you know I didn't have a computer
science degree people ask me oh but you
had a programming programming and
systems degree which was which
was an IT degree it wasn't like I had a
computer science I wouldn't live the
same way how you guys go in without a
degree in computer science you know
where people look you know some people
might look down upon that and be like oh
you don't have a degree so what did I
have to do I have to grind it out I have
to go in I have to take the first
 job you know for 14 $15 an hour
I did that for three months got my
experience went to another job got
50,000 went to another job got 65,000
went to another job got 80,000 won to
another job got over a hundred thousand
like that's just how it is
you keep on moving up every year you
know because that's why I tell people
like this is actually better than then
actually going to college because
somebody who's going to go to college
they're going to spend four years
without earning one single dime
they're not going to earn your money
while they're in college
they hope to earn something at the end
you know they hope soon to learn
something after they graduate from
college
but it's not even guaranteed at least
with this is like you're not leaving it
up to luck or you know or destiny or
whatever you want to call it you're
basically taking control of your own
life you put in your own hands you say
you know what I'm gonna bust my ass for
the next you know one year two years and
from there that said just do what I got
a don't you know that's how I think you
guys should think man
don't don't listen to everybody that's
out here because everybody's on
different levels you know even when
somebody comes in and tells you oh man
you took forever to code that page or
somebody comes in and tell you I'll tell
you oh man I could have done this in a
in a shorter version or I could have
done this in a better way or more more
easier way but what they don't
tell you is that they've been coding for
a year two years why you only have a
month you know so it's like when
somebody gives you an advice here online
take it for what it is take it for just
that advice it's not something
is not like these people know your
history and you don't know their history
you know what I mean these people here
on YouTube who have never even worked a
day in their life in coding and somehow
they charge in people a whole bunch of
money and they've never worked a day in
their life as a programmer or a
developer like how can you be be asking
people for money when you've never even
freaking you don't have enough
experience you know
or people who have never even worked on
an arts project they've never worked for
you know a fortune 500 company never in
their life and somehow they here on
YouTube giving advice like me I know
what the I've been at I know where
I come from you know and I keep the
real I curse on my videos I say a bunch
of that a lot of people don't like
but my resume is there my
background is is there I've been doing
this for a long time like I just
like to give people real advice real
advice meaning no filter no lying to
people no giving false hope I don't want
to give people false hope because like
when in the beginning for me I
hated that I'm like you know people were
talking about men this job's a hundred
thousand dollars why am i as a junior
developer why I can't get that that was
false hope people were giving our full
soul telling people that everybody could
get that and it's not now
everybody's gonna get a hundred thousand
dollar job on their first year it's not
gonna happen to you that's how you got
to think about it you got to think about
it it's not gonna happen to me when it
does get to me I'm gonna be happy for it
but don't start from the get-go like oh
you think you're gonna get it no because
then you become lazy then you become
arrogant then you think that you have it
like that
and in reality you're still just a
junior developer you have to put in that
work
you know once I get home I'm gonna read
through all the comments right now
driving so that's all just you know I
can't answer to anybody right now sorry
I'm probably getting sick my
throats already acting up but here man
like I'm just saying you know not
everybody's advice is it's towards Julia
developers like you know sometimes I go
in and I watch videos from other people
and I'm like they give good good advice
for someone like me you know like this
sounds that I watch I'm not gonna say
everything anybody's name but I watch
other youtubers and I'm like oh cool
that's a good advice for me but then I
see people from here on their comments
or on their things and they're like oh
yeah man a PSP is why PSP is
doesn't hat and I'm like buddy
you still don't even have a job and
you're you're throwing shade you
on a language that's that could actually
give you a job you're expecting to try
to get into nodejs you are expecting to
try to get into Python Python is way
harder than nodejs
look it up look up look up online I want
you guys to look up online and look up
Python jobs
look Chris Hawkes who knows Python it's
 legit developer he can't get a
job as a Python developer and he's had
it he said it multiple times he's never
worked as a Python developer and it's
not because they freaking you know don't
want him or anything or that he's bad
it's just that it's not that easy you
know it's not that easy at all
especially online like if you feel it
online mandus for python jobs they're
looking for people who are masters in
 in mathematics math and masters
in engineering Lake do you think you
could compete with those guys no let's
be honest you know people want to get
into machine learning they want to get
into AI guys you're not going to be able
to compete with those guys I'm being
honest with you guys you know over the
years after having years of programming
you might be able to get a job like that
because now you have a solid background
for coming off the ground with no
experience with never working at any
company you think you're gonna get those
jobs no man let's be honest here man I
want you guys to have like a clear
pathway to your careers you gotta
understand you got to start from the
bottom and then from there grow never
get stuck in the same place somebody
left a message to the other day saying
oh if they hire you if the company hire
you as a junior developer and you leave
in three months that's like a slap to
the face of no they know that they're
not gonna pay after three months you're
gonna be able to learn so much and
you're gonna know so much that you're
gonna be
up to par with the same people that are
working on that company but will they
talk will they give you the same amount
that they're given to other developers
no they won't because you came in as a
junior developer they're not gonna give
you the same amount i'ma do I won't do
it Christmas at his company he came in
as a junior developer and there's an
advice to Christian - Chris I went into
that company as a junior developer
there's no way that they gotta pay him
as much as they're paying the other mid
and senior level developers in there for
the next year the next two years and he
already has a year there right so if he
wants to make more money and he wants to
grow as a developer the best advice that
I would give him is apply somewhere else
because they're not in that company you
came in as a junior developer they
already look at you as you know somebody
who just came in there at this level
when you go to another company and you
start applying for the next company
they're gonna look at you they don't
know I what level you actually came in
they don't know that if you're a
mid-level they don't know if you're
senior senior level sorry if they don't
know if you're senior level or not right
so if you go to the next company you
apply over there you're gonna get pay
may level to senior level money you know
what I mean but for now for the next
year to two years you're still gonna get
paid the same almost maybe they'll give
you two three thousand dollar raise
every year which is nothing especially
when with everything that you know now
if you apply somewhere else you're gonna
get almost double as much as you're
gonna get over there and also everybody
make sure you tag Christian to this
video so he could get that advice from
your boy Joe because for me you as a
junior developer you cannot get stuck in
one place after if you are already in
one place for six months seven months
eight months
you already know you learned so much for
that company that you're ready to get
way more money somewhere else and like I
said I brought that whole topic up
because somebody else said oh if you
leave in three months from the company
after they then invested in you and give
you an opportunity then the best
investment that they could do is double
your money if right now you're making 40
grand
forty five grand fifty grand whatever
you're making there if they come in and
give you 75 this month then stay there
if not leave because they're not going
to give you every year they're not going
to come in and give you a $5,000 raise
they're going to give you two thousand
three thousand dollar raise because
every company the biggest race that they
give is 3% so that's why as US
developers and Millennials we jump
around from company to company now
because we want to even if we like the
company or we like the people there we
jump around because you get paid more
when you go to another company everybody
knows this you can look it up whenever
you leave a company you know you get
paid way more you know I kind of wish um
this guy Chris hooks will actually say
why he left Geico
because that's a very good question you
know for a lot of people a lot of people
might say Geico is a good company and I
want to know why he left Geico to leave
for another company and I have a feeling
it's because to get a better race to get
more money because he already has enough
experience right so why would he stay in
that company were they not gonna pay him
more soon as he needs to another company
his money is gonna double up
and that's why I've always jumped from
one company to another if a company
right now tells me hey Joan we got a
hundred and forty K right now for you
I'm gone like I'm gone that's it you
know what I mean like loyalty is not is
not to the company because the companies
are not the one that they're not gonna
be loyal to you when they have to make
cuts when they have to to release people
when they have money that comes in
that's extra you know they're not gonna
come in and give you a great bonus
they're gonna come in and give you a
little $2,000 raise $3,000 raise which
is you know what I mean but
yeah man let me see I just got home

stone axe for GPA that's true I've never
heard of a company asking people for GPA
I've never had anybody ask me hey was he
GPA but I'm pretty sure it there might
be a company out there asking for GPA I
think food if they actually for GPA most
of the time it's like an internship or
something like that you know they're not
looking for that shape
alright guys so I see you guys later I
gotta do this tutorial for you guys for
a little bit umm yeah more videos

man it was a good little trip you know
sorry if I sound like better if I sound
like I'm negative or whatever I
just want to be honest with you guys
like I said I just want you guys to have
a real advice not have advice where
people are telling you stuff of you know
it's easy to say hey you know so I so
got hired to Google or so I so
got to go to the NBA but what happened
to those other guys that didn't go to
the NBA that's why I want to know I want
to know the successful stories of those
guys that they're busted their ass in a
you know school like UCLA or or Duke or
UConn or whatever and those guys that
busted their ass playing ball they
didn't get to be in the NBA but somehow
right now to this thing they got more
money than the guys that were NBA
players and that happens a lot you know
what I mean so those are the stories
that I care about I don't care about the
guys that won the lottery I care about
the guy that got to own a bunch of gas
stations he wanted to you know all
 you know get the lottery he said
 I can't win the lottery but I'm
gonna take my done it in my destiny and
take control of it and say hey I'm just
gonna buy a whole bunch of gas stations
and I'ma play the lottery on my
own gas station if I want to you know
what I mean like those are the people
that care but I don't want to hear the
successful stories of you know it's like
when I listen to like Gary Vee like Gary
Vee is another guy who you know when you
look into his background his background
is he already had money when
graduated you know when he he basically
became successful so it's like I don't
really care about that that person give
me the story of the person who had
nothing and became something you know
what I mean don't tell me the story of
the person who went to the MBA because I
want to know what happened to those
other guys that they played their whole
life to become NBA players and then it
get to make it you know what I mean so
it's the same thing as what develop me I
don't want to give you guys two stories
of hey I'm a successful developer here
ended up at Spotify or I ended up by
 Google I ended up at distance in
this those are like unicorns you
don't see that those people are like
 leprechauns you don't see them
you know what I mean I'd rather give you
a story of a guy who came here came
online learn share his own somehow ended
up in a whole bunch of companies that
most people can't get into can't get
hired I didn't make it to Google to make
it to Facebook gotta make it to none of
those companies not because I want it
now because I didn't want to or that
they didn't want me it because it really
did not call my attention you know what
I mean
I have other passions and other dreams
so when I tell you guys like yo you
could actually have a better life
working in other businesses businesses
where people know your name businesses
where you could actually make a
difference you will work at Google
you're not making a difference at all go
read it read what everybody guys had to
have left those companies those guys
sound miserable those guys are not happy
you know what I mean like those guys are
not they didn't have a great time there
you know so for you guys are putting all
your baskets
your all your eggs in one basket and
just thinking like oh man I'm just going
to learn no js' I'm going to become the
best node.js developer
and it's like okay buddy you could go
ahead put all your eggs in that one
basket and then don't come to me and
