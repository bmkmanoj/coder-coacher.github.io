sure you subscribe man don't forget to
subscribe him don't forget to click the
notifications down there at the bottom
somewhere make sure you subscribe we're
gonna teach you some JavaScript
functions today right alright so we're
gonna go very simple today all right
javascript functions what is a
JavaScript function right so what is a
function a JavaScript function is a
block of code designed to perform a
particular task a JavaScript function is
executed when something calls it all
right so let's say your boss wants you
to give him the total cars made
yesterday and today so pretty much what
does that means it means give me the
total so add whatever was from yesterday
and whatever is from today whatever got
made all right
so instead of us having to repeat
ourselves in every single day's you know
write it down and a sheet of paper and
say hey yesterday we made seven and
today we made eight so we adding it up
instead of doing that every single day
and writing down on a piece of paper we
basically we create a function to
basically do that right so you don't
have to keep writing the same code every
single day all right
so pretty much you start with a keyword
which is function and then you say total
cost which is the name and then from
there inside parenthesis you say okay
yesterday and today so this two are
called arguments it could be one and
cook abhi could be 10,000 arguments if
you wanted to build it of course it's
not practical to build so many you know
arguments the most arguments I've seen
is like I think four that's the most
I've seen but yeah so pretty much you
you put your arguments inside the
parenthesis and this becomes variables
inside of your functions so pretty much
okay you have your arguments and then
you got curly brackets which is an
opening in a closed
and then inside of it you basically you
put in the code that you're gonna
basically repeat every single time so
pretty much what I did was basically say
okay var total equals yesterday plus
today and then what you want to do is
return the total right so now add number
whenever you run add number two you know
got a comma there and then you say two
is gonna return a four so it's pretty
much just saying okay
two plus two because that's the
yesterday's number and this is today's
number pretty much pretty simple so you
could do it like that just doing the
function or you could basically declare
a variable and say okay VAR a total cars
equals function this tool right here are
exactly the same thing same type of
function so pretty much you thought is
up to you
exam you know to be exact the only
difference is this like let's say if you
have the same functions written down on
the same on the same JavaScript file
this runs first before this because when
you type function without it being
inside of a variable it basically it
goes into memory and it goes into memory
right away right so pretty much that's
about it that's how you write a function
it's not that that hard I mean look at
the code you see how easy it is
functioning total cars and then you put
two arguments and then inside of the
code you basically say hey what's the
total total equals yesterday plus today
so I returns total now you have a number
two plus two is gonna give you four
right so let's say an example here we
wanted to say okay I want to say I want
to repeat my name three
time's right oh I like let's say
something simple user 1 user name let's
say user using right so let's say
function and then we say name and then
inside of here we say okay VAR title
equals you know equals let's say hi my
name is there right here what I'm doing
is concatenated I'm basically putting
what I was gonna come through here I'm
gonna out of here a name so now when
this is gonna return hi my name is Joe
right so return title right so when I
say user name put in the string Joe now
this should say hi my name is Joe or I
mean sometimes you could even put
whatever you want and through the
arguments you could pass functions you
could pass objects you could pass
numbers you could pass anything so
basically inside this functions I could
at least say hey 33 hi my name is 33 you
see you can just pass a number or like
let's say the object if I wanted to use
the object matter fact because I haven't
taught you objects yet let's leave that
for later on but
this is the basics of creating on you
know how to write a function it's that
simple is that easy and I say make sure
you watch the next video you're gonna
love it
and make sure you subscribe because I
need to subscribers I need those likes I
need motivation to keep making these
videos man and leave a comment I want to
see what you want to learn next you know
even if you already know all the basics
trust me tell me something that you want
to learn and I will make a video for you
okay you already knows your boy Joe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
