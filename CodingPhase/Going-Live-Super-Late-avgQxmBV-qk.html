quick
all right Lester that's good
word man earlier today man freakin drama
and there's not even dramas just
freaking people you know god damn you
lie Oh see you Washington Heights
I'll see you boy tomorrow I gotta set
this up to be on on a window like I want
this one else will be showing about all
times
possible a little stock man we just we
get it in here man I'm just getting
comfortable with the streaming I'm just
getting some you know a little
comfortable you know being here what's
the what's the question cuz I'm like
wait I couldn't see it before
we're gonna open this up no I gotta get
used to this okay so much I don't see
HTML CSS and my question is what should
I learn after JavaScript or PSD HTML
bootstrap I mean if you know JavaScript
then what you want to do is start
learning a framework right and decide to
what exactly is it that you want to do I
mean do you wanna fall into more like a
front end do you want to do back in
because if you want to get in some
back-end then obviously jump into
another back in back in language after
JavaScript what you know a lot of times
people jump to the next thing without
even knowing you know what they need to
know I'm certain things like you know I
seen people jump from JavaScript to a
framework right and then they jump to
another framework and they keep jumping
so different frameworks but they don't
understand what the basic concepts of
JavaScript like how the Dom works they
don't understand how you know JavaScript
objects work functions
now PSD to HTML CSS man thank how you
gonna be able to build a website if you
don't know how to build HTML CSS like
that's the first thing you gotta jump
into don't try to jump into JavaScript
before knowing you know HTML CSS I don't
try to do it but you know we got your
boy Cameron here what up son
I see you feel like you the course is so
slow Oh too fast well listen what I will
say is you gotta slow it down in the
sense of go over them again like tell me
where is it that you feel like it's
going so fast for you and then I can
help you out you know because sometimes
it's like you fall into a trap of like
you're stuck somewhere but that doesn't
mean that everything else is not gonna
click you know like there's times like
for me when I was learning HTML I
couldn't understand tables for nothing I
couldn't understand it and then I was
like oh man and I was feeling like I was
about to give up but then at the end I
realized somebody got away
that's the only thing that don't
understand this other stuff that I do
understand so I came back later on and
learn how to do tables better but you
know what I mean so maybe he's gotta
send me an email telling me exactly
where is it that you feel like it's
going so fast and let me help you
yeah you shouldn't be using bootstrap or
less you know what's going on
like unless you know how to build it
yourself doing this bootstrap bootstrap
is supposed to make your life easier
once you know how to do you know
response it that's alright oh you know
but if you don't know how to do it
don't jump on to the kids it's like what
happens if you have to edit the you know
the grade or you have to edit something
in bootstrap you're like you're gonna be
lost because your whole time to be like
Oh everything supposed to not the
bootstrap way but then when you know I'm
have to do it or it or whatever like
you're gonna be like ass down you know
yeah my fault if I sound like sort of
sleepy or tired you know forgive me but
um it's like 3 o'clock in the morning
and you know I'm just here cuz I wanted
to test this out see how this this new
stream is gonna be looking no I don't
know if I might keep this video now
let me see I'm currently taking a sense
cuz I just what else what frameworks do
you use Elysee I don't know - you know I
use I used to use bootstrap a lot but
then now you started building my own
thing so cuz it's just easier cuz
bootstrap is so bloated it's not even
funny like they got so many different
things that you don't need at all like
if you just need a full of the credit to
make this responsive like you don't need
to strap at all let me see George me you
got Kelvin Davis got your boy cam let me
see what you say okay Joe is it okay to
use projects from your courses or others
make them your own by adding a few
things and change some things for a good
portfolio yeah you could do that but the
problem is what I would say is try to do
those projects on your own don't use the
same project like let's say if you using
one of my projects right don't use one a
same project for your portfolio if that
makes sense like take exactly what we
did and redo it again because the idea
is not for you to have something really
nice on your portfolio but the idea is
for you to be able to know how to do
things like if somebody comes in and
says hey could you build a you know
build a filter system for us with react
you should be able to know how to do
that on your own because you took my
course but if you just follow that alone
and you say okay cool I checked off
react off my list and never they react
on your own you don't know him oh you
there was a project that you follow more
that's it
let's see at bar side of day and that's
the same way I am that's the exact same
reason why I like to learn how to do
something like everything for another
JavaScript before I use something in
jQuery I mean I'll be honest it's fine
if you use jQuery is completely fine
like trying to do everything in
JavaScript like raw whenever javascript
is really a waste of time to be honest
with you like you will go in and like
understand the concepts like you don't
need to know everything about JavaScript
just understand the concepts and know
like okay when you use like jQuery right
and you're trying to get an element and
you say okay dot assign a string and
then you say hash tag
I don't know header or something right
so you know you're looking for that
element that has two ID header right if
you already know that concept you're
fine you don't need to know it and you
know if another JavaScript like from the
top of your head like you know you
looking for an ID so in reality if
another JavaScript you're gonna say okay
I'm kind of get element by ID but you
don't need to write that right like
jQuery is gonna make your life so much
easier and give you so many things that
you're not gonna get from another
JavaScript like that's the main reason
why people create frameworks because
it's like nobody wants to go to the
process of rebuilding the wheel every
single time yeah exactly
yeah like frameworks are there to make
your life easier
like once you know the concepts of
programming in JavaScript like you're
ready to jump to a framework like you
have to do it because it's like if you
go to a job and you're like listen guys
I'm gonna build everything if another
JavaScript like that sounds retarded
they're gonna look at you like wait this
is dumb unless it's a situation where
they'd be like hey we need this to be
super light meaning like we can
have a framework that's like 400 400
kilobytes you know eating up the space I
mean so you guys okay I'm just gonna
write this with another JavaScript so
the only code that's there is the code
that you have for the application
instead of you having you know like
let's say an example like angular right
when you use angular 1 I think it's like
almost like 1 megabyte of like there's
not many files it has any so it's like
it when you use angular it's like you're
adding your code which is probably a
hundred kilobytes right and then from
there you add angular which has one
megabyte of freaking code like thousands
and thousands of lines that you don't
need you know so in a situation like
that somebody tells you hey man don't
add angular because it's just gonna make
it heavy for no reason morning from
London London boys the East End what
about those all all these legacy systems
yeah definitely gonna be using whenever
JavaScript on that but I mean even now
it's rare like the most legacy code
you're gonna find online
it's jQuery like when you go to
somebody's code and somebody tells it oh
yeah this is so so legacy this is super
old you look at it it's just jQuery like
it's not that old it's not like guys is
walking around with 1994 JavaScript you
know it's just not happening are you
good at math Joe no like I think I'm
good good enough to get like the regular
stuff like you know like for me math is
a loving hating like I love math because
it's just straightforward meaning like
2+2 is 4 no matter what but at the same
time this other stuff that I
never really got into like angles and
was a trigonometry like that like I
have never liked that
you know cosine sine log I've never
liked those things right I passed the
class I've done um but do you think I
remember all those things no you know so
it's certainly things that I'm good at
certain things that I'm not I'm really
good at you know finding logical things
you know it's like hey Johnny went to
the store and he crossed the street he
dropped two quarters and he had four
hours how much did he still have oh yeah
450 you know logical things I'm not go
with like oh the piazza is this way and
the angle of it is this way source it
has to be 30% here because of this
diameter like I'm not good with those
things you know and are like I have to
look at the documentation on certain
things or have to like look back that a
different stuff from like math like I'm
not though the greatest expert at math
because I just don't do it have so many
other things that I have to worry about
like I don't practice testing you know
Joba English is not it's not that good
I'm a little scared to start JavaScript
because every everyone says is a room
programming language and it's heart
I mean it's programming the programming
part is easy well I could say could be a
little bit difficult is understanding
objects for people you know and like
certain concepts of like hoisting right
so like let's say you can use a variable
and like you use the variable here but
what you don't know is that the variable
got moved to the top like if you don't
know those things like a co mess you up
but besides that like it's fine
yes you can just get a job with no
html/css
it's not gonna be a job that's gonna pay
you a lot of money but yeah you can find
a job yeah you need to stay away from
memorization like trying to remember
things is it's not gonna work out I mean
some people have good memories like my
my wife she has like really really good
memory like she remembers the Wi-Fi
password which has like 20 sudden
freaking letters there letters and
numbers and she remembers the whole
thing she has really good memory for me
I don't have that good memory what I do
is I remember concepts right like if I
have like this is a perfect example I'm
gonna show you guys this let me see like
this is this is the course that I did
for the restaurant course right so let's
say this area right I have this box and
each one is different right but the
original design only have one now I just
copy and paste it okay so one concept is
instead of me having to manually do this
and say okay copy this copy this copy
this what I will do is I will do it one
time here and then create a loop that
will print out each box with the data
that I want to print out so if I come
back to this cold oh this is some phaser
stuff I'll show you right now okay so I
have this here if I wanted to say hey I
want to change this if I wanted to
change this alright most people in the
beginning what they do is they were
going and make the design themselves
right and basically copy and paste and
then just change the text here change
the text here
the Texians the texts year but at some
point you're gonna get more advanced
well you like you know what I could just
write a loop that creates each box for
me and then all I have to do is replace
this area of the text was the data that
I worked so that's what I did here so
let's say I wanted to say check your
fingers Excel alright what I saved this
automatically is going to refresh the
page and change it to check your fingers
Excel as you can see here all right now
the way how did this was because of a
loop if I go back into the component
here special menu I'm basically seeing
here there's the data so I have to state
that special menu data right and then a
half of that map a dot map is it's
basically it's like a loop it's like an
automatic loop right and then inside of
it you have a function now for that
function you pass down each item every
time that it loops a path it goes
through this function and then you do
whatever you want with this this
information right so for each one that I
have an array in the data I get to print
this out
so I print the first one then when I
loops again it prints the second one
when it loops again
it prints the third one now those are
one of the concepts that you gotta think
about you're like okay I'm a programmer
there so instead of me coming here and
doing this manually young I could just
go in and create a loop you know what I
mean so that's what I'm saying
see how it changed
oh yeah man
Missy see what you guys are talking
about this thing is annoying have
something like a better way to look at
this this chat box
I'm just looking at over here what
people are saying that I don't we have
to 24 minutes and we got 24 people oh
god I miss that thing I might change it
back to the other one
you know being on the web developer is
not memorizing it's more about thinking
about the concepts that's a just
figuring it out it's not that hard trust
me guys you know some people might be
like oh man I gotta be super smart and
it's like nah all you gotta do is
remember the concepts remember how to
look for things how to find the answer
and that's it that's all you really
gotta remember man so what'd you guys
think about this man having our live
shows like this you know you got the
number how many people's in here we got
the live chat if one of you guys got
donate anything I'll show up if anybody
does on let me see can I do this I mean
let me see I don't want to spammy
let me see where is it get the alert box
oh it's freezing
come on stop acting up
don't you hate with computers start
acting up like website start acting I'll
be like come on man
it's 2017 this isn't dial up a see this
was gonna come up kids let me see how
yeah there you go word man now I'm just
testing things out with you know let me
see if I we got subscribers you know we
got a little something you know get some
sponsors you know get the get a little
donation you know we make it you know we
may get it poppin in here now I'm just
saying man I hope people don't start
copying my swagging everything that I do
you know but you know if I do something
if I start bringing stuff from like
different therefore YouTube different
twist different little things you know
people's gonna be taking your voice swag
see word I really like this one man I
really like this oh God a we do testing
things out man
let me see what else what else man who's
in here man word we got people in
Tanzania
that's my peoples man straight Africa
man I'm straight Africa out here bro I
got time for my famous debts I was gonna
put it I still gotta set it up I got a
couple of things like like the coding
fee is when people subscribe we're gonna
see that one right heyy
let me see let me see if my boss
training was working let me try this
let me check we will check see if we
show up right now you know don't you
hate when people send you like crazy
crazy stuff like on Facebook and you're
like like some you know like some kid
starving or something like down like man
stop sharing those things with me like I
know the world is messed up man
like I know that you guys share sharing
bad news swooping like I don't know that
I can't like I just found out that that
kids are starving in the world you know
I mean like I was the last one in the
world and nobody nobody told me let me
say see if this works
Oh gotta set this up
see want to put this up here
what I'll put this like on this list
here my people who support the channel
or like you know yeah I mean you know
what I mean like that's just how it is
it's like this 3:20 in the morning is
about to be four o'clock like we usually
have way more than that people you know
but that's fine
like right now I'm showing love to my
people you know in Europe showing love
to my people Africa show love them my
people the Philippines India Australia
Japan you know we're here now a lot of
times people can't get to see me they'll
be like man this sucks I can't see Joe
and also at least they get to see me now
I'm trying to set this up man I don't
know what's not working
it's really annoying me eh
okay so it is working
missing
we just testing things out
wired I'm thinking about it think about
adding the little Z I just gotta find
the right one
yellows is the matter
let's take this one let's make a tower
gonna see we're gonna make this one
I know which one should I make it I'm
gonna make as a pledge when people
pledge to patreon so let me see put it
right here
let's see save that
our nothing shown enough at our
all right it's about to start now I'm
just testing this thing out that's it
any questions before I leave guys let me
know you know I'm an old man I'm just
trying to help you out man
you know try to help you guys as much as
I can man no we here right now man
setting things up hopefully you know
people don't start taking the swag you
know we here man we here right now kids
we live right now okay Tyler Benton says
how to code with only one mother Joe how
to come with only one mother I do it
I have only one mother the mother that
I'm seeing right here I mean I have my
laptop here but I don't use this I use
this monitor I don't have like two
monitors for me I find it annoying to
having to switch up like this all the
time it's like I have everything here if
I have monitor big enough I just stay on
that mother I really want to get the lg
monitor the one is like super wide I
want to get that bad
you know let's test this out one last
time I like I like this man this is cool
a look at look at that boy hey yeah I
saw they got mad black youngster I love
that kid you guys should listen to a
song that black you know like just no
black youngster said he has is called um
I call this is called birthday you wanna
die a birthday
I love that song yeah he's the man let
me see yeah I think that's overkill
that's kind of ridiculous sometimes you
know I think that's just that's for sure
six mothers there's really no need for
that I mean it's cool sometimes I mean
for what he uses it for sure it's
definitely useful because I'm pretty
sure he has all his code here like the
real code that he already de here and
then the one that he's doing on the live
show you know or like the live video
that he's recording like it makes sense
when when you do it like that cuz it's
like you know even myself sometimes I
find myself like I might do a mistake
and then I might do a mistake in there
I'll go fix it right there in the video
because I'm really doing it live with
you guys even when I'm doing my courses
that's me just like I won't take
sometimes I have to do it again because
there might be a error that's just too
much but most of the time I just go in
am i ok cool
if I find my mistake I'll fix it right
but when a a video is completely perfect
that means you have it on another screen
you already did it right you have your
work that you everyday and then here's
the screen that you're actually
recording so you know it makes your
video so much better so I definitely
know why he what he uses that many
screens makes sense what for like real
productivity that doesn't work in the in
the real world you know that unless you
don't like stocks or something like that
where you need to see a whole bunch of
charts but for coding that's just kind
of ridiculous
learn how about you just get four
ultra-wide and make yourself a circle
kind of everything nice man
man yo so let me say we start closing
this windows up
I should be sleep all right now man you
guys don't know I've been going to sleep
too late all this this whole week man I
should be knocked out let me see what
else I wanted to play event list I
wanted to add the event list see all
let me add this safe setting
stay right there I have to post this for
a second hey Sarah left your subscribe a
you know we keep getting more people
every day man
God weather man we're gonna be good kids
yes I love it too big
see what else man if we change this up
change the theme
now we got kids now we don't wanna curse
trying to stay away from the curse
I read let me see what else we want to
add to this
there's something that I'm missing
where's the stream labels strain boss
hey you go
okay
all right we ain't here kids any
questions before I go to sleep man let
me know what projects are in which
courses right
I believe the react one has the real
estate the no tes has the portfolio the
building a restaurant has the restaurant
all right so you got those three there
I'm still gonna do the e-commerce which
I'm coming to learn PHP later on and
then the digital agency I don't know
which one I'm gonna do it so that's
gonna be like the last one if I ever
must be max now what type of computer I
got I got the super souped-up macbook
pro 13 inch something like what that's
it mind you guys I had a 2008 MacBook
Pro till this year this is the first and
this is the very first time that I buy a
macbook brand-new from the store like
that's not me I don't just go and spend
money throw money away like that
Mac books are very expensive but I was
like you know I'm gonna splurge on
myself for one time like I never do it
you know but but you guys that keep
telling me hey Cho should I buy her well
you know 2012 MacBook Pro my gear like
I've had my MacBook Pro from 2008 used
that I bought from Craigslist and that's
how I learned how to program in 2012 our
body
I bought a 2008 MacBook Pro from
Craigslist for $900
online and I promise no like on
Craigslist you know I want to go meet up
the guy and everything it was last
sketchy but I got myself a MacBook you
know it's like here we are you know five
six years later we still can you know
where it man
yeah of course they're always gonna make
your explain your code but it's not like
you're gonna have to go in there and be
like super precise it's just like
explain why you did this Wow you know
like be like oh we used react here we
connected through API which was no J yes
I use fetch instead of jQuery this does
not like little things like that you
just explain it normally you don't have
to go in there but I why do you use a
loop here when you could use a wire loop
you know it's like nobody's going to let
see if they do that that's not the
company you want to work for if you want
to upgrade something you gotta get to
number one is an SSD hard drive that's
gonna change the game on the MacBook Pro
like completely
what does n mean the ampersand side I
know man I'm up at this time
I know Philippe don't remind me I'm
setting things up as you can see we
basically set up our string now we ready
to string like a you know like a pro
got your boy Chris Shaw not even see
that Christian was online a little while
ago I saw him in a chat room somewhere
around here you got Christian isolate
text me text me like at 8 o'clock well
eight o'clock yesterday
[Laughter]
Philippe is like yo man I just finished
with this court now we gotta come here I
spent time here so yeah you seen this
fully
let's see where is
next it's a wish one down on the cross
there you go
I'm trying to Willow something trying to
mess around with this thing
let's play capture this playing window
capture
or and Ava
there you go now we good
man things that do for you guys you know
yeah because I love you guys man word
what's up what's up some sub kids any
more questions before I go to sleep

all right kids yeah make sure you share
this man share this with your boys some
sign up and sign up to the to the
channel subscribe support the channel we
hear kids super lately
yes hard to catch my my life string I
