back at it again man : freeze calm
listen today we're going to try
something you basically we're going to
answer questions for Korra you know a
lot of people send me messages about
people send me questions that's why I
tell you guys I got to take advantage
just send me a question on my email send
me a question here through the comment
and I will answer them but yeah so
somebody say why do companies hire
junior developers alright very simple
because a mid-level developer or senior
the developer most of the time is more
expensive right so let's say you're a
junior developer and you're trying to
get hired right you might come in and
you're more open to get hired for a
lower you know a lower salary than what
other developers will come in for right
but you could still compete with them
meaning you still have the skills you
still know HTML CSS JavaScript you still
know you know some back in you basically
have all the skills that a developer
needs to get started on a project right
so as a company they look at that and
they say you know what we're going to
give a chance to this person we're going
to give them a chance and we're going to
hire them right so that's one
possibility
another possibility is sometimes a
company is working with newer technology
meaning let's say no J yes let's say you
know crystal lang let's say elixir ness
a gold name sometimes all the developers
like missing somebody who's been working
in Java been working in c-sharp for 10
plus years they haven't kept up with new
technologies new programming language
right so there's situations where those
companies cannot find the right
candidate so let's say I'm in that
company
and I'm a senior developer and I know no
js' right I say you know what we we
actually need an extra hand here
you know let's try to find somebody
who's brilliant somebody who's smart
somebody who carry pick up the pace
right away and we basically give them
some training you know we start them up
slow and then from there we build them
off all right so that's one of the
situation another one of the situation
that you know depends on the company's
budget a company might just say hey we
we basically we had let's say in a year
we had half a million dollars for the
budget for the developers right and then
they have one senior developer who's
like 150 they have another mid-level
developer who is like 80 another one was
80 so they still have money in the
budget
so basically say you know what let's
hire a couple of junior developers who
are kind of helped us out with this this
project so we could you know knock it
out as soon as possible
so that's another reason why they might
hire junior developers and you know to
me those are the top three so yeah man
I'm just answering the questions and
like I said yeah just any questions you
might have let me know is your boy joke
back at it again yeah you did make sure
you subscribe make sure you like this
video man make sure you show some love
CGT you already knows your boy Joe back
at it again man listen make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like this
video man by the way if you want to know
exactly what questions I took to become
a web developer they right there in the
description it's no secret it's nothing
crazy is no secret gift that I had is
just pretty much I took the courses
they're pretty cheap they're like 15
dollars each on specials and just this
immense change your life change your
lifestyle do something fun is something
cool that you could call a career</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
