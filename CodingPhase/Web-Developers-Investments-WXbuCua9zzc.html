back at it again coding face.com listen
your boy is back I didn't did it again
alright guys so this morning I'm gonna
hit you guys with a little topic just a
little topic okay so I'm going to talk
about investments for what developers
all right sometimes you work at a
company where they give you you know
some equity on the company that might
give you some stocks they might tell you
hate your heart owner of the company you
know they might give you a little
and all the contract where it says hey
if there's extra boost stuff like of
profit you might make a little bonus
whatever it is right in situations like
that I will say guys man try to invest
your money keeping money in a bank um
it's not gonna do anything for you you
know when somebody tells you oh say for
a rainy day
and it's like yeah you can say for a
rainy day
five years later that money isn't almost
not worth anything
you know because how how things work how
Demario the market works how you know
how society works so the best thing for
you guys is to invest your money in
companies that you know are profitable
companies that you know are going to be
here for the next five to ten years so
when their stocks go up your money goes
up you know even if it's a 3% 5% 10%
that now 10% but at least 5% return on
investment so try to do your research
try to do your research which stocks you
should buy try to do your research on
technology in general like right now in
video cards and AMD are really hot Tesla
is really hot and to meet Tesla is gonna
be one of those companies that they're
gonna be here for a long time you know
they like one of the first companies
doing electric cars doing now the guy
what's the name of the company Solar
City which also does like solar panels
and in private homes and to me like
that's what the future is going so right
now the stocks are not that expensive
you know AMD right now is like algos
maybe like eleven twelve dollars so if
you sign up for Robin Hood and then you
start buying stocks you know like every
you week by like two three stocks by
late two three stocks from from AMD
right two three stocks from Nvidia if
you can but make your money work for you
you already worked for the money now
make the money work for you I mean
that's what I'm doing right now you know
I got a couple of thousands into AMD
with the whole Trump situation my money
after I made a whole bunch of money in
profit it kind of went down but it's
fine because what it did gave me more
chance to buy more stocks of
MD and Vidya when I went down so then
today it's up again so today we're
making a lot of profits but yeah that's
like an advice I will give you guys you
know make sure you invest your money
smart and also to know that this this is
not like you should sign you should
basically buy stocks of companies that
you know that the most that they're
gonna lose is like 1% 2% 3% never buy
stocks that you see that the past five
years they've been going down or for the
past five years like one moment they're
up one more man they're down you don't
want to deal with those type of stocks
you want to deal with stock start pretty
much steady they either growing slowly
but surely so it's like in the end of
the year they made you know they they
want up 20 percent or sometimes even 30
percent those companies that you invest
in you can make 10% back on your return
on your investment
ROI return on investment so try to look
into that of course equals to like
real estate buy yourself a little condo
everybody talks about oh you gotta buy a
house first sometimes you just gotta buy
a condo first it's baby steps guys you
don't have to do everything at once if
you just go in start slow get introduced
to real estate buy things slowly it's
like right now I'm thinking about buying
my my first house right I'm doing a lot
of research so at the same time I don't
know if I want to buy my first house
right now because I don't know if I must
stay in New York forever you know what I
mean even though I know I can sell it
later on whatever but I might be buying
a condo because at the same time I can
own that condo either salad or renting
later on and then now I have like an
extra income coming in you know some
I'm thinking about doing that
I'm in between you know if I buy a house
or buy just condo it's kind it's a hard
decision you know everybody has to go to
that and decide what exactly they want
to invest their money in what keeping
money just on your savings account is
not going to do anything for you I don't
you know sometimes you're gonna take
risk the stock market it is risky you
know invest money it's like when you but
to think about that you're gonna come in
and you're gonna lose 20% like in the
beginning the first time that I started
I actually started buying stocks in
around August of last year for the first
time and since then I actually lost
money I've actually lost money about
Donna let's say out of every 500 dollars
I lost $100 all right but that wasn't
like every single month it was more like
the whole beginning like in the
beginning I lost a lot of money because
I was just learning
so I would my advice to you guys is just
start slow don't go all in
I mean I started in with like I think it
was like $3,000 I put in so for you guys
you don't have to start that Vicki we
just put in $500 and see how it goes you
know
but yeah so I actually lost money in the
beginning right now I recouping
basically make him back to the 1% not
the 1% the 1/5 that I lost
nassim which is fine because I was like
I don't even count that as you know
money that I was you know investing it
was more for me to train myself and to
know how the markets work how how to
find the right companies how to invest
in the the right technologies and like
that's one thing that I love being a web
developer because I I have up a little
taste a little inside if you of like
what's the tech industry like there's a
lot of people who are not in the tech
industry so they don't know about they
don't know about Facebook like they know
Facebook ask the the company that they
go on and talk to their family and
friends but me I know that Facebook is a
legit company they're doing a lot of
cool that in the future
it's gonna be very profitable like I
also own a lot of Facebook stocks I wish
I would have bought Facebook when
Facebook was like 30 bucks 40 bucks but
it's okay we live and we learn from that
you know but yeah man you guys like I
said start investing into something
don't it doesn't matter if you're still
not a develop it doesn't matter if
you're just starting like to invest it
doesn't cost you that much it's only
like you have $20 $30 in your pocket you
might as well start investing start
playing around with the market sorry you
know just get your feet wet you know
you're gonna throw that money away going
to a restaurant anyways you're gonna
throw that money away buying a brand new
ps4 game you're gonna waste that money
you know buying your girlfriend I don't
know some brand new hair or something
you know like if you're gonna spend your
money you might as well just like play
around with it see what you can do see
if you could double it see if you can
make some profit out of it because if
you already work hard enough you know
what I mean like so let's try to make
that money work put some you know put
some some money in the stock market guys
like trust me I know with the whole
Trump situations right now like it's not
you can say it's not ideal like every
day is that he does some dumb and
then the stock market goes down well
that's fine when the stock market goes
down that's when you buy you know if it
goes up and goes up a certain amount
sell right away just so you could make
your profits and then once it comes back
down by again you know you just gotta be
also to patient and like sometimes don't
sell just because some crazy should
happen like this past week with the
whole thing about Trump fire and call me
and share whatever call me or whatever
hit that guy's name I kind of up
because I sold I had about how about
like 400 AMD stocks and I kind of messed
up I kinda messed up I saw the whole
thing money I started losing money and
then I sold everything and then now
today all that money came back and even
more and then I'm like oh man I was I
lost the opportunity I should have just
kept it there if I would have just left
it there
I knew it was going to come back up
because AMD is is one of the top chip
companies and graphic card companies so
Plus now they they're working with Intel
so I should have just kept it there but
I messed up I got I got nervous I was
like oh man I got nervous and I
was like oh man I got a sell
before it goes back down anymore so it
went down like I do like four or five
percent and then I sold everything and
then now it's up and even more I would
have made more profit if I were to
freaking out that in there but yeah
