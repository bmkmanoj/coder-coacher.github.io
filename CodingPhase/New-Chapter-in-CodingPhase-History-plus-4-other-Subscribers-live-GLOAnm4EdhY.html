man coding face.com listen your boy is
back I didn't bid it again alright so we
ain't here man live man listen we gotta
do two things man right first thing I'm
gonna talk about the topic of this video
which is you know new coding phase new
chapter you know it's a new chapter of
colonies calm and and your boy man
you know so we're gonna talk about that
and then from there I want you guys to
email me send me an email right now
whoever is available to go live with me
in like 20 20 minutes all right
so let me know whoever's available to go
live you know so we could go hang out I
love hanging out with my viewers I love
hanging I work for my subscribers so
just like the other day the other day we
actually chill with kik greatness you
know your boy can but the audio and
their faces didn't get to come out for
some reason
I messed up bounced my phone I press the
wrong thing so it only showed me but
there was also other people's and in the
video right it just happened that you
guys didn't get to see them ain't kind
of sucks cuz it was like we was having a
Google hangout we have a conversation
and then basically I'll press the wrong
thing and you guys couldn't see right so
anyways as far as the new chapter in Co
defense calm listen guys um I'm going
all out right so I'm going all out um
I've been saying this for a while don't
wanted to teach 100% of the time you
know I feel like man it's the time that
I have to do it man I have a lot of
subscribers I have a lot of people that
want to support me 1/2 also not only
here people from here but also from
other places you know Cora team tree
house you know from different form of
Stack Overflow people don't want to
support your kid right
so they want me to start throwing out
more tutorials right here on YouTube now
the problem of YouTube is that when I
release a tutorial let's say I create a
tutorial since HTML whatever right when
I create those tutorials those two
tourists end up
Pease 700 something right if you're not
prover Singh media if you're not Chris
hogs if you're not uh whoever whatever
name you want to name right for reals if
you're not one of those guys your videos
is to the back man
so only oh I don't know maybe only five
percent of the people that actually take
tutorials get to see my tutorials right
so like I said from the beginning what I
wanted to do was help out other people
here I wanted to create a community I
want to create a UH a safe space for us
you know to create something cool right
so what I'm doing is I'm gonna go all
out I'm basically I'm gonna start
creating tutorials creating courses
right
not just tutorials I'm talking about
full-fledged courses with
slideshows to share with you know proper
or introduction proper oh you know
without no mistakes right just me going
online
cuz I'm this one I created this thing
man but you guys don't know like just
start teaching I've wanted to go to
different organizations and speak so now
I'm gonna really be a body cuz there's
no point of me having this dream of like
man I want to start teaching what about
a man I wanna have all this cool ideas
that I have to teach people and then
don't implement it
don't make you know don't make the
videos it's like when I create a
tutorial here on YouTube I create a
quick I'm okay whatever there's a
mistake I'll leave it whatever right
that's not the proper way to do things
now I'm gonna create like you know real
courses that I could be proud of
 that I could say hey man I'm at the
same level as Coastie on the same level
as Steven Crider you know like those
guys to me those guys are great
cuz those guys are the guys that taught
me what development taught me basically
the right path right so now I want to
create my own thing where it's basically
is learning web development with real
life scenarios right nobody has done
this before
because everybody comes in and gives you
all this how you do a tutorial this a
little thing here's the line there this
line there there's a function da da da
that's boring I want to create videos
with real-life scenarios meaning hey you
have a somebody emails you like in all
your head designer the head head of the
design team emails you hey we have to
design barra da you know we want you to
create it for us how could you create a
prototype
you know the whole scenario the whole
 that happens that work for you guys
right but the only difference is because
I no longer can make tutorials for
people to just you know four or five
people watch it right I can't do that no
more because I want to teach to the
people that want to learn meaning I want
to teach to the guys that are there that
they want to go hard and like you know a
man if I'm coming here it's for a reason
you know I have a lot of subscribers
that they come here because they want in
your mind you know my advice my opinions
and that's fun because this is YouTube
right this is YouTube this isn't
supposed to be like the place to find
like students people who are really
dedicated to this right even though I
know some of you guys are but there's a
lot of people they just come here just
for you know for the hell of it they're
like okay cool
I just got a notification on my phone
that's great that's what this channel is
here for is YouTube right but now I'm
branching off at the same time I'm
creating my own courses my own tutorials
you know and in different platforms you
know so creating you know stuff for you
to me courses are gonna be for free but
at least I know that the people who bump
into them on udemy those are people that
they're gonna take the courses for Sara
you know seriously and gotta do the the
courses and do the projects because
that's what I care about I don't care
about money wise I don't care about um
anything about it right all I care about
is if I go and spend three four five
hours
thing I want people to do it right
because I don't do this I already
know this already you know what I mean I
already know how to code like why do I
need to create videos to have like booze
or on YouTube on the tutorial which in
reality out of that 500 views on it
probably only 40 or 50 people only took
the course right or took the tutorial
whatever I don't want that because
that's it's a lot of time from me so if
I'm creating this I want people to
really learn I want people to really
bust their ass and do it like I don't
want to just come here and do tutorials
on YouTube for nobody's going to find it
especially how the algorithm is of p2 is
that you got to create a video that's a
super catchy clickbait title and be like
oh the greatest top five Python
functions some crazy like that you
guys know what I'm talking about
right so in different day once you
become all viral then you to
start throwing you views and
subscribers like I don't want to be
dependent on that when I create a course
and I say hey man I'm gonna stop hanging
out with my kid I'm gonna stop hanging
out with my wife I'm gonna stop doing
all personal life if I'm gonna dedicate
three to six months of creative courses
right that's gonna be legit that's
really gonna help people I want people
to be able to find them and I want
people to be able to do them all right
so that's where I'm going now you know
and I'm not gonna be in here on YouTube
like oh guys go check out my course at
da da da da nah be wrong video I'm a
Korean one video whenever I created one
course I'm gonna create one video that
says hey man I just created this course
on HTML guys go check it out it's free
on udemy whoever wants to take the
courses they're gonna go and take the
course right and finish it and it was
good for me is that I get to see the
statistics and get to see how many
people actually complete it who actually
signed up who actually enrolled whatever
right just like feel good because to me
is like
not gonna pay off I'm not
becoming a millionaire out of this my
only payoff is to know that other people
did it you know like I love when I see
you boy 84 like I have my Instagram I
love when I see that he put on his
Instagram I kill I'm working on on Joe's
you know coding face tutorial right now
I'm doing the big storm doing this and
that like that motivates me right
but then I don't see that from anybody
else I mean I see it from a couple of
people Megan and I I say from a couple
of people but not the same amount of
people that are on my youtube in at the
same amount of people who are searching
what development right so it means that
there's more people that want to watch
you know news they want to see reviews
they wanna see certain topics I wanna
know vue.js versus react they want to
see like that right and that's
funny because this is YouTube but at the
same time I'm not putting no more
tutorials on YouTube it's not worth it
it's not really worth it for me so spend
all those hours to basically do it for
five people it doesn't make sense
alright so I'm gonna do it in a way
where it's gonna be fun it's gonna be
easy for everybody who wants to actually
do tutorials who actually we are looking
to learn and they respect what I say
and you know they want to learn a little
bit about you know my knowledge my
experience right so I'm gonna create
this courses which are basically just
like real life scenarios you know like
somebody is like hey man we need a HTML
email for you know for this new product
that we release him all right right
there that's gonna be the whole project
you know somebody's gonna give you a
design then from there we're gonna break
it down create the stinging HTML on
basically tables right we probably use
ink from foundation to create the HTML
email so it could be responsive and then
voila that's it
that project is done you know that's
what I wanted to write so that's what we
go in that's what coding phase calm is
going and of course the the rest of
everything else that I want to do
way with the stacks for : phased account
which is more like a a checklist of you
know the things that you need to learn
for from a stack right so if you want to
learn the mean stack you need to know
HTML need to know a store CSS need to
know JavaScript you need to understand
get em get requesting sorry get rid
cross the post request you gotta
understand on passport you gotta
understand you know the whole stack
right so it's more like a checklist so
also to for people who are taking the
courses that I'm making or tutorials and
I'm making other platforms they could
use coding phase calm as a checklist of
like yeah I know how to do this I know
how to do that I know how to do get
requests I know how to do routes
alright so that's what we got man I
think to me is very soon because I'm
gonna expose for what me like this is
why I really wanted to do like I've been
one to just get the opportunity you know
like somebody would tell me hey Joe we
want you to come teach here you know
just like around my house right this is
this place that they they have our
coding camp for kids right I'm like man
I wanna go in there I want to tell them
like hey man I would love to just
volunteer and you know how about you
know get to teach kids how to code or
even you know for for adults people who
want to get into the industry used to
give them a little bit of insight you
know cuz for me I consider myself just a
regular guy I'm not here I'm not like a
dude who went to school for computer
science I'm just a regular guy who loves
technology and loves code right so I
know that what I can tell to people and
when people see me they could relate but
I oh shoot he did it I could do it so
that's my motivation right so I was like
that's why I'm like you know people want
me to do tutorials on YouTube is like
it's not work for guys I'll be honest it
is better off I just come here do mine
my videos where I hang out
what'd you guys do my videos when we
talk about certain topics do my videos
where I answer questions that you guys
might set me but the tutorials take a
long time and as I I'm only pleasing
like five of you guys you know it just
doesn't make sense it's like for me to
release on YouTube and then nobody
watches it you know it's a that's just
how it is YouTube's algorithm basically
keeps you know throwing me to the end
it's like hey I create a the Instagram
HTML tutorial right that's it you're
sent to like page five nobody finds that
show right so now I have to actually be
like yo me putting all that time and
posting things on YouTube like tutorials
is it really worth it I don't know I
don't think so right
my other type of videos the videos that
go viral and get popular like you know
when I do reviews I'm gonna do my top
five of you know whatever new plugins or
extensions a JavaScript whatever
it is I'm creating a top 5 those you
know they out of here don't just pop off
right away
and I don't even have to think about it
because that's like in the back of my
mind I could just come in and be like oh
yeah that my top 5 of and you know are
add-on packages or my top 5 vs code
extensions like that is easy to me
you know I could blast in like 10
minutes
right so let's take a long time so
that's what we goin man
and um I hope you guys lose that I
really want to take this serious
and guess you know they enjoy my content
all right I'm going to put um probably
like a preview of this new tutorial that
I'm making I'm being honest guys I'm
surprised myself I was like holy
your voice sounded legit your voice your
voice killing it right now it's like I
have a very good concept of this
tutorial and like I'm creating something
really cool for you guys man so the guys
that really take the tutorials you guys
is gonna find
now with a group of other people who are
actually doing the tutorials which is I
think something is very important you
know because this is a difference when
you like a certain topic it's a big
difference of saying hey man I like
basketball right and I watch the ESPN
right but it's a big difference when you
hang out with all this dudes that go to
playboy like man across the out in
real quick you know like those guys did
you know boy it's like right like they
 gold play ball on by themselves
then go play ball with their
friends go play ball in tournaments go
play ball in college like those guys
they go hard and that's like us right
you know I'm talking to you guys does
that really do the tutorials the guys
that really appreciate the time that it
takes to create this tutorials and
create videos for you guys that really
appreciate it I'm talking to you guys
you guys are guys they're pretty much
yeah go hard you know who you are the
one start you know yeah go to work I
come back do a tutorial even after they
do a tutorial and go to the udemy bio
course learn some more containing go
through YouTube find another tutorial
and continue doing you guys are not
good right so we love you know added
being busy and creating new right
so this this is really gonna profit you
guys if even you know you guys gonna be
 good you know that's what I'm
saying oh yeah man um and that's what I
wanted to say I don't know a thousand oh
it sounded like a rant but that's that's
what we got right now that's the new
chapter of coding phase calm and I'm
excited cuz now it's like I just want to
see people do the work you know what I
mean I want to have that list of people
who actually do the work and you're like
yo man these are the people cuz I want
to know let you know if you guys are
doing tutorials and dual courses and
final courses online I want to know who
who are you guys you know cuz it's like
this is like I wanna also find out like
what type of impact I have on you guys
alright it's like when
um I had you know see from Grider and I
had cold steel like those guys had an
impact right and as I I have a not super
close relationship with Steven grata but
we email with each other right we got in
contact once in a while and you know I
appreciate that because I'm like young
man you don't have a job because of your
react native course and your react
course reactor Redux if it wasn't
because that I would probably still be
working on angular type of ops which I
hate it so things like that it's like he
had an impact in my life and he knows
that right
he knows how many people take the
courses he knows how many people
complete them you know so that's what I
want to have I wanna have that
interaction with you guys that people
that really go hard just so I could know
cuz it you know nobody's becoming a
million me out of this thing nobody's
like making mad money out of me nobody's
like getting anything you know the only
the only joy that I get out of this is
knowing that people are finding jobs
people are you know continue
continuing their studies in web
development and programming and knowing
that I'm doing this not for myself
not for me to spend my time here in
front of a computer like who wants to be
in front of a computer talking to
themselves I don't think you guys want
to do that right
so if I'm doing this and I'm sacrificing
so many hours of my life I wanted to be
for for something I wanted for for
people to be like hey man you know what
is that cam it's like cameras telling us
that story like that he's almost
earning nothing over there my grant like
how can I help that kid how can I help
him get to next level in this a lot of
you guys with similar stories that hit
me up as a young man I mean I mean
freaking Bangladesh i frickin working
for a dollar fifty a day like crazy
stories I get crazy emails and I'm like
man how can I help those people how can
I you know get them to the next level to
just to better themselves alright cuz
I've been in situations like that being
not
bad but bad I've been in situations
where I'm like ill man I don't even have
a way to get back home like I've been in
situations like that I don't even have a
way to get back home so I know what it
feels like to not have money in your
pocket or not have anybody that you
could count on but I hate Lincoln
had that I don't like I want to help
people out that's my that's my goal so
if I come here I'm doing all this work I
want to be able to help people you know
in tutorials on YouTube take the longest
which doesn't make sense so it's like
I'm going to other platforms where
people want to do tutorials people want
to learn people want to take courses you
know I want to do YouTube for what
YouTube this YouTube is for you know
being the personality you come here to a
review story or you know fun videos hang
out with you guys but at the same time
there's this a big divide this the
people that do work there's the people
that want to find entertainment and then
there's the people that just like oh I
found this video or my related course of
my related videos whatever right but
they're not there to do those courses or
do those tutorials so I was like Who am
I making them for for five people

working full-time but then at the same
time it's like if I don't work full-time
then it's like I'm you know
what I mean like just a lot of people
who are on YouTube and they've never
worked in their life and talked about
hey I'm a developer on this and that but
they've never done in real life you know
is like was I was the point right at

hopefully they don't do that till
customs man yeah let me see so as
say what up signs they say except you
just sell you I mean yeah y'all start
talking about cars I don't know much
about cars
to be honest I mean I'm not you know
there's a bug little bit of a muddle
you know this I'm an old man is just we
just hanging out today we can now remain
squad squad I mean I call you know this
is what I do every weekend all right so
I mean when do you start Quinn
oh yeah I started like a year and a half
ago my friend got me into this honestly
I mean I graduated with the engineering
degree and by the way Kota has nothing
to do with like man they really you know
okay
that's the crazy thing anywhere graduate
engineering degree I'm like I don't want
to be engineer that's just not what I
want to do a year and a half later I
just got a job I'm starting next week on
Monday the eyes against man thanks oh
honey you know it happens all the time
with were you like you know you start a
careers like me right um not really
school I was gonna become a teacher
right ah matter fact before that I was
gonna do like audio engineering I was
gonna go to full sales in Florida and
that's what I wanted to do
yeah that's what I was gonna do and then
from there stop and say you know what
man the recording Oh industry is
it's going to shake I'm not gonna do
that
so then from there um I went to school
how do you know what to do I was like I
picked up never arts and then my mom's
like well yeah that is a professor I'm a
teacher just become a teacher I was like
cool whatever I don't even know what I'm
gonna do in my life so I signed up went
to school there like a good year and I'm
like yo I hate this like it's a lot
of writing I'm not going writing I mean
I don't don't enjoy it right so then
from they I switched up so long I team
and then graduated when a
associates
as an IT right programming systems it
says programming system on my degree but
I never did any programming so that's
that right so then from there I
went to four-year school and basically
was doing a communication design
finished a and then I was like I
did the internship and I was like I
don't like designing and I'm like but
literally is like the last step before
you graduate so it's like it was already
too late for me I'm like I don't like
being a designer because a designer you
just gotta take everybody's opinion and
you shut the up and just take it
like you go and spend five hours I'm
creating this masterpiece right this
amazing website and there's somebody the
owner or the header or designer
just comes in but all this looks like
 typography looks like this
colors don't go here this doesn't
match here so now you're five hours gets
 ripped up your whole
dreams get ripped up in as I hate taking
right so I was like this I'm
gonna become a designer so then I was
like you know what man let me just work
for a little bit and figure out what I'm
gonna do so then that's when I was like
working as an IT in the city here in New
York I was working in Wall Street and
then I was like man I really hate
dealing with other people's problems so
that's what I was like you know what man
I'm just gonna go back to my first love
my first love was coding I created a
website for Dragonball Z and I was like
oh that's my it's lame I remember
that I don't have TB wait no DBZ right
you know it was it was the cell saga and
I was like yo I'm gonna create this
hey I'm a creative website to basically
put all of videos back before there
wasn't no torrent there wasn't no crazy
 that was only our Casas and it was
Napster right that was like early 2001
2002 around there I remember keziah
Napster yeah
like manna I'm just gonna get
back to coding and here we are
five years later oh my girlfriend she
she let me rock she was like you know
there was all this time I was like when
my girlfriend's like yo I got a
cold man you gotta let me code this
extra three four hours at night because
I gotta do something with my life I
can't just be some bomb-ass King from
the hood you know so here we are man
 doing code now we got this
website now we got YouTube
channel coding phase comm holding phase
calm that's our long shots out of - Mia
yes sir
let me see so we got your boy Andrew
Andrew what up hey buddy how's it going
hey how's everything man waiting for you
um I'm over by a buffalo about 45
minutes west of buffalo Buffalo New York
no no I'm in Hamilton Ontario whew
another okay but I've never been there
red I should be ashamed of myself
I got a passport I got the little green
passport too which technically I could
just cross the border they have still
having but it is a maximum I'm actually
supposed to come out to New York at the
end of joy oh yeah oh yeah with a rope
I'll put meet up man we do a little
quick meetup right here man take you out
to the hood spots you know the whole New
York field is like hmm you know have fun
man ya know my buddy said he works down
on Wall Street right downtown nice legs
nice nice though yeah so how the looting
um I've been coding on and off I started
in like the 90s went to school for it
and then I am I work from about 2000 to
2008 doing a PHP MySQL HTML CSS a little
bit of JavaScript Ajax and I've been out
of it for the last nine years or
so so last couple months I've just been
getting back into it doing free code
Academy trying to get into all the new
stuff NPM composer all the like web pack
and github and all that stuff so it's a
it's a learning curve I mean why did you
jump out of it uh I'm kind of like not
years experience I was like okay why why
he jumped up um I don't know I had a bad
experience with a company I was working
with in Toronto I was working out there
for a few years and then uh the guy
screwed me over for about half a year's
pay yeah Wow damn yeah it was rough
oh yeah yes like that happens kids
well are you a freelancer like how do
you screw you up a half a year's pay
like I would I think I'm like for a
small web design firm and I was like
there were some employees and there's
some contract employees I was a contract
employee I invoiced him and he was just
having financial issues and it just like
you would pay me when he could and it
would just get behind and I just got
further and further behind and then like
the Christmas of 2007 I told them like
dude in the new year start paying me
every two weeks like you're supposed to
and he didn't like that first month of
2008 he didn't do that
so I just said screw you and took off I
mean sometimes I do I'm gonna tell you a
little story I'm gonna tell you a little
story of like of me basically what
happened to me this will happen to me
before the company that I'm with right
now right so I was at this
company right I know I was
right I'm coming from the sin and like I
don't know most of you guys know or if
you I don't know I don't like working
the sin because when you work in the
city you gotta be super fake you gotta
be like you know I don't know like that
people are there's a super hipsters wait
we're weirdo close and and just
like I don't know to me it's just like
it's from the water or you it doesn't
mix right so I never
right so whatever I was in this other
company I left and then I said you know
what I'm gonna apply to a company in no
life because I've been wanting to get
out of New York City for so long but I
can never find a way to get out of here
so I freakin go to this other company
and the guy comes in I'm like my the my
last job I was getting I was getting
80,000 right and then when I go over
there the guy goes like hey man we have
this great opportunity it's like a
start-up we have this great opportunity
where we can make about thirty million
dollars this year alone and basically
gave me a full story with
rainbows and leprechaun right so
the story and I kind of believe them I
was like y'all I believe them right and
then he goes like missing come meet me
at the office and we basically gonna
work something out it's a startup but in
the long term you're gonna make more
money whatever so I get over there first
of all I don't even know if we could
call that our office right we I
get there it's like on top of a bar I'm
like okay I don't know mother
yeah I'm like I'm not I'm not picky but
when you're on top of a bar like this is
like a I don't know it's like a
super small business tech right
and I say you know what it's a start-up
it's like you know like this happen
sometimes and it's like you start enough
so I know in a few months she's gonna
get good when I get there it's like a
bunch of interns a bunch of little kids
you know like guys run guys like 20 21
years old the other guys like it he's 28
years old but he's a freshman in college
which it doesn't make sense for me and I
was like how the you were
entering my 22 years old do the same
thing to me I'm looking at this kid I
know like what have you been doing
tonight so whatever he heat whatever so
make the story short when I get there
everybody's like oh we gotta use angular
and we gotta use PHP right okay cool but
angle is a piece of let's not use
that as jump to react we
our windows who basically release this
for this project are for five months the
project took about nine months to build
now that song we released it the whole
competition already have eat up
the whole market right now since I
believe this dude he had told me hey
we're going to pay you at a salary of
$50,000 dollar loss right there
automatically right like yo bro like
you're telling me to go back down so
 fifty thousand dollars like
that's almost nothing right so he told
me hey I'm gonna people salary right he
pay me the full salary ahead of time but
they were supposed to be in Poland by
the end of the summer of another fifty
thousand so I worked there for nine
months for fifty thousand dollars and I
was like yo this is some you
know for me like this is some
 and at the end I just
left the place and like that
happens all the time where you have to
have her a client or you have for an
employer who comes in sells you a dream
or tells you oh yeah right now we're
going through some hard times give me a
little break give me a little time and
when you're a good person like me and
like you know your boy Andrew sometimes
you give them that extra space and okay
don't worry I got you I hope you all
continue doing your work but then at the
end you end up getting you know I
mean the guy that gets paid you think
he's gonna get your lucky charms yeah
exactly yeah it just got worse with my
bills that's what it was it was I was
starting to use more and more credit and
stuff and I like I couldn't pay my my
rent for her that Christmas and that's
why I was like I said yeah that's it
yeah he kept on getting behind and then
the other thing was we had a project and
it was her a fitness club and they said
that it was going to take three or four
months with two developers ends I'm
taking a year and a half and we're still
working on it
like the guy him and another lead
developer had had outlined it to be
a three-month projects with to
developers full-time and I looked at the
project outline I read over the
documentation and stuff and I'm like
there's no way I'm like there's no way
this can be done in three months I'm
like you're like if this is going to be
six months a year and we were working on
it for in like a year and a half later
we're still working on it yeah that
that's one of the problems with like
working in in like a digital agency like
I did that before to where I'm like
working for a digital agency where they
get multiple clients so every time you
know client like I say somebody also a
restaurant right and they come to a
small firm or small agency and that I
hate we we way Joe's pizzeria and
we need a website can you guys
build it in a week the project
manager is gonna be like cuz he wants
the money to come in that first
downpayment open I deal with actually
doing two days you know like they'll
come up with some crazy days and
but I oh yeah we could just build it in
two days well you know the type of
website that they want
might take you two weeks three weeks
right so now sometimes you come out
losing because you put in more hours
into something and then you charge for a
set amount so like for for your guy he
probably charts for three months but
then the took a year and a half
yeah and and he was it was really bad
because we were dealing with the clients
like me and the other lead developer
we're dealing with the clients and we
had to lie to the clients and our boss
was continually said like what can we
charge them on what can we build him
extra for and stuff what wasn't in the
original specs and it was just like I
mean an awful feeling when you have to
lie to the customer you know half this
man and there were two hot checks as
well I know that that definitely is some
problems right so I when it comes to
like you know women sometimes you know I
love women but sometimes they ski me you
know what I mean they come in with that
extra little smile you know they come in
nice they talk to you super nice like
how you can chose separately no kidding
everything's good you
get you with that oh my god I can't
really do it and then you just be nice
to them next thing you know is they rape
you
you know how does hot don't get gas man
yes like a doobie active thirsty they BR
don't give you 11 go they're not gonna
go to Little Rock so I say yeah yeah um
I'm from Philly um I'm here in State
College yeah from I'm from Norfolk like
something would be like I'm from Philly
and they'd be like I'm just outside of
Philly but I'm from Philly yeah you're a
dad you know yo Joe I have a question
for you though okay um this place I'm
about to start right now I was a little
skeptical when they offered me a job
because there's only gonna be junior
developers there mmm these like Garrett
they've been around for like two years
so they're a startup and I'm probably
gonna be the most experienced person
here I don't try I'm trying to figure
out like is is this you know is this a
normal thing or for people to just hire
junior developers yes is very very
normal so like let's say an example
right what Bigelow will stacks you guys
are working on well the guy is like they
don't know anything about code they're
leaving it up to us to figure out like
what languages we're gonna use I'm a
user yet honestly yeah the other guys or
I'm a front-end guy the other guys are
back in you know I'm not sure what's
that you're using but they did mention a
PHP who and things like that
all right cool cool cool yeah no um that
 is very normal very very no like -
- happens all the time like you know
sometimes it's like this let's say
 his name on Johnny and and
 Anton right Danny and Anthony
came up with this idea
so create a startup of I don't
know creating fridges spinners
and right and you bought them
online as they come up with this idea
they they both own a business or they
both got mommy and daddy come in
and then they like you know what man we
need developers we have this idea to
order fridges spinners online on
one click button whatever right so
though they don't know how you know how
this thing works they don't know how
back-end development work they don't
have front-end development works there
is no they need a website they need a
website to take the users information
register them take the payment and
that's it that's what they really know
and that that happens all the time
now for you that you're coming in rain
you come in as a new developer it was
this your first job or you have other
jobs that's different well this is my
first developer job I mean I did things
for like friends hmm but as far as
development this is my first one my job
right now I'm a I'm a chemist right now
it has nothing to do with you know
developing at all no turn being a
developer God didn't Philly yeah I got a
lot stuff under my belt seriously I'm a
little smarter little oh boy man that's
what I'm talking about
but yeah so look this way you come in
you come in and you basically the good
things about this is there is no head
engineer no somebody a senior developer
you have extra space so go in there and
if you up no I don't really notice
this right especially if you have a
developer and it cut not it happens
right so but the same time you gotta be
strong and be like okay you gotta catch
yourself you gotta catch yourself when
things are going wrong when things are
taking too long when you're like okay
I'm working on this component and
there's a whole bunch of bugs but it's
taking too long right if there's a
senior developer they're assuming the
developer might come in and help you out
and be
simply guide you to the right way right
but since you're there more and
everybody's also junior developers
you're basically you gotta catch
yourself and basically I'll be able to
find the answer to certain problems on
your own you know in a sense that's good
because that's gonna make you way better
developer by the next time you go to
another company you you're gonna go in
there like man I've been to so many
problems that I figured out myself that
everything else is right so that's the
good side of it now the bad side is that
you don't have that extra backup you
know it's like the good thing when
you're working with a theme where it's
diverse with junior developers mid level
senior level it's like you could fall
fall back on somebody but I oh hey I
don't know how to do this what up you
know it's like you can just go in there
and you know like can you help me up but
now you don't have that so that's the
bad side of it about it and also too is
that you don't know how the other
developers are this times where you
might be doing or you know your job
really well and you're good in
the front end but now again they might
just be experimenting with
that they don't have idea how this is
gonna play out or like let's say an
example like how the last job where I
was saying before when I got there the
people that were doing the back end with
 interns there were like junior
developers kids that don't even know
what the hell they were doing so they
built a back-end in PHP like raw PHP art
with no organization with no migrations
nothing right just long
the Wild West right so for you to go in
there if you have the most experience
you gotta go in there first of all be
like yo we do this by the
book so like that you could save
yourself and you can find a help online
also too cuz I let's say somebody come
in be like oh I'm a great Python
developer oh I'm just gonna do
this raw Python look at that kid
like No
we're doing this with a
framework we're doing this bolero we're
doing this with Django we doing this
with Ruby on Rails because none of you
guys are our specialists or you haven't
had the years of experience that it
takes it takes to architect a big
project right is in the beginning
everything simple is that oh yeah we do
a router front page we're doing a little
thing here we adding a registration
there but website depending on type of
application is it becomes huge and to
maintain it if you don't have a
framework that can become a
nightmare right so hopefully the people
that you work with are people that you
guys can interact or as a team and come
up with the best ideas Joey listen to
and it's not just it's not just like
let's say somebody who knows it all
hopefully that doesn't thinkers from my
experience every time that I had to work
with other junior developers
people come in thinking they know
everything you know every job even
yourself going to the job thinking and I
don't know I don't have enough
experience for this but that's to
keep yourself humble in the sense of
going in there with your mind open and
open for ideas where people might say
hey what you're good at that other
person is not good at whenever he's good
at you're good at you know whatever he's
not good at you're good at right so yeah
bounce ideas and you'll find the
solution to things hopefully that and
you know and everything's gonna be fine
no soul unless you don't have somebody
who's like some smartass okay who's that
oh everything that he says is its final
because that brings problems to look to
a project you know cuz when there's a
senior developer you like oh man this
guy has 10 years 15 years so you trust
its judgment but since you you all
basically are new developers it's like
at least one of you got I just gotta
know hopefully it's not somebody else's
like you know it's the other person can
go in there with an open mind and don't
be an asshole
you know because that those are the bad
things that happen in situation like
that when there's no senior developer
although it doesn't matter how senior
you are you're still gonna come across
problems that you know you're missing a
comma or your logics wrong and you're
gonna have to have a network of people
that you can count on and talk to so you
have to build your own kind of network
like being being able to call up Joe and
say Joe I've got this problem can you
take a look at it or you know being able
to rely on other people to be able to to
get across problems because it's going
to happen and yeah grow your your
development life you're going to come
across problems that you could sit there
for three hours or somebody else takes a
look at it and pictures in five minutes
yeah yeah well like the very first
things that I learned just like if you
go through this copes course was there's
like a million ways to do the same thing
because every time he gave a project I
just try to do it just free out of my
head on my own before ever looking at
his stuff and then I could make it do
the exact same thing but then when he'd
go to show his code how he did it
it's like doctor say but like okay I can
see how he did this here and how he was
thinking here and so it's just like you
know it's beneficial to learn to do
things multiple ways because you never
know who you're going to be working with
and you can kind of piggyback off of
what they're doing is them you know how
to complement each other exactly yeah
but I think those guys are gonna be the
heart because if if the company you know
the owners are the company they trust in
you with the website they know your
skills you know how comfortable you are
with the front-end now it's all up to
whoever's gonna be uh the guys are you
gonna be working with right when you go
in there you basically gotta find out
exactly why the backgrounds have just
casual with you don't be like Ashley
what you think that you know but I I got
their resumes actually IX they both got
for their resumes but I wanted to check
them out before I even got there the one
guy he just merged with hi I'm he just
graduated college
like how good he's going to be to be
honest but I mean no he he could be no I
letting bag chips whatever then and a
girl
Oh like she got like a 4.0 so she
probably like she probably really knows
what she's doing so yeah I definitely
check them out already it doesn't it
doesn't matter how well our score is I
had girls in my class in college and
stuff they were really good test takers
but they would come to us they come to
other people that and just for help
because they couldn't figure out
yeah sometimes I yeah it's just how
they're just a critical thinking and
like you know being able to to to act
with pressure because like some we will
dig but then the pressure of like how
you know showing results it's a
different time pressure like oh like you
know owner or manager might come by like
every two three hours that Oh
how's everything going guys but when
they come in with that it's
pretty much is like I must show you they
hurry the long that's what it
really means
you noticing I'm just saying that how
was you know because yeah all the time
like even my own company like you know
the owners they're super nice but I know
body language I know how is is an
old hey how's everything guys you guys
need something any some water here it is
pretty much to make conversation to try
to find out how far along you are so
some people they can't deal with that
pressure the like man they start getting
impostor syndrome and like oh man I
don't know if I could build this I don't
know how you know if I have enough
experience like that happens but
for you I think you're already
comfortable and you don't come the one
thing you're gonna go in there and just
kill - no yeah I'm I'm pretty confident
you know I get results done I'm just
hoping other guys are you know just as
good mmm
but I mean we'll see no no that's what I
was saying like I've got a history of
PHP and stuff but it's all like Wild
West stuff it's not framework stuff oh
yeah before before a lot of the
frameworks I learned in 2000
I was learning PHP in 2000 we didn't
have frameworks back then though Nealon
coming in to all this stuff and there's
so many frameworks there's so many
different tools that you need and and to
deploy and my I great and all that stuff
and I mean yeah I've looked into it a
couple years ago but like I've only been
going at it seriously for about a month
and a half so it takes a lot to even
though I know PHP and my sequel takes a
lot to like Lehr eval does so much for
you it makes it does magic
like it doesn't magic because I used to
write my own validators I wrote my own
kind of shopping carts stuff like that
you know we didn't have no RMS and stuff
like that so it's a lot now I can just a
beauty of it because it's like now like
for for like a developer right like all
you have to do is just go in if you know
exactly what you want to build and you
know exactly what are the pieces that
you need you're good like if you follow
a framework there's people who'd be like
a framework is seven seconds
slower than a I caught it myself
so somebody who comes to me with that
shame and I'll be like man shut the
up because you don't know this thing
gets complicated I've been in companies
where you know they created something
which was efficient ten years ago right
now ten years later because there's no
documentation there's no framework
there's nowhere that where you could
look online and be like well how do you
change this how do you make this a
little bit faster how do you make this
website more secure there is no
framework it was like some some guy who
created this your friends brain and it's
like now you gotta think you know it's
like even like in my company this
there's a page right thankfully we
change our whole company to an era right
that's why I got hired but before they
used to have something called pearl
interchange right the whole website was
made in Pearl and every page you
will see different people who actually
coded and everybody code it's completely
different enzyme variables are
please me different so instead
of like somebody will instead of
put in prospect
somebody would put PRD country are you
supposed to know that that means product
if you don't keep a certain way of a
 you know of keeping the
variables a certain way so when people
come in ten years from now they could
look at them oh yeah we have
documentation on what this means
so we have documentation on the way how
the routing system works right so it's
like the the most important thing right
now is working with frameworks man
people want to be doing on their
own because they feel like they they're
smarter they're they could go in there
and create on their own and it's
like whoopty do you wanna candy for that
like it doesn't matter if you could code
it yourself alright because right now
the most important thing is is this
thing gonna be able to be maintainable
can people actually come in at any
moment and read your code and be able to
read and follow it if they can't follow
it that code is useless no like just a
few months my name a few months ago two
weeks ago we let go somebody because
their code
they've been coding since the 90s right
but they this person we told him the hey
learn laravel right like oh I know
laravel I know Oh cuz she knew well the
person I don't wanna say she or he he
knew he knew Ruby on Rails so he
told and said the hey he knows Maribel
so he came in and like oh I know laravel
I understand it completely and it's like
bro you never look at the
documentation like you got to go in
there and learn the framework you gotta
learn how to do things the framework way
because that's what's gonna save your
ass if something goes wrong on the
website or whatever you could look
online and be like hey how did fun today
you know XYZ found the answer for this
 and you go to Larrick ass that car
somebody has that same question that you
had five years ago and there's like
20 answers for doing on your own
you're gonna Wow Wow last now
you're just you're going off the deep
end
you're like somewhere everybody swimming
over here by the beach your song way
over there channel with the sharks like
you got to come back and chill with them
you know what everybody's at that's what
the frameworks to free all right
wait a minute sorry I went into right I
just saw flashback this person I'm like
that I wanted to slap the shadow support
Django right yeah yeah because I've done
it jangle a flask when I'm out here was
I got on that web site meetup calm and
there was a lot of people there all
Python programmers and that was I live
like literally in the middle between
Cincinnati and Indianapolis both as an
hour away in opposite directions and so
I decide well you know I just goes check
out see what these people are because I
had one book on Python I was meeting up
with amilia like honestly what we would
have you do learn out here in both of
these cities learn a PHP because you're
going to need to use it on a lot of
legacy sites but everyone out here all
the new stuff new companies starting up
they're all using Python for the backend
stuff out here where I'm at it's always
like okay so in the meantime I have got
to meet some actual developers working
for various different companies and get
a little bit of guidance of like what I
need to do specifically if I want to
stay here which I necessarily don't but
uh but they also give me an opportunity
to network and meet people and have
people that as they're like yeah you
know just keep coming in hanging out
with us and going over stuff with us and
as we see your skills grow if we feel
like you're capable doing a job we'll
all be your references and you might've
end up getting a job with us or
something so that's when I was like I
need to learn all the basic front stuff
front end stuff and brush up on my HTML
again is CSS
and it just kind of mainly focus on
getting it javascript under my belt and
then I'm gonna just jump in and all that
other stuff yeah I think right now like
if you're gonna do what development you
I don't know HTML CSS right so that's
automatically that's to build any page
that's what you need and then from there
JavaScript for everybody should be like
if they never done code before should be
like your introduction to programming
language right because HTML CSS is not
programming but once you touch
JavaScript then now you get the hang of
actually dealing with variables loops
for each loops if statements
else switch else if in a
whole bunch of extra that comes
with every programming language that's
out there right and different type of
data types right you got the
strings you got numbers you which are
 integers they could use name
dashing numbers by um whatever right so
but it's like it's your introduction now
when you're looking for a job and I told
everybody I repeated a million times PHP
is like 80% of the web so for somebody
that's trying to get into web
development you got a no PHP just for
the hell of it because at any moment
you're gonna bump into it and then the
last thing that you want to do is lose
the opportunity to get that job because
somebody asks you do you know PHP just
there's people that would throw at
you just because it'll be like pee and
then if you be like no that's it
automatically know about web they
actually do you know my sequel you don't
know my sequel you cannot touch the back
end because if you don't know my sequel
my sink was like 90% of the the
of every type of database out there even
people that are not able working on on
web stuff you go to businesses and their
databases in my sequel so you could
literally get a job
just doing my sequel like you don't even
need anything else that's how big my
sequel is right so if you don't know
those five things as a web developer you
don't have to be an expert either on PHP
or my sequel but just nobody if you know
about it you're safe because every other
person that's out there if they hire you
for to be an expert they're gonna come
to you and be like hey here's $90,000
here it's $100,000 your expert
right if you're not expert they're not
gonna pay you that much so you in your
head you got a number like eight you
only pay me fifty sixty thousand dollars
I'm not supposed to be an expert as if
I'm an expert I'm not gonna take
this job and you had that's how you're
supposed to think so when you go in and
somebody tells you hey no PHP in my
sequence I cool I know I already I know
the basics and you could say yes I know
PHP in my sink ooh cuz everything that
you want to build on PHP it's out there
on the internet if a a business owner
tells you hey can you create a cart
system there's a million examples out
there it's like this I roll with people
looking online finding answers online
you're not creating you're not
recreating the wheel
you're not like it's not like when you
go to like I say an example for for
Google or you go like one time I went to
the tumblr of offices right so to hire
to be an engineer there
so basically create a system for the
file upload write to go fast right me
out at that time when I went in there I
wasn't prepared for that the type of
questions that they gave me there
because those are that's not even
welcome
that's like trucking engineering I
wasn't I wasn't you know I was like you
had data structures you got a
algorithms down a whole bunch of
that they throw at me that I wasn't
ready at that time but that's a
different type of interview when you
come in as a web developer all they care
is can you build this page
is a joke can you come in we have to
design can you build it we have this
HTML email can you build it and they
don't care what what language it is they
don't care how you do it
90% of the time all they care about is
that you get the job done that's what
cuz have a product out there making
money that's what's important
they don't care what we care about we
the Nerds that we in here we like what's
the most efficient way to create
this database or what's the most
efficient way to create this array this
filter of this array don't care about
that that is care that's out there
that's working
that is exactly the I did I do that
quick question for you like in the
actual job setting you know since you've
been working for various companies on
when is it okay to be copying and
pasting over and when is it not
okay and like witted how do you know if
you're going to like cross the line it's
like plagiarism type alright to me
it all depends on what you're building
right
like for me like I work in a company
where we basically set up glasses right
so basically that's what my company does
I don't touch no glasses I don't even
wear glasses but that's what they they
sell I come in our build a
website right so that's my job basically
I had to create something called a Tryon
T which is the person gets to quite a
high college for pointers where the
pupil or I had to calculate um how big
the glasses are basically size them up
on their face I had to create a whole
bunch of and react right now
there's a whole bunch of other companies
who also have that they have they don't
have exactly what I created but they
have similar things you know this Warby
Parker there's a bunch of other
companies glasses usa.com they all have
something similar to it but if everybody
calls it completely different we're all
building the same thing but it's
completely different now if I go and I
start going through their their source
code and I go in there and I copy their
source code and I copy their their
formula of how their function is and how
it calculates the eyes if they find that
out then we get sued that I do that know
right I'm not gonna do less because I
know exactly that's like something that
they could really find out well
let's say right now an example all your
competitors right whoever it is and you
work at this company you work at I
 I don't know Google calm
I Google right and then you go
on Facebook and you're like oh
Facebook has a nice animation with their
head burger in Oh for each line it shows
up for each line right
you can copy that that's just an
animation you could copy that style you
go in there and see their CSS style and
copy it nobody's gonna come to you and
be like hey guys you copy my CSS
nobody's gonna do this it has to be
something that is proprietary for you to
guess or for you to get in trouble so
it's always fine to copy something
everybody copies like it doesn't matter
who it is every single person
copies nobody here created this thing
because none of us created you know dot
the the standards of HTML or CSS so we
have to go into all the wizard Mozilla's
 some substantive element
never exactly to look for look for
examples or look for on was a cold
I think it's cold school something like
that uh W 373 I'm sure everybody does
that I've been here for five years and I
still do that
I don't know flecks boxes by like the
back of my head I don't know that
I'm working on something that I want to
implement flex spots
I look it up so basically yeah all all
the basic that everybody uses for
everything that's cool but more or less
it's when it's like you said proprietary
or it's something like you're creating
you created a brand new type of web app
specifically for this website yeah like
you couldn't just be like someone can't
just come copy that from you unless
you had an open source just oh yeah
exactly
just have also yeah okay I got a I got a
question on right quick um that who do I
cut off Lyon go over there just be real
quick Joseph um you can copy and paste a
lot of stuff and there's a lot of open
source stuff there's a lot of stuff that
you can find but realize that if you're
starting to learn it's better to type
 out learn the stuff but once you're
comfortable and you know what you're
doing and you know what the code is
doing you can you can go and grab an
example from a website or like say for
example you needed to upload a file and
then that file needed to create a
thumbnail well there's like there's a
script already out there to do that
so you can pull that script in and just
implement it into your application so
that when some of the uploads and image
it automatically creates a couple
thumbnails and keep the original size
and and say like say you needed
something that generated a PDF well
there's a script out there that you can
hook into your application that will
take a HTML page and turn it into a PDF
file so realize that there's a number of
scripts like say a shipping module from
UPS you're going to drag that in for
your shopping cart you know you don't
need to try and create everything
because there's a lot of stuff that's
already created out there for you so
realize that some things I mean you
could spend two weeks two months three
months trying to create something that
generates a thumbnail for you and it's
through JavaScript or you can pull an
open source script from the web you know
so you're not going to go and try and
learn that but also at the same time
if you're still learning learn to do
like the basic to get stuff working
yeah and it has this approach I take is
that like when if I'm just making like a
little basic site that's basic like
template type stuff I know how to do all
the CSS styles and the HTML all that
stuff I just copy and paste over but if
I were to doing something like the first
time I had to do forms like a sign up
register type thing I didn't know how to
do that I went through and I just
freehand it coated all that stuff that
way I could do it a couple times and in
the concepts of what that thing does
kind of got embedded and concrete and my
skills of being how to do of how to do
it yeah I know how definitely a brewery
where well Andrew like one of the
problems that a lot of people have is
that people be like hey like let's say
an example you you building a web page
and you're like I need a slider right so
instead of you building the slider
because you don't know how to
put the slider you go on YouTube or you
go on jQuery on on Google but I how do
you know get a slider jQuery slider so
instead of them building the slide of
themselves they just copy somebody's
slider but they don't know how to build
it so now they put it to their website
or they put it to a website of a client
and since they didn't know how to build
it themselves now they can't edit it
they don't know what's going on behind
the scenes and now that side most of the
times you you end up it just happens
because they haven't so a lot of people
they come in they they add a
plug-in they add up a thing and they're
like they don't know how that works they
don't know where the functions are for
for that plugin they just say hey
there's a plugin that i got for jQuery
jQuery why they don't know how it works
and they just add it to their page so
it's like if you're brand new developer
at least find out how and find out how
it's actually main popular you know
especially if you're gonna put it for a
client because that color is gonna tell
you hey can we
this and then now you're talking like um
I only think this two slides for the
left to the right I don't know how to
make it from right to the left
you know you don't want to look like
that you wanna even if it's even if it's
a plugin you want to come in and you
want to be able to to be comfortable
something like only mistake that's mine
you know and I think one of the best
like basic skills someone can get
because I know it's been beneficial for
me is that if you do have to like go and
look at how to do something learn how to
read free reverse-engineer that code
like you can look at you like okay this
part of this code does this and that
does that so if I were to change this
part of it to this or whatever it would
do it backwards and that kind of stuff
yeah exactly
I think reverse engineering is like very
crucial to being able to work and do
stuff in a timely fashion but also learn
more from the phaser you know at least
in my personal experience
yeah you're right here so kids with what
is the same yeah all like I've been on D
like I just I've been looking at sure
you look with jobs um just to see the
hello they see if I could just get an
interview but a lot of entry other jobs
I'm seeing nowadays it's like it's not
just being like a web developer is he
like is a web developer flash hi brick
web designer so they like or you need to
design you need to be able to design a
whole page and my problem is like I can
build a page like if you give me the PSD
I can build like I can go input the HTML
the CSS the JavaScript or whatever in
and I get I don't know I'm still playing
around with PHP in my sequel but like I
can build a page but like I can't design
a page so what are your recommendations
on that should we start learning like
design is like sure we get a unity
course on design I to become wide web
designers or do we just say punt that
and just worry about focusing on the
cold I think everybody should have the
basics of design as far as like I the
Photoshop sketch or in the
right just the basics right not saying
you're gonna come in and be a designer
because the problem is that the industry
has freaking I don't know it's Donna all
freaking 360 melted everything together
so now everybody there's not like back
of days like you're a designer you're
developer you're back in developer know
now everybody because of the internet
because of courses and because of how
the web works everybody knows a little
bit of everything now so now not only
are you competing with just especially
when you're a brand new developer oh
you're getting those junior positions
it's like you know what let's try to get
as much as we can out of this person
let's try to get into if we need to
somebody it's an ethical design he could
edit the design if we need somebody to
come in and do the code he could do the
coding we need somebody to do the HTML
emails he could only see my emails right
so now they want everybody to have a
little bit of everything especially when
you coming in as a brand new developer
like it just opens a door for for new
developers like let's say um an example
the designer was a desert I know for
like 10 15 years and now uh he's getting
into what development right he wants to
get into one to relish well what does
that do is like it kind of messes messes
it up for the route of my hate of us
developers because now he's coming in
with design skills and he's also got the
basics of what the man
so now it's it up for all of us
you know so it's like the same term for
you now you for for you to compete we're
sharing are sharing people you gotta
have the basic stuff or design so that's
what I advise to you just know the
basics know at least how to move things
around inside of a PSD file um you know
how to cut things up slice it up that's
the minimum you know because there's
gonna be people who's gonna come in and
they're gonna be like
know this I know that I know that on the
land of that so if an employee comes in
and say hey this person already knows
it's cold but this person knows how to
edit videos or edit photos he knows how
to retouch it they're gonna give
the job to this other person
yeah they're more valuable you know okay
I got a follow question that so um
because even only like these doing a
developer job I'm seeing like UX
so should we be looking into like okay
Photoshop I took a good I find a good
Photoshop course on udemy and then spawn
a good like UX course or should we focus
on you act like cuz I don't see like
like the junior developer job I'm
looking at right now it's like oh you
need to be able to build a page you need
to you like what good UX design I'm like
exam like developers job was this a
designer or UX evoke Josh is it even a
is even a separation anymore is like
it's just everybody to be a developer
now you're gonna have to know UX Tom I
guess be a web designer and a developer
all in one and just say like okay when
they tell you hey
they were somebody who knows UX design
all of the
99% of the time I'm being honest with
you
if they mixing up what designer with me
joining us.she why designer UX UI
developer most of the time is gonna be
somebody who was a recruiter they don't
know what the hell they talkin about
most of the time they they look at
keywords and they go to like let's say
Google right they look at Google in the
respect Oh what is Google looking for
right now oh they're looking for nodejs
even though the job has nothing to do
with no js' they put it in there even
though the job that you're gonna be
doing has nothing to do with designing
or UI design that she has nothing to do
with it like I went to school for
 for that
I got a communication design degree
right that she has nothing to do with
web
right that's for people that they wanna
plan out things usually is for somebody
who was a product designer right a
product designer comes in back in the
days who come in and say hey um we're
launching now the the new Kellogg's
right Tony the Tigers gonna say
hey it's gay right so that's this new
slogan right so Tony the Tiger
comes in and we gotta create a
rainbow box for him
now right so that's what the product
designer used to do back in the days now
because of the webbing because nobody
cares about print right now what all
this college is they're creating this
new you know actually Y design and this
and that it's more about just what's
gonna be the the view or the branding of
the product right so for a developer to
try to learn that it's literally
irrelevant all you need to know is just
hey do you know how phones work do you
know how things look do you know that
nowadays most on logos of a company goes
on the Left do you know that most menus
are on the right side do you know that
uh there's a menu a hamburger me man
you've been going on websites right so
if you know those things in cook so like
let's say AWA RDECOM
which is a word calm which shows you
like the best designers the best designs
out there you could look at the best
cases for UX and UI right so even if
they actually interview they'd be like
do you know best practices for UX alone
UX UI just be like yes I know
how a website works I know how a webpage
looks I know what are the newest trends
I know what bootstrap is I know what
responsive design is like that's what
they really care about
oh man I gotta take a course of UX UI
you're not gonna eat - yeah I've
been working in this industry for five
years I haven't had one person ask me
about all the that I
studied for four years like a football
two years and a half like it's not it's
not relevant to what we do as developers
you know like I just wanted to do this
he just built some projects you know
build something that you have to login
authenticate yourself then it's I don't
know tracks sports teams or shows the
stats for player it's like just create
something and then you're gonna come
across well how do I lay it out where do
I put the navigation how do i what's it
like for example with UI UX stuff does
it take me three clicks five clicks to
get to the piece of information I want
you know how hard is it to go and get
down to from like the NFL team to light
like from I guess east/west division or
whatever it is to the team to the player
through his stats you know and am i
doing that in the most efficient way
possible
same with banking applications it's all
about you know well I got into this I
got it into my account I looked up a
stock I got the stats on the stock oh
now I want to go back out and look for
something else well is there a menu item
like a hamburger menu item that Oh
slides open the menu and I can quickly
jump back to the main screen instead of
having to go back back back back back
you know alcohol mode it's it all about
you know the more stuff you build the
more you'll understand is like well how
many times do I have to click to get to
the information that's pertinent for
that user and can I do it easier can I
have it so that it jumps out of that and
gets to something else really quickly
and and I've seen it with like with that
there's a big bit like there's three
Canada Trust in Canada and there is
 horrible I have to leave and so
yeah there there it's Earth they've been
they've been constantly updating their
their mobile app and
their desktop app and like they do use
interface design like some of it really
bad my same with Royal Bank I was I was
on there at a Direct Investing and he
would have to go back back back back
back to get out to go to look up another
stock or something so um their interface
design sucked and it was because they
didn't have a slide-out menu that could
quickly jump to look for something else
you know so you've got to think about
that when you create an application and
you get three or four levels deep do you
have a breadcrumbs that lets you jump
back three screams you know to quickly
navigate yourself throughout it
throughout your application that's
that's what UX design is is how easy is
it for somebody to get the information
you know or add information or edit
information how easy is it for them to
edit their profile you know do I have to
go through five different screens to
edit my profile or cancel my account or
turn off my newsletter subscription you
know so just depends on on like that's
what that's what I think UX design is is
how efficient can you get around the
application and the more applications
and the more little projects you build
the better you'll get at it yeah I
definitely agree with you in that of
what you actually wise but at the same
time like what I saw everybody who's a
brand-new developer maybe if you ever
use the website and you know the things
that you hate about websites and you're
like this is horrible this just
taking me too long to sign up this thing
I'm pressing enter on the submit button
it's not even showing me something it's
loading the data is being sampled you
get requested the post request is so
slow so now I'm pressing it multiple
times like that is a issue those
were you know you actually wise but a
reality for developer branding developer
if you fall into this trap of trying to
learn that's out loud oh it becomes
a nightmare it's like if you decided hey
I'm just gonna take a UX UI course on
udemy now
now you're basically you're not study on
JavaScript not study on that you
need to be studying need to be focused
on because now you're trying to learn on
other stuff that you're not gonna
implement into your job that you might
have a little stage in there and be like
oh okay
but 99% of the time that's not even your
decision because you're the developer
this designers is design team is a
product designer that's a head designer
and the head designer talks to the owner
right so you your job is pretty much be
your developer you have enough an
opinion thought-out
you know sometimes give an input but
your input is not the final sake you
know so I think if we go into a place
and really oh I'm gonna take another
course on udemy on learning UX UI foot
simple that you're not gonna be it
you don't need at the time it's not
gonna be worth it it's like when you
look at all these jobs all that
that's there is like business man like
we could go right now and we quietly
look like I'll share my screen and be
like yo let's go to and be calm real
quick right we're gonna do sign quick
let's delete this is put and say web
developer right Betsy Oh little
I think I'm not saying into this thing
okay so you see this one's not that bad
because this one's telling you okay HTML
html5 jQuery CSS Ajax my sequel and PHP
so they have an idea of what they're
actually posting now let's see if we
find one that's just completely some
retarded whether it gives you like
30,000 oh things now usually they have
like let me see if I find one oh we're
looking at the whole country oh let me
say a lot
this was not that bad
but I'd be fine and sometimes I find
like like listings that be like
oh do you know no GS do you know PHP do
you know JavaScript do you know
general do you know Python do you know
 yes do you know this test isn't
this but do you know neuroscience like
like what is gonna be and it happens all
the time because all this recruited a
lot of times you know they like the
other day we was looking for developers
for our company right and to be
honorable developers write the was
sending us first out was doing a c-sharp
in Java right which I learned to do a
laravel well people that don't even know
anything about lateral or Ruby on Rails
it was guys that were super old like
they're like I've been a Java developer
for 15 years and I'm like
brother have you loved it do you know
about MVC in the guys side well I can
look it up and I'm like we 2017 every C
is like the standard it's like
if you don't know this I don't want you
touching this website so that's it the
same thing I'm told the owners I was
like where are you finest people and it
happens that the what we looked
at the listing that the recruiter was
putting he put 30,000 different
 in there it's like now those people
are coming in into that position and
that's why sometimes they float out you
know like a job the job posting cuz
right now you're a junior developer and
you apply it for something but most
companies that like may we got 500 500
emails and out of those 500 emails only
25 employees a lot of applicants and
yourself which is 26 are actually for
that position because know whoever
actually post the position putting a
whole bunch of different things that
have nothing to do with it
so it's like if I'm a Python developer
and I see Python in a junior front-end
developer position I'm gonna apply to it
because I know Python but that's not
what they're looking for so for you as
variety developer it kind of you
up is now you like trying to send emails
to something that's already you know
flooded with emails you know but that's
just how it is
it's the wet you know sometimes they
they do some like that
recruiters people over there man
when we ain't here man we got a squad
the missing who's online right now be
online check my peoples check the squad
shoutout him everything he just dropped
on like a Dublin lip off huh a work
shout to him army he got five minutes
every minute I got four I found on it
you know we got Barbara here Barbara go
to sleep man it's past bedtime man got
your boy can you see yo Matt still on is
like 4:30 in the morning right now
dedication the dedication man let me see
what else was in here we got a bunch of
stuff we got white crit uh who else who
else is in here
Victor Baku oh you see who else okay he
says Wix vs WordPress man I think I
don't know WordPress learn WordPress I
just got a little bit more control
well I think WordPress is the gateway
yeah yeah thing is the start is it is a
start for a lot of people it was a start
for me without I got my first digital
agency job it was working on WordPress
websites yeah on it wait you know what I
mean WordPress is just really powerful
it allows people that don't know how to
code to set up their own website get
online and get their their message out
build their brand and you know with you
know you can buy a you can buy a theme
that makes your website look like a
million bucks
you know you you buy a forty fifty
dollar theme and your website just looks
killer
you know you some designers when made it
and he spent a whole bunch time on it
and then he sells it you know 500 times
450 bucks a pop you know so you get that
you get that cool ass design and now
asking some people or was it Dean Forest
this guys did are making a killing I
mean now's a little bit too late but
those guys I got in there like in
2009-2010 hey those guys they make
millions out of it because you go in
there and that same thing gets resold a
million times and it costs $40 $50 and
you making money and it's like
you know those guys that they make money
from WordPress man they they definitely
they got the best out of it because I
just think I just think the whole
concept of WordPress is very powerful
and so for somebody that doesn't know
anything about it or is learning web
development just to see the
possibilities of what you can do with
websites and with plugins with themes
you know boom you can drop in this
commenting system boom you can drop in a
forum a chat system a shopping cart you
know it expands your knowledge of what
you can do with web development you know
here you can put in analytics you can
you know secure your website down a
little bit and stuff like that you can
send out emails and there's a whole
bunch of plugins that are
three or either paid that allow you to
do this have leadpages have little
pop-up chat windows on your screen so
that your users can do that and either
you can just implement those or you can
start trying to look at the code and
figure out how it's done you know it is
I think it's a good education for any
developer to get in and learn how were
dressed works and how it functions yeah
I got I got a question for both the off
with Andrew and Joe cuz like you know
how it is on the interweb they'll I go
if you a wordpress developer you're not
a real developer
so wish I opinion on that cuz I both
know PHP laravel well it is like good
nah independence I mean it really
depends on you know there's people who
scheme it like if you're designer and
all you know is just how to edit a theme
like that's a business right there like
this people who sell websites to
other people but hey I could come in and
and build you your website for your
restaurant and then download
theme and then put in the 30 different
plugins even though they don't know how
to sing works I was actually being built
but they can resell that that's a
business for some people well are they
web developers know right so then
there's the people who are actually what
developers who are creating the themes
and creative plugins like those guys
those are real one developer stages
happen to you know you just call a
wordpress as a way to create sites
quicker for clients because sometimes
you need results right now like let's
say somebody comes to me like one of my
friends he wanted me to build his
website for a strip club that he owns
right so I'm like I'm building it for
him and then I'm like wait
I was about to build a narrable and then
I realized I'm like ill I'm gonna have
to rebuild so much that I could
just go and get a theme and if I can get
a editor theme get it to plugins
and then he's gonna be fine cuz he's not
selling anything
he doesn't need a website that's
completely custom all he needs is the
basics
people to leave their emails people to
make reservations and that's it so
WordPress works perfectly for that look
yeah that's that's not a way for you to
make a side income you could freelance
and just drop on Craigslist hey you know
you need $500 site boom boom you you
know you pay they pay you 500 bucks and
you pop out of WordPress site WordPress
is free they just need to set up the you
chart you say it's going to cost you for
your web hosting it's going to cost you
for your domain you pay me 500 bucks
I'll set up your website put your
content and your pictures up on the site
and I'll install Google Analytics also
you know things and then you know you
give them a little tutorial on how to
use the backend
show them a couple links to some videos
on how to manage their site and you know
the setup or if they don't want to
manage their own site to change that you
just keep a business relationship with
them so that whenever they need to
change something you just log in step
back and change it and charge them 50
bucks a pop yeah I still have I still
have like a couple of clients they are
like on WordPress like people are like
in the middle of nowhere I got this
client that he's from Wisconsin right
and every time he just works a little a
little change he's like oh is it is
actually a restaurant and he's like oh I
just want to change something from the
many or I want to change the prices on
my i $50.00 minute is I can go straight
to my PayPal and he's like it takes me
two seconds to change it but it's like
almost little extra money so you know
money's you throw in the club you know
so yeah I like that I'll think about the
whole code yeah but I'll have we have
like a little gonna get or do like your
why would you wanna do that it's a waste
of time if your WordPress isn't real I'm
like nah it was like it's easy money
like why would you take easy money you
have to you have to learn WordPress if
you just want to have like freelance
work in or a freelance work whenever you
look online somebody needs some box
something edit or something to change on
their site it's always WordPress
almost every site
you see out there is gonna be WordPress
because regular people don't have enough
money to speak like you know what man
let's spend ten fifteen thousand dollars
on a custom theremin website because
that takes time so for a junior
developer if you could get in there and
you know at least get the experience of
creating websites the WordPress is fine
there's nothing wrong with that
of course other developers they're gonna
be like oh man I'm doing Python right
now and you work in a WordPress and it's
like yeah I got money in my pocket the
money in the pockets of matters we're
men freaking somebody asks me I was a on
the chat they're like uh dangle versus
lerigot
Larry so would I pick Larry oh for sure
um I'll be honest guys I still have a
bunker - I hear Python is popular in
academia meaning colleges and university
isn't understands why because there is a
powerful language and we do a lot of
stuff with it but at the same time I
don't know if you guys have ever tried
to do a project with Python
I feel Python to me is a clusterfuck
meaning like dealing with other
libraries and dealing with all like
even the package management system that
it has it's not even as organized as no
giasses of pipe no js' smpm or yarn
right so when you dealing with a project
like that like I hate dealing with
anything that is not organized that it's
already that gives me too much freedom
I feel like Python gives developers too
much freedom of like where they're gonna
keep the packages where everything is
and like it is a clusterfuck so working
with laravel laravel all you have to do
is work with composure composure is
already set up for you is that you
download it you do composing stole all
the packages can download it whatever
you
valerio has uploaded and Yasir you good
you could hit the ground running with
Maribel and lasting 15 minutes I created
a tutorial called PHP my sequel are
about 30 minutes it's like you can't do
that with Django you got to do a whole
bunch of extra you know so I don't
know that's my opinion
anybody else you messed around with
Django Python now I haven't looked at it
the only thing I know how to do in
Python is I know like the basic syntax
structure I know how to do like beginner
to intermediate strings and arrays and
just a few other minor things but for me
what I liked about it is it seems very
simple it's very compact but if there's
the deeper stuff I really don't know yet
cuz I haven't got that deep in it yeah I
like I like Python because it's similar
to Ruby and that's why I like it I like
the syntax of it but for me to create a
project a full project on it I wouldn't
do it personally because it's just too
much that you got to deal with as
far as like you know the hosting even
hosting a Python app is it's not
that easy it's not like if you just pop
it up on any server it's like you need a
special server for it you know it's like
I don't know
every time I've messed with it it never
it's never been easy it's always been
like some issue so it's like it's not
like Ruby Ruby is is an amazing language
everything is super simple and easy for
you or for the developer PHP any
host to host it so you could put PHP on
even on GoDaddy or sorry GoDaddy or
Namecheap anything you could use PHP I
know Jas you could go quit no GS on
Heroku or what's the other one
digitalocean
like it's easy but for me python is
annoying you know as well as languages
isn't always like people tell you
super-powerful
but I don't see it for myself
there's so much stuff that you got to
learn there's so much stuff I learned
that how many back-end different types
of languages you want to learn do you
want to have PHP the Python ASP or Ruby
on Rails you know so the question is is
which one do you wanna you want to get
good at you want to get really good at
one and maybe get into another one but
you know there's so much stuff with the
front-end framework and then all these
build tools and deploying and that you
know if you stretch yourself too thin
you're you're not going to be a master
of anything you know yeah that's true
that's definitely true the one thing
that I was told like it would kind of be
beneficial to me and it's not
necessarily going to be beneficial to me
as a web developer it'd be beneficial to
me in my current job is that uh pythons
really good at making a web scraping ax
and so what I could do is I work for HUD
right now I go in look at different
properties to make sure that uh the
contractors that went out to go to
whatever hit everything that requires
there was to do and so I'm working in
Excel and I got a copy and paste all
this stuff though that you can actually
make a Python program that reads website
grabs all the information I need
automatically puts it in my Excel
spreadsheet and literally all I would
have to do this hit approve or decline
which would make my work 75% times more
efficient there's a curl or guzzled
that'll do that in PHP yeah I think
guzzle cuz I think we did that before I
haven't really done web scraping not
much I've done it like moving once oh it
was already set up for me so all I have
to do is just click run but um I don't
know I haven't really it's not a big
thing for me but I think now if I dose
is powerful in its own way and there's a
lot of people that are using plus is
simple is
simple in a way where you could teach a
course like I remember back in the days
people are those like my introduction to
computers and introduction to computer
science and the professor was teaching
us C++ and I was like girl this is
 difficult and annoying and I'm
like why are we learning this
so now a professor by committing like
hey kids let's learn programming with
Python and it's like oh cool now it's
fun it's easy you know so I understand
what to use it you know what it's like
right now it was like other languages a
crystal Lang like man
 crystal laying what is gold like
those languages are a million
times better than Python but you know
how it is now what else Kristen lang
used for crystal lang
basically is a whole purpose programming
language like is like super isn't Hans
bethe right now nobody another year
should be at one point no um pretty much
you could use it for anything you could
use it for the same things that you use
a C C sharp but you see like C sharp you
could use it for creating software right
so you could create something with
asp.net create something with visual
basics like sky's the limit right it's
all about what you use it for dependent
is a continent I think the name is
coming right now people are using
continents to create Android apps right
but Kotlin is just it's just a language
it's just a programming language that
compiles into to bytecode so like let's
say you create a program right you
create a program with with cristal name
and then at the end you compile it so it
could be an executable file so you can
create I don't know a mood a
Microsoft Word or or crystal and you can
create a website on crystal lang you
could create a video game
Christel a like it's just a programming
language it was good about is that it's
at the same level as C and you know they
is as fast as see the programming
language and C is basically the standard
it's like the fastest language out there
there if that means anything like you
know sometimes like people tell you like
oh there's a fastest language
but it's like if you don't use it for
something that each speed is like it
doesn't mean the feature because I've
heard a lot of great things a crystal
but with a lot of the newer languages I
really don't know like exactly what
their niches like I'm still trying to
figure that out with like go as well and
stuff I mean I know goes developed by
Google right yeah yeah it's the same
thing it's like they create this
languages because okay tonight from what
I heard from Google they created gold
because they wanted to create something
as fast as C right and they wanted to
have something that was better than the
language C and then from day that
created that but what's crazy is that
everything on almost everything on on
Google was made with Python so it's like
I don't know it's like one of those
situations where is like they have a
whole bunch of lyrics together and
they're like how can we make this shift
faster but nobody knows what's the
reason to make you faster you know you
also got to mention that you can now use
a program called electron and you can
take like HTML Javascript CSS and turn
it into a desktop application yeah so
electrons really good and then there's
like Cordova or PhoneGap that allows you
to compile HTML CSS JavaScript and turn
it into like a mobile app it's called a
hybrid app yeah that's that's kind of
what like ionic does for angular it
creates that and then react native and
stuff like that even um view Jo view GIS
has a thing called
we X and that does like me
kind of calls her like mobile phones and
stuff so yes a lot I want to go ahead
make go ahead now go ahead I think he
talked before me anyone oh I was just
going to say that at some point I would
like to get a like a Android app or
something under my belt just to say I've
done one yeah that's pretty easy this
this guy uh Steve from bride or Steve
from Grider he got a course for react
native like if you are a web developer
like that's one thing too is like I
don't know you guys saw the video way I
released that about today yesterday
where I was saying hey I'm not
doing game development no more because
this shitty they are too hard it's too
much to learn right and that's the same
thing as all Android development
it's the same thing as iOS development
like when you you spend so much time to
learn at the web right to learn the web
to switch your brain to learn something
else like a whole different paradigm
which is like Android development or iOS
development like that's a whole complete
different world like people putting this
courses online right
it's like they put a course I gonna loan
you to me that I learn how to become a
game developer in like 40 hours no and
it's like it's not realistic because
game development is so difficult
and there's so many pieces to it that
you're looking at years you're not
talking about it what development right
now if somebody from here from the
chatroom will also become a web
developer they can become a web
developer by the end of the month if
they work hard throughout the whole
bottom right for you to become a game
developer you're not gonna learn that in
one month you never become a JavaScript
or Java developer who makes Android
applications in world 1 it's not going
to happen it's like that's a whole
completely different world
it's like software engineering it's like
it's a whole different world from the
web
the work is easy the web is like super
easy you don't have to worry about
hexadecimal you don't have to worry
about garbage collect you don't
have to worry about compiling like you
don't have to worry about so much
that that's what makes the web so
special but when you jump into something
else like Android development is or game
development or software engineering
that's a whole different world but is it
like a whole lot easier like say you
were going to do like a mobile app for
like just say like coding phase comm
versus like a course like doing
something like a game and stuff like
that yes this OPIC that's why things
like react native like for you you say
you wanted to create a Android app like
the best way to do it is to react react
native prettiest it's like the most a
native way that you could release an app
when you do it with Cordova or ionic
ionic what really does is it creates a
it's like a browser and creates a
browser inside the the phone creates a
the application it takes the HTML CSS
and JavaScript in kampala ozzie makes
into application and the application has
a internet browser on it so it loads
your application there but it's not
really using natively like native code
it's not compiling to me at all
so there's a whole completely different
thing you know so this is not a it's not
as slick and it's not as responsive as a
native app with like the ionic and stuff
like that but it is it's they call them
hybrid apps when you're using HTML
Javascript and CSS and you upload it to
PhoneGap and then it compiles it down
for either an iPhone or an Android
device or Windows device or a BlackBerry
device that's what PhoneGap comm does is
they you take your HTML CSS JavaScript
you upload it there and then it compiles
it down so that it's doing native kind
of calls to
the mobile device and that's what Mike
because I don't know about react native
I don't know how like if it's just the
same as it's calling Cordova kind of
api's or whatever
I'm not sure though well I want to know
that would be like a huge gap though I
jumping from web development to like and
rap I figure like the basics is the
basic and then you just gotta learn Mike
like the details like I don't know like
gaming like game development is huge
because like you gotta learn like like
Unreal Engine assignment that y'all are
like physics and all that is ours but is
that much of a jump from from web
development to like native fat like a
and rap cuz don't you just gotta just
like learn once you know the basics like
how to web works like you know dead
databases don't just need to know like I
are small little things in between Java
I would give you orders all right this
is like this is very simple when you
know the web the web is just programming
language right so you know you don't
have to worry about libraries you don't
have to worry about SDKs it's like this
when you want to work on all iOS you
gotta know Swift right before it was
objective-c so then not only do you got
to know a programming language there
from day you got to understand the
program Xcode so Xcode the program
itself is a whole different thing it's
like you trying to learn Photoshop right
imagine somebody tells you hey try to
learn a programming language learning
program the software itself and also
learn how all of these things work
together so that's what makes it are so
that's how I game development for me I'm
like yeah I'm not doing this alone
in Psych I keep torturing myself once a
year every year I'm like I want to
create a video game and every year i
torture myself trying to learn this
thing and it's like it's hard because
not only boy I already know C sharp
right which is easier programmer side I
got it but then I gotta learn um how to
work with on this thing called unity 3d
which is the game engine the game engine
has a million options so I think now
that I remember every option
like where where do I have the time to
learn this I think for somebody who has
nothing else to do like it's just focus
on game development they could probably
learn that but for somebody who is like
a a what developer to just say hey I'm
just gonna jump to game development it's
not that easy and here I got a realize I
feel you mean you also got to realize
that once you learn Swift in all that
sdk and all that stuff that's only for
iPhones and the majority of the market
is Androids Samsung Android phones so
then you've got to learn you know the
SDK the Java and had a packaged app for
Android operating system so that that
and like to create mobile applications
your end up creating you you've got to
learn for you know iPhones Android
phones and then if you really want
windows phones and Blackberry phones but
that's the thing where the hybrid apps
will work for all all different devices
they compile down to different from the
HTML CSS and JavaScript will compile
down to the code for iPhones the code
for Android phones and so that makes it
more beneficial you only have one code
base instead of two different or three
different code bases Nexus only app type
I'm concerned about like when I get my
website going I would like to just have
like a native app for whatever for each
one I would prefer it I have to pay
someone else to do that okay now if
you accept simple you go simple
things that can connect to an API like a
REST API which I'm actually working on
the coding phase once I finish coding
phase comm the website then I'm going to
create the react native chrome app which
just connects to the API and it just
does requests so unless say when you
want to save something saves it on to
you
site or API and that's it like that's
easy but what every comes card is like
when you want to create things that
gotta use the SDKs like you know the
camera gotta use the you know I
don't know facial recognition like that
my best is hard it's not as easy as
people think
no like I I tip my hat to all those guys
that they do like Android development so
for engineering
his - it is hard I actually try to get
into a couple of times and I'm like this
 is not for me like I like to code I
don't like to have this other extra
factor which is the user interface which
is like a software that you
gotta connect your code with that
software and like that's where it
becomes a nightmare you know plus also -
like let's say for UK um like let's say
think about like this when you learn
something like Java or you learn iOS oh
well Swift wait that language itself got
the standard library has a million
functions right so that language itself
has a chameleon function and you can't
remember all of them you gotta always
look it up now when a company like Apple
creates a SDK for iOS or they create a
new one they go and create that same
they created another function to it so
until the language they added and then
create another million functions so now
it's like you working with two million
functions on both sides you got the
flower the standard library and then the
other functions that SDK created
so it's like it's extremely hard to
remember that shape I know one of my
friends tells me that everything he does
he spends more time looking through the
SDK and looking through the
documentation then coded so to me that
 is for it you know what I mean I'd
rather be coding and creating cool
instead of spending so much time on the
documentation
they are true yeah yeah hey guys I think
I'm about to call it a night we've been
here for like two hours three hours it
was a good a very good show
you got nuts funny here we got Andrew
for the first time we got this idea in
sorry in yeah my camera done sigh we got
 we got Joseph we got your boy kid
greatness you know we got the squad man
we got you know a lot of people in here
we have what I think like 200 people
came in in and out so that was good also
pretty good good luck with that uh job
by self thank you thank you I appreciate
it I can't wait to go how it goes and
how things work out yeah I'm actually
I'm working we do this again and you
know I say I could come in and you know
update is I'm gonna yo should it came
out pretty good you know yeah definitely
I definitely let y'all know this so I'm
gonna see you guys later man
thank you have an assignment thanks show
you man no but make sure yeah yeah hop
on by the next time Manon and for
everybody who's here man go to coding
phase calm and register guys just trust
me two guys down this website is legit
make sure you register kids alright wow
