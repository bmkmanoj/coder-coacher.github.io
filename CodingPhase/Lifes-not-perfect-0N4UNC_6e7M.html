it again : face calm out here listen
guys like always life does not
disappoint me every time I tell you guys
you know life is not perfect no matter
what you do so yeah so got this craving
specifically so we could be able to
record the videos and audio downstairs
you know be away from the kid and
everything and make sure that you guys
get the best quality in this world and
this is what I'm telling you guys you
know it's like when I come in here and
I'm like I'm trying to work so hard I'm
literally I'm seeping my life around
this you gonna say so when when people
come in and just drop some heat or drop
some dumps like and I say hey I'm not in
the mood it's because things are not
going how it's supposed to be right and
just how life is
you know life is never supposed to be
perfect so anyways got this new crib
specifically so we could come in and be
able to do a whole bunch of videos for
you or a whole bunch of stuff and you
know spend so much money moving out here
and spend so much money buying gear and
doing a whole bunch of stuff and you
know after spending some time downstairs
you know I'm realizing I'm like for
whatever reason don't know if it's my
allergies or something right it's like
my chest as I clogging up and I'm like
wait what the hell's going on so I did
it one day I did a two days I did a
couple of videos for you guys downstairs
but then I realized I'm like yo I can't
be down here so for whatever reason like
allergies or something Poland I don't
know what the hell it is basically I'm
gonna have to I don't know Kolak uh
a company come in and and uh you know
just clean the air I don't know if it
was like whoever used to live here used
to have a dog or something um I don't
know exactly what it is I don't know if
it was like they had a dog and because
this carpet downstairs there's still
like the Poland's and that the freaking
the hairs or something so I'm like y'all
came and beat us this I can't we make no
videos downstairs and also chose this
house specifically for that main reason
and I just feel like everything it's not
going as planned man and like this
sounds like just feel like man sometimes
I just feel like crying like straight up
just cry cry it out because it's like no
matter what even when I feel like I'm
there and I'm like super happy I'm super
excited and everything's going good like
this always something else in life that
just it's like a block like and I you
you too hyper son don't get to hype here
you go here's a curveball just to make
make sure we ruin your your day or ruin
your your week yeah so dealing with that
even with our personal issues to that
you know
anika energy around me but at the same
time is all the BS the happiness in life
right you can never be happy out here
right you're gonna be good you can never
have something planned and go as you
like to be as you like it to be right so
that's how it is so now I'm up here I'm
in the second floor there's another
extra room that a half in the house and
so now I'm taking this as the office all
right I'm still gonna use downstairs to
do videos but not to do like my audio
okay
like I need to do audio whenever I'm
doing like you know recording videos for
you guys for the website or any
tutorials cuz I can't really be
downstairs for too long I think like the
maximum I could be there is like an hour
or two until everything is cleaned out
everything is I don't know I'm gonna
have to call up a company to just come
in and just I don't know free game make
the air good like how can we make the
air good you know like whatever it is
that we need to do how much we gotta pay
we gotta pay right but then at the same
time it's like I told you guys like now
it's an extra charge it so it's like you
know I'm already using this move in I'm
already like like ten thousand eleven
thousand eight already just on the move
a lot so it's like now we gotta come in
tomorrow gotta pay somebody cleaning up
all the carpets and all this other stuff
and I'm like man you know it's like you
know what I mean so then the beauty of
it
so I go to Guitar Center so buy this to
have better audio have a better
microphone for you guys I don't even
know where the microphones that but have
a little microphone pretty legit micros
microphone supposedly is the best one
it's called Sennheiser it's one of the
best phones for live and podcast so both
this one so as you can see I got my
chest is a little bit caught up from
downstairs the beauty of the great so I
don't know I like allergies and asthma
I've never had asked my I don't know
what it is I just know that I spent two
days on stairs and now my chest is
clogged up don't know why but um I go
out of my way I go by this thing right
the guy tells me hey man all you need is
this
all you need is this you need the
Focusrite USB everything is already
connected but mind you now this piece
that's right here doesn't fit there
what's the odds of that happening right
like this sounds up like your everything
is going wrong and then like the last
little thing this this was supposed to
be like my my little nugget all right
I've having like a horrible week he's
he's your little nugget of like half a
good day at the end of the day right and
it's like man this little piece is too
small for this so great Thank You Guitar
Center oh you guys are the best
you know it means you know sometimes I
all I can do is just laugh it off man
before I could just like spaz out and
just like you know you guys haven't seen
that movie where was this guy's name
Michael Douglas he has the glasses right
let me see if I could pick it up Michael
Douglas glasses glasses shotgun yeah so
let me show you the screen I'm pretty
sure a lot of you guys already seen this
this will be if you ever seen this movie
from Michael Douglas this is exactly how
Furai des like I'm this much closer to
just like spazzing out like really
flipping out out here but you know you
know me I'll try to think of it in a
positive way but
man that's what I got
it's freaking crazy like nothing could
ever go how you want a man falling down
that's anything moving hello miss eagels
in here Ramsay Jordan Alejandro Romero
Remi world
David yang Donovan Hans
khadeem I say Alejandro Jarrow Jerry

Julio caballo Dennis jr. what up en si
yeah check for mold in the carpet yeah
man I'm gonna check that out
moisture in the basement yeah I'm gonna
check that out
try the humidifier yeah I'm gonna try
that which is another thing I didn't
mention this so i go to i go to what's
the name of this thing up man what's the
name of this freakin thing Home Depot I
got to Home Depot right I've done like
30 trips today right so I go to Home
Depot and Home Depot they tell me oh man
take this purifier this purifier is
gonna you know clean the air out and
this just not even hitting do a shame it
didn't do I don't so I put that
 right in a box
I'm returning that tomorrow right
away so you know what I mean but it's
crazy man
yeah people out here dying and casting a
hunger word and Freddy Martinez is like
yo can we just make the air good for
real man man you gotta get a
dehumidifier yeah I'm gonna try that out
tomorrow Kelvin Davis says is in the
walls man don't wasting money on the
carpets let me see yeah no but you know
like I'm thinking basements that are
really bad there's the thing well I
don't understand
I've been embezzling that are really bad
like I used to go to one of my friend he
had a recording studio like a super no
budget recording story like you go in
there it's just full of dust and full of
a whole bunch of shake right and I've
never been like that like I've been
inside of the basement children
recording and you know how it is when
you're getting a recording booth like
it's it's like close to phobic pad right
but I've never had that happen to me
where's I kill my chest is clogging up
I'm like yo this ain't normal like this
never has this has never happened to me
all right and then not only that that
when we first came in here I went to the
basement a whole bunch of times and and
like it nothing ever happened to me like
if I would have known this I want to
have you moved in here what a freakin
moved somewhere else straight-up but
it's crazy man and I mean the house
everything else in the house is far to
me like I like the house I like the
location like every
it's just now that's a big letdown
because it's like you know what I mean
that was gonna be like the spot for me
to get all my stuff done you know what I
mean so now I gotta come here and do it
in this room which is pretty much right
next to all the other rooms which is
pretty much it's like I don't want to
have to baby you know be like okay I'm a
record send the baby downstairs I don't
want to do that to the baby you know if
the baby wants to be up here I want him
to be up here you know so that's just
like a big letdown like I freaking hate
that and I hate that and people don't
even know is like I swear to god it's
like my life is like constant stuff like
this happens you know when people come
in but I know you haven't you're doing
this this and that like you know like
you know when I spaz down somebody is
like Broz like I already have enough
 in my life all the time like this
is non-stop like I never get a break on
anything so it's like when I come here
it's like you know one of the main
reasons why I always come here and try
to support you guys and motivate you
guys is because in reality this is like
my escape from our every lack of reality
like yeah I'm successful in coding but
there's other factors in my life that is
just always some up you
know my sister passed away my mom is has
a whole bunch of issues my dad is in dr
sake days there's a whole bunch of stuff
going on and like I try to block
everything out by staying busy and
coming here to YouTube and creating
content for you guys but it's like oh
man like I'm so tired of like dealing
with like I feel like people have
bad happened to them but it's like
not like me like this is like all the
time like every single name
this parts on the screws I don't know
man if it's on schools I think oh wait
you might be right
let me see ah nope
this one doesn't go screw no I don't
think so
well yeah so it's like it's everyday
type man let's see maybe it kind of
loosen up but I don't know if it turns
around completely
maybe yeah so once again another letdown
oh god yeah the same BS since Joe
unscrew the gold part I had the same
issue with mine be sure oh sure
Wow look at you boy 84 music and Toby
look a char yeah we here solving my
problems and so this actually
does unscrew Wow see there you go we got
a little victory for the day
all right look at your boy you know you
already know man your boys in here man
not because I want to give you guys the
best quality man you know what I mean
like that pisses me off I have when
things don't go right it's constant it's
not I want to sound like I'm complaining
all the time and this and that so but at
the same time Jesus Christ can I get a
break yo hole here I used to do music or
still does music man well here remember
it's the mbox man right the only shame
remind you is a little em box but an EM
box was sexy man it was blue and great
it was legit man
if you know about this stuff man you
know the N box was the back in days
man listen man I used to have a studio I
don't even know if I should tell this
story with I just have a story this is
like another sad story so I used to have
studio and pretty much pretty much
remember yesterday I was telling you
guys that I had guys sake whatever so
when I was like 20 21 I think like back
in 2000 2009
sake right so I had spent all my money
that I had I was like okay you know I'm
gonna get back into doing music I'm
gonna get back into doing this and that
me and my boy we spent like you know ten
thousand dollars back then when we was
broke right he moved into my my building
right he moved into my building and he
used to live in the first floor and I
stood up in the second floor of my
family so then we had the basement we
had a legit basement we spent like six
grand on a fixing up the basement
cleaning it up getting everything legit
we fixed a spot up and then we've been
paying rent and everything then the
owner we find out that the owner wasn't
paying his mortgage so now we get an
order from a bank some Bank of America's
type it's like hey man there's a
new owner of the house and pretty much
no the house is going to foreclosure
right and we don't even know what the
hell was going on we've been we've been
paying rent to this guy and my boy had
just moved downstairs and pay him like
six months ahead and the guys didn't
miss a night like he just skimmed it
like got his money you know we spent
money downstairs fixing up the studio we
put a whole bunch of equipment you know
we lost probably like 20 30 racks and we
was broke like broke broke broke broke
you know that's what my reason why don't
do music because every single time that
I try to come back it's always some
shake so yeah so we got the studio and
then the guy disappears and they're not
the bank comes in and they were okay
cool it's gonna be a new owner and we're
gonna basically give them the money and
that's it we're gonna stay in the place
not the owner was some freaking old
polish dude who was like yo I'm moving
my whole family in here so everybody in
the bill
right so now we in there and mind you we
just spent so much money fixing up the
place
the dude literally toza tells us oh
thank you for fixing up the basement I'm
moving my son-in-law downstairs and we
looking at this do like we wanna kill
him like yo bro you don't even know like
we just don't spend all our savings into
fixing this place up thinking that we're
gonna be here for a long time and we're
gonna have our studio and have all our
 and we was gonna start booking time
and like so much man like yeah so
mind you my boy my boy used to hustle
big time so he moved to Puerto Rico to
move to big things so my boy was out so
in that time he broke up with his with
his girlfriend at the time and then mind
you we had a we took out all the studio
equipment and we put it into any
warehouse this chick after they broke up
she had the keys to it she went in there
and took all the equipment that was his
all the equipment that was mine and
basically took it and started selling in
the street like the monitors mothers
that we spent like 500 on each piece she
was selling an industry for $25 like I
heard their stories I was like yo one of
my boy him you know my girl we just seen
this chick over here or you know your
boy's girlfriend I'm hearing on granham
selling you're selling you know studio
equipment on the street off the truck
and I was like wait what what studio
equipment mind you people were buying
studio equipment my studio equipment for
like $25 because this this chick was so
ignorant that she didn't even know that
those things are cost about like $500 so
that's not like regular speakers that
you just put in from a BS radio you know
this chick is so dumb she thought it was
like a boombox acting like you dummy
this thing costs man money so after that
you know I just never look back I was
like man it's just not meant to be you
know so he's like my life is constantly
after this type of stories right but
every time that I come in and I bump
into different stories right and in
situations where it's like it brings me
down it brings me like five steps back
like right now this whole basement
situation bro me five steps back but
every time that that happens I've got
ten steps forward
so I recoup that five steps back that I
did and then I go five steps forward you
know so you know so think positive out
of all of this stuff something good is
gonna happen I don't know what it is but
something good is gonna happen in the
next the next few weeks but it's just
crazy man like you know I know everybody
goes through stuff but it's like
literally I go hi I have stories on
stories on stories on stories man like
you know I mean like it's just constant
stuff that has happened to me earlier
those setbacks hurt man you know what it
is
you know it's a big difference like if
you have money man if you come from
money and you have money inside cool so
okay you lost ten thousand dollars oh
yeah you move on from that ten thousand
dollars when you broke like that's a so
when people don't even come back from
that I know people at got stories like
man I lost seven thousand in 1973 and
they never come from that you know lucky
yeah for real I'm living line like this
dudes that out here that that be like
man 1973 man I lost seven stacks and
never got back like it happens you know
yeah oh my boy Jose Jose what up Joseph
it's been a while man haven't seen you
in a minute man we miss you out here man
yeah man is crazy
let me see no no my what I'm trying to
read the the comments man yeah that's
true man 84 you're completely right I
was looking at that online people be
like oh they put it on the humidifier

do a little nice setup like it's
technically this thing is I got to speak

to list a
you
things that's the built-in microphone
right there let's build a microphone
let's see the USB chit chit chit chit
chit chit chit chit some reason feels
like the gayness don't know they

good okay cool
yeah man
so I say your boy Joe got a new mic all
right this is cool I don't even know how
to
lower the delay on a Mac I remember
doing the latency I mean I'm not using
any any software this is connected
straight to the to the system itself
you're not I mean like they shouldn't be
any legacy at all
yeah I think I just got a read you know
refresh the page and reload the video
itself
so yeah let me see what's good man word
man you boys out here
diving on them just you know you gotta
have fun in this world man it's a lot of
bad that happens but at the same
time it's like what are we gonna do it
you know what I mean sit down and
complain about it or are we just gonna
move on and just get it poppin
you got what I'm saying I wish the
headphones will work I can't hear myself
like the monitor is supposed to work I'm
gonna have to go buy some new headphones
but yeah man let's see how it goes man
kind of try this out real quick see how
everything goes create some you know so
pretty legit videos I started the Ruby
on Rails course so I want to get that
done man and I'm going super detailed
which will be on Rails guys like I'm
going detailed into it like for real for
real like we're breaking it down every
single thing so yeah anyways man let's
talk about cold for a little bit I see
what you guys is up to what you guys is
working on let me know
let me see how can I get into I wanna
see the chat room Lucy but what you guys
think this this the sounds that's the
microphone sound good do I keep it do I
return this I mean what I wanted
was a microphone that doesn't pick up
everything that's around me because you
know if the baby is gonna be running
around or people gonna be walking around
you know everything here is hardwood so
I don't want like the wood coming out
into the sound then I gotta get like a
little piece for it you know so you know
make it nice and professional a little
pop get those no pop out of here you
know I mean you know it's crazy to me
like nothing but there's like an
emotional moment right now for me like I
haven't had like no audio interface I
haven't had a microphone like a legit
microphone like at my disposal like I
own my hands in almost 10 years
like literally but you guys don't know
how that feels laying especially when
you love music and you've been doing
music for so long and I mean you did it
I did it for basically the first half of
my whole life you know what I mean like
I I did music for a long time and then
now it's like you know even the new
fruity loops are so many fruity loops
and I was like man free loops done
change like there's a lot of stuff that
I don't even know how to do you know
what I mean like back in the days they
used to have four you know on the where
you have to drum kids the users to have
how many how many bars you wanted to for
that for a pattern to be now I don't
even know where that that's at I don't I
don't even know how to change it
like this you know I try to come back
into everybody's like madness is very
different now Mike needs to be turned up
yeah man it slowly but surely is coming
together it's gonna be a nice little
setup give me some time you know what I
mean like I gotta give myself some time
too cuz there's like I want everything
to happen right away but it's like you
know it's just not meant to be at the
moment it'll happen when it happens you
know I mean so
PHP is the best maybe the best ever you
know a lot of people saying or saying
that but I don't know
I mean PHP I'll be honest PHP is not the
most fun language it's not the prettiest
language but at the same time it's like
it works man it works and there's jobs
like you know sometimes you if you stay
in your house and you're like oh man I
want to do this I want to work you know
it's like who doesn't want to be a
rocket science scientists you know what
I mean but are those jobs coming by
every single day like you know there's
barely any jobs for that you know
there's people who study to become how
you call this thing a what's the name of
it to become an entrepreneur was it
anthropologists or you know one of the
people looking for dinosaurs I forgot
the name or whatever my mind is blank
right now you know people out here
looking to to find dinosaurs they go to
school for this thing and there's no
jobs for it you know what I mean
archaeologist you know people go to
school to become archaeologists and then
they're like yeah I'm gonna find some
dinosaur bones and like this and that
and there's like they get freaking they
get freaking disappointed when there's
no jobs man you know so it's like it's
like you should have known better it's
like hey man how many people want to be
working at a museum looking for freaking
dinosaurs a lot of people but you know
it's like are there that many jobs are
there that many museums out there that
that I hate man we're just hiring
everybody man yeah man yeah
anthropologist I know it's the study of
people but I know it was something
polishes so that's why I was like yo I
can't remember it right now but that
should happen I don't know why that
happens to me all the time now I feel
like I'm getting old a sign like I know
what it is but I can't say I can't
remember the word you know that was like
some dude who hit me up boy on a comment
like oh man
you said Ruby on Rails is a is a
language and as I bro it's like a slip
of the tongue like I made a 30-minute
video and you caught one little snippet
where I was wrong and you like the whole
argument is wrong because this guy's say
Ruby on Rails is a language it's like
bro I know it's not a language
it's just I'm freaking too lazy to go
back and edit it I'm like I'm not gonna
go back and edit Africa video for one
little line like if you want to you can
edit it for me but I'm not going back in
there you know especially after you do
like a thirty minute talk like you talk
to somebody for 30 minutes you ain't
trying to go back to that conversation
you know what I mean like you already
said everything you need to say like
that's how I be like I don't edit
everything at all man the oh by the way
I want to give congratulations to your
boy Chris Sean I just saw on Instagram

sauce here you know this this thing is
like a good restaurant right there's
like a five-star restaurant under bridge
you know I mean so it's like we can be
seen because we're under the bridge
right so the only way that people know
that this is a five-star restaurant is
word-of-mouth so if you guys go and tell
other people that you know even gonna
comment even you know
ready even you know freaking in a pose a
blog post
a medium post a freaking corner post you
know show some love if you feel like
this value in this channel send the
people this way man because I understand
like a lot of people you know they
coming and they get what they need and
then from there they disappear but at
the same time man come in and show some
lovin and just pass it down pass the
knowledge down to other people but I
hate me you know go check out this dude
let me see jokes aside Joe your Facebook
alone taught me more than the two
hundred astronauts on treehouse I mean
yeah let means it to some people it
could work some people it doesn't work I
think what I do is just give people like
real life experience in like real life
things that they gonna experience at a
job or you know what a client like
little errors there's things that I keep
specifically on my videos like if you
see a error is not because hey Joe
didn't want to come in and edit it or
Hey Joe did not want to come in and do
it the right way no it's to show you
guys how it is to find the answer like I
could easily edit something now like hey
my videos are perfect but that's why I'm
trying to stay away from and it's why I
tell you guys about you know what this
girl a real tough kandi say you know
tutorial heaven like you don't want to
be in that world of like everything is
perfect because when you go to the real
jobs then you like oh man all the stuff
that I didn't know how to do I didn't
know how to actually find out the
answers in the documentation I don't
know how to put two things together I
didn't know how to look at one thing
that I learned from one programming
language to another programming language
and bring that knowledge to the next
thing
like these things that you learn in
JavaScript that you could come in and
bring it to PHP
this thing's like in our in PHP and
bring it to Ruby and therefore Ruby you
could bring it to Python or to whatever
language all the skills that you get you
could pass it down it and still like
bring all those skills with you and
implement them into other programming
languages or or different frameworks
right so those are the things that I
feel like I come in in I bring up up to
the forefront you know what I mean so
Jordan started the sauce movement word
man we are here like a you know like
your boy little bee man we out here like
a surfer man hey catch it from the back
pass it to the fore it put the little
sauce on it oh my word
well Danny
whether it's like yo you got me my first
job and now I just got offered three
weeks.3 I got offered three in past we
have to continue even after losing that
one due to your knowledge etc yeah man
we grind it man oh God
Philippe is crazy Philippe is like yo
today it's not Joe the developer but Joe
the singer I want to know know what you
want I wanna know I know my voice is
horrible sorry man you know somebody by
John g6
let me see see what else people saying
84 music is like yo bro this is like the
one shiny spot in the hood that nobody
knows except for you and seven other
people yep this boy you taste like filet
mignon but constant right here is
delicacy yo that's like we was watching
um what was it like not HGTV but like
the Food Network acai and they gave a
commercial and you know people when they
have something good I feel like when
people have something good they have
good content they come in and give you
like one of those little small plates of
like you know those fancy restaurants or
it's like hey we're gonna make you spend
$200 for some little that looks
like this where you be like this is what
I'm supposed to eat for $200 and it's
like yeah it's like it's a delicacy you
know what I mean so yeah sometimes I
feel I want to slap the out of some
people when they come like there's a lot
of dumb in this world but for you
to pay $200 for like some that
looks like this it's like this is like
you know like some crazy right and
you know like people have good content
but there's like they want to make so
much money out of it they're like man
you know this there's a niche for it
there's people they need it how can we
eat how can we eat off them like I don't
think like that man you know cuz I put
myself in the situation of how I was
back then you know what I mean like you
know how annoying it is to be broken how
annoying it is to be like you don't know
what you're gonna eat the next day you
don't know how you're gonna go to work
the next day like
people live in situations like that and
it's like I'll never forget that like
the guy from clever programmer the dude
doesn't even have a laptop the dude is
like you're I'm he's doing this from the
library right he's doing this from a
library but he's going to take a long to
pay to do five hundred bucks for the
course you know what I do when people
you know how many people hit me up all
the time be like yo Joe you know I just
lost on my job or listen I'm moving back
to my mom's crib I'm doing this and now
like they've been paying for like the
past three four months and not even
paying like the full price they're
paying like the freaking the father
Alice special and they hit me up like
Georgia I'm not even gonna be able to
pay the next month like you know my bank
is overdrawn like this isn't that bro
you know what I do I just be like okay
cool here you got it for free and I do
it all the time
business-wise money-wise is this smart
no but at the same time I feel like
that's gonna bring me good karma to help
them out and then from there someday
somebody if I'm in a really bad
situation
somebody's gonna help me out or if I'm
like in a situation where I might be all
messed up people's gonna take notice
internet and be like okay I remember
when he looked out you know what I mean
but these people they're not like that a
lot of people are not like that they're
like man how can we eat how can we make
you know come in and freaking make
people pay five hundred dollars like
that's crazy to me that dude didn't even
have a laptop you're in a library right
now my dude like you're I wanted to like
grab that dude out of the comment and
just like shake his head and be like bro
you're in a library right there
library bro like are you kidding
me you gotta go take a long to
pay some do five hundred bucks instead
of buying yourself a laptop you're in a
 library like come on and do this
out here like yeah man I'll take that
money like I don't care I don't care
what happens to that do
that's on him if he fell for it I can't
I can't live for myself like that you
know there's been people and I got a lot
of people that have came in they have
found me from Google even some have
found me from YouTube and they have paid
the full $300 for the lifetime right and
I feel guilty I'm like yeah I feel
guilty that somebody even paid that much
and I I told her dude I was like yeah
you know there's a link that would get
you 50% off and the guy's like now don't
worry I wanted to pay you that and it's
like yo that like a hitter spot I was
like they're like there's people out
there that they support the move and
support the channel cuz even at that
like anybody that sees order freaking
order links is there 50% off 65% off
like like it's crazy you know I mean so
it's like I look out for people you know
cuz I want people to ask something you
know if I'm in a situation look out for
me why wouldn't I you know this channel
is the straight Jimmy truck with a meal
and they're keeping a Brownback and with
the grease stains of a $7 you guys are
crazy man
there is a kind of dumb get out of the
library go work a bit down so some
shaking my head now but even at that
some people you know you might be like I
don't want to work at McDonald's like
let me try to go to the library I don't
have a computer i'ma try to see if I
could find a job online or I could find
a new skill like it's fine to go to the
library but my problem is is like bro
like for $325 so you go to Best Buy and
you get yourself a decent Windows
computer a BS LeNoble
that's gonna work perfectly you could
put it in Lenexa cool be working out
here you know learn all the skills that
you want if you don't have internet you
could go to Starbucks you know right
there there you go and get the free
Wi-Fi you know what I mean I see
freaking people do that all the
time they buy a freaking $1 freaking
cookie and go sit down in the corner at
Starbucks for the whole day and every
time that somebody comes in and tells
you something you just go to the freaky
you go in and you buy yourself a little
coffee and then that little coffee bean
max old and you just leave it there the
whole day nobody could tell you now cuz
you bought that coffee you know what I'm
saying like you know you gotta learn how
to play the game but yeah man it's crazy
oh yeah man
yeah for real you know Joseph I really
appreciate it man
don't worry you was one of the first
ones in there man
so you always go send me an email man
whenever if you like you know and the
downtime send me an email man I got to
you you like one of the old G's in here
you know what I mean so I got you bro
I got a whole bunch of new courses man
you gotta go check it out the Agera word
is like yeah hell naw don't feel guilty
you're giving quality content you should
get paid yeah I know I should get paid
but at the same time it's like what if
the person really needs that money at
that time you get what I'm saying like
that's what it makes me think about it
like if somebody comes in and they
really needed that money I don't want
them to come come in but I came in like
this could be my rent or this could be
you know food for the rest of the month
you know like I don't wanted to lose out
on that you know
yeah man definitely I appreciate it
Gary ya know that's what I'm trying to
that's what I'm trying to do like I'm
trying to come in and create a whole
bunch of different courses for everybody
so at any moment in your career you
gonna at some point like you might not
need html/css now you might not need PHP
now a year from now you might be like
hey man I need that PHP course so it's
gonna be there food for you waiting for
you you know what I'm saying hey you
come in and you notice that in your area
they have Ruby on Rails cool you're
gonna have that there you know I'm also
going to do but the go p-- course I'm
gonna do the Python course like I'm
leaving Python the main reason why I'm
leaving Python last I haven't really
focused on it because I feel like if I
do Python I feel like I'm doing it for
the money that's why I haven't done know
Python course I haven't done anything
because I feel like Python I've used it
I've worked on a couple of projects I
know how to use freaking Python for you
know Django and you know to create web
you know web applications cuz I've done
it in so many different other frameworks
like it's all the same pretty much
but I haven't really done a Python
course because it's like everybody's on
it right now like people that don't need
to be using Python and don't need to be
learning Python or learning Python it's
like I don't want to be part of that
wave of people that's like man we just
got a cash-in it's like huge yes I
couldn't easily go and be like hey man
let's cash in on view Jes is like I
don't want to be one of those dudes man
you know what I mean but yeah man
word dreaded dev who's that dreaded dev
I haven't checked him out let's see
let's go to dreaded dev oh yeah
yeah I see I see no I found him on
Instagram he got a lot of cool your
dreaded dev welcome to the squad man
dreaded a view from Florida right no I'm
almost sure you from Florida
where do not dreaded F is legit let me
see hosing here Oh
salami Jes you guys are crazy man we
ain't here man
hurricane I'm trying to keep it up man
yeah a dreaded F is legit I liked his
video where he goes like yo why I look
why I look the way I do doesn't affect
my job like no cuz I got the skills
thank you know what I mean like you know
a lot of times people be like man you
can't be yourself and it's like nah you
can do whatever the hell you want
as long as you got the skills and you
can show for it
people are gonna support you you know so
I was like I messed with dread us dread
it dev your boys he's nice he's legit
for you man let me see it was in here
man yeah man now I appreciate appreciate
all the love that everybody comes in and
shows love might not you know me I
should love to all the other a lot of
the developers and stuff but you know
you know it's funny to me it's like you
know when you reach out to certain
people so so I hit up well the other day
on Instagram because I follow I was in a
more rosemary I hit her up on a DM like
girl what up we need to you know link up
work on something never heard nothing
back from him for her okay cool
you gotta say like sometimes I'll be
like yeah what's wrong with people you
know what I mean like you extend your
love you extend like the hand and then
they just leave your hanging it's like
oh really like you just gonna leave me
hanging out here cool like but you know
that's how this man it's the world of
YouTube in the world of like developers
man
these people are like I don't know what
I don't know what's wrong with them like
I feel like out of everybody I'm like
the coldest dude out here like I'm super
cool with everybody and like I'm just
nice to everybody
we're husband probably the leader you're
evil like y'all now I was a regular just
a DM on Instagram nothing disrespectful
it wasn't like I was like yo what up MA
you know where I'm at what that mouth to
like I wasn't disrespectful like that it
was literally like yo man love your work
love what you're doing we need to link
up that's it and it's like I extend the
hand it's like okay cool great leave
them hanging I'm out there like this in
the cold with my hand out still like you
know rosemary I'm still waiting for this
I'm still waiting my hand is still
waiting I reached out but I'm saying but
that's that's why I'm saying that you're
trying to start a deaf journey exactly
man I've been since I started in this
whole thing minute my whole thing is
about how can we get all together how
can we all work together how can we all
come in and like collaborate with each
other because the same way how that
works with other youtubers in other
communities it can work even better here
in this community because what happens
is it's like five people know each other
okay five people know each other and
then that's it in there from there they
don't collaborate with nobody else and
what happens is if I got ten thousand
Juanita got freaking ten thousand
Juanita got twenty thousand a but insane
who got freakin a hundred thousand
my real guy freaking 300,000 we all work
together and basically people that
didn't even get to know that you existed
get to know you right and it's not more
like oh we trying to leech off each
other it's not about that is that the
way how the algorithm from Google works
is if you collaborate with each other it
basically gives back to you in starts
giving you more new subscribers and more
people that come in that did not know
you but those people are for being
developers they're pretty dumb and
stupid like straight up like they act
like they never built a website like I
look at YouTube I'm like I know exactly
what's going on with the whole website
and it's like you're telling me like as
a developer you don't understand how
this work but this whole website works
it's like dinner like you know what I
mean but you know what I mean is like
yeah so it's like I just leave people
out like that man but you know somewhere
out there in the cold my hand is still
reaching out my hand got by my hand got
frostbite right now my hand is out there
in the cold like you know rosemary you
ain't gonna touch this hand like your
Engel you ain't gonna give it a little
tap you ain't gonna say like oh no heart
you ain't gonna say hi you ain't gonna
say nothing these people are so corny
and I'll be like I just be surprised man
sometimes man like the world of YouTube
once you use a prop when to use the
state Kelvin you're lost pearl listen
you use a prop when you want to pass
down something from a parent than a
parent component so like let's say you
have one parent component and that
parent component has all of your
functions right if you take in the react
not the react I mean the react course
but even at that if you've taken the
Builder restaurant um application that I
did with hyper app you will understand
all of that in one second you will see
how we pass down from one component we
pass down all the functions and there
from there the child components have
access to that that functions that the
parent has and all the data is being
passed down so it's like that's how you
use props now the state is you could
have two different ways if you're using
something like Redux you have a global
state right a global state that all the
components need to know about right
think of it a website if a website I'm
gonna show you for example let's look at
YouTube you know this is for the people
that want to know about this you know
once in a blue moon I want to come in
and talk science areas you know so so
let's get serious let's share the screen
okay
let's explain this to Kelvin okay think
of it this whole website right okay
think of this area as a component this
area right here is a component okay if I
have a master component which is like
the parent think of it as the master
which is the initial component of
application which is the pairing of all
this child components if I have a global
state in that component which is the
parent
and I want to keep track of everything
that's going on inside of us instead of
each component
I have everything inside of that global
state of the parrot right the initial
application okay so when I click in here
locally inside of this component here it
says the menu got activated okay but
that's locally
okay that's inside of this component
okay now something like this where is to
show me a notification this right here
can be coming down from the parent
component the parent component can have
the API call where it goes to the server
or the web socket and says hey when I
was a notification passed down this data
to the child components so this
component here when we click on it was
inside of the local state is the click
so we say I clicked on this and it shows
me this other component here so that's
in the local state of this component
okay
but on the parent component what you
have is like the the stuff that you want
to share between all of the components I
hope that that makes sense sometimes I
wish I had like you know that's another
thing that I want to get I want to get
like a high call it's like
africaine like the notepad thing that
you could just draw and explain things
to people I want to get that because
sometimes it's easier to show it to
people visually like what exactly is
happening let me see if we got the
Photoshop see I want to show it to you
eventually so you could really get it
this is so easy but when I was learning
react and when I was learning state I
was like yo what the hell is this you
know but once you get it you get it man
okay so yeah we could draw with with
Photoshop so let me show you this okay
let's talk about components okay and
when to use props and why would you use
them okay so think of it like this this
is YouTube okay YouTube looks ugly but
it's YouTube okay so this over here is
the first application right the first
component right let's say we call that
component application inside of it
there's a component call left menu and
then here we have another component
called
notifications okay on the parent
component here right we have the API
calls so let's say you doing an API call
or you connect into a WebSocket that
data you pass it down to this component
and that data you pass it down to this
menu so this menu has all the different
sub menus right all the different things
like your subscriptions your libraries
and all the stuff so all of the stuff is
coming from an API okay and that's how
you got all this information now on this
right menu which is think of it the
notifications the data that's where the
data is coming from - so the parent has
all the information so we pass it down
to the child and we say okay here's the
notifications and here's all the
subscriptions and all the the playlist
information okay now let's go back to
photoshop inside of this alright inside
of this component there's another state
which is the local state in that local
state you want to keep track of what's
happening inside of that component okay
only things that everybody else need to
know about go to the parent component
okay which is this one so you only get
to pass down to the parent things like
let's say if the parent has a function
that you say hey I want to know of when
the person clicks on let's say on DJ
academics okay when you click on these
academics right you say okay I want to
switch the page so now it takes you to
the channel right in that situation
that's a function that you trigger and
actually let the parent know so now the
parent renders everything inside of it
so everything that was here it changed
because of that function that you
clicked but that function actually came
from the parent it got passed down if it
has nothing to do with the parent or any
other component all the information you
keep it on your local state which is
part of this component okay is very
simple I hope that makes sense
okay so it's not that bad it's not that
difficult at all
all right like I said go check out the
real estate app that I did with react go
check out the the the building a
restaurant app and you're gonna
understand all of that pretty well so
let me see what's the chatroom
that's the coding phase no you know okay
here you go
yeah so that's about it
you
now you could see guys like yo Joe Joe
was just trying to network unless I
don't know what that mouth to ma know I
know I was away now I think or maybe it
was like the husband probably like yo
this to seems every man do hit my girl
up delete you know dudes gay get nervous
out here man for no reason
does the new place
start feeling like home I mean yeah
somewhat I mean it's good it's good you
know what I mean like I don't know
like I still got to get used to it
there's certain things that I got to get
used to it yeah
Ricki Garcia's legit - he reached out to
he you know when I did the the freakin
survey for the year you know the top

definitely looking to to link up with
him got a pretty legit channel you know
and that was the thing that he he did
that was pretty cool because he was like
he did a video where people were like oh
man you know like they don't want to do
web development cuz he has a lot of
computer science students and people who
want to get into programming and one
against a development and it's pretty
it's pretty legit what he said he
basically told him like hey man
like you know I was one of those guys
that at some point I was like man I
don't want to get into web development
but then the more that you're in the
industry you start realizing like
there's so many jobs and so many
opportunities to become a web developer
it's like it's not the end of the day if
you are a developer some people think
like oh man I went to school for
computer science like I'm supposed to be
here so software engineer I'm supposed
to be a software developer but it's like
bro
it's like money's money you know it's
like you're basically gonna be doing the
same thing no matter where you go you
know what I mean so and it's not the end
of the world like you could pretty much
switch up and go work at you know so for
engineering company if you want to like
later on but at the moment if you just
came out of college and you got the
opportunity to become a what developer
like why wouldn't you you know what I
mean so those are the things that you
know he gives people like some real life
advice you know and he's like one of the
people that's in the industry like he's
working it's not it's not people who
come in like oh yeah I was a developer
in 1999 it's like bro what you know from
back then till now is like it's almost
irrelevant you know what I mean even I
myself if ten years from now I'm like
I'm on YouTube when I'm talking about
Manning 2016 I used to be a web
developer and this how it was and it's
like yeah but things change you know
what I mean like you're giving advice to
newer people to get into an industry
that you haven't been on in over 10
years
or even 15 years so I was like you got
what I'm saying but Dave sharing is
pretty legit I like his content a lot
so let me see gaming gobbles as I can ok
Manito Java started
in your videos almost right after I
started my coding bootcamp is almost at
its end what skills should you say it's
most important to show off on a
portfolio if you went to boot camp I was
saying try to show a full application
and something that people can look at it
and be like oh this is a business you
know a lot of people who go to boot
camps or even people who learn online
what they do is they create little
projects that are cool to them and cool
to two or three of their little nerdy
friends but a business owner or a
recruiter is not looking at those
projects and it's like oh this guy can
find the nearest coffee like you know
I've seen this thing where it's like
some guy created a website about where's
the the nearest bicycle bicycle shop and
as I brought nobody cares about that
like that's cool to you cuz you ride a
bike but to a business they're like okay
he knows how to use the Google API
whoopty-doo you get what I'm saying like
show them that you have a full
application show them that you have like
I say even on e-commerce I'll create a
t-shirt company right teach your
e-commerce website where you sell web
sell t-shirts and then they could use a
stripe API to charge the clients the
customers show them that you know what I
mean give them access to the admin
section where you could come in and
change the settings change the the price
of of the products like things like that
will take you a long way cuz they'll be
like oh man this guy's is he's ready for
prime he's not out here creating like
little code or be like some
people come in and do like here's an
algorithm here's the Fibonacci sequence
it's like nobody cares about that bro
like don't show that in your portfolio
you know show real websites
yeah I was thinking about doing that
like creating some coding challenges for
for the subscribers and giving them like
I don't know either money or giving them
like prizes you know what I mean it's
still there man decoding reality still
there man yeah man
are you wife he's not gonna get it man
yeah using Google this is fine man
nobody knows everything I use Google
every single day I even show it on my
videos like hey like there's certain
things that you just don't remember
you're like okay cool
what are you gonna do you're gonna post
a video and be like oh let me act like
the whole world is perfect like no it
doesn't work like that
it's like you can't remember the syntax
of every single thing
in ten years when Joby come see like the
computer guy ten years I'm not even
gonna be doing like a lot of the stuff
that I'm doing now I'm still gonna be
creating stuff on my website but I don't
think I'm gonna be like you know I don't
know I don't know if I'm still gonna be
on YouTube probably I will
cuz I'm like I love it I love you know
hanging out with you guys and getting to
see your progress and all the good
things that comes from it but you know
like one thing that I am noticing it's
like the more subscribers that I get the
more a-holes that I I see and it's like
man that's gonna suck to come in and you
know you gotta you like let's say like
today like if I'm having a bad day
even though you see a thousand comments
there's one comment that just like burns
your blood like what the hell are you
talking about you know what I mean
people get your math so I know the more
subscribers that I get the more people
that know me the more a whole starte
gonna pop up like there's this dude cool
I don't know if you guys remember like a
few weeks ago I was like man like I used
to be trolling on team treehouse all the
time and because they used to be a hose
with me so I used to be a hose back to
them that was my way to say f you team
treehouse right and I used to leave like
really dumb questions or I will repost
blog posts that you that I used to have
for my website so this dude was like oh
man Joe did not starting in 2012 he
started in 2014 and that had me pissed
off cuz I'm like bro you don't even know
me from nowhere and whatever so then the
dude comes in and whatever I sent him my
email curse them out and I was like bro
stop talking about me like you're
gonna be pissed off so I curse them out
and whatever the dude comes back and
like like weeks and weeks later
like I haven't talked to this guy
haven't I have nothing to say about this
K like I have nothing to say to this guy
like so what if I trolled on
teen tree house like you're gonna
be on my dick about that the whole
my whole life like who cares but yeah so
this dude it was like he's like oh let
me see that email let's give him some
light you know cuz that's what he wants
but I already blocked them but it's just
from it was like I don't know if you
guys remember his this freakin dude ran
I don't know if you guys remember this
dude so not this guy this guy's cool but
this guy oh really
ESPA doric so he's like hi Santos
remember me like like a creep like this
dude is like he talks about me all
the time and he sends me an email
he's like hi Santos remember me like bro
you're troll like why are you
hitting me up he's a good job man your
videos are helping other people by
giving the motivation as such so good
job so then he goes like I'm still after
what I have said before so he's like I'm
still after what I have said before it's
like I don't know what you're after bro
like what the hell is it that you want
like you want money out of me you want
want me to be your best friend I don't
know what it is that you want from me
it's like so he's like some of the stuff
that some of the stuff I don't believe
especially the way things turned out to
be but that shouldn't matter anymore
that's past and it becomes the reality
like what like listen to that sentence
listen to this whole thing
like I'm still after what I have said
before some other stuff I don't believe
especially the way things turned out to
be but that shouldn't have matter
anymore that's passed and it becomes
reality
like what does that mean like I don't
even know this like I don't know what
this guy's after like so he goes at the
end you're having a positive impact so
that counts who cares about the past and
I'm like bro what are you talking about
my past
like I don't understand this dude so it
was like the videos you make aren't
going to suit everybody so okay so it's
not gonna sue everybody so good job man
as long as it brings value to other
people it's good you're definitely
trying to try and in taking action which
most people never do no matter how no
matter how you're doing it eventually it
becomes a reality like what the are
you talking about like you get what I'm
saying like what is this dude talking
about like his whole conversation it's
like he has this idea of me in his head
and like this dude does not know me I
don't even know what this kid is this
kid is like 18 years old and like
Czechoslovakia somewhere and it's like
he's like eventually it becomes reality
so the past has absolutely no place in
the present and the stuff for money
well everyone tries to make money with
whatever they like you do put into
action into learning and then teaching
you improve as others Pete as other
people will keep it up like this is like
having like you know this is like some -
that's trying to like low-key trying to
 you or some like like I feel
like I feel like how girls feel when you
know you have like this creepy guy
who you just you just do not know and
like he tried to ask you for a dance on
the prom and you're like bro I'm not
dancing with you and then from there on
this kid is just
following you for the rest of your life
and you like 30 years later this guy
hits you up and be like you know you put
you do put into action into learning and
then teaching you improve as others
people will like that sounds so creepy
to me like if I was to bump into this
cake either cross the street or I'm
gonna have to slap the shadow like
straight up like this kid I don't know
so I send them an email before I block
them and I'm like yo I don't know what
what you are after bro so I answered
what he was saying it's cuz he's like
I'm still after what I've said before
I'm like I do not know what the hell you
want from me kid so he was like
definitely I got like all the videos you
make I'm going to sue everybody so I got
like so if it doesn't suit you why do
you even care about me or my channel so
then he goes like so good job man and
they were like now here you're saying
I'm doing a good job which I am okay and
then I scroll down I'm ready they goes
like no matter how you do it you're
doing it eventually it becomes a reality
and he's like I'm like here I don't know
what the are you talking about like
I just don't know what the hell this kid
is talking about so then after the whole
thing goes I enter stuff for money well
everyone tries to make money with
whatever they like you do put into
action into learning and then teaching
you'll improve as others other people
will and this is also makes no sense and
I got like you and this also makes no
sense and then I will like you first
talk about me they hit me up
randomly again talking like I'm
trying to be nice where your gypsy
Slavik ass right but it's like you have
nothing to do bro go build a app
go get a job go have sex go do something
useful I really don't want to be talking
to you you don't come you don't come
talking to someone and then expect
to be cool with you like go off
somewhere and don't talk to me like such
a Slovak ass somewhere like go to church
noble
go freakin eat some hot dogs over there
and you know hopefully there's like a
rope somewhere you know what I mean like
like why are you talking to me like I
don't know this kid in this kid in his
whole head he's made this idea that I'm
like some evil guy who's on the internet
