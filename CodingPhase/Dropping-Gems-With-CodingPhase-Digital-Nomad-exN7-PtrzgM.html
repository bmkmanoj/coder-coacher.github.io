special today we're gonna talk about how
to become a digital nomad how to
basically playing yourself how to plan
your life and and just have a plan have
a goal right cuz you're not gonna become
a digital nomad from one day to the
other like it takes time right some
people are lucky because they already
have you know a lot of money saved up or
they say hey man I have 401ks I have
this this and that if you're not one of
those people and you're like me where we
basically we started from zippy from
zero from nada you know if you starting
with if your girlfriend is not a you
know that me that's your girl if your
girlfriend is not a you know what I mean
like if you started from nothing um
basically what I will say is you gotta
start saving up right so I'm gonna tell
you guys my journey right now some might
say Joe you're not a digital nomad
you're not in in Thailand you're nodding
you know a worst out of the place some o
some my oh you're not in Bangkok you're
not
the Philippines you're not in Colombia
you're not in Portugal you're not in
Ireland you know those are the places
where people go to become digital nomads
I mean quote-unquote you know did you
don't know Matt's that's where they go
listen your did you don't know Matt the
moment that you're free right the moment
that you can say hey I'm working for
myself and everything that I do is for
me and I could work from anywhere you
know what I mean that's when you really
a digital nomad
so for me I'm gonna tell you my journey
how started years ago when I first came
in to web development I was like man I'm
gonna become a web developer but I don't
know if I really want to be doing this
forever right because I always find like
companies are fickle you know I mean
some companies are good some companies
are bad you might have a project manager
who is just an a-hole you might have
some people that you just don't like and
you're like wait I don't fit in with a
lot of this people I don't wanna be
working with them you know I was like
that was my story in my first two years
right plus at that time I was like just
doing front-end and I was very limited
as far as the work that I got so I only
do front-end I currently work at certain
companies right so I got hired whatever
became a developer everybody knows my
story I started at 14 there from there I
didn't do any coding until the age of 24
25 back in 2011 2012 so then from there
started working etc I set a goal I had a
goal I said man I'm gonna become a
digital nomad I was watching guys like
Johnny FD I was watching guys like
levels that I owe who I consider one of
my mentors one of the people that put me
on to what you can do with the internet
and the skills that you have you know a
lot of you guys are still in that stage
where you think oh man once I get this
job everything's gonna be Gucci and it's
gonna be great hey okay a job is a job
you get what I'm saying like it's not is
gonna change your life it's like you're
gonna be able to afford more things
you're gonna be able to work in
companies that you might say oh it is
you tell somebody hey I work at xyz.com
in the black Oh cuz you know they work
at McDonald's or they work on Macy's or
something like that something that
nobody cares about
alright but you as a developer you work
in interesting companies companies that
people are like oh wow you work there
like how is it like do you guys get free
lunches this is never like some people
like they get surprised by that right
after you go through that phase of like
okay this is cool whatever
you're gonna be bored with it you're
gonna say okay what's next for me okay
and that's what was happening for me I
say you know I'm gonna go in I'm gonna
save money I'm gonna pay off all of my
debt right I paid everything off I had
zero debt right um uh yeah paid off on
my day I basically all the money that I
earned was profit all the money that I
had was to save hold on give me a second
I forgot to put this live on on
Instagram so yeah everything that I made
was like for me it wasn't like oh man I
gotta pay this bill at the end of the
month
everything that I made was just directly
for me and I was good you know what I
mean so that's the first step you got to
have a goal the second step is paying
off all of your debts right making sure
that you don't owe nobody anything cuz
when you become a digital nomad you
don't want to be having something
holding down on your leg like uh you
know like a chain bald to your leg like
oh man I gotta pay this mortgage I gotta
pay this car I gotta pay you know this
credit cards I gotta pay all this stuff
like you never want to be in that
situation because then you're you're
gonna be like in another country put
thinking oh man I gotta pay that back in
New York gotta pay that back in your
lair I gotta make sure they don't
repossess my house you know they don't
take my car etc right or when I come
back I don't want to have my credit at
zero you know what I mean so make sure
you pay everything off
save your money keep money in the bank
at all times right you know for me my
goal was always to say hey I'm gonna
have $10,000 cash I old times right and
that's my goal that's my goal by now
I've already passed that you know I'm
way past that 10k you know I'm you know
I'm Way beyond that right
but my goal was like here I gotta have
$10,000 cash $10,000 in the bank $10,000
somewhere knows a lot of cash you know I
mean like some people they consider the
credit cards there are you know people
that all the money they think like those
are assets those are things that I oh
yes I got our a $40,000 credit card it's
like buddy that's not money that's like
money you need to pay at the end of the
month for two months you get what I'm
saying
like money is when you have it right
there in your pocket you say hey I could
throw this thing in the air if I want to
right so that was my goal to have
$10,000 cash right then from there I
started doing research I started looking
online and seeing where am I gonna go I
looked at everywhere people talking
about Thailand people talk about even
the Medicare Republic like where you
could pay a pretty decent house or a
pretty decent apartment for $200 $300
hey super cheap and I was like man like
I could do this so after my second year
I just started saving money putting
money in on the side and keeping
everything there I decided you know what
I'm gonna go in and make this trip
things happen right got merry got a kid
got everything you know sigh you know
took the left in life you get one say I
took the left on life you know what I
mean I was my whole goal this whole time
was that to go and travel the world and
be able to live on my own and and just
work remotely constantly right but you
know now I got a family now it's like a
extra thing that I have with me and even
though I didn't go to tiling I didn't go
to any country like you know around the
world like I could still do that now you
gonna saying I could do that any
homey you know I set myself up in a way
where I have clients I have my own
websites that generate money I have this
YouTube that brings in a little extra
thousand dollars a month I have my own
website that brings extra income that
comes in what else I have websites like
you to me that basically I sell my
courses in there not all of them because
majority are in my own website but you
know it brings in extra 300 400 dollars
a month from you to me and then I have a
multiple websites that are selling my
courses so it's like 300 here 700 a or
400 here like that right in total we're
looking about you know over 10k a month
right that's after taxes and everything
right so over 10k I'm off right and I'm
not even a big youtuber I'm not somebody
who was like oh man I I'm the CEO this
company I'm this this and that I'm just
a regular dude that made all of this
happen
because my goal was to become a remote
developer right right now if you guys
follow everything that I just said right
now you know paying off your debt having
a goal saving money always having cash
on you
and basically diversifying yourself in
different smaller businesses and little
ventures online and little websites that
make you money like you could basically
be good you could go to any part of the
world that you want to write if you have
no family no kids no nothing you can
literally say hey man I'm just gonna
travel the world like you could do that
this a lot of guys start doing that out
there a lot of guys and girls who are
doing it so for me in the next year 2
years you're gonna see a lot of cool
stuff I'm doing a lot of things here in
the US but I'm still focusing on showing
how I travel the world so at some point
I'm gonna go to the yard this year I'm
gonna be over there for like a month
two months then from there we're gonna
go different parts of the US and yeah
it's not Thailand yeah it's not
Columbia's yes not this in that but it's
like a remote man
completely a digital nomad everything
that I do is digitally all my money that
comes in is digitally I don't even you
know I don't lift anything up it's not
you know it's not like I got a go clock
in somewhere I gotta go and do this and
that it's like not everything that I do
is digitally you know all of my money
all of my income comes in from the
internet okay tomorrow there's no
internet I'm effed up you know anybody
hey as long as the engine is around I'm
good I'm GU Chee right so to tell you
guys about their a it's just to prepare
you guys because a lot of people they
want to become digital nomads they say
hey man this is cool hey I want to
become a digital nomad how can I do it
this is the best way guys listen to your
boy Joe with this skill of web
development there's so many different
avenues for you you don't have to be
stuck in a company you don't have to be
just the dude who is just like oh yeah
I'm working on XYZ company for five
years and I'm working hard to become
project manager like that sounds so
boring to me like it's not even worth it
to be honest with you guys so in reality
and even if that like you know a lot of
guys have you know me I just my goals is
to work at Google it's like bro I'm
bringing in more than somebody that
works at Google like if those guys that
go into Google like I'm just gonna work
I go when that's it's like okay not
making no money you know saying like
you're not doing anything that's
changing the world you're not changing
other people's lives you're just working
for one company you know it's not throw
shade out anybody that works out there
but it's just more like hey for you guys
who have goals and say hey I want to
become just an employee at Google or
employee or Facebook or everybody yeah
whatever Amazon or whatever bubble
bubble comm website that you want to
work at if you think that's the goal
then I don't know I don't know what to
tell you you know you gotta have the
goals are beyond that because anybody
could work at any of these companies
right but what happens after that
you don't know saying like I've seen so
many people who hit me up and tell me
Joe
man I just want to get a job in this
this and now I'm like yeah it's cool to
get a job you're gonna don't worry if
you got the skills you're gonna get a
job stop worrying about am I gonna get a
job are people gonna look at me
different from this ethnic group hey my
sexual orientation is this hey this
isn't that guys if you could do the job
you're going to get a job but what's
gonna happen after all right what's your
goal what's your five-year goal you know
my five-year goal was like hey I'm just
gonna make as much money as possible and
then from there make sure that I have
smaller businesses online where they
could generate me you know my goal was
$2,000 my goal was $2,000 I was like yo
if I could make $2,000 online without
having to to work for any company then
I'm just gonna go to Thailand I'm gonna
sell everything and this this and that
and at the end of the day I was like go
like that was so easy to achieve $2,000
you could do that with your eyes closed
you could build a CSS generator right
now like literally you could build a
generator for higher colors for CSS
grids right create a generator for that
and trust me people would use it create
I don't know something that you know
picking material I don't know if you
guys seen this like the material design
colors like those guys made money like
those guys you know like what is the
material design colors I'm gonna see if
I can share the screen with you guys
okay so look at this there's multiple
websites that have a lot of traffic you
know there's this one material design
material that IO /color those guys make
money this guy's from material you i.com
these guys they make money you see this
right here that's advertising kids you
know you get paid a lot by the clicks
but you also get paid by the impression
meaning how many times people come to
this website this right here they get
paid to for this little advertising you
know what I mean
now let's see what else material palette
look at this guy ads via carbon they
give money I think this thing is like
something that you could do with your
eyes closed and then the next thing you
know that's it you made it
you built it people use it it shows up
on Google Google search results and
you're good you know let me see what
else this website just watch calm I was
telling you guys about this the other
day if you ever use Netflix you know
that Netflix is a nightmare because you
can't really filter through anything
right so what this guy's day they're
connected to every API for every single
channel out there you know you got max
go ABC SX of acorn TV History Channel
NBC you to read what else
CW HBO now Amazon Prime Amazon Video
Hulu Netflix right so let's say you
wanted to click here and say I want to
watch something from let's say release
year choose a decade 1980s automatically
it filters through all the data and
shows you all the movies and shows from
the 1980s that are on Netflix okay
now Netflix don't even do this so people
need this service right and then let's
say I wasn't looking for a movie I say I
wanna watch let me reset this I want to
watch predator okay this thing shows me
exactly where to stream it alright where
to rent it and where to buy all right
now you might think like oh this is
stupid
there's like of course somebody created
this but at the same time guys it's like
why didn't you create it you got one
saying so it's like there's so many
different services and different things
that you can create that generate money
for you to be ready to become a digital
nomad you don't have to be a freelancer
like a freelancing is cool but it's like
now you're dealing with clients now your
dinner with somebody else's work now
you're dealing with building things for
people that you might not like people
that might pay you late people that
might say hey I'm gonna pay you you know
four dollars and fifty cents because I
got I got Benesh in Delhi you know
working for two dollars so if you want
to get this job you got to work for four
dollars there's like wait what you know
what I'm saying so you gotta come up
we'll be here and and just plan you your
whole journey to becoming a digital
nomad like I live in Connecticut live
nowhere near where my old job was that I
live nowhere near of any companies I'm
completely digital right I'm a digital
nomad you know and on top of that this
year I'm about to start traveling all
over to the US and going back to my home
country Dominican Republic and the money
flow is still gonna be there probably
making even more money once I'm you know
I'm out there and at the same time it's
cool cuz you save money like if you guys
you know you know you don't have no
family no kids no nothing
right you by yourself right you're
paying $1,000 right right you could go
to another country and say hey I got an
idea I want to build a startup I want to
start
our new business I want to create
whatever right let's say you could go to
another country for $200 a month you're
paying off your rent and then another
$100 you're paying off your food that's
a for $300 you you paid off all your
expenses all right now you could take
that money that you have and put it into
your application and pay advertising you
know or promote on YouTube or promote it
on Facebook ads or etc right like that's
how you become a digital nomad there's a
whole bunch of stuff out there how
people make money right there's a
million ways to make money online you
can sell things online you could do
affiliate marketing you could do what
else you could do like there was an
image website like drop shipping on
Amazon you could do so many different
things it's your it's your lane you
gotta choose the one that is for you
right it's your choice

for everybody else to come in then it's
Magnusson you move into twitch am i
moving to twitch I would like to work
with twitch but I don't know I don't
even know how that works over there you
got what I'm saying like I hear that you
gotta be sponsored that you gotta do
this and that even when I try to do live
stream to twitch it kind of don't work
properly I don't know it's weird
something I like it here on YouTube
YouTube gets me a lot of new people you
on Twitch will be like me starting all
over again from zero so I don't know
maybe I'll upload something I don't even
know can you upload two straight to
twitch or is it just live streams I
don't know you know so it's it's weird
you know
okay so Alex Tobias says thoughts on wet
flow so let's put this on the screen for
the people that know don't know what
workflow is I'm gonna show it to you
guys right now
and I'll share the screen with you let's
look at web flow okay so what flow is a
way to basically you know design your
website and at the same time it spits
out the HTML and the CSS for you okay to
be honest with you I think web flow is
cool but if you are a developer you know
how to do this yourself you got what I
say so this is cool but at the same time
it's like if I know how to do this like
I wouldn't use it now if I'm a designer
and a half of beautiful design on PSD
and I say hey man I want to try this out
then this is perfect for them you know
for developers I don't see a developer
using this to be honest with you this is
more for designers guys who who really
enjoy creating the design and then
they're like man I want to see it on a
real website you know this is great for
them but for us what developers this is
more like I don't know it's like it's
like a middleman it's like having a
middleman for something that you already
know how to use right now there's a lot
of cool features with it but personally
for me I've used a whole bunch of
different programs before I use this I
used mules
I've used
what was the other one from from Adobe
dama for DreamWorks is it DreamWorks Oh
Dreamweaver sorry so it's like all this
stuff is cool but like I said if you
know how to do it yourself it's not
really it's not really that great you
get what I'm saying because you don't
have that much control you could go in
there and drag and drop things but it's
only for previuos more for people who
need something quick if you are a
developer you're not gonna use workflow
okay let me make sure I put in this live
stream on Instagram so give me one
second because people oversell me Joe
why don't you put it live or Instagram
guys also to make sure you follow me on
Instagram coding phase just like the
channel coding phase follow me on
Instagram and your boy is popping on
Instagram man the things that you see
out here you won't see on Instagram so
it's a cool it's a cool platform okay so
yeah we live we live online on YouTube
we live for Instagram we live on every
day okay so anyways let's see another
question see carafe magar says where are
you from Joe I'm from Dominican Republic
born in Dominican Republic raised in New
York City from the age of seven till now
I'm a grown-ass man and basically now I
live in Connecticut okay move from New
York to Connecticut we live on the hills
man we live in the mountains out here
now you know so yeah that's well from
let me see what else
Marsha says how much JavaScript do I
need to know listen just know the basics
know how to program with it understand
what objects are I understand what the
DOM is and they're from there and that's
it you're ready to move on to something
like jQuery okay
now you're always gonna come back to
learning more javascript because
javascript is a thing that you can't
learn in one shot you have to take your
time with it right it's gonna take you
some time to actually learn JavaScript
so while you're also learning you're
going to you know come back to it and
just like let's say for example you were
at a company and a company tells you hey
man I need you to do a application that
you could drag and drop and when you
drag and drop and you drop it into this
little trash can I want you to delete
the file okay
you might they right oh my god what the
hell is this I don't know how to do this
all of that stuff you're gonna get there
once you get to that point then you're
gonna look that up and you're gonna go
back to the basics of JavaScript and
learn what you actually need to build
that application um once you know
programming like you're good you can
move on and start using javascript you
know you go into the documentation and
look at things as you need it
right don't try to learn everything on
the documentation say I'm just gonna
learn everything in JavaScript nobody is
like reading the Bible let's put this to
two this example learning JavaScript is
like reading the Bible nobody really
goes in there and reach the Bible from
one point to the end right if you're
doing that is because you're like you
don't know saying like you're super
fanatic with religion right most people
what they do is like the priests or the
preacher what I would say hey go check
Matthew 313 right go check Austin 3:16
something I don't know
right so go check out Joseph on 222
whatever right that's exactly how
javascript is yes you're there you're
trying to learn everything in there but
you only get to learn the things that
you need at that moment and then in the
long-term
year two years three years four years
five years you're gonna realize like wow
I learned everything in JavaScript but
that's because you learned it as needed
now as I'm trying to learn everything
with one shot all right so let me see
what else is seeing here I'm reading
says Marcela Rafael says it's so hard to
code apps I don't know what that is
let's say tank happy says answer this
coding face yo I'm 13 years old I want
to learn this stack front react HTML CSS
in JavaScript back node Express MongoDB
how can I keep it at 100 yo I'm Louis
bro like listen you gotta talk you gotta
get the sauce man you sound pretty stiff
man you sounding stiff man you gotta get
your your sauce up man
it's like it's like your coding phase
I'm 13 years old
I learned this tag from react HTML CSS
JavaScript act no now you gotta loosen
up okay you know I mean just going here
so just regularly man you don't have to
do all this yo yo you're like cuz I
don't even do yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
yo yo raps you know what I mean like
sounds kind of corny but listen if you
want to learn no Gs send me your email
coding face at gmail.com you're 13 years
old for those of you guys that don't
know if you are younger than 18 years
old
and basically you say hey Joe I need
help hey can I get access to your
website I do give access to my website
to everybody who's under 18 years old
all you have to do is just send some
proof right and I definitely give you
access to the website man right now I'm
actually working on a no js' course I'm
pretty far in already so yeah like I
could definitely help
with that if you want to learn react the
website has that HTML CSS JavaScript the
website has that node the website has
that I'm not doing it with Express and
MongoDB but I do teach the basics of
Express I'm doing it with Adonis Jes has
the framework and then my sequel as the
database and the reason why I'm doing
that is because 80% of the jobs that
you're going to get out there right
especially if you are a junior developer
they're using my sequel that's something
that people don't talk about you get
what I'm saying so send me an email
I'll set you up why do you take the
other PHP course out of here on
description the reason why I took it out
because a lot of people started
complaining like Josas seems pretty
outdated for those of you guys that
don't know when I first came into this
channel I had all the courses that I
took right all little courses that I
took from you to me on my description so
what I did I say hey I'm gonna update a
couple of things here all right
the PHP course status on my description
is good as solid but the same time is
using PHP I think 5.3 or something like
that it's old right but that's the one
that I used when I was learning right
now I created the PHP seven and laravel
course and basically I say you know this
is more modern this is a latest version
of PHP and for a lot of people they're
gonna get more benefits to actually
learning this right and that's it that's
the only reason all right so let me see
what else since I work two jobs should I
try i freelance to replace my part-time
before I go for on developer yeah you
could do that that sounds perfect you
know if you can find a part-time job or
a freelance job then yeah do it like
that while you're still learning and
still getting your skills up and then
from there once you're ready then you
you jump on to a full stack run a full
stack full-time employee at a company or
etc whatever you want to do you know let
me see so let me see what else what
other questions we got Joe I'm sixteen
can I still become a digital nomad yes
you can become a de you don't know Matt
on basically being a digital nomad just
means like GU being somebody who's
independent right like I could work for
a company and be working there for two
years and then say hey I actually want
to go travel the world I'm gonna be able
to come in at the same time on skype and
work for you guys and do the same work
that I've been doing but now I'm working
remotely right if your company says yes
then you are a digital nomad right
you're making money and you're working
from around the globe you know what I
mean like there's really not a pinpoint
location for you that you have to clock
in every single day
you gotta say take for example how I
think um this K was it dreaded death
right
I was watching his video where he was
talking about how he became a remote
developer when he first came in he first
job he had to go in into the company his
second job which is where he's at now
basically dating half our office yet so
because then he have an office what they
did was they told him hey work from home
so the office is ready now that the
office is ready they saw that he he
works so good by himself at home so now
he don't even need to go into the job
alright cuz they already trust him and
they know that he's actually legit you
get what I'm saying so now because they
know that he's a J he's working remotely
full time you know so right now if he
wanted to go to Puerto Rico he could go
to Puerto Rico he wanted to go to Mexico
go to Mexico or Europe he could go to
Europe
as long as he works on those hours that
his office works then he's good alright
so as 16 you could become a digital
nomad if you do freelancing if you find
a company that that trusts you and they
lie
you or like let's say you don't even
need a company right
you could go literally go online start
building small applications things that
solve people's problems like how to
calculate let's say for example how to
calculate your tax returns you could
literally create that with HTML CSS and
JavaScript how to calculate your job
your your tax return people are looking
for that right now that's a lot of money
right you can make online you could
create something like how to find the
best movies for sci-fi better calm best
sci-fi movies calm that's it people
search that all the time and then from
there that will show up on the search
results you have advertising on the side
right now you 16 years old so you will
need your mom to actually sign up for
Google Adsense and then from there you
make money from there right it's a lot
of ways man check out the website - man
check out my website send me an email
anybody who's 17 17 years old in any age
younger than that send me an email and
show me proof that you are 17 show me
proof that you 16 show me proof that you
13 something that shows like hey this is
me this is my picture did like an idea
or something
you're good you're golden you know what
I'm saying like I will hold you down and
you get access to my website that's
something that I've been trying to to
promote but I want to do it the right
way right now I'm just telling you cuz
you're here but I'm gonna do a complete
video on this on how to get free access
to my website if you are from either the
top 50 poorest countries in the world or
you are young and then seven with
younger than 18 years old if you're 18
years old you could work buddy you get
what I'm saying I'm sorry at 18 years
old I was making money you know what I
mean people that walk around like yo man
I'm 19 years old man you know can you
hook me up as I broke the courses the
subscription is $10 bro like you go pay
that instead of you buying
McDonald's you could pay down online
like it's not that difficult you go to
riding you bite a little credit card you
put into a debit card and that's it you
sign up to the website people do it all
the time
all right so don't try to game the
system all of this costs money and time
is money and at the same time I put in
so much work to to this website so
somebody gotta get some type of benefit
out of it right
Joe has says bro I'm overseas what
should I do to make my income with our
effing with a company like I said you
gotta create application small
application little things to our niche
right on my website right on my timeline
even on my site man I'm gonna show you
this coding phase calm let me share this
with you guys
remove this phone on here all right cool
all right so we hear coding phase calm
let me share the screen so this is
coding freeze calm that's my website
people come in all the time people find
me all the time to Google search results
right the page the number one page that
everybody travels to and goes to see is
the timeline when they click on the
timeline you get this page all right
then from there you click on the front
end you come in you put in 24 right 24
hours that you can devote per week
automatically as you guys may see here
there's advertising there right when
somebody clicks on the advertising I
make money right of course
if people click on it it's like it has
to be genuine it can't just be like
people just clicking on it like a-holes
Google smart enough to be like nah
that's fake right but people click on
the ads all the time like a bootcamp
might show up I don't know like a game
that they were watching on Amazon now
shows up the ads here right so even
though this is for the website and this
is completely free and shows you the
timeline I'm making money off this right
and the reason why this is also free
access to everybody unlike a lot of
websites that they'll be like oh you got
a sign up to the website to even get all
the the courses that you need I make a
completely free people who come in and
say okay I could calculate how long is
gonna take me to learn how to code now
in Google
they sent me hundreds hundreds of people
per day rain they come here and check
this out and not only does it help my
website to get promoted but the same
time every time they get here
this ads is here so I'm your boy is
making money from that right it's a free
page but it's a service it's giving
people a service real Christian is in
here so say what happened to Christian
he's on Instagram what up but yeah so
that's how I make my money right I have
a whole bunch of websites like this you
know I mean like this page along
probably per month probably makes about
maybe like 120 dollars and you might
think like oh it's only 120 dollars like
what can I do with that but if you have
20 pages that are making 120 dollars per
month calculate that you gotta say like
the is just how it is man you gotta be
smart you got to know how to actually
use things man and it's like we have a
skill we are developers but doesn't mean
that we have to just work for somebody
that's like somebody think of us I
always bring up like a mechanic right
but we are also mechanics right we could
go and say oh I'm a mechanic at
mercedes-benz
yeah buddy would you just a mechanic at
mercedes-benz you don't own the
dealership you are a mechanic at
mercedes-benz you got what I'm saying I
hope that makes sense now when you're a
developer you work at Google but you're
just a developer at Google you work at
Facebook
you're just a developer our Facebook
that's not yours
you go home the stocks go up you made no
money out of that you're gonna saying
like that's not a startup you're not a
founder
you're not saying so we have skills that
can
money for us so that's what you got to
do you know use your brain use logic be
business savvy and understand how the
world works all right I understand that
the the skills that you have you can
make money or why you gotta say all you
have to do is really do the research and
that's it so let me see so there you go
Joe has C do you recommend October CMS
based on Larry also that Larry will dev
don't have to really learn WordPress
listen man
October CMS is cool but it's not it's
not WordPress man like most people are
used to WordPress for us developers
we're looking at this and we're going oh
man a wordpress I don't want to look at
WordPress right we make that face
automatically but one thing that you got
to understand is that to the world to
marketing people to content editors to
copywriters guys who write our blogs all
this and that they know one thing they
know WordPress they don't know you know
what's the name of it October CMS they
know WordPress that's what they know so
it's cool I think October CMS is cool to
set up a website you have somebody who's
like oh I want to create a wordpress
wordpress type of website but without
having to use WordPress it's cool but
most people most businesses and small
businesses they're gonna ask for
WordPress they're not even gonna tell
you can you build me a CMS type website
no they're gonna say can you build me a
website on WordPress now if you can do
it then you're higher if you can't do it
that's it they give it to somebody else
you know they give it to the gnashing
and deli for four dollars and fifty
cents you know I mean so it's up to you
if you could you know if you wanted to
WordPress okay how can i deploy the know
web app or Heroku I don't know how to
deploy web apps um pretty much upload
your files to github
then after you upload your files to
github just log into your Hiroko account
and then there's a section that says
deploy and then you can log in with your
github account and then search the name
of your repo on github and then you say
automatic deploy that's it it's pretty
simple even here YouTube that's probably
a million YouTube videos on how to
deploy to Heroku okay Tyler Patton says
dreaded F be promoting bootstrap studio
trying to handicap people I don't think
he's not doing it maliciously he was
doing is telling people like hey if you
don't know how to code at first if you
don't know how to code and you're trying
to get into freelancing you're trying to
get into working something like that my
my work perfectly my studio was a
bootstrap studio or web flow all of
those things can work perfectly right
for somebody that doesn't know how to
code once you become a developer you
know how to code there's no need for
that
you got what I'm saying but he's not
wrong on telling people to learn how to
use bootstrap studio or wet flow there's
a lot of people that just know how to
design but don't know how to code you
know so it's like if a client comes to
me let's say your client comes to me and
tell me hey could you build me a little
website I'll landing page this isn't
that if the person doesn't need a
back-end doesn't need nothing crazy hey
use what flow use bootstrap studio
whatever you might want to use you know
what I'm saying like it's up to you
whatever makes you happy
me personally I know how to code so it's
like I'm actually faster at coding than
using other programs cuz then it's like
a middleman for me you know what I mean
it's like it's like if I know English
and you know English and then I have you
know the middleman here is like hey
could you tell him to pass me the sauce
and then the guy goes like hey could you
pass him the sauce he's like okay thank
you for passing the sauce he said hey
thank you for passing the sauce it's
like we know English you you got on
saying like we don't need a middleman
but for new people who are coming in is
great like I said you know I think a lot
of people that are showing up to his
channel are people who are coming in and
they're like they're interested right
they're interesting that's acknowledge
the interested in becoming what
developers so it's a great introduction
what flow bootstraps to do they don't
know how to code yet but they want to be
able to show something cool something
nice and pretty
so they is like a shortcut brain it's a
shortcut to build something quick for
client right but as they become more
experienced developers they they move on
from that is the natural thing okay let
me see the centralized application
blocking stuff to be honest I'm not
interesting on none of that stuff like I
don't see that making me money at all
that's just being honest I know there's
gonna be there's gonna be a section of
people that are gonna focus on that like
let's say creating their own blockchain
technologies or working with like a
terraeum but I'm not interested in that
like I just don't see the Bennett excuse
me I don't see the benefits in there for
me you know but it might be the
different type of industry I'm not in
that industry where you know if I was
like in a bank maybe that would make
sense guys also to just reminder if you
get a notification make sure you show
you a boy some love man you know I only
have a few people that are following I
actually have four my notifications guys
make sure that I'm one of those guys
that you know show up here for you guys
you know for me people that I watch Dave
Ramsey I like this guy who talks about
different type of worlds different
people from different countries got the
coding tech I like there
there talks I like the dreaded dev I
like Krishan you know those are the
people I get notifications for so make
sure that your boy your boy Joe get some
love man you know make sure you
subscribe to my channel and make sure
you click on the notifications it's cool
to have your notifications there you
know what I mean like um yeah so show me
love man rickety is like Austin 3:16
yeah man sometimes I throw a little
something in there hello
I love a little pinch we call that a
little pinch to see if people catch it
let me see what I was sober blade the
blade is like yeah the sauce is steel
[Laughter]
listen the sauce is never still mean the
sauce is here forever man the sauce is
so good that everybody got the sauce now
you know any channel that you see out
there that's socially oh you don't say
like that all comes from the sauce man
you get on saying like that drips down
boy you know it's like we dripped down
on every channel out here
thanks to your boy now people got
personalities thanks to your boy now
your boy is out his shiny thanks to me
people are out here showing their faces
before me it was over here's the code
here's how to do this here's the top ten
programming languages before me there
was nothing out here it was dry you guys
are saying the only source is you know
what I mean it's your boy out here
you're not saying the sauce is out here
I'm the social leader of this you
got I'm saying so anyway I just really
in the comments way I'll be laughing so
so hard with the people when people are
retarded can you use that word retarded
nowadays I don't know sorry to whoever
is offending let me see you
let me see what else is in here man I'm
reading I'm reading reading the comments
we're in the comments francisco comma
yet at Joe's plane Time Lord says hey
Joe Oh should we got dreaded deaf
without what up son
Tom Laura says hey Joe I sent your email
last night because I signed up to the
saker's Ginobili have you got the email
how much I haven't checked my emails
today I'll be honest so if you're there
don't worry you're good you're gonna get
access in the next few minutes the
digital nomads you see on you to promote
travel but don't really tell you 100
percent of truthful about what they do
there could be some in drugs yeah I mean
now people there's a thing there's a a
big scheme you know I'm asking the
teachers or nomads of YouTube I'm
putting this gonna be the section where
we all mask digital nomads there's a lot
of digital nomads out there that are
poppy and mommy's kids meaning like hey
little Shawn and got a freaking trust
fund and every month you know it's like
he got a four hundred thousand dollar
trust fund and every month he got you
know eight hundred nine hundred dollars
per month back you gotta say and he gets
a little money extra on the side and and
if things go bad mommy says hey little
Shawn are you okay are you in Thailand
right now here's some money for you
little Shawn right so let's unmask it
taking off the mask for for the the fake
that you don't know Matt's guys who be
faking it hard right so what happens is
I don't know if you heard of that term
which says fake it till you make it
this happens a lot with digital nomads
on YouTube they talk about hey man I've
got an amazing course on how to travel
the world how to travel for free how to
make money from blogs you look at their
Alexa nobody visits their website they
barely get any traffic
which doesn't make sense because it's
like if you're traveling to work you
need you need to be making money but
it's like now they don't make money some
people they just scheme it right so they
fake it till they make it right they end
up with 50,000 subscribers they end up
with a hundred thousand subscribers so
now money is coming in now they got our
audience but in the beginning they faked
it right it took them the whole time to
fake it until they made it you gotta say
and even for youtubers or what
developers out here there's guys who
just they pay for or you know they pay
for subscribers
you know people pay for advertising on
Facebook they pay for a whole bunch of
stuff and like let's say they go to
India right India Philippines even
Dominican Republic and get a whole bunch
of subscribers from there that is super
cheap to get those subscribers to get an
American subscriber cost a lot of money
but to get a subscriber from those
countries are you know up incoming
countries third world countries whatever
you want to call them right they
basically are very cheap right you pay
for the advertising is it costs almost
nothing right so I might come in I might
be a legit developer out here right or a
legit did you don't know man but I only
have a thousand five hundred subscribers
right little Johnny from the side has a
hundred thousand subscribers so now an
American sees that and says oh man the
guy that has a hundred thousand
subscribers
he's the legit one but what they don't
know is that people bought those
subscribers right people bought those
views so now they faked it until they
made it was they faked it right and
again 200,000 subscribers three hundred
thousand subscribers now those extra two
hundred three hundred thousand
subscribers on top of their fake a
hundred thousand subscribers three
hundred thousand dollars 300,000 square
are legit so those people now give them
money you know what I'm saying I don't
know if you understand how it is it's
like people fake it at first and then
once they on and people see like oh this
has 100,000 subscribers now those new
subscribers are quality subscribers so
now they really make the money that they
tell people that are you know that
they're like oh I'm traveling for the
world for fries again now you bring for
from the YouTube ads and now you're
paying for it from the traffic but first
he faked it he wasn't getting no money
you wasn't popping out here you got on
saying so that's what happens right and
that's how it is in the whole world it's
how you call it was a perception or
whatever it was like somebody might come
in here and be like saying there's
somebody would love to comment let me
see if I could find him you know me I
like I like to bring things out with
like real proof of things right so go to
YouTube let's go to my community and
search through the comments and this is
like a perfect example of something that
happens all the time so let me just do
the research I want to show numbers I'm
gonna show real real comments real
things right so when people see this
they don't be like Oh Joe say this and
this and that without having any proof
so I'm gonna show you this right now
share this screen okay I think his name
name is max like that where was it okay
so let me see where is it
fine with us or hungry okay so this is a
perfect example of somebody some poor
innocent guy that just doesn't know how
the world works right how this internet
thing works of faking it right faking it
till you make it right a lot of people
fake it on YouTube until they make it
like I could be here man fake and say
man I'm making $100,000 a day I'm I got
a Ferrari
I got a Airbnb I got distance in that
although that's pay for all of that fake
right but now doc hosts in subscribers
who think that that's real a year from
now because I have so many subscribers
now I'm making that money but when I was
making that first few videos that wasn't
real okay so this is a perfect example
of how innocent people think so this is
max feeding he says coding face listen
bro I'm looking at jobs as I told you
for the whole thing about this video was
it was about Ruby and I'm telling him
like yo bro like this more jobs on Ruby
on Rails on your area and he still
didn't believe it even after I show him
the proof but he's so innocent that he
just doesn't understand how how this
thing works man
sometimes it's crazy talking to sheeps
you know I mean so it's like I'm telling
him hey man like this is how you do
search results man this is how you
search how to find jobs and find the
real numbers not the numbers by why HR
people add a whole bunch of different
technologies to a listing when you go to
a job interview they're not hiring for
that they just add it to the listing and
people think that oh this a million
nodejs job is like no bro
what they asking is do you know how to
use NPM so anyway sometimes I'll tell
him that in a coding phase listen bro
I'm looking at jobs as I told you I see
no Ruby I'm looking at jr. playing
developer roles javascript is not hot it
just has some things it just has some
things
to his nation that other languages don't
and will never have that's why it makes
your future
says you're a little too opinionated Joe
I feel you are carried away you're
misguided in your audience big time see
you're not the only youtuber i watch and
I watch a lot of youtubers and guess
what you are the only one preaching set
my dad rails
and ironically the only person hating on
VJ s why do you think that's happening
is that because you're the smartest guy
that knows everything why other
opinionated channels I'm not talking
about the tutorial channels that have a
hundred thousand plus subs
don't touch Ruby and never hit on view
please answer this question and says why
should we trust you or other channels
other channels also care about the
audience just like you do they also do
researches and clearly elaborate their
points why is that right now this person
is a poor is a poor sheep right is a
poor doe with that you don't want to say
how the YouTube game works
you don't understand how things work
like that's why I tell you guys you
gotta live outside the bubble you now
look when you're a developer when you're
somebody out here right use your brain
you're no longer a consumer you are a
producer you are somebody who is a
creator so think like a creator right if
you are a youtuber and you coming over
here and you say hey I promote nodejs
which gets a lot of search results and I
promote view Jas which gets a lot of
search results your channels gonna grow
bigger you're gonna get more views if
you promote the things that people are
searching for now what people need
there's a big difference what people
need is something totally different than
what people are searching for you know
what I mean like if right now I say I
create a channel and I say hey guys go
to school get a degree this is how you
become successful do you think that
channels gonna get a lot of views
nah you know what's gonna get views hey
guys how to become a millionaire in
seven days that's what's gonna give use
how to become a view Jes developer in
two things how to do no js' in one day
those are the things that's gonna pop up
on the search results like you gotta use
your brain like you know what I mean so
this is what happens constantly it's
like fake it til you make it
people fake it and then once they make
it now they're legit but the whole
beginning they faked it you know I mean
there's a lot of even like channels that
have really great content that you will
learn a lot you know I watch a how you
call this girl the real tough candy I
learned a lot from her
like a lot I go to her channel I learned
a lot right does her channel gets a
whole bunch of of beust
know a bunch of subscribers no it's not
really about quality it's more about hey
man what catches people attention you
get what I'm saying so when it comes to
digital nomads online going back to the
topic that happens the same way over
there hey wait tech wait take what up I
got a lot of people in here so um that's
for Instagram so that's what happens
you're gonna say like people fake it
with digital nomads and they act like oh
they're making money they doing this and
they're that travel in the world
and it's like most of the time is kids
from papi and mami with a trust fund who
don't even have to go to school don't
even have to work they just say they're
getting money at the end of the day no
matter what right so there there is no
being scared of failure they gotta get
that money regardless right in there
from there have you seen that or online
have you ever seen that when you you
look online and somebody says I'll make
$20,000 traveling around the world and
all a half is a blog about traveling and
you like wait how do you make money and
the person tells you I just travel well
- you travel how do you you get the
money to travel and pay for your
expenses in and pay all this stuff
you're like I can't tell you that papi
and mami you got what I say that's what
the papi and mami factor comes in
you got nothing so when it comes to
digital nomads there's two type of
people the papi mommies the guys who
fake it until they make it once they got
200,000 people following them now they
make him money but before that there was
just papi mommy holding them now and
then there's the other people who come
in and they have you know the smaller
businesses and just like me they have
little businesses here and there that
can train money and they survive to
become a digital nomad and then there's
the other people that just you know they
get paid by sponsors you know people who
say hey promote my my course online and
affiliate marketing and do this and that
like this different type of people's
you're gonna say so when it comes to
digital nomads and just knowing how
YouTube works how the internet works in
general like guys this is a thing that
has been happening since the beginning
of time even with rappers you see
rappers that just came off the project
that looks super dudes that look super
dirty yesterday and then from one day to
another now they have changed they got
this and that but what you don't know is
that this person has a manager who was a
drug dealer who has money and says here
wear my chain wear my watch wear my my
diamond earrings and now you're the
rapper so you gotta fake it til you make
it
once they made it now they really afford
all those things when in the beginning
they faked it and that's what happens
here on YouTube okay now let's move on
from there to the next subject let me
see what else hope people got something
out of that you know sometimes I break
it down and jump into different things
but I hope people know how to put one
and one together you gotta say
so we got--we tech way tech without my
hope you got a little something out of
that Oh see got the wolf packing here
yes sir and guys in a few minutes I'm
gonna open up the lines for people to
come in and you know show up to to the
show man if you want to show up listen
the link is gonna be there man so let me
see I'm reading reading reading reading
just got in a lot of people just got in
I let me see reading reading reading
reading comments guys let me see
really really reading from up for am Joe
has you up right now in China your boy
Joe has is is from the us man he's in
China right now he's crazy I mean talk
about a nomad that's the Nomad that
somebody who's out there rent let me see
PC filtering to a.m. everybody's giving
out the time now
who's John Tyler Brendan says I'm giving
shot I'm throwing shots at John I don't
know who's John are you talking about
John Thomas nah I'm not throwing shots
at John Simon John Simon's been around
for a long time his audience is old his
audience he's been around since
Pluralsight the arrows things like he's
been around for a long time been writing
books he like he's done a lot of stuff
that a lot of people haven't even
thought of but he's up there I'm talking
about like guys like ty Lopez like you
know ty Lopez came in here super faking
it it's obvious that he was faking it
well once you get enough audience enough
people in there like now say he's good
he makes money he makes a lot of money
Tai Lopez but he had to fake it till he
made it you know what I mean so yeah you
know I tell people all the time man
listen if I was to do something like
that
I could literally come in here and be
like yo I got changed I got crazy
jewelry I could literally come in here
but like y'all got
hey man your boy got $20,000 on the
chain you know I'm driving the Benz
you know right now we bout to happen on
a private plane your boy could do that
but then that would be faking you know I
mean like ain't even that I have all
those things except the private jet I'm
not paying $10,000 for a private jet but
I could fake it I could literally go
to the freaking to the logical is to the
airport
the the clear port that's pretty close
to here you know go where they do a
video they pay somebody a film crew
spend five hundred islands there four
hundred dollars that I paid the film
crew I could make fifty thousand dollars
by just faking it and be like hey guys
I'm out here I'm doing this and that I'm
singing even the craziest things man
I've seen people that's never worked as
developers and telling people that hey
I'm a successful developer I'm doing
this in that as I bro you've never
worked in anywhere like you're like a
college student you don't seem like you
some little kid
we just started so it's like you know
how to sell yourself for you where have
you worked you guys wanna say so you
could figure to you make it right that's
not my goal my goal is like you I do
everything
genuine so at the end of the day I could
show that off I'm like yo I'm the
originator I'm the guy who came in here
changed the game again what I'm saying
like things that I do you know I mean
like how did I was thinking about this
you know I mean like even like when we
was talking to Chris Sean the other day
me and Christian are like like this you
know when we came in we came in just
like that we're gonna same same level
same game right listen but I'm like how
did he'll in less than a year with less
than 10,000 subscribers somebody asked
me this like Joe how can you do YouTube
how can you do all this stuff full-time
you know I actually came in and did all
this stuff full-time and killed the game
with less than ten thousand subscribers
with no support from YouTube no support
from or Google again no notifications
again none of the stuff right and
somehow I'll make the same amount of
money of the do start making three that
have 300,000 subscribers now imagine
that right imagine if your boy gets to
300,000 subscribers like we're talking
about like I don't even want to put a
number on it
because if I 10,000 I could make about
$15,000 a month with that just this is
my goal
like at ten thousand one less than with
less than ten thousand subscribers i no
support no nothing I've made fifteen
thousand dollars a month
imagine if I touch three hundred
thousand dollars we're talking about
do the math you gotta say so it's like
your boys out here man everything that I
tell you guys just because I have a
small number just because you might see
this in there just because I come and
sit chit chit chit chit doesn't mean
that I don't know what I'm talking about
everything that I do is for a reason
everything that I tell you guys about
something is because I'm trying to help
you out so you guys don't do the same
mistakes that I made you get what I'm
saying and I know that you guys can you
know a lot of you guys are way more
talented than me a lot of you guys are
way more smarter than me you guys just
need somebody to put that bug in your
ear help you out to get to the next
level and give you that confidence I
could be that person to help y'all cuz I
didn't have that it took me five years
to get here because I don't even have no
guidance and I have nobody that could
look up to nobody that could look at
their channel but I all man I relate to
this person
there was nobody you know like when I
came in here know there was a whole
bunch of corn balls on YouTube nobody
really teaching me anything nobody
teaching me how to make money
everybody's all yeah let's get a job is
this just top ten technologies to learn
for 20 18 20 you know 2014 2013 it's
like well how you make the money though
like don't tell me don't tell me don't
talk to me about what's the technology
top technologies where's the money
where's the way that I'm gonna get a job
tomorrow don't talk to me about this is
the coolest tech talk to me about dollar
signs right if you're interested in that
this is the perfect channel for you you
gotta say so everything that I do is for
a reason everything that I tell you guys
this for a reason so you can learn for
your future man like there's so much
stuff that I know that people like
regular people just don't know you know
what I mean it's like this poor soul you
know what I mean it's poor guy max
whatever his name is
it's like he in his head he really under
he really thinks that when somebody
that's on YouTube has a hundred thousand
subscribers
tell them hey go over here learn the
signal is they have the best interest
for them you don't want to stand that
they make money from the time that you
know they go to view their channel when
they view the channel the other have a
link to other websites linked to their
courses they have affiliate marketing
they make the money from that all the
stuff that you see in my description
that's my size stuff that's like twenty
percent of my income you know I mean
like if tomorrow
everybody says Joe Fu we dropping out
from coding phase comm doing this and
that I'm still gonna do my YouTube I'm
not gonna be affected by it
you're not saying for those guys they
need to have two views coming in they
need to subscribers coming in every
single day in more views because that's
how they make their money from the
middle YouTube's so it's like they're
gonna tell you use this technology
because that's what on that's gonna show
up on a search results then tell you hey
learn this programming language because
that's was gonna be hot on the
programming languages it's not what you
need as a brand new developer who's
never worked in a company you get what
I'm saying like PHP Ruby on Rails those
things are solid those things are things
that if you know it you're gonna get a
job and people are gonna trust you right
away if you go in and say hey man I want
to learn no GS and you know even though
no J's is grading everything but at the
same time it's a higher barrier because
these guys that have been doing
javascript for years that you as a brand
new developer you can't compare to them
so when that guy goes into the job
interview and you go in and you've never
worked before he's gonna get that job
not you people are not going into PHP so
that means there's an opening for you
everybody's jumping to other
technologies because they've been doing
it for five ten years already but you as
a brand new developer you've never done
that you've never worked at a company so
this is your opening you gotta say I
just sorted the other day well who
forgot
this K according to Tory's 360 love the
K God blessing right but he was saying
the company that hired him they're
backing us in PHP but then he's telling
people not to learn PHP what part of the
game is that you're gonna say like I
love crystal I love Ruby but I want to
tell the people hey man these are the
things that's gonna get you a job this
is like real advice just being honest
with you all right am I gonna come and
tell you it's like if I work my first
job was in a company that worked with
PHP right and they gave me the
opportunity and they use my sequel all
right if I as a self-taught developer
don't tell you to learn PHP what am i
doing to you I'm actually hurting you
because I'm telling hey this is the cool
technology that's cool in the future
well what about now who's gonna hire me
now don't tell me what's gonna happen
two three years ago
who's that hired me now I just came from
you to me I just came from the what
developer bootcamp I just came from a
tech degree on on teen treehouse I just
came from whatever who's gonna hire me
now it's somebody with PHP either doing
WordPress or doing larva that's it
Amy let's move on from this Oh God
I just trying to help people man I'm
trying to I'm trying to tell you guys
exactly how it is man listen we got a
couple of people we got a lot of people
in here man we live and I was like that
actually hurts people
and it's like well you know you see
people that come in I see this all the
time on Quora is the worst Korres is
like the worst you'll see like a bunch
of guys who work at companies doing PHP
but then they'll go to somebody who who
says hey man
language should I learn to get a job
quick endeavor like me go learn you know
focus on nodejs and focus on only elixir
and focus on was a scholar I seen
somebody telling some some dudes that
I'm like bro you look the research and
what company they work on what do they
do
and as I you work at a PHP company like
does it make sense to tell people not to
learn PHP when you your first job was at
a PHP company doesn't make sense but
whatever what do I know man I only got
what 10,000 subscribers or something
like that I don't know nothing right you
know that that's the that's the math
behind things you know what I mean
guys this it's just like that how it is
everywhere social media you could buy
followers you can buy subscribers you go
buy all this stuff and a poor soul like
yourself not saying you but like
yourself right somebody who's trying to
find the right research the right place
to to learn you might see there and say
oh this person this person got 200,000
subscribers this person got this is not
this person he must be knowing you know
he must know everything you must know
you know the best things for me
200,000 people are following him you
must be saying something right and then
you realize is like wait what what are
you saying like huh think I'm saying
like guys man do the research man the
best thing that you can do is use your
brain in this world a requirement to
using the internet nowadays should be
like you should get like your eye scan
design like right before you hop on the
computer IRIScan real quick just be like
a big red letter like BAM and this
person is now using the brain don't even
let them online you know I mean like you
can't use your brain in 2018 you're
doing something bad man
so anyways man oh let's see
yes Harrell says Joe you are right I
have my site running no with digital
ocean but no one's hiring for that in
Miami that's the thing that's one
another big issue if I come in and I
tell you hey man this is the top
programming language there's the things
that you gotta learn today to get high
and get higher and I don't think about
every other part of the world and every
part of the country and I'm only
thinking about my city my city New York
City my city is the second biggest tech
hub after San Francisco right we have
every technology here driving and
booming right if I come here I consider
my city as the standard is like bro you
know I mean I think you're not giving a
proper advice out here so anyways guys
let me see I'm gonna give the links
right now so who ever want to hang out
with me for the next half an hour on the
livestream sorry took a little bit
longer than usual that's the link guys
imma put it in the description right now
your boy is
I cannot indent it again listen I'm
putting the link in the description if
you have anything that you guys want to
talk about
saving it all you have to do is refresh
refresh the window and you're gonna be
able to get in here okay guys I missing
let me see let me see we got 90 people
steadily watching for like white for it
for now
we good we popping out here you know
what I mean
it was so guys so so long as you guys
continue supporting your boy your boys
gonna be out here I'm gonna be supplying
this this gems just real life stuff man
we got rage we got Latino codes from
Instagram we got with tech Joe I'm still
with Texas wait tech Joe I'm still a
newbie should I skip Express yes and go
straight to react yes focus on maybe you
know the backend language maybe after
react right then you choose which ones
you want to do not with PHP you want to
do no js' whatever you decide yo what's
good yeah so let me see who's in here
hosing I can't see I got Tyler and we
got Harold
right yeah Harold say what are you from
Harold Miami Florida a Miami I'm
thinking like yo soon as I hear Miami a
thing of like young people doing doing
the Southside like people with like
freakin pink and light blue colors and a
freaking glorious Stefan dancing like
yeah man let me see it was in here man
somebody said where's the dreaded dev he
was here for a little bit I don't know
what happened to him so what's the topic
hey what are we gonna talk about right
now Harvey listen man you guys about
anything
any questions that people have let me
know we discuss here alive I don't know
I'm if you answer it like Mike um I
don't know if you answer like my
question that I'll say it like in your
chat because I had to restart my
internet and I didn't see it so if you
don't mind I'm gonna ask it on my gang I
was basically trying to ask um is it
hard to get a remote job if you on the
if you barely have any job experience
but you have experience they were like
programming like is it gonna be hard to
get a remote job if you if you don't
have any job experience or will a good
portfolio and some really nice projects
at actually ran them over all right all
I'm gonna start it up again I'm gonna
start the Instagram live give me a
second damn I had a lot of people on my
life I'm starting up hold on give me one
second
and I'm gonna answer your question all
right so Tyler says basically is it
gonna be hard for him to get in the game
as a remote developer when you don't
have that much experience as working in
the company etc right
basically I will say yeah it's gonna be
harder right you know the people that
get our remote jobs in the beginning
that's like random you know what I mean
like
you know I'm being honest that's like
random that you're gonna find that that
situation it's like it's like the
lottery you know now everybody is going
to get there you know so not to say
don't go for it apply like let's say if
you find a job online that says hey
we're looking for a remote developer
this this and that
yeah ply why not why not apply for it
right but do take into account that most
of the time when somebody gets higher as
a remote developer they actually either
are an expert or they already know that
this person has been proven to be a
great developer so now they're gonna
trust them to work remotely right
because when you work remotely
it takes a lot you gotta have patience
you gotta be somebody responsible you
gotta be somebody that can be online all
the time as far as like the working
hours you gotta be close to you close to
your computer I've seen this done where
people are supposed to be working live
and they're like they're like outside of
their house and you're hit them up on
skype and you're like hey we've been
hitting you up for 20-30 minutes where
you was I don't know I had to go outside
something something happening outside as
I broke it's like you working even are
you working at your house you're still
working on the on the clock it's like
you know we expect you to be there and
expect for you to to answer you know
answer the phone or the Skype etc right
so you gotta be very responsible to get
a position like that
that's your first job and is rare I'm
being honest it's just rare it doesn't
happen for everybody you know sometimes
you might hear stories we bring back the
dreaded deaths story of how he's working
remotely like that sounds like something
that never happens you know the way how
he's working remotely that never happens
in the world at all like people don't
just you know hey our office our hour
you're building you could work from home
like that's not gonna happen to 99% of
all of you guys it just doesn't work
right it doesn't really happen in the
real world but for him it's a special
situation you know what I mean
and that happens once in a blue moon man
so you have to have skills you have to
you know prove yourself a lot of times
that I see people that work remotely
they've worked at a company for a year
or two and then they say hey man I come
here once a week you know I come here
once a week
can I just work from home you know
instead of me coming in that one day of
the week
you know Joe has listen you got to go
through the link on the on the live
stream don't don't try to google hangout
me sending me up my invitation cuz it's
not gonna work you gotta go through the
description I'm gonna share my screen if
you want to jump jump into the chat room
so pretty much right here just refresh
this page right if you're watching me
here refresh this page okay when a post
is here and on the description it says
here's the link to Gold sort of hangout
live you click there and then here you
go it's gonna ask you to agree and then
you click ok and then you're gonna be
good all right do it through there man
hey yo what's up something like as a
grand I was gonna be going at once yes
sir who's this project Fox Oh project
Fox what upside the bad guys we live we
live we live we out here man so yeah
hold on
my
done has a question where's your
question Mike dunk dunk could you please
write the question again so I can read
it sometimes it goes too high up and I
can't find it so yeah we got a couple of
more people in here so we got Tyler we
got Harold we got ally who's Project Fox
and we got Lewis and now we got your boy
Joe has what a doula a passes bedtime
it's like 4:00 in the morning in China
right like fire alcohols firing them on
[Laughter]
like Donkey Kong you show me we're going
order man so at least the way you
ferment from the UK London London we
popping in London man those don't even
know your boy is out there like this
let's say I'm from the East End man you
already know man we out there man we
poppin you know I mean I get a hook pass
when I go to to London you know I mean
definitely man come on Oakland and I
button yo man so um a little bit about
you really what you studying now yeah
I'm just crying for your crime line at
the moment man I'm on the dashboard I
have actually been on it for a while but
I didn't want to take it into I did a
bit more practice so I went on Google I
looked for a PSD and I just conveyed to
a HTML
I finished it yesterday but I'm turning
it to be responsive now nice yeah now
I'm gonna jump on the dashboard probably
today tonight and then continue tomorrow
nice nice and how's your JavaScript
how's it going with that no JavaScript
at the moment right yeah
now that's fine that's fine you know
once you you can convert any PSD or any
design they're from they jump into
JavaScript you're actually doing the the
right thing I see people jumping into
JavaScript and they can't build a page
yet you know since I build a page be
able to understand what's happening
there and then jump into JavaScript
because if you understand HTML you
understand how things are working in an
HTML file and we'll CSS then you're
gonna be able to understand the Dom
better and somebody would just jump into
it randomly so oh hold on I got a
question from Mike Dunn he says I'm new
to coding I want to build a site like
worldstar I was told to learn PHP JW or
play or any other resources I can use to
help me in the process
Joe Holland alright so one thing that
you would notice I mean worldstar I
don't know what's technically half now
but worldstar actually started with work
with WordPress I remember a few years
ago they started with WordPress right
now they're using I'm gonna tell you
right now they're using Apache which
most likely means they still use in PHP
so yeah this websites pretty old like
the backend for it it's pretty old you
can use a lot of different technologies
right now you could come here and say
hey I wanna build it with PHP and
Maribelle or you could use something
like Ruby on Rails or if you like
somebody who wants to do it with no Jas
I would say considering Adonis genius
because it gives you a structure or how
to build your your application for this
website you will need to have AWS server
for just uploading the video
because that's what you're gonna need
the most if you really want to do
something like worldstar what else you
can do this whole website with jQuery
like if you look at worldstar calm like
this is nothing serious like this is
like super simple to do like there's
nothing that's complicated that they
working on you know right
so I would definitely just like look
into any back in language that you like
and you could build this like it's
pretty simple like there's not a lot of
things that's not there's no I don't
even think they have user authentication
or anything it's just they have probably
do have user authentication for the
administrative side or that's like in
the backend for the users you don't even
have to deal with that this is mostly
just putting videos on online and that's
it so it's pretty cool pretty easy
alright so let me see what other anybody
else got any other questions
you know um Joe um if like nobody have
won a crashing um have you checked out
um I was actually on pleura site um this
morning and they actually have like some
type of like site where you can go wrong
and you can take like an accurate test
unlike someone like the programming
languages and arm and the frameworks and
they they probably give you like what
like 20 like Christians to actually like
to actually like go through and at the
very end they would like they would like
tell you what your IQ armor armor level
is on it like specific subject and I
think is pretty cool a for like people
who wanna like see if they like know a
specific language for like framework or
something yeah I think it's cool I think
Pluralsight has something like I think
it's cool the link right there
I don't know if other side yes
Pluralsight well have skills it's just
pretty much basic testing to see I think
email CSS JavaScript or any other
programming languages it's cool if you
want to just test yourself out this is
this website called top tool guys if you
really want like mote work they have so
many good jobs like for really big
companies but this is not for everybody
I'll be 100% honest like the best like
literally so you have guys who are like
college professors from Ukraine or you
know college professor from Argentina
like on this website right yeah we hella
smart super smart is just more like you
gotta know your things and like focus on
one specific subject like you know you
have no js' developers PHP developers
Python react yes developers so it's like
they have you take a test right and
there from there once you take the test
if you pass it then you're a member of
the top they say is the top 3% of
developers in the world so if you're a
member of this then now they hook you up
with remote jobs to companies like you
know CNBC or Zendesk Airbnb ap Morgan's
and Hewlett Parker there's a whole bunch
of companies right so whenever they need
a remote developer or they need like an
extra hand a contractor then you will
get hired
alright and then of course top two will
get their their percentage out of
whatever you learn what
get paid really well it's not like
you're working for for you know Elance
or or what's the website odesk.com
whatever like you're working with guys
who are trying to do work for $3.50 you
know what I mean like this guy's
everybody is making $50 awesome
Jake had a sites where I've been looked
at them I was like oh everyone's betting
on like little like $3 $4 $5 I'm like oh
I can't do that yeah I got bills to pay
exactly man so was good Oh Joe has man I
mean people I don't know you you in
China right now what part of China I'm
in western China near near too bad
actually I'm actually in a system on
there West's wine there uh Tibet
here Tibet few hours will place two
blocks away from to the mountains and
fill me I had to mute you man so I gotta
get some headphones because if not the
the feedback man it sounds like Xbox 360
Kinect everybody alright yeah I hear you
good I'm just on the little regular I
was talking to this other guy cohosh
asked us Joe you might be on like a xbox
like 360 talking and next thing you know
a somebody comes in they would like they
connect and they starts talking and they
got the whole voice chat going
that's crazy well yeah um so let me see
Lewis so what's good Louis where you
from man were you you man
can you hear me now yes put a Rico yeah
I'm straight from Puerto Rico Sam one
well I live in the states now I moved
after like Hurricane Maria cuz Italy

power and I kind of work so I've moved
to the state so I'm in the States right
now I'm in Lancaster Pennsylvania okay
play well I'll be moving to Virginia

it's like Merc we're stuck to the over
there okay nice nice nice
yeah man I was actually looking to go to
Puerto Rico in May oh yeah well I don't
know man like a couple of things need to
get fixed I'm like I don't know maybe I
leave here I mean there's some places
that have power but like if you go like
you know like out of the city there's a
lot like place the best still don't have
power so I mean a lot of places are
messed up trunk then do not blow like
toilet paper and I don't know I
been I've been out here for hell of
years brick I just see him he'd been
done he'll look Jake a Joe has has
no idea what's going on in the world
like listen man I
and it's I been in prison broccoli and
rice that's all I mean Elham Arabi hella
hungry I'll be like y'all put a Rico my
shower I'll rather be in Puerto Rico for
real though that's pretty Shady
listen man I survived man you you send
me to hell I'm selling fire but yeah man
so Louise so how about now now that
units in the state you working remotely
or you you went closer to the company
you was working with
so I was working remotely like from
Puerto Rico Oh boots estates and I kept
working remote for a bit but I got tired
of it I've been doing it for three years
and like it like I just want to do
something different so I'm just looking
for new opportunities I have a couple of
interviews lined up and I received a
couple offer letters so um just so you
know like working to get hard and I'm
always there so I mean what stack you've
been working with because from what
you're saying like you you you want to
try new opportunities what where exactly
do you mean by that you want to work at
another company this one working like
different projects been working kinda
like on the same like industry for for
bed and I just want to try something
that frame so the stack that I currently
use this you know like react nodejs
um MongoDB so like a murder suspect
pretty much um so yeah that's kind of
like what what I do
sometimes you need a switch man
sometimes you just need to switch it up
and try something new
you know you sometimes you get bored you
know I was talking about in the
beginning of this livestream it's like
for me I already had a plan I was like I
Know Who I am I know how I am how I
thinking and like the person that I am
like um I switch up quick right like I
used to when I first started I was doing
you know I'll give you I'm 30 years old
right so I'm gonna give you guys the
five-year plans of every five year plan
that I have from the age of 14 right at
14 to 19 I was doing music alright Troy
I was like traveling all over the US
making beats for a whole bunch of people
already don't was popping I was doing
music for this guy Corrigan here signing
atlantic's
I was doing a lot of stuff I know those
guys yeah I had the opportunity to go to
Puerto Rico at that time I was like
scales like not really skateboarders
like should I leave the stage to go to
some country and the Caribbean when I'm
making money here so whatever things
happen I changed my mind I was like I'm
done with this so I came back to the US
and from 19 to probably 20 go 19 to 23
I just basically focus on school I say
I'm gonna go back to school I'm a move
on or moving back with my mom's and and
just help out family was going through
stuff so I had to help them out and
stuff so basically I said when I'm here
I'm just gonna go to school went to
school got some BS degrees whatever and
from then became a developer so from 24
to 29 I was a full-time developer
working orders he is now I got my other
five-year plans
now it's entrepreneurs you know I mean
like now it's about making money opening
up small businesses and that's where I'm
at right now so it's like you constantly
gotta keep on changing through life
especially when you know you start young
you know is
you're gonna see somebody say oh yeah
I'm a developer at this company for ten
years it's like nobody wants to do that
you know at the five-year mark it
doesn't matter you could be at whatever
company like look at fun was there fun
fun function he was working as Spotify
so I made my the is one of the the
the coolest companies to work for but he
was there for four years he's like yeah
I need to get the hell out of here you
know what I mean so no matter what at
some point even if you in the best
company or your favorite company you
gonna be like you're I'm out of here
you know I want to try something new I
wanna move on so I definitely do not
blame you on that because it's like you
definitely gotta move on it and work on
something else even a different stack or
something completely different a
different industry you know I know some
people that they've been working their
whole life with enterprise right and
they don't even know what a start-up
feels like they don't know what it is to
not have to wear a button-down shirt you
know I mean like these guys that have to
wear a suit every day to work well have
to wear some slacks and like they don't
know the freedom that it is to work in a
start-up or a smaller business at some
point like yo I just want to switch up
you know so yeah man any other topics
you guys might want to talk about thing
I think that like most of us you know
most most people watching your channel
you know we all came from a certain
place did certain things and we all
realized like a basically certain things
happen we were like yo we got a
you know try to do something right or
make some kind of change in a life that
will make steady paper stating money
coming in they will better our life or
our family's life you so me and that's
that's the one thing I sing English with
your channel it just made me realize
like yellow I need to go ahead and
follow a dream that I actually wanted to
do instead of just something that is you
know afternoon or whatever else you
doing you know to me yeah
definitely I think everybody you know
for me like I tell all of you guys it's
just about evolving you know what I mean
like and always putting challenge just
in front of you having goals because you
know a lot of times people you know they
become depressed they become sad they
think man I couldn't do what I wanted to
do when I was young and a lot of of
those things happen because you don't
have goals if just you know day to day
say okay today I don't got money
tomorrow I'll work at the end of the
night I go to a party I wasted the money
now you don't have no money for the rest
of the week and it's like things like
that happen all the time or you might
say hey I love to party all the time and
I don't want to go to school next thing
you know two years later you're at
Walmart you know packing up boxes saying
things 14 years go by ten years go by
you like I'm 30 years old I
don't have a career you know what I mean
like how long how long can you do this
you know yeah they might legalize it in
one state or do this you might be in
another country might be in another
place you might be doing these things
and what can happen if you're doing
pop you know what I'm saying yeah
basically just look at it like Oh daddy
maybe you have a kid you just had a kid
raipur yeah I just had I had my kid my
kids three years old you feel me I'm
looking at it like I need to make a
real career make a real change I'm from
the bay you know what I mean I'm from
the Silicon Valley whatever that is I'm
talking but I mean like at the end of
the day like gotta work towards
something you know back in the day when
I was 14 you were talking about Dragon
Ball Z and you were making these
websites I remember back in the day we
about the same age deeper and back then
I was like yeah I wanted to do this I
was talking to my grandpa told him I was
like yo look I'm gonna make these little
apps husband bought and put on all these
things and there was like graphic horror
all that ain't none that's you
ain't
really make money that's dead there
ain't no making and light little bread
like I think I could do it and they was
like don't do that I'll do something
else do something else I thought all
that and it didn't really make
nothing for me
method of the day I wish I would've
followed that now I'm looking at it I'm
trying to learn HTML CSS sass I just
finished your sass program you know I'm
just finishing your sass you know to me
I'm going through all your things and
I'm like I should have been doing this
yeah I mean the good thing is that you
know we still young and you could still
come in in the industry and even that
like right now you were you in China
right
you went that is probably opportunities
over there cuz things that you don't
even know like around the corner you
know what I mean like there's so many
different things I have a friend of mine
who he was working here he know he got a
degree for engineering for engineering
and it was like automotive engineering
it wasn't even like engineering
engineering it's like automotive
engineering and as I brought like
there's no jobs for you out here you
know you're not building the cars you're
not doing today there's nothing like
that so what he did was he went to China
he was around Beijing Hong Kong
basically teaching English out there but
then he started learning to code online
and I think now he he working for a
company over there that they make make
websites and software for American
companies but now he's living out there
cuz he knows the language and he knows
everything so it's like they give him
you know that one up it's like okay cool
what's it out down or how about
you may you learn the language yeah I
can speak I can get around I can talk I
can go where I need to go eat what I
need to eat pay rent
I can't have a conversation like we
talking right now you I mean at the same
time how long you've been they you've
been there for like yeah they don't look
where I live they don't even speak the
same language is like my girlfriend
right now right like she speaks the
language but they're they're they're
real language Mandarin right the rest of
the country every city go to speak
another language straight-up like we can
speak like if you speak Spanish you
could speak Spanish right and yeah
there's a little differences but no in
China there's big differences for big
big differences there's like at least a
good 20 languages that people speak
everyone say they speak Bhutan water
they don't they don't come back with
culture you know what I mean you come
back with a kid yes I listen I got my I
got my trophy right here this is my
trophy I got my kid you know I mean my
little break so as I get your well you
got a son or daughter yeah I got a son
double citizenship you know it's all
about applying yourself then at the same
time looking at opportunities man this
opportunities out there for everybody
the problem is like how do you find
these opportunities you got a do
research you got a look online you got a
network with other people you gotta find
where even like let's say for you Joe
has like in your area you gotta look for
where are the developers meeting up
there's meetups all over the world
so you go over a meter would be
because they find people who are in the
industry even in your area you rely hey
man I want to I want to work for this
company I want to do it to shape I want
to do something right like most likely
you're gonna be good it's like right now
if I go to Dominican Republic I say in
Dominican Republic in a month or two I
could find a job out there for the
simple reason that I already know
English that I'm already Americanized
that I know all this programming
languages and you know I have the skills
right so it's like the same thing for
you you know what I mean like you you're
an American in a foreign country you
know you probably have more
opportunities than most people have over
there so is that you gotta take
advantage of that you know I was like
even if you gotta go to other cities and
check other things out
hey that's something that you have to do
on your own you know what I mean yeah
but you know I say is this like way a
hard dough like I meet the people out
here they like the people who did you
see on them other channels you filming
like when I talk to you I see what you
talkin about everything else is it's
real you know what I mean you make it
really understandable
to anyone videos on your courses
everything and even when you're like a
look at the documentation look at the
document say something like okay I get
it I kind of and then when you say it
through I'm like oh yeah now I get it I
get it but like but our here they just
some square bears birthright my mamma's
like there's some square bears from
Delaware they just be like oh you
understand when I'm talking to mom the
bobble on it I'm just like where are you
Jake hey it's Mama's girl I tried I
tried to be cool don't be like they did
some mm-hmm
I'm really don't like they not from
where I'm from you can really they're
not the same people even if I try to be
cool with everybody how to play the
system man that's how you gotta play the
game man it was like you know when I
come in here
people be like yo damn no goes in there
you know Joe goes into a board meeting
it just comes jumps on the table comes
in and be like dab Joe is here in the
office like I don't do that you know
every night what you doing though you
know what you're talking about like they
know what they're talking about - I
understand like they they try to pull
out like I mean up I met up with them
right at this little meetup over here
talk to him they like trying to get me
into a boot camp they like 35,000
dollars up front and I'm like very when
China doesn't you know how you gonna
charge 35,000 only making
like $500 a month
mm-hmm you know and that's you feel me
like like oh you wanna take take
advantage everywhere in the world it
doesn't matter where you at I seen that
done you know it's like people even even
got that like I seem like a it's like a
meetup type thing in in Thailand where
people who are like entrepreneurs go to
and just to go to set a place for two
days you gotta spend $25,000 if you
don't spend $25,000 you can't go to the
meeting right now all the people that
are there then I'll be making $25,000
what they're doing is they basically
they you know they selling things in
their house they you know they freaking
taking loans they're doing this and that
to get those $25,000 to go for a two-day

back at it again in Australia you know I
mean then you got some Dominican kid
from New York City is like soul of man
so I really appreciate it you know so I
definitely let everybody know about that
man but in London
that's everywhere in the world Joe where
on everything everywhere I live like
right now like I'll let you know like I
live in Chengdu right Chengdu is
supposed to be like the biggest city in
the Western of China or whatever
the city's it's 15 million people burn
they they say 15 to 17 million people
and yes we got people you feel me you
know Dominick man you gotta be careful
with your mic man you y'all hear
breathing right into it all right sounds
like this ha ha brick sorry man my Mikey
was just too gross form of this the
reason any other topic guys you guys
want to talk about the sites that you
have where they become like passive
income sites like how much maintenance
you got to give to those sites like
after they're done because like you know
they're they're like to me they're like
bubble gum machines teachers kind of
like check on them you know like it once
in a while the only time I look at it is
if it goes down like if as far as the
the Adsense money goes down that's the
only time that I look at it because
sometimes you might get like let's see
this type of websites is like I said on
four words the material material colors
right let's say this website material
that I oh right like there's a website
that you could probably build it with
any type of back-end and you could do it
with anything as far as like any
front-end framework you could even do it
with jQuery so I don't miss a material
UI colors yeah so this is a website that
you can do with almost nothing like
right it's super simple all it does is
you click on it as soon as you click on
it you copied the code so automatically
when you
they say they'll say you got the code
now a lot of people need this you know
so it's a very simple site but very
useful once you build a site you never
have to come back here like you never
have to come back and try to fix this
like the website is done it's now we're
gonna break you know the JavaScript you
know the things that you add it so there
is no meaning just to it the only
maintenance is sometimes you gotta make
sure that you don't lose the domain name
because that happens so what I do is I
buy a domain for like 10 years they'll
be like $100 because usually domains is
ten dollars that I pay so I'll buy it
for ten years and then I have a reminder
to my email so I email got specific just
for that just for like reminding me to
look in there and like to get important
notifications so whenever domain is
about to expire then I go in there and
rebuy it for another 10 years or that's
about it I mean or like let's say if I
want to switch up a hosting company like
I still have GoDaddy then I switched up
to namecheap.com
and that's it that's the only hosting
that I have to do namecheap.com is is
good for domains
I actually I had that question for a
minute like what what do you recommend
for domains and hosting I will go for
Namecheap it's super easy you could buy
hosting there you could buy your domain
and usually they have a for cheaper like
let's say you wanted to buy that I Oh
usually you will see like people pay
like thirty sixty dollars yeah
the dial but with namecheap you go get
it for sometimes even if you buy on the
first time you could buy it for like
fifteen dollars I've seen offers like
that if you go to
domain.com they're gonna sell it to you
at a retail price Namecheap will get it
for you for cheap joe yo yo yo here
talking about on talking about domain
names I a my real name
like table and I tried to get Telecom
but sadly their domain that's been
taking something like that let me know
me when I'm Joe um I was actually like
he is like what do you think about da IO
domain names for a put a portfolio
because every time I think of a DA
I like domain like I think of like a
like application or like a game or
something like that like I don't really
think of a portfolio site having a dot a
dot domain it doesn't make sense to have
a diode for for your personal website I
think a dot me go sounds so yeah that's
what I got right now
yes dot me I've seen people dot me or
calm because that's like you telling
people I hate this is my portfolio this
is my work now when you do it that I
always you're gonna make money out of it
like this no reason why somebody will
have to pay $30 or even $60 for a diol
domain somebody said you could get 99
dollars for it that I alright so there's
no reason for you to be paying $100 per
per year for a freaking domain that
you're not making money out of it you
get what I'm saying like if I was to say
hey I'm gonna buy material designs that
I owe then that makes sense because
that's gonna generate money that's gonna
pay itself off you know and people gonna
look at it and say oh this is a serious
company or a serious you know serious
application on your portfolio site do
you think you should put your full name
like I know you play Joe Santos Garcia
but do you think you should put your
full name some people got long names
joke you should always try to buy your
domain I've seen somebody who was like
Hossam Syed something
something right and I was I brought like
like just by that domain just to buy it
because the the thing is that if
somebody searches your your name the
first thing that's gonna show up is your
full name so you want them even if you
you have another domain which is saying
let's say for example Joe designs calm
or or whatever your main domain which
has your full name you redirect it to
that or the domain exam or you do
vice-versa you tell somebody go to Joe
designs calm and then you redirect them
to your full name website because right
now if you google my name in a while yep
I just love it but I don't know if I
should store with HTML on the designer
just I mean you in this well you gotta
start with HTML you have to start with
HTML CSS you got to do what Ali is doing
which is actually learning how to build
a website from a design meaning that if
I give you a design can you build it
right if you can build it in from day
you start worrying about programming in
JavaScript right but at first you always
want no way until you finish your mouth
CSS once you get through that and you
understand that then you jump into it ok
how much for one year in just how much
you understand it bro like what you
actually think look at a design like I'm
durable and you can like
use just the CSS and HTML to design that
same site then you jump in the
JavaScript like I still at that point
right now really I'm not even jump I
tried to jump in the JavaScript it
didn't work out for me
so lay hey I'm still working you gotta
first learn how to build a website from
your design and then wants to do that
then from there you jump into something
else
that's a question I have for you too Joe
is the how my CSS like Wendy's feel like
like like if I look at this site a
template on dribble right and I'm just
trying to like recreate that I can read
pretty much recreate that and change it
up my own way I just go ahead yeah just
jump in the JavaScript brush sorry keep
going on it for a minute longer if you
can build it exactly how the design is
that means you're ready to move on to
JavaScript if you stay there then you
just wasting time that you could be
learning other cool stuff you know so
once you ready any website what do use
of the JavaScript or what that what
there's a basket talking what what
Travis speaking these were for Oh
javascript is used for the interactions
of a website when you go to a website
and you click a button in the background
turns red or let's say you click a
button and see a little drop-down show
up that's what javascript is doing you
know it's the interactions in the web
sites the programming side of the
website of what the user sees you know
because when you go to a website HTML is
all the text that's that's on the
website race is all the text that that
builds the website right CSS is what
gives you the colors what gives it the
positions and the layouts
then javascript is will give you the
interactivity of the website you know
when you search something online a like
I say on YouTube you search for coding
phase so why don't you click enter then
basically it doesn't get requests with
Ajax to the back-end server and brings
back that data and shows you all the
latest videos when you hover over an
image and you see like a little
drop-down menu show up that's also
JavaScript when you you know everything
that you see that anything that's like
interactivity most likely is JavaScript
sometimes you can do certain things with
CSS but most of the time is JavaScript
doing it so um I kind of thought you was
talking about your user name by this
note dot J is course that like you are
going to make right and you're going to
use my son and you're gonna use I on a
my sequel database I was actually
curious I like because you don't really
see like too many people use a my secret
database i when they use know like you
know Oh a huge um people who use PHP
they are usually the ones who use like
be my SQL and people who use know like
they go with like MongoDB and I kind of
always like dark would it be kind of
like awkward to actually use a my secret
database with anode baking right beep
because you don't see like too many
people like do that and you barely see
anybody mix the two together yeah um and
that's the main reason why I'm building
it like that because let's say for
example most of the companies that
you're gonna be working with let's say
you're a brand new developer most of the
time they're gonna have my sequel right
if you come in and say hey I know no js'
I know MongoDB then okay cool you know
no js' but now you gotta learn how to do
no js' with my sequel because that
company uses my sequel right no js'
where it shines
is creating api's and Russ api's and
like using it as a small server like
let's say your let's say for example
take this as an example you go to a
company the company tells you hey we
have a store we have an online store we
want you to create a countdown of all
the sales that are happening on the on
the website right you're not gonna go in
there and do that with PHP because it
will be too too bloated too much stuff
to do right so what you would do is you
say I'm gonna build it a small micro
service with no Jes so you're gonna take
no GS connected in my sequel database
and now display the countdown on the big
screen for the company with connecting
directly with the know Jes and in some
reactive applications directly right now
most people teach you know GS with
MongoDB because of how it was introduced
in the beginning where people would say
hey I know the mean stack now the mean
stack is turning to hey I know the myrn
stack
hey I know whatever stack right well it
doesn't mean that is mandatory to just
use MongoDB with no GS that's like a
huge problem that people have because
most of the time even like I believe who
was a Walmart Walmart I think it was a
Walmart or one of those so I think
Walmart they they build a website with
no GS their databases like Redis you
gotta say like it's not MongoDB not
every company is using MongoDB you got
I'm saying so you want to be able to say
hey I know no GS there's so many
resources out there for nodejs with
MongoDB which is technically like the
easy route right because MongoDB is like
JSON like let me go back to it like
think about it like this when you are a
brand new developer right you
look online everybody has to mean stack
right the reason why they talk about the
mean stack because everything is in
JavaScript so you could focus on one
single language right and the reason why
they tell you about MongoDB is because
MongoDB is very similar to just objects
okay so it's very easy for people to
transition from learning JavaScript to
learning no GS to now learning how to
use MongoDB okay like weird to having to
go from Mount from nodejs to now jumping
into my sequel which is now much other
language you gotta say most developers
that are creating courses they really
take the easier route to catch people
things because it's easier to just say
you learn the mean stack learn MongoDB
and that's all you're gonna need but in
real companies there's so many different
stacks you gotta say like when you're a
computer science student you basically
get the foundation for all type of
different data structures and on type of
data bases so when they get higher
they're good because they they've had
knowledge of no sequel type of databases
type of databases and other type of
databases and even you know mercury
wasn't mercurial which is another type
of like getting the hub you know what I
mean like they have more knowledge
online if you just follow what everybody
has only showing you the most easiest
thing that's like the basics then I
gotta teach you the things they're more
advanced there's barely any advanced
courses out there
everybody knows everybody that you buy a
course they teach you all the basics
over and over again but then you do that
you're gonna be using on home real
website you don't say that's the reason
why I kind of like to use on a plural
site I'm a lot because they kind of
teach you like the more intermediate
stuff
yeah whoever site has a lot of good
intermediate courses I think a lot of
times the the developers that are
teaching the courses they're teaching it
for enterprise and 80 percent of the
people are now gonna work at Enterprise
you know if you gotta work at an
enterprise company you know what I mean
a corporate company where a whole bunch
of different stacks then lower site
might be good but if you're looking for
smaller businesses um
they teach you like in a longer way some
it's more complex than what is really
needed you get what I'm saying I don't
know if that makes sense
but that's that's why me personally I
don't look at a plural site because no
none of the instructors there the way
how they teach things I've never seen
that in any of the companies that I've
worked at like most of the stuff that
they have is more complex than what what
is needed if you're working for
Microsoft right then yeah you probably
have a super complicated react
application but most jobs you're not
gonna be doing it like that kind of a
bit so yeah but going back to no genius
in my sequel the reason why I'm choosing
no js' and my sequel is is because
nobody else is teaching it okay and most
companies is you're gonna be more useful
if you say hey I know no js' but I have
knowledge of my secret even if you say
there's people here that no matter how
much I'm going to explain to them that
they should learn PHP they like now I'm
just not gonna learn it Joe
I've already heard so many people tell
me the PHP is dying Ruby is dying I'm
just not gonna put my time into it or
there's gonna be people who's gonna say
hey Joe my brain can only take one
language I'm only gonna focus on
JavaScript which is like the biggest and
the most stupidest thing that I've heard
from people but they say that all the
time that I I can only focus on one
language oh I can't do too many things
at once so no matter what I can't change
those people
well what I can do is say hey listen to
try to persuade you to understand all of
these things is I'm doing this no js'
course and here's my sequel and when you
get your job you're gonna thank me how
everybody else that has got a job and
came back and said Joe thank you you was
right you know it happens all the time
people be like Charles Mann all these
other people from YouTube waters
instructors they saying do it like this
do only MongoDB learn the means tag
learn the myrn stack and then when they
get to the job they have their
applications which look cool but that's
not what they use on on most companies
you get what I'm saying yeah but then
they miss out on those opportunities if
you've never tried my sequel if you've
never done my sequel ever in your life
that's gonna put a big stop for you to
be coming along becoming a a back-end
developer you get what I'm saying my
sequel is actually pretty good on
because I was actually on a couple of
like months ago
all my when Java it was like my main
language and I was a focusing on net um
I was using like my sequel home as my
main database hey you know zamp
and my sequel um I would always use
there so I'm I do have all my knowledge
am I I do have knowledge in my sequel
but I'm it's been a while since I've
used it so I might need to watch like a
course on it to refresh my memory on it
but um I do kind of I'm understanding
though you got like things like um and
you got like those like you got like
those like on the statements that you
have to write like you know on my selec
so and so from this update they're from
there and things like that yeah look I
think everybody you know everybody could
choose whatever technology they really
want right cuz if you hate something you
shouldn't do it but I think when you're
starting as a game developer self toy
and you don't have a degree it's harder
for you to get a job
without having the basics if you want to
become a web developer I'm not talking
about I'm a software engineer iOS
developer Android whatever so become a
web developer having PHP is like the
basics PHP is like JavaScript because
it's just the it's like the language of
the web no matter what there's a lot of
cool ones are popping up now we're using
javascript in the backend but at the
same time those jobs are not gonna go
away companies don't switch up you know
there's new companies coming up that
they have the luxury to say now we're
gonna switch up to we're gonna start
with this new technology right tomorrow
you start up might come up with using
crystal but a major company is not going
to switch up from they're stacking java
to no js' or they're not gonna switch up
from the stack in PHP to no Jay yes you
gotta say like I think nodejs is cool
because it's just JavaScript and it's
easier to learn and you could just
create micro services and like let's say
you want to spin up a server you could
do in a few lines great well when it
comes to major companies companies don't
work like that companies they have a
stack that somebody chose 10 years ago
20 years ago and that's not gonna change
the amount of money is like right now on
my last company we had to do our
basically a payment gateway to connect
with Chase right she uses Perl right now
you would think like Oh chase is one of
the biggest company in the world like
why would they still be using Perl you
know what I mean that's like bro that
that's been there since the 1990s that's
not gonna change
it's gonna cost them so much money to
change their whole infrastructure to
something completely different just to
say hey we got the latest technology you
know what I mean and that's the thing
that I try to drive into people's head a
lot of times when I say no PHP my sequel
and even now where I'm
teaching them no genius with my Seco is
so they could have there could be more
valuable you could go into YouTube and
find a course on nodejs a MongoDB you
can find a crash course from traversing
media but a good my sequel and nodejs
course you're not gonna find it there's
barely any of them out there period
I think Coast you had one but it was
focused more on my sequel then the
nodejs part what I'm doing with this new
course is is actually I'll make sure
both no js' my sequel and Adonis GS
especially for people who like let's say
I'm a ruby developer right I'm a ruby
developer or I'm a PHP level developer
and I love the frameworks Adonis GES
gives me that structure that I had in
those other frameworks but now with
nodejs the biggest problem with nodejs
is that there's too many libraries same
problem that's going on with JavaScript
every single thing out there is just
libraries are different a million
different versions which one is the
right one nobody knows right because
there's millions of them if you go by
github stars and all this one got ten
thousand github stars this one got seven
thousand but which one is the best
library right what Dhananjay yes saves
you the time of thinking about that
instead of you focusing on which
libraries should I get
which body parcel should I use which
libraries should I use for sessions
which library should I use for cookies
now you can focus on building the
application instead of focusing on
building the structure to your stack so
does that include like the Express
server and everything so you just like
start using it right away
Adonijah j/s doesn't use Express but on
the course that I have that I'm building
right now I do start teaching nodejs
with explore
because it expresses like you you got if
you're gonna do no js' you got to know
the basics of Express right so I'm gonna
show you guys right now you see where is
my screen so people could know exactly
what I'm talking about
sometimes we talk about something and
people don't don't see it visually
they're like wait what like why are they
talking about okay so let me share my
screen yeah y'all is just Kevin from the
bay okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna come in
I'm gonna show you this so basically
this is the course basically we have
this thing where here how long sorry Joe
has gotta meet you so yeah so basically
this is the course right what I have so
far I'm working on named finishing it up
by the end of the week
so we have the introduction you know
introduction to no js' where exactly is
it how to install it how to use atom
text editor the programs like the
packages that you need for the course
understanding how websites work on a
high level when I say on a high level
some people get it confused they think
on a high level means like always like
it's gonna be very detailed no a high
level means like we're looking at from
up high like below us it's like okay I'm
explaining it to you I'm not going into
every single detail of how HTTP works of
or the history of tcp/ip like we're not
going into that what we're going into is
how websites work how a request works
how things get saved into database so I
explain all those things here okay now
from they are going to the nodejs basics
initializing our first project doing NPM
in a require an export create our first
server basic routing and static files
with that information
you're already are basically you you're
good
to understand how a web server works
right there from there we go into a
dynasty yes okay
Adonis - yes how how to set it up then
from there the structure of the folders
and then from they are going to every
single thing about routing with Adonis
GS okay a dynasty yes is a framework
that's built on its own it's not really
built on top of express when you see a
lot of frameworks that you might find on
github or or online what you see most of
the time is people that are using
Express and they basically calling it a
framework that is on top of Express
that's not really a framework right so
what dynasty s does it basically the
author of it created a dynasty s from
scratch it's not using Express it's not
using anything so it's super fast then
on top of that we have all the good
things about basic routing route params
how to bind controllers to a route how
to render views how to basically do
routing for single page apps a lot of
websites in a structure don't even talk
about none of these things how to do
named routes how to do groups
what is middleware you know before you
could even jump into anything else you
got to understand what is a middleware
how middleware works how it basically is
it goes through a requesting it's like a
middleman between the requests and the
backend so I explained that here with
metal or middleware then from there we
go into template engine Adonis GS which
is called our edge if you ever use
laravel you use Ruby on Rails then you
understand how this works
so you got basic gauge edge conditionals
loops templates and layouts how to do
includes how to create components with
edge which saves you a whole bunch of
time like you guys don't even know then
I have the section called batteries
included which I go into explaining what
is the
request what is the response objects and
then I talk about batteries included
which is explaining all the things that
come with a Down SJS when you create any
type of how long I got a call when you
create any type of application with any
instructor out there they teach you
everything like from scratch right with
Express and there from there what they
do is they go into different the
libraries like the body parser they talk
about sessions they talk about Passport
they talk about all of these things and
as a brand new developer you get
overwhelmed because number one you don't
even know what all of these things doing
right you don't even understand up the
body parser does you don't understand
what sessions does you don't understand
what the cookies does like people don't
know these things they're following it
but they don't want to say how to put
things together so in this course that's
what I do I just say hey I explain
everything show them all the things that
Adonis Jes has that saves you time from
instead of you having to come in and try
to figure out which one is the best
library is like now although that's
already included in this let's focus on
building the application you gotta say
hey Joe he was talking about party on
parcel and one thing I hate I'm about
node and um and you like packages is
that like um every time I get a package
right on my life to check out the repo
on github twice on Twitter to actually
like check out like the code and see
like how like the library is actually
working under like I'm under like the
hood just so they can make me a better
day off and one thing I find kind of
hard is that
like let's say you download a library
right and you want to see how their
library work um it's kind of hard to
actually see how their library work when
it has a sister or mother like
dependencies and they're like that
library actually the pan
you know I'm saying yeah I mean that's
that's one of the problems with
JavaScript right now this you use one
library I don't even think people even
look into the project folders when you
even when you do the web developer
starter kit right
every project out there has like 400
megabytes of of files 500 megabytes 600
megabytes of files any time that you you
do a NPM install and that's because
every library is depending on like
30,000 different things you know that
shooting need you didn't need to have
all those different dependencies but
because that one library that you're
trying to use has all of those as
dependencies now you're downloading all
of that right yeah I definitely
understand what you say to me I mean
that's one of the things that don't like
about JavaScript rent right now is like
and that's why I try to tell people to
use PMPM cuz BPM what it does instead of
installing everything on that folder
what it does installs it globally so
like let's say if you if you restore
react right you install it one time and
every time that you use react you're
using it from the global location you're
not using it from your local folder so
it saves you that space on your computer
pretty good well you may not I think I'm
about to start heading out guys I
actually gotta go to the gym I just
remember this for a year to five thirty
years by 5 1 a.m. over here break and
pop a bit listen guys for those of you
guys don't want to learn no GS go to my
website kobi5.com I'm teaching you guys
everything that you're gonna need guys
trust what stuff is personal choices
it's not me saying hey I want to take
the easy route I'm gonna teach you guys
the easy things it's not me coming in
and showing you guys something that is
gonna be like oh you know popular on the
Internet
no I'm teaching you things day
you're gonna need on your job and that's
it you know I'm not teaching you guys
anything besides that I'm not teaching
you guys you know everybody here knows I
love crystal right I love crystal Ling
that's my favorite language right now do
I have a course on crystal night no do I
try to force it down your throat
no do I come in and make 30,000 videos
on that no I don't write what I do here
is just literally come in and tell you
the things that you need now what I need
what I need to do is to make no js'
videos all the time what I need to do is
make huge yes videos all the time what I
need to do is talk about bootstrap all
the time that will get me views and that
will get me subscribers but when I do
you know what I mean what I do is just
give you what you guys need now what I
want you know so unfortunately I just
want people to get jobs and don't waste
time man if you can come in and start
working in two to three months and do
exactly if you do everything that I'm
telling you he's gonna be fine people
hit me up all the time Joe I just got a
job thank you the people that don't say
Joe I think I didn't get a job is
because those people are doing other
things they jump into frameworks they
following what I was trending guys
whatever's trending doesn't equate to
jobs whatever is popular online doesn't
equate to hey I'm gonna get a job
guaranteed the things that I tell you
here are gonna guarantee that you're
gonna get a job
nothing listen to me if you want to if
you don't Haberer what do you want one
last question real quick what do you
recommend all people who ain't looking
for a job like oh you know what I mean
like I'm not gonna find a job in the
States right from China you feel me or
from here so like what do you recommend
on like just trying to set up your own
things out here right now
I mean what you could do is try to get
some remote work I mean or not not
remote work I'm just saying like like
setting up your own little things like
what you was talking about like you get
money on Adsense and other things
besides assets you know what I mean
like I said what you have to do is you
gotta do research on things that you
like right you gotta find the data let's
say you like I don't know you like Honda
Civics let's say an example right so oh
well I think that people that love Honda
Civics need right they need to find out
where to find it the parts for cheap you
could literally connect to an API to
eBay and create a website called a Honda
Civic parts for cheap dot-com right you
connect to eBay now through an API now
you show them all the different products
there that are cheap for them whatever
they might need right
you have advertised in there and you
have you probably get like an affiliate
link from eBay so now every time that
they buy those products from there you
make money out of that you get what I'm
saying so those are the things that you
gotta look into you gotta find something
that that you're interested no ohsho
right on Berk alright so anyways guys
you already know Superboy job back at it
again coding phase comm listen we here
on Tuesdays 3 p.m. we're here on
Thursdays 9 p.m. if you can't make it to
the live stream then make it to the next
one it's ok I'm gonna see you guys later
and by the way make sure you subscribe
make sure you like this video go to my
website : face car give it a try trust
me guys everybody has been there either
they've been getting jobs or they have
improved dramatically on their coding
and whatever they're working on and
that's the truth that's the honest truth
people can leave comments here people
who have been on a website for the past
2 or 3 months they could basically a
test to that so anyways I'll see you
guys later your boy joke back at it
again coding phase calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
