at it again man coding face.com your
boys backing out and did it again listen
guys this this isn't an amazing message
this is an amazing question that this
kid sent me basically says hello Joe
I've got a question which I like to have
I like your advice on I started as a
junior web developer in January but have
been doing nothing but SEO since we
didn't have any deaf job right
due to this I forgot most of the things
I learned right but now my boss wants
someone to make an invoice for our
business which also has a PayPal or
stripe payment request
I just restarted web development working
through you know thr timeline I don't
know what that me Oh working through the
timeline now on your site should I jump
to PHP in my sequel and try to make this
invoice for my boss so I can do what
development won't stick to the timeline
and learn everything hmm
all right so I'm gonna be completely
honest you know don't be mad at me but I
really think that people do this all the
time you know sometimes you get higher
in a company as a junior developer and
next thing you know they want you to
upload products or they want you to you
know write some descriptions so now for
the next two three months all you've
been doing is just stuff that has
nothing to do with web development this
happens all the time guys when you get
hired as a junior developer you pretty
much you just like an extra hand for
like you know data entry in and
everything a lot of times it happens
like that now every single time you're
going to be able to be coding all right
so what happens here right what was my
thoughts on this I think you should have
been practicing all the time even after
you you you know you finish working
you finish all coming out of your job
you have to continue work and you have
to continue taking courses online you
have to continue practicing even if you
got the job because situations like this
is gonna happen at some point they're
gonna ask you all can you build this and
then you haven't done with web
development in months you know so it's
like now you is like in reality it's
like a this thing let me put it like
this it's like when you ride a bicycle
right you always gonna know how to ride
the bike but if you have a rode a bike
in three years that first time that
you're getting on you might fall off and
you might hit your head break on art
because your your body and your mind is
not used to it you haven't done it so
long that how you say you forgot a lot
of things right so this is a warning to
everybody guys you have to practice like
I do this all the time when I was
working full time I will come home learn
a whole bunch of stuff learn golang
learn oh you know c-sharp
learn stuff like you know more advanced
JavaScript where events react like I was
still learning and I continue to learn
every single day even now that I'm doing
you two full time I take two hours of
the day so basically do research find
out what's out there create small
projects for myself
so basically stimulate my mind and
continue doing this now for this kid
what I will say is you have to ask
yourself at what level you have Rainer
all right
you work there so you have to build this
this invoice no matter what because
that's the job so you just got to figure
it out
now you coming to my website what
exactly is that you need to do you need
to ask yourself at what level I am do I
need to go back and learn HTML CSS from
the beginning then if you do that you
have to do that because how can you
build a page without knowing HTML and
CSS how or you forgot when down on that
you know that you forgot how how
breakdown a layout or whatever right you
have to go back and revising a lot of
those things you're gonna just is gonna
come up to your head oh yeah I remember
how to do this thing you just skip to
the next one just scheme through the
whole course and then jump on to you
know PHP in my sequel right on my
description I have a course that is
directly for PHP in my sequel on my
website I have basically a beginners
tutorial for the laravel I'm still
building that course so it's not
complete I'm doing that now especially
now that I'm here full time so I'm
knocking that out as soon as possible
but what I will say to you is you should
do something like this issue either just
accessible by what level you at you know
what I mean like if you really do not
remember anything then you have to start
from the beginning and I would say hey
man don't even try to take the the
project on yourself like if there's
another developer pass it on to the
other person if you really think that
you're gonna have to start from the
beginning because it's gonna be number
one embarrassing when you know you're
your boss comes to you but I oh hey John
can can you finish this often and then
you're building it and you're like you
just don't know what to do right don't
embarrass it so right now if you have
some type of knowledge of web
development you remember some of the
things then go ahead take my my course
that I have on sass like a pro that's
aside from Larry like a pro which should
be here somewhere on my website and
pretty much just take that that's gonna
give you the basics of larva basically
rewrite update delete all you need to
basically create any type of invoice you
know and at the same time you're gonna
have to look into api's you know there's
a lot of things that come with it it's
like databases all right connect into
the API of stripe or paper
like there's so many different small
skills that you need to build this
project that you jumping in and not
knowing or remembering anything is
really gonna be bad you know I want to
be positive he's just
if sucks it feels like you was there you
got hired they put you to do stuff that
wasn't dealing with web development and
then now they want you to do something
but it's like you haven't practiced on
your own time you know what I mean it's
like in one sense is there for because
they they hire you as a junior developer
but then do they have you doing web
development but then at the same time
it's also your fault because if you if
you're not expert at your junior
developer and you're not an expert and
they hire you and you know that you're
not an expert expert somebody who knows
this like the back of the hand because
right now I could do I could forget to
do web development for you know a year I
don't have to do what development for a
year but I'm an expert on a lot of
things so it's like when I come back I
know all these things when you're a
junior developer you need to do a lot of
projects to have that in your head
engraved in there you can't just leave
it on longer but I hey I'm just gonna
disappear for two three months and then
come back in it's gonna be hard it's
gonna be like you started from scratch
so you know it sucks I will say man if
there's somebody else in there get them
to do it or else look look online maybe
like you know WordPress there might be
like a WordPress theme out there for for
that or something already pre-built
where you could go in there and and just
edit it you know it sucks for me to tell
you that because it's like man you know
it's like I want you to go in there
heart hardened and just you know get the
project done but it's like if you're
telling me like you don't know where
you're gonna start if you should go -
back to the timeline it's like that
means you forgot a lot of things you
know what I mean so I wish
but at best man that sucks I know that
definitely sucks to be in that position
I just wish that you wouldn't never stop
learning online and continue making
projects on your own even if you have a
job it doesn't matter this web
development is not something that is
like a job guys it's not something like
hey I learned JavaScript and I learned
HTML CSS and I learned PHP I got a job
that's it I stopped learning I stopped
practicing at home no this is something
that you gotta love and you gotta
continue doing it right and it really
sucks that maybe you have other things
in your life maybe you you basically
you're like oh man I'm already doing
enough work even though work is not
related to web development and then you
just drop the ball you know what I mean
like I'm sorry I wish you nothing but
the best and just keep me updated I want
to know what happens you know and and
probably the people here they want to
know exactly what happens - with this
project just keep us updated let me know
you know if anything email me if I can
help you with anything I'll help you out
and try to guide you to the right places
but yeah man you're already a nice it

there's a kid from a dealer who really
needs to code and now I'm giving it to
you and you like you know you live in
California and you're chilling you're
like man I'm just I'm just not trying to
pay $5.00 you know like don't do that

Czechoslovakia something like that I
said you know what you know this can't
feel bad for this King whatever I send
