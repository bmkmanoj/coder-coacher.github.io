again man coding face comm your boy is
back and I didn't did it again alright
this is just the web developers lunch
break I don't even know what's today's
topic you know for this lunch break it's
just we out here with chillin man no I
don't know man
somebody sent me a question today
earlier and there was something like you
know they're pretty much stuck with CSS
for some reason people find CSS to be so
difficult I don't understand why I
really wish you guys would take the time
check out my website and basically build
learn HTML CSS of course that I have
there
because in reality I basically put
everything that you need you know
there's a million things that you can go
into detail with CSS but in reality you
don't need it you only need those all
those things in special occasions right
all you really need to know is how to
change the background how to change the
font size how to change the wave the
height positioning also displayed is
there gonna be display:block
display:inline-block those are the only
things that you really need to know
right now when it comes to responsive
design you can do everything with just
hey coders like percentages you don't
have to go fancy and become a flex bag
store is a flexbox master or freaking
CSS grid specialists like you don't need
no - guys that's like sugarcoating
something that you don't need to be
honest with you guys
you don't need none of that stuff so
create your layouts and there's gonna be
occasions where people will prefer that
you don't use what all you know flex
boxes and CSS great depending on the
team so I know a lot of people been
relying on those things that like man we
gotta do it to flex boxes with this and
now that guys I'm not against flex boxes
the thing is that you guys are focusing
on something
that you can pretty much do it with just
regular CSS right it's like you tryna
run before you crawl right you don't
understand
regular CSS but yet you want to jump to
flex boxes you get what I'm saying like
you gotta first understand the basics
and be able to create any any layout
that I give you or any layout that any
employer might give you with just
regular CSS guys stop trying to run
before you crawl man I give yourself
that time so to learn all this stuff
learn all the concepts and also to is
about practice you know you can't
compare yourself to somebody who does
coding like you know builds layouts
every day eight to ten thirteen hours a
day if you're only doing it one hour a
day two hours a day it's gonna take you
some time so you gotta understand it all
right so give yourself that time it's
like hey man you can't you can't
freaking fast forward to like the whole
process it's something like the real
casa de Oro it says like trusting the
process believe in the process like you
can't go against that you just gotta
wait you know you gotta win it out and
just relax just you're gonna get it
trust me it's not that difficult at all
at first and you had you're thinking
like oh man CSS is it's difficult
setting up a layout start small you
don't have to create a complex design
start building things start simple start
building things that are small and also
- one thing that I noticed from people
is they don't understand how HTML works
you know it's like they really don't
understand it they look at it and then I
oh yeah maybe it works like this if I
put in a a div tag and I put an h1
inside of it that's it it does
each one is out of the day but let's say
for example let's say you wanted to
create a menu right they drop down menu
how would you make that how will you
make that happen right there's a whole
bunch of little CSS tricks that you can
do that with right you let's say an
example you want to hover alright so you
could put in you can put in let's say a
div right and then a side of that if you
create a ul right that has your list of
the menus and then also inside of that
that if you create a a span which is
called the title whatever you call it
whatever class you want and then let's
say you have the title okay so think
about it like this you have your you div
your title inside of it and then also
inside of that same diff you have your
UL with a list of menus how will you
make that become a drop-down how will
you do that the way I would do is very
simple our basically I will keep it
there then I will say position:relative
or on the DEF and then on the UL I will
say position:absolute so what does that
mean that means that the Dave well the
UL is inside of the div right and it's
relative to that that space the space of
the dev so it's not looking at the
windows is not looking at the layout is
looking at just that little space of
that div so you will say okay this div
is a whiff of a hundred and a height of
60 right so now it's just like that now
you say to the UL you say hey basically
this is going to be position:absolute
and this let's say bottom zero why would
that do that will basically bring
the freakin UL to go under the DIF the
main div so now what you will do is do a
little CSS trick you will say
display:none you will say display:none
on the UL and then when you hover on top
of the div you will say display:block on
the UL what does that do when you go on
top of the div it will display the many
basically you drop down menu that simple
it's like I know it's hard to say right
and not being able to show it to you
guys through here but the whole point of
this is that to explain to use ik if you
don't want to say how HTML works how can
you understand CSS alright if you don't
understand how you know the splay block
works and how can you go in there and
try to build the pages like you're
worrying about man I'm trying to make
this working and if flex box is like if
you can't make it in flex box use
regular CSS if you can't make in CSS
we're going to CSS that means you don't
know what the hell are you doing you
need to go back to the drawing boards
you need to understand that you gotta do
more projects I have to learn HTML CSS
the one with the social media I have to
one that is building a Netflix I have to
one that is building an Instagram guys
nobody here is special nobody here is
smarter than the other person pretty
much take your time it is not gonna hurt
you
this is a thing look I'm looking at 84
music right he's always here right and I
look at his Instagram and he's pretty
much I would say he's like somewhat
mid-level already like he's doing pretty
good but yeah he takes the time to do
the learn HTML CSS he don't have to do
that he already knows those things he
don't have to do that at all but why
does he do it
because he wants to perfect it the
certain things that I teaching on every
course every video that even though
you've seen it in the cold steel course
like HTML CSS you went through the whole
course or you learned it in team tree
house or you learned it in and coke atom
E or you learned it from another
youtuber there's certain things that I
teach in every single video so even
though you like oh yeah I'm past
html/css no you're not
don't think like that continue building
stuff so it's like if I come in and I
create something for you of course do it
even though you already took HTML CSS
before because the certain tricks that I
do that you don't know because I have
the experience so I'm giving it to you
guys you know what I mean so you know
you sent me this question like how can I
help you with CSS and you know I want to
help you but you have to go in and do
those projects if you don't do those
projects and you try to jump onto
something like flex boxes or CSS grid
it's like bro you don't need that
that's like synthetic I go to a
synthetic sugar or some like that I
forgot the name of it it's like you
don't need it
sake is there it's like supposed to make
your life easier
just like bootstrapping and everything
else but if you don't know how to do it
with regular CSS how are you going to do
it with Flex boxes and CSS grid those
are more advanced things into CSS guys
also - when I do a tutorial in in sass
guys sass and CSS is the same thing if I
put something inside like let's say I
create a class and then inside of that
class I nest meaning I put another class
inside of it what does that mean in CSS
that means that you know that class
space that class in regular CSS that's
all it really means for me is easier
to have it like that and have an ST
because then I don't have to keep on
writing the same classes over and over
so like let's say if I have a couple of
a couple of elements of CSS like let's
say I have a div sorry my fault let's
say I have a CSS I'm dying here is that
let's have a CSS
that has
oh I'm freakin literally dying right now
feel like I just got out of air sorry
yeah so if you have a different and you
have four h1 and h2 inside of it and
regular CSS if another you know what's
another CSS regular CSS you will do
something like you will say div and then
from there you say space h1 and then
create your properties and then you say
div and then you say h3 and create your
properties right but now you keep on
writing div constantly why would you do
that when you could do it with sass what
you would say you declared this one time
and then every time that you want to say
the element is inside of div just put it
that's the inside of it all right so
that's why I do it with sighs man you
know even here on youtube I think I'm
gonna have to create a SAS like crash
course or something real quick just for
for a lot of you guys to really
understand this little simple concepts
but yeah man
check out the learner you know learn
HTML CSS course that I have
you know building a social network right
check that out because I built
everything with just regular CSS like it
took it took me forever I feel like it
took me forever because writing things
in just regular CSS is it takes longer
than they doing it with sass alright so
yeah man I'm trying to help you guys out
man but you also got to help yourself
out you got a practice and you got to
build things and like man go to my
