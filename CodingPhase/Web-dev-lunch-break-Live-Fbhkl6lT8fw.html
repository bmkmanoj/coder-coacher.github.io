are watching this right now you need to
go subscribe to Lottie now you might see
videos that you might think oh why do I
care soundproofing well you never know
you might be able to become a
concentrator later on right you might be
creating your own tutorial see my
community you're all your own content in
the future so you need all of this
knowledge right just because you are a
web developer doesn't mean that you have
to be in this little box right
the guys are successful as web
developers entrepreneurs other guys that
have knowledge of everything right it's
not just one thing you never want to
just be good in one field right you want
to be able to know now be an expert on
everything under the Sun cuz you just
can't right you got focus on one thing
but you have to have the knowledge and
being able to to know what's going on
out there right you know if you're gonna
create a website how you gonna monetize
it if you don't know how to how to get
Google Adsense right a lot of people
come to me asking me about that I say
man how do you get approved for boo
assholes how do you get money from
when you create a micro service like
those are the things that I'm talking
about in Lodi right
I'm dropping a couple of cool stuff
there man and like always I'm always
gonna come here we're gonna talk about
what this got a man about programming
and we're gonna continue dropping
courses on my website yesterday I
dropped I think about six new videos for
the social media website which is
teaching you guys how to how to
basically use no Jes to build a social
media site we did user authentication we
did user post now we're we're basically
setting up user followers and also
following other users you know all the
basic stuff that a social network hi now
you might be thinking cool like like
this is such a little course guys this
is like a real project you know what I
mean like this is not you guys finding
like some little on YouTube a
little tutorials like hey man this how
you do a component and this doesn't that
not we're building a real website or a
real web application like we've
basically recreating faces from the
ground up I talked about it like this
but Facebook - to be where is that like
I needed a lot of developers right I'm
just one person so what I do is I drop
about maybe 10 10 15 videos per week all
the social media website basically but
it's such a big project man because you
know sometimes I feel like man maybe I
should take the wrong road of like how
most instructors do like they teach you
the bare minimum like the most basic
 lady like I feel somebody
somebody's course out there that it was
like I forgot I don't want to say the
name of the course but it was like so
bare minimum is like you're paying for
the
communication basically like people are
now holding your hands building a full
application so it's like when you go to
a job interview you know out writing
because it's like they show you just the
basics the same that is on the on
the stupid documentation and I'm yeah I
know it's taking I know for a fact you
look at me like when I create women's
courses it takes a lot things like you
know if it's like a full full of course
it takes like at least a month right but
you know people want to be knocking out
courses like you know one week one week
one course the next week the next course
what happens is that they're not giving
you the full experience of what a
developer is and and that's why I told
you guys coding phase comm is the only
place that I've seen so far that really
goes and builds full applications it's
not just like okay here's the one little
thing right yes we have a couple of
courses like learn HTML CSS which is
basics right you have to know the basics
so it's super easy but once we start
going you know you go past the future
proof JavaScript that's what we really
start like cranking in with the freaking
applications man look at the PHP course
that I really like we build like a full
application from the ground up i
teaching PHP the you know the syntax
then from there we talk about object
oriented programming with PHP then from
there we jump into creating a crud you
know a simple crowd with just raw PHP
which 99% of the time you're never gonna
have to do but we did it just because
you need to know how how things work
under the hood right when you use a
framework like Merrill
you want to know exactly what's going on
you know yeah man but it's crazy I'm
like yo I'm doing a social network
website man and it's a lot of work I
feel I feel like I'm at work you say
like we went bumping into bugs we we
fixing the bugs we fixing the bugs from
the front end and we fixing the bugs
from the back end and I guess a real
application it's not no babysitting it's
not let's do another to-do app now we're
really building a full application like
once you you see this course you're
gonna really learn all the I was
like I don't know how I wish I could
like spread this out to the world I
don't even know how to do it like to be
honest with you like on the website the
constant dust is so good like I wish I
could tell more people about it but I
don't even know how to be honest with
you I don't even know how how to get
this out there because you know I mean
beyond the fact that you know your boy
never got no support
we never got no you know no real
collaboration like people that you could
really show be like oh man like there
were surplus to my mind my channel like
all right so all this stuff is from the
ground up
it's like most of the people that find
about coding friends comments by word of
mouth right or they bump into one of my
videos that YouTube don't show them you
know really somebody finds me and then
they can come in and go to the website
and then you know two three months later
they going when I kill I learned so much
 I've been trying to learn this
for eight nine months I learned that you
know I can't figure out this bug I'm
like boom
what have you been learning JavaScript
like how to help you don't know how to
debug an application you gotta say is
like people take courses and courses
just teach you the basics they teach you
the syntax but they don't teach you how
to become a web developer but it is what
it is man listen I know at some point
people was gonna find out about this you
know the ones that have been taking
advantage of code
please calm guys you guys are so much
ahead of a lot of people out there like
it's not even funny
like I get emails from people that
they're still wondering like oh should I
sign up for coding phase and then I look
at their portfolio and I look at their
work and I bro of course you need to you
need to sign out of coding phase calm
because you have nothing on your
portfolio that's meaningful you don't
have no experience you you don't have no
projects that you can show somebody and
be like oh I built this it's like you
have like a little thing connecting to
it those move database movie poster legs
bro
like this that is nothing a baby
can do that I feel bad sometimes
and I look I'm I'm being too hard on
people you guys let me know am I being
too hard on tv4 sons when I'm like just
being honest I feel like people won't
like how can I say this people want
something that would be like like I
don't know it's like here's a little
drink that will make you into a
developer in one day it's like nah it
takes time you know what I mean it's
like somebody sent me a message
yesterday about somebody and it was
talking about you know people are
talking about you know they could do it
in a month they could do in two months
they could do in three months they've
been doing for months and then you find
out and do this out here my console
editors like that's not you know what I
mean like anybody say like this that's
not that's not something to be proud of
like I mean it gets you in the industry
right I guess you're in the industry but
it's not really what's the worst way
it's not it's not really like something
that you could be like man you know like
I'm working something super hard and you
know it's like no man like that's what
that type of job doesn't get paid as
much as the type of job that I've done
and they you get off selling you're not
on the standard advice
nobody's gonna pay you good money if
it's something that anybody can do right
so we come on web development so become
a successful developer somebody who's
making money out here you have to
actually go out of your way and go hard
like you can't expect it's like right
now right I could easily say hey I don't
got to become a medical assistant right
how long does it take to go to become a
medical assistant you go to a little
program which is like a boot camp for
like six to nine months right they
charge you like $20,000 right there's I
say you become a medical system so
you're pretty much doing the files and
you know welcoming people into a
doctor's office that's your job you're
not a nurse you're not nothing out here
you don't say like here like at the
bottom of the bottom of that industry
right so for you guys to get to the top
if you want to become a doctor
it takes time you gotta say sometimes I
see people that come even to my website
and they see you know of course might
take you 17 hours to complete right guys
how do you expect to get paid a lot of
money if you don't put it in that time
like seriously let's be honest right
like how do you expect to get paid like
a doctor if you don't put in as many
years as a doctor do in education you
gotta say like how are you gonna get
that level you can't expect the medical
assistants to be getting paid as the
doctor it's just not gonna happen
you got what I'm saying so it's up to
you guys to see what do you guys want to
do you know it's easy to get into the
the tech industry you could be customer
service if you want to right you could
be a marketing person like literally you
could get into marketing with no degree
with nothing
make about like 49 a year starting and
then actually continue to grow in the
company you could get up to 80 you know
right or even a hundred thousand gives
you really good right it's easy to get
take that route right but when you want
to become a developer you want to become
a programmer on the software either the
web by the gaming like it takes time you
get what I'm saying
it takes time this is not something that
you say hey I'm gonna do this in a week
no this is something that that you come
in and say okay you could do it in two
to three months but that's if you have
if you're like 100 percent in meaning
you're not working you're not hanging
out with your friends you're not
freaking uh you know shorty calls you up
so let's go to the club let's go to
starlets on Tuesday like nah I ain't
going to let started smart I ain't
throwing no money - no no BBS out here
you got what I'm saying I ain't throwing
money to the toddies right I'm not doing
that I'm in the crib I'm at coding
fees.com right now you gotta say I'm
doing this for two three months and
then we born out then we hang up
somebody could come in and say some
like that right but that's the
motivation that's what you guys should
be and be like yo if this guy could do
it why I can't do it you don't think
somebody left the comment three months
bootcamp then when I say man I told you
he said something like what was it he
said something like oh why you can't
understand that not everybody can do
about themselves
but the problem is that everybody can do
it by themselves like you don't need
somebody to hold your hand straight up
like you just don't need somebody to
hold your hand at all like let's be 100%
honest like why did I do it right and
how the hell did I get out you got hands
like most people will be like me
tell your developer you're a senior
developer like you should be working for
XYZ listen I went into the industry
my thing up there my time you gotta say
from there
now we entrepreneurs status right now
you gotta feel like I'm doing a lot of
things you know I got my website that's
popping I got now to YouTube that's
popping I got also a new started that
I'm blowing my boy drew I don't know if
you guys remember from a day in the life
of a remote developer he came in on a
farm real quick that's my partner
you gotta say we putting in some money
into this now it's not just it's not
just me it's both of us you gotta think
and we got somebody else another
developer that's helping out and then
from there I have like a million people
who hit me up all the time and I Joe we
want to be part of coding things oh we
want to answer for you Joe we want to
help you out
dah dah dah so pretty much - literally -
hi it's so crazy and that's all I'll
tell you guys like this should be a
motion for people like a lot of you guys
have even degrees you know from better
universities that means right
I know people in here who have business
business degree from you know X Y Z
University whatever right probably
better education than I have right if I
somehow lady what makes you different
you get what I'm saying like what makes
you different why you just can't do it
the same so it's like it's just putting
in the work guys you're gonna get all
that man you guys don't understand
that you know even for those of you guys
that stuff in the bottom right now and
you might be like man I'm 30 34 years
old man I don't know song I'm too late
to learn this nah
termination experiments from other
industry people think like just because
now you're switching to web development
like this is totally different like now
this is just logic like you have more
experiencing some kid who's 18 years old
this things that that they don't
understand that you understand
right you probably thirty four years old
you've worked in and in an accounting
firm you've worked in a retail store you
worked in a whole bunch of different
businesses your mind it's more elevated
than somebody who's 16 17 years old
don't think in your head like oh man
it's too late for me this isn't that
it's not too late for you you're coming
in with experience that most people wish
they had just because you're switching
careers doesn't mean that everything
that you learned gets thrown away you
gotta understand like it's not the same
thing
oh you're gonna be fine so anyways let
me see who's in here who's live you know
sorry came in Taming hype came in strong
today so let's see Freddy Martinez you
don't know Jes bounces hard Nunez

Kevin Davis Jenna create horn Lopez let
me see project Fox online let me see
what else Eric Russell Ramsay Jordan who
goes gobbling Louie's been to court
threat Barry thank you threat Barry
right Barry
yo official sponsor of coding fees.com
you know we bout the fight you know I'm
gonna create a section where it's gonna
be like you're the official sponsor the
guys we just currently show love it and
you know it is what it is let me see
let me see

other kid and us I'm talking about but
um yeah I don't know guys you know I
wish people want to like this thing
takes it takes time it's not like some
 you you wake up and be like okay
cool whatever I was like you know like
when I came in right when look I didn't
even put a modeling thing I didn't even
put in developer or engineer or nothing
also like my first my full first year
and after building like real complicated
 all right because I was always
scared there's the thing that I was
always scared right of people calling
you out on some shape like there's a
great now if I come in and be like yo
software developer and I'm like I've
never done a software
you got four legs no more so I was done
it's like dotnet you going on saying
like I'm not building software you don't
say like if I'm not gonna build building
software like I can't come in and be
like yo software developer
you know LinkedIn find me as I find me
in the software developer groups
you got my thing like I don't want those
guys to call me out on some I'm
gonna get bro you're not a software
developer like you're not doing this
like anything like you're not really
about this life you know so for me I
never even went out like I literally to
be honest like my first day I was like
putting straight up like well as a web
designer I mean that was my title and
the first year because I come from a
design background right I already had
the design background from going to
school for communication design so my
thing was designed web designer right I
didn't have what the fella brought huh
webmasters front-end engineer I'd have
known that the whole first year
because I was just like yo like I didn't
want to get cold out on died just
didn't know you get what I'm saying
so it is what it is well that's the type
of person that I am right there's like
look at this like it's weird I got into
this I'm I'm so crazy you know like now
that I think about it I'm so crazy with
it that I knew so much on my first
six months and I didn't go to a job
interview that's still bother so that's
about that's why I tell you guys like
y'all so long as you know the basics and
you start building projects from my
website or from wherever you decide to
build your projects like solid projects
I'm not talking about a
JavaScript watch like don't put
that on a portfolio that
 pisses me the off though I'm
sorry little person but it really does
piss me off
don't put some on your
portfolio and think you're gonna go to a
job
you're gonna get embarrassed guys right
so my whole first year I didn't even go
to no no job interview son like I didn't
go to no job into because I was trying
to master everything they got literally
are wearing in I freaking learned HTML
CSS in like a week a week or two right
CSS there were some things that were
kind of tricky you know like so like
certain selectors that were like a
little Fe specificity I was having some
issues with it the first two three weeks
I learned that shape after I learned
that then from there I focus a lot
on JavaScript then from there I learned
knockout then after learning knockout
learned backbone then after new backbone
I learned and you know then what else
definitely I learned Ember after
learning ember from there
that was almost at the end I was like
man I gotta figure it out because I
still didn't have no experience with the
backend so what I do was I took this
small tutorial that I found on a block
sometimes you find the best on a
block guys like sometimes you find like
yo you know how you doing Google a
little search like oh how to create how
to save data to a database right so I
found it a little blog and it was in PHP
so I did that and then I did it right
and whatever then that's how I practice
how to use Ajax because you can't go to
a job if you don't know how to use Ajax
right if you don't know how to send data
between the front end to the back end
you can't get a job late I mean some
people do get jobs but you're like so at
the bottom that like it's not even worth
it to even get that job you got a family
was already earning 41 to 45 thousand
dollars in my job at IT before
that right so I was like man if I'm
gonna get into this I'm
putting in all this time I need to get
you know 60 70 and up like I'm not gonna
 leave another career for the
same career or less money or
you know what I mean something that's
what it was so that whole first year it
was just me like going hard right you
know and to be honest I kind of regret
that because the idea that you're gonna
learn everything in one year it's not
possible like even after I learned so
much on my own when I got to the
job I realize I'm like wait I could have
learned all this while getting paid
you know what I'm saying like that's one
of the things where take my hats off to
Christian people talk about
Christian
but hey Sean pretty much I'm pretty
short like when Chris Sean went to a job
interview like he wasn't good like you I
can't imagine croissants
his first and his first level when he
first got his job so be like the type
you know expert developer right because
I three months coming from two tree
house you're gonna just know the basics
right like this is being honest you just
gonna know the basics right so I take my
hat off to him for having the courage
and going out there and getting a job
like me I've always had to stay in the
back of my head I'm like yo I just got a
call out on some that just don't
know right and sometimes you just gotta
take the risk you know you got take your
hat off to the kid like he went and
probably wasn't even good at the time
right in the beginning you're not
good three months I'm telling you out of
experience at 3 months you're not good
you're just like such a guinea level
like it's not even funny but he went out
there and got a job and started working
learned a lot of on the job while
getting paid you gotta say for me my
whole thing was not when I go to the job
interviews they got a freaking be like
killed this kid knows so much we wanted
to get you know get the highest hires or
you know freaking salary that we can
give him but it doesn't work like that
the way how it works is like you put in
the work you start at the bottom if I
got Hargitay right I went to
tumblr I went to Twitter both for them
denying me right because I just wasn't
ready the level that the interview that
I went to we're more senior and you know
how I always thought you just go to the
interview I was going for senior
interviews like on my first job like
senior level of developers like you've
seen in front-end engineer at Twitter
senior front-end engineer at tumblr
those are the jobs that I was going to
but first who jobs my first two
interviews I didn't get it how do you
get the job here so then but one thing
that I do tell you is every single
interview I learned so much I learned
from shakedowns like men I don't know
these things I didn't know this concepts
I didn't know that I have to remember a
whole bunch of words making me you know
like I learn JavaScript raw meaning I
just learned it I didn't know none of
the freaking words for me you know
lexical scope I didn't know you know
even methods to me metrics are just
functions right that's how I was looking
at it so even the guy was asking some
questions like you know I was like you
know what's that metadata what matters
can you describe that I in my head cuz I
was like so wrong I learned at home with
nobody explaining to me
right I didn't even know no other words
guys they always done other hosting data
like I know how JavaScript works but I
know the words right so when you go to
this company they ask you for a whole
bunch of shape that you just gotta
remember the words right you know the
concepts you just if you don't study the
the wording for it you're gonna feel
you're not gonna get the job right so
those are the things that I know from
those two job interviews and the fact
that I was going to senior level
right like they were asking me about
what was in my Seco and Maria de Ven and
how to do a query that is more efficient
than you know doing a regular select oh
oh and this is nothing at the time I was
all I know is the front end I know every
so framework that's out there I know
every single thing that you could throw
at me right you want something bill I
can build it
yeah big word alert big word alert like
if you don't know them shits man you're
gonna make it to those companies right
and that's what happens to me but I tell
you guys like so hard get hired and yeah
that was my first year man you know and
then I got a BS job man got a beard up a
 job got a job in an
e-commerce company and I was there for
three months maybe two two months and a
half all right I was in there literally
getting 13,000 our slaves were way less
than what I was making already as an IT
but the reason why I took that job was
because number one I was interested on
eBay I was interested on Amazon I was
interesting on on basically making money
online so it was like a mixture of like
okay if I going to this company I can
learn how ecommerce works how do they
begin to wholesalers and all that I
learned it those are the things that I'm
I'm sharing or naughty right everything
that I'm learning I'm sorry it's from
literally from different jobs that I've
been through in my life and and
different things and different mistakes
that I've made like when I teach you
something and literally I'm teaching you
from a mistake that I already made and I
follow the answer and then from there I
come in and show it to you but but yeah
freaking oh yes so whatever got a
 $13 an hour's once and a half
later I was out of there I said yo I'm
super fearfully shame working for $13 an
hour works like you know what I mean and
that position was what was they was the
official title of it it was like product
product something
I can't remember I don't bother
producing products editor it was
functional right and that was my first
job just to get into the industry got my
feet wet got the up out of this you
know I got the hell out of there and
literally I never looked back you know
cuz I really prepare myself my
god I was meant to become a web
developer I wasn't meant to become some
other you know what I'm saying like
I'm not I wasn't meant to be out here
bringing coffee to people you gotta say
like when you started those little jobs
at the bottom you can't stay there more
than a month two months man those jobs
are not meant for you
those jobs are left for people are you
know they they're looking to be you know
passing coffees like he-man you you need
something from Starbucks okay I thought
you I'll bring you coffee like those are
the type of people that need to be
working on that if your your head is in
another level you like marijuana becomes
developer I want to get money I'm gonna
do my thing out here like you can't stop
there you you gotta continue growing
that's what you you can never I seen
somebody talking like one of my friends
right one of my friends that I know him
I'm having a meet-up right and me and
him were almost at the same level when
we started back in 2012-2013
but he got a job at a hospital right he
got a job at a hospital and basically
what he did was like very like
programming with HTML CSS and I think he
got hired for $50,000 right mind you he
got hired for $50,000 I was working for
$13 an hour all right I wasn't even
salary I wasn't nothing so for him he
was like oh man it's like I'm doing
really good it's like I'm getting for
$2,000 oh yeah man I was like I told him
straight out that broke don't stay there
for too long don't get too comfortable
and you know it's like you know
shrieking you work there and then keep
moving every year you know what he's not
right now
he's probably making like $55,000 fifty
five thousand sixteen fifty five fifty
six thousand dollars he's still in the
 same place I checked off his
Lincoln having nothing insane maybe you
watched it all right don't get mad at me
bro but you up but he's still at
the same place same freaking hospital
and I'm like bro when you what developer
when you a programmer were you up
engineer when you somebody a cold you
don't stay in the same spot you keep
growing
you gotta stay awake and it was funny to
me is like you know when I told him at
that time I was like oh you didn't say
yeah I'm learning $13 an hour and you
know that's the first job it's just for
for me to get my feet wet and I liked
the environment because of the
e-commerce and you know I could listen
to music while working this is not the
guy who is like oh oh that kind of sucks
man I'm earning $50,000 right now Mount
Sinai Hospital I'm like deep down inside
I'm like this guy's making way more
money than me and he probably you know I
was like did I up did I take the
wrong job that I do you know cuz you
start questioning yourself you start
thinking that I do the right decision I
think the right decision you know but
man I was out of there in two months I
got the extremely needed the next job I
got 65
you
what Yogesh you for whatever reason
 is crazy
don't give up guys stop late so I'm like
you know thinking you know you're not
gonna be able to make it man
like it's just a process man it's a
freaking process left you know you
cannot you cannot keep thinking like oh
oh this is gonna happen from one day to
another it takes time and while it takes
time don't be afraid to go in there and
even take a job that's paying less than
what you're making because sometimes you
just need to experience sometimes you
just need that stamp you know like
somebody else with the knowledge that I
had in that first year would have never
taking that job that I took right they
would have never taken that job that I
took alright but the reason why I got
the next job was because I had ecommerce
experience
mind you I'm coming from learning
everything in my own house you know
going through every
website online so for me to get
experience ecommerce experience I needed
to go to an e-commerce so the only way
that that I was gonna get the next job
was if you have any type of e-commerce
experience cuz it's like yeah you could
code yeah you know HTML CSS but there's
certain jobs that they just be like hey
man when trying to not trying to train
you on how ecommerce works we're not
trying to train you on how wholesaling
works we're not trying to train you on
how thick is right
so because the the previous job that was
paying $13 an hour already gave me the
experience and the exposure that I
needed the next job gave me the
opportunity is okay he already knows how
ecommerce works so here you go the other
thing
I'll read over in the comments just one
