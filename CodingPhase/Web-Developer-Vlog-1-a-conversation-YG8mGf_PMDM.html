phase of log whoa something new for the
channel wait what what's going on hey I
hope you guys enjoyed this video that
you're about to see now just make sure
that you subscribe and click on the
little Bell because that's the only way
to get notifications
whoa okay guys we here man I'm in a
parking lot Planet Fitness and this is
why we do it man so yeah somehow we're
doing vlogs and we're doing
conversations you know this is stuff
that I've been doing since the beginning
of time I kind of let it go for a while
but now I'm gonna start bringing this up
I'm about to start doing some vlogs for
the channel I'm about to start doing
some content that it's not just only
coding you know I've been trying to
bring it into you guys
slowly but surely through the live
streams for I don't know past whole year
but I really think a lot of people are
gonna enjoy the new videos aren't
dropping
it's more of a channel like it's more of
like a complete channel it's not just
only about code 24/7 which is what I've
been doing since the beginning of time
point it out but now you know I want to
ask some stuff you know like little loaf
logs like what do I do when I go out
with the family when I go to the beach
when I go hang out when when I chill
with my friends like those are the
things that make a channel interesting
you know we can talk about code 24/7
that's always gonna be there but there's
also going to be some content that you
know it just gives you the human touch
okay I think that's why people
constantly come back to my channel
hey Joe we want to know what the hell
you doing we don't know we want to know
like what's the drama face you know when
Joe goes through his phases you know
it's like even at that guys like that's
just being a human being you get what
I'm saying like this days are good days
are bad they start amazing you get what
I'm saying so you gotta take it with a
grain of salt all right but let's talk
about this so I was watching I think who
was it the Franco show I was watching
one of his videos today and he was
talking about you
release this video that explains how
notifications work so now we know now we
know what's going on now you know it's
popping all right so what's popping in
the world of YouTube is that pretty much
if you subscribe to a channel you gotta
make sure you click the little bell and
cool you click the little bell but not
just a little bell you gotta be active
right if let's say something that a lot
of people are here like I can say 90% of
you guys are guilty of all right because
it's kind of my fault too I never tell
people I hate guys make sure you you
leave a comment make sure you leave a
like make sure you you are you know tell
me what you think about this make sure
you you answer my question or you make
sure you you freakin whatever it is I
have never been Internet but now we're
gonna have to do it because no matter
what you do we try to win man
and all I do is win in this world so we
definitely not gonna take this out
before from YouTube right so basically
what they say hey for you to be able to
see somebody's channel on your feed on
your notifications you need to click the
bell right if you don't click the belt
you never see this channel also if you
don't leave for comments and you don't
leave a like which like I said most
people are guilty of you know sometimes
we we have conversation people love the
videos you know people come in in and
out out of the live streams you know I
mean they come in they chill they hang
out for an hour two hours and at the end
of the day don't even leave one like
don't even leave one comment what do
they think about the live stream what do
they think about what we talked about
guys we have to make this a community
where we're active no longer can we have
ghosts no longer can we have people that
just you know come in
take the content and and leave right
this is free content guys only thing I
ask for is just leave a comment and
leave a like that's it it's not that
difficult not that hard it's free thank
you know when I like a video I always
leave a like right now knowing how
YouTube works nowadays I'm also going to
leave a comment even if it's just the
letter J or say hey cool video or
something right just because that's how
you to work so now it's not fair for
people that are dropping amazing content
and not being able to be found or not
being able to get the same love myself
channels because we just don't beg for
like singing in comments we just focus
on the content so unfortunately we're
gonna have to do this but hey is YouTube
right last year some people had some
issues with what was it that
yeah they had issues with apocalypse and
for me I mean I wasn't hurt because I've
never looked at YouTube like hey the
more views I get the more money that I'm
gonna make like I've never really looked
at it like that but for people that were
actually looking at YouTube that way you
know they don't stop half of their whole
income so if you quit your job and
you're thinking you're gonna do YouTube
this is not the place alright alright
but yeah so right now I'm about to go
work out a little bit I hope you guys
enjoyed this this little content we're
gonna continue it's okay on my way back
home and yeah I'll see you guys later
whoa now I'm back yeah I'll be home be
come on we home kids
so yeah I'm just here answering you know
comics and whatever people hitting me up
for let's go see some a little something
it's too much like coming here right
bring them that I so I love it comments
comments and I'm just answering
everything like always know what people
are saying you don't just assume that
like I'm trying I'm trying to answer it
trust me it's just there's a lot of work
there's a lot of people backed me up
you know I'm really glad people like
this last video that I did where I'm

type of applications that you want me to
