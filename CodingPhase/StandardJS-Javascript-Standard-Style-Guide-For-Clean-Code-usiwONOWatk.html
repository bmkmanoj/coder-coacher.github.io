again man : face.com make sure you
subscribe make sure you like this video
man it's your boy bow we gotta talk
about the javascript standard style
right so this is a style guy that pretty
much people are finding out about it now
if you guys have a fun after body that's
why you're here because your boy got you
listen all right so what exactly is it
it's just a way to code your JavaScript
there's a way to organize in JavaScript
there's a way to basically have the same
style as everybody in the team right so
where does this come in to the picture
of when is it a good idea to use the
JavaScript and a style guide right it's
a good idea when you're working on a
team well even when you working by
yourself whenever you want your code to
actually look clean to look a certain
way how certain standard and something
that you could be proud of you know
that's why I use it that's why I'm
constantly promoting this thing because
it's pretty legit and not only that when
I first found out about the JavaScript
standard style guide there was like
literally 40 stars on it don't kill
almost nobody nobody and then you know
me I'm constantly looking for the new
projects constantly looking to see what
cool things are out there and you know
everybody was talking about the Airbnb
style guideline right it was cool and
it's still good a lot of people use it
but it gives you the options to turn off
rules it gives you the options to ignore
things so like let's say somebody in
your team wants to code a certain way
and they're like you know what matter of
fact I wanna have double quotes for
strings right yeah you could go ahead
and do that and you could ignore the
rules but in the JavaScript standard you
can't do that it's basically everybody
has a certain standard that they gotta
follow either for spacing for indenting
meaning two spaces for their indents
it's like it just basic
he controls the way how people code
because if we don't control how people
code this is gotta be the Wild West
especially when you know everybody's
like okay I want to use es6 or I want to
use es5 and I want to go use this this
and that I want to use typescript and a
whole bunch of things in one project
then it becomes like you know the wild
wild west and becomes really chaotic and
it's not working right all right so what
you guys probably like okay who help
what the hell uses it right so most
people they they judge a project by who
actually uses it so I'm gonna tell you
right now the people actually code like
this with the standard NPM github up
beat me brave Zendesk MongoDB type form
let me see who else is in here the
people who created Adam the people who
created Express nodejs guys come on you
know so I say it's pretty out there
a lot of people are using the standard
so I would say guys if you wanna be you
know a little edgy wanna be out here and
be like hey guys I'm one of the first
blueness well you guys gotta jump on it
now not later now in a little while I
will say you jump on it now because it
just makes your code look cleaner and
not only not that's more organized
anybody that you come in and you say hey
look at my code now you're cold
basically with the es lint and the
linter through a Dom which I will be
doing a tutorial on this basically it
just makes you cold or cleaner and
anybody that's gonna read it to actually
follow what you're doing
plus they're gonna be familiar with it
because it's a standard people are just
taking this s to standard for JavaScript
you know a lot of people just gonna hate
on there because you don't need to put a
semicolon at the end all those the
people that are hating on it they're
pretty old alright so don't tell them up
don't tell them I told you that right so
but that's what that's
guys it's like you know the Oh heads
those guys has been around for ten years
doing oh my god
I've been going like this for ten years
and oh my god then you really don't push
that one call it oh yeah
there's no semicolon on it all right so
a lot of people's gonna hate on it but
this is the future guys you know don't
worry about the Oh heads don't worry
about those weirdos man we out here man
we couldn't come out here and basically
ransack the industry everybody's using
it already so make sure you get on it
