know simple job back at it again live
from the house what developers lunch
break getting things ready baby crying
it's the life of a developer nowadays
you know I think this is cool because
people got to see this you know the in
and outs you got to see this from how it
has to become a developer how to
basically see parts of my life how
things have changed and how how you know
how just change the family got the
little baby out here big I have to go
outside because we're about to burn so I
just left it here got the baby in the
cut coming out Cyril quick what
developers lunch free man and the crib
man
I'm gonna show you guys what's too late
today's special is not it's not a little
turkey you know a lot of people be like
man Joel stay on eating turkey right
today that's what we're doing man what
developers lunch break man you know you
guys don't know I like my food almost
burnt like it real dark like it's dark
just like my thoughts black I'm Joe
Oh
but that's what we're doing today
got that stakeout got a little pork loin
on the side I'm gonna have some some
corn you know real soul food man I keep
it so full man
know what I mean keep my food nice let
me see if I bring this down a little bit
let me talk to you guys for a little bit
so we out here in the yard there's a
little sign let me go a little bit under
the shade just so we go have a normal
conversation see what's poppin for today
y'all let me know the joke it was a bite
yeah man I would you know just a little
sunny oh man
 clean this yard up finally she
looking it looks teasing now it looks
like it's the side of the man Long
Island living that life can't wait so
you know you know I get back to my
coding days I'm gonna be working on this
JavaScript course I just finished the
HTML course HTML CSS all right so that's
done and today I'm just writing writing
down the curriculum for the new course
that I'm doing on JavaScript where I'm
basically teaching people how to code
JavaScript but with real examples you
know real life shape examples that
anybody can understand because sometimes
you know somebody tells you hey it's a
loop but why do you need to learn a loop
what the hell is a variable what the
hell's our effing else statement what
the hell is a switch statement when do
you use it
when is the right moment to use it right
so that's how I'm teaching it just
keeping it funky you know keeping a nice
teaching in a whole different way
without you know copying anybody style
or without you know teaching it without
having to go into somebody else's course
you know what I mean something it's cool
that's what we're working on today
working on that curriculum and then from
there I'm gonna record the videos
throughout the the night time maybe I'll
stay up all night try to knock this out
well maybe I'll do it tomorrow morning
early in the morning real early in the
morning all right
yes sir gas grills are the best telling
ya missing
so who's in here now man let's see
what's actually in hey watch me on the
weekend right cuz like right now we only
got 11 people with him
it's a Saturday people's out people
ain't trying to hear no cold then I
ain't trying to hear no cold right now
I'm chillin it's natural you know
Netflix and chill tonight you know what
I mean but for me coldest every
day man I do this day I do this
 every single day coming here live
if I don't drop a video I do a live
video like I do the show the regular you
know what I mean like this is my life I
love doing this you know sometimes
especially now with everything that's
going on like the baby and family and
it's like now I have to restructure my
life I gotta find a way to keep myself
happy to keep you know my wife and the
baby happy you know giving me enough
time because it's also not fair you know
for me to just be like all day coating
not only do I go to work 9:00 to 5:00
then from there I come home I eat foot a
little bit hang out with them for a
little bit and then I'm back to coding
and then from there I'm there to like 1
o'clock 2 o'clock in the morning and I
guess it had a long conversation with
wifey and it's like no she's right she's
definitely ready I'm putting in a lot of
hours into this so I just got to manage
it better you know cuz this is not fair
for for me to miss special moments of
the baby or not give the baby enough
time that he deserves or give her enough
time so it's like now I'm like in a
weird space where I have to find out how
to manage time you know and manage a
family
oh
Burt let me take this out then this is
ready
well the pork is ready the things just
missing a little bit well yeah so that's
what we got
so we got right now and you know I want
people to see the cuz I come here
either talk about cold either come here
and motivate you guys to a video to
motivate you guys or I come in and share
parts of my life and I want people to
just see this like you know there might
be some 17 18 19 20 year old kid and
they might want to know like hey how is
it to you know how can you balance
learning how to code or how can you
balance work with a family work with
your side projects cuz you know even the
courses that I'm doing that can be
considered as a side project you know
what I mean my way and my website coding
face.com is a side project so anybody
that comes here like every day you see
ups and downs with me you know it's not
it's not old all the time happy it's not
kumbaya all the time I come here with
that real it's like that's why it's
called coding face.com real the real web
developer right so it's basically me
sharing my story sharing my experiences
and yeah y'all see me mad yeah see me
happy I see me sad you've seen me upset
you see me you know all type of
situations right and that's what I think
makes this channel special because it's
not just about code I could come in and
just say hey hey guys watch this
tutorial all the time right but it's not
just about that
sometimes you want to know how is it how
does it feel to be a web developer how
exactly is it you go to an interview how
exactly is it
- you know get hired how is it the
process to worry about benefits how is
the process of sharing time with
yourself and the family how is it that
we could you know do a bunch of things
so it's like at least somebody's gonna
get something out of this Barbara what
up chip - Cheerios
my Barbara miss yes no we need to do
another live video man everybody's been
asking for it
maybe tomorrow night before I go to
sleep we do a little live video for the
people you know do a podcast I want to
bring back the podcast so that's that's
something that I want to do it bring it
back for the people you know house lve
mama Joe her name is Alvin house I'll be
doing she she's dead always doing good
the baby baby Ethan aka baby Kenji he's
good if I watched the video he was just
crying you know from the beginning all
right let me bring this in
we are about to eat about this shell
one of these days we might do a video
together
hey what's the baby that was milky okay
oh it's freaking hot guys it's
burning up
it's like eating some of the grease
right now little baby car seat yo this

you have a kid you gotta get say you
gotta get the accessories you gotta get
the baby pampers you gotta get
the what else the no little
swing get him the little swing and the
stroller game a whole bunch of it's
a process is like a little it's like a
little I don't know how to explain is
like a little little person there now
you gotta get him a lot of stuff which
is cool cuz then it's like he gots to
enjoy you know like it's crazy my sister
got him that little swing and that's
like his favorite thing but he just be
there all day
I mean before he was there all day now
he was to you know be carried around or
half people next to him so that's cool
what's a good combo of languages I can
learn to get my first job listen very
simple HTML CSS they're not languages
but they're basically for the view so if
you're gonna build web page you have to
know those things there from there you
gotta know JavaScript just the basics
just to know how to you know manipulate
the Dom meaning like oh when you click a
button make something pop up or when you
click a button makes
to disappear or when you click a button
change the color whatever right just
JavaScript just for interaction and then
PHP and my sequel for the backend the
backend is just to you know be able to
persist data be able to save it and like
myself when I will you go from one page
to the other
you basically have that data or that
session or those cookies so you got to
do that through my sequel and PHP so ya
learn those things man you got you came
back a word let's do it dance puppet
dance without what I would up dance
puppet you your girl or you're a guy
with a frickin a girl icon I've been
noticing this this like so weird so many
guys that died noticed like on YouTube
which to me super weird if you're a guy
and you have what a girl's I con I don't
know why how're you doing but yeah man
so semicolon without yeah man finally
you watching your life man this how it
is live man I tell people I think to me
I have the most entertaining the most
informative the most real Channel like I
give real examples I talk about real
 it's not just like theory or just
regular programming there's a this
is how you do a function like no like I
give you that's you know real life
shake cuz I think for me when I started
this thing that's why I wanted to have I
wanted to have a channel I looked
everywhere a channel where people just
it was just a regular dude who was just
doing web development right and I never
found that the the most that I found was
like Chris Hawkes
right Chris Hawkes was like the closest
thing
- like a real developer like somebody
who's just like a rope person then
everybody else was just you know it was
just monotone people who have no
personalities people who just didn't
really have no sauce you know what I
mean like I come in hit him with the
sauce you know what I mean
gotta have fun guys doesn't nothing to
like you can't your life cannot be
boring man you gotta learn how to laugh
you gotta learn how to smile you gotta
learn how to just have fun with it you
know not every time you gotta be sad and
every time you're gonna be upset you
know every time you're gonna be mad you
gotta enjoy it but yeah man I
got a cool channel make sure you
subscribe
we just hit 7,000 right for that so for
whatever that's worth we hit 7,000 so we
pretty much in seven months we got seven
thousand subscribers right which is not
bad it's actually not bad you know we
started in December the end of December
and pretty much January it was after my
sister passed away that's when I really
started making videos for YouTube and I
said you know what I'm gonna go hard I'm
gonna you know we're gonna get to places
kids and that was the idea behind it
yeah man make sure you give this some
likes where like if you mess with the
kid this is nothing wrong we just press
on the like button trust me it's not
gonna hurt you it's not gonna bite you
it's not gonna electrocute you yeah your
phone is not gonna blow up it's just a
little thumbs up and just click that
you'll be like get on a low like because
then YouTube doesn't show us to anybody
else all right
when part of somebody comes here and you
guys somehow found my channel if nobody
likes it then you two just don't show me
to anybody else I mean of course if you
want to keep me to yourself and you're
like you're like one of those hardcore
fans where they're like man I remember
one nirvana
was like nobody knew them I had their
 tape you know like if you want
to be one of those guys and just like
hold on
cool don't give me no letter but if you
say hey I like this channel other people
might like him you know you know when
you click like it's not for me it's
really more for like okay I like it
somebody else you watch this thing -
alright so it's not really nice doesn't
put nothing in my pocket doesn't tell me
nothing
it just says for you to like hey this
channel is cool let other people see it
- cuz that's how that's the thing is
like there's so many people that do
YouTube not every channel is it's worth
it I know it I know that firsthand you
know like sometimes you go to a channel
like you like a video for somebody and
then you subscribe to them and then all
the other videos that you see you like I
don't like this channel you know what I
mean but I think oh my all my videos are
similar to each other so if like if you
like one video for me you're gonna like
all the other ones I'll keep getting
emails from people where they tell me
hey man I just freakin watch all your
videos for like three hours straight
it's like I was supposed to go to sleep
early and and now I'm just watching it
on a playlist on my girl that's crazy
you know what I mean
so that's how I can say that's hard
because people show love babies good you
don't want to come say hi to the peoples
they want to see my my beer when you
come up yo
this food is still not done right okay
oh you know we keep it so full in here
man you know what I mean like look at
that you got the little potatoes in here
I got up and careful with this thing
this thing right here is gonna burn the
 out of me not knowing I gotta put
this away when it comes to like
getting hurt I'm like the king of it
it's like everything I see I gotta
 take care of it because I will
get hurt from it it's like if I see you
like I see like how you call this like
damn you know little ticks little things
that you put in for the pin boards and
Shandling whenever you want to put up a
note like obviously that my office
I'm like yo I know I'm gonna get hurt
one of these states from that and
just like on Thursday I'm walking right
I'm walking by the board and as
soon as I'm walking from there right

good sign
cuz you working hard and you're young
you're working on this thing that's the
beginning you know what I mean
so I know from like when I was going to
college there will be people that they
don't even do projects on their own like
they only do the homework on that you
only do the homework when you graduate
you don't know because if you only
do the homework it's like hey do this
assignment
okay you got an A on it who cares
because now you don't know how to think
for yourself but you since you actually
been doing this and doing prior on you
know projects doing online courses like
doing your own thing it's like it's
gonna pay off man so you're gonna be
going oh you gotta learn es6 you have to
man I will say es6 is the future like
any company that you're gonna work with
now most likely unless you're working
with legacy code then that's different
but I'm telling you guys man you got to
learn es6 for sure SAS 100% you gotta
learn it
who is the video from yesterday yeah
deleted that I didn't delete I put
it private it's still there
