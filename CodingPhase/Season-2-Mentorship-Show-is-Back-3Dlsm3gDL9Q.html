students now I'm sorry we can only have
four last time we had six out of those
six only four people who made it and in
reality only three people really made it
out of it then a lot of people just gave
up people came and came and one night
you know what I mean

is this time bring in four people and
there's other requirements be a member
of coding phase comm this does not mean
that you have to be a paid member at all
you could have signed up for this course
which is it says of course but in
reality is just to watch the show so all
you have to do is come here you register
here make sure you register at the same
time and you know know how to set up the
web developer starter kit that's the
basics guys if you don't know how to do
that to be honest don't sign up because
we cannot teach you the most basic
things this is for people to hit the
ground running who have been pretty much
learning on their own and they're like
you know what I just need a little extra
help a little extra push for the next
month and that's it I'm not trying to
teach you guys this is what a HTML tag

so if you know how to setup the web
developer starter kit you understand the
terminal right now know the basics of
HTML CSS and JavaScript alright because
we're gonna have three projects one
project is gonna be just HTML CSS you
know another project is gonna be
something that you're gonna create on
your own and then the third project is
gonna deal with JavaScript okay so you
have to come back and be able to build
this for us okay so if you don't know
the basics of those three languages this
is not for
you you know just sit down watch this at
home and enjoy the show but for those
people that they know the basics and
they think that they're ready for this
