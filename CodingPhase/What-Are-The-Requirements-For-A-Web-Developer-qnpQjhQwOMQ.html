again about to teach you about some web
development teach you exactly what do
you need to become a web developer right
so here are a couple of requirements man
there's the basics this all you really
need operating system operating system
is just it means what type of computer
you have so pretty much you could
actually make any website or you know
just play around with things with any
system you could do a Mac Windows Linux
I actually use a Mac and it's easier
it's actually easier for me to you know
do what development in a man because of
the way how the terminal is and I don't
know it feels like so much easier for me
okay so you need a text editor a text
editor is pretty much it's like
Microsoft Word so for you to be able to
type your you know your code you need
something to basically write it with
because using anything like a notepad or
you know the regular text editor from
you know that comes with Mac is a
nightmare you need something that's
gonna have actually the highlights of
the code and it tells you what HTML tag
was a HTML params whatever it is but you
actually need a text editor right so you
got stuff like atom sublime Visual
Studio code webstorm
personally I use atom is so much easier
for me to have it and you know it has a
lot of packages that you know become
very helpful as you know as you get to
learn more and more about what
development there's a lot of stuff that
you don't want to keep doing constantly
so what packages actually makes it
easier for you so you don't have to keep
repeating the same thing that you've
done before or sometimes we want to
learn a new language and your editor
actually knows about that language so
let's say if I wanted to write something
of react what I will do is I will
download
a package from Adam that is called react
language so now I co actually the editor
can actually give me some highlights on
you know I react so it's pretty simple
you gotta make sure that you're gonna
give yourself time to learn this is not
something you're gonna learn from one
day to another there's something that
you have to put in some time and say hey
do I want to be ready in a year from now
okay so maybe I just do two hours a day
now if you want to be ready six months
from now you gotta put in four hours a
day now if you really want to go all out
and you want to learn all the basics and
everything that you need to be able to
find a job right away pretty much you
got to do eight hours it's that simple
that's not if and buts about it you just
have to put in the time and then from
there
you've gotta have all the basics and
trust me there's plenty of jobs for you
out there also you cannot give up you
gotta understand you cannot give up
right trust me you're gonna hit some
roadblocks and you're gonna bump into
stuff that you don't know or even
certain things that you want to do it
that you might not even see in this
tutorial but you can't give up whatever
idea you might have you want to create
the next Facebook whatever the next
Google or whatever idea you might have
you might want to sell t-shirts online
and you want to make your own website
well this gonna be roadblocks so you
can't give up because somewhere in the
internet somebody already did that for
you they already went through that
mistake that you did or yeah where were
you stuck so all you have to do is
Google you put in the question that you
want to find out like hey how do you
change the color of a background or how
do I arrange a list or how do I add
images whatever it is that you want to
do just go google and put the question
say hey how do I change the CSS or
whatever it is you know what I mean so
cool was your friend
make sure that you constantly searching
on google or Stack Overflow or even
Quora just ask other people or if
anything just go ahead and just leave a
comment here and I'll make sure that
I'll you know break down the answer for
you
I'll show you where to go or I'll give
you a little tip you know sometimes it's
not good to get that answer is better to
just find out yourself like you know how
to do it but you know if you stuck for a
day or two forget about that just ask
somebody for the answer after you get
the answer you understand what the
hell's going on but yeah man he already
