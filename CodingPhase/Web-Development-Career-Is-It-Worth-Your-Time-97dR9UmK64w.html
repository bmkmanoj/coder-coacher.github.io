job back at it again man : face.com your
boys back and I done did it again
alright so somebody sent me a message um
Joe please be honest just tell me the
truth is web-development worth my time
should I switch my career so become a
web developer and I will say yeah
alright but it also depends like if
you're a doctor
right and you making 300k right you're
making 300k I'm not I tell you hey man
leave your career to become a web
developer
alright I'm gonna tell your man you
better stick with that all right but if
your freaking Jonny from the block or a
Shonda the skateboarder who decided to
be a marketing agent you know or
you know your Jing though the girl who
who was popular in school and somehow
didn't want to go to college and ended
up being a secretary to somebody then
yeah become a developer man like who are
you kidding man right you're now making
money out here you're in a dead-end job
and you know it so it's all up to you
it's like do you see yourself growing
and your company do you see yourself
going forward in your life like you know
you're putting in a lot of time into a
job that is it's not gonna pay off in
the long run right some of us yeah yeah
start on certain jobs that in reality
back in the days were jobs for you know
teenagers teenagers you know real estate
never to see your own sorry
you know working at a store
right retail sorry you work at a retail
like it's cool it's cute when you're
young but you after I think after the
age twenty seven years old and you still
work in retail and you're still working
enough in a restaurant or are you still
working I don't know one of those
fast-food places like it's not cute
local because not only are you feeling a
certain way but society looks at you a
certain way and they're like why is this
person not not growing past this level
what is it that they're doing wrong
right and you're probably asking
yourself the same questions like man
what the hell I'm about to be
thirty years old and and I'm working as
a waiter and this and I'm like you know
you know this a better world out there
you know you you drive by those big
houses and you're like man how the hell
they do that how'd I have they get
money like that
well people bust their ass you know like
sometimes it's its money that comes down
from the family but a lot of times is
people that just work hard they don't
get stuck in one scene you know one same
spot they just be like okay this year
I'm I'm here and I want to grow next
year right so what can I do I'm gonna
switch careers I'm gonna go do something
else you know like that's my point man
Barbara said but Joe what if the doctor
hates his job and loves what development
it doesn't care about earning one-fourth
of the money well then that's on him you
know me personally I wouldn't I wouldn't
tell him to leave his job right he can
code at any time you know his personal
time me personally if you invested so
much into a career and you know that you
you get it more over there then don't
leave it and just make yourself happy in
other ways that's my advice right but if
you work in some job and you're
like man should I become a web developer
it's like bro why are you even asking
that question like you know the answer
you know you you ain't going nowhere in
that job like you might as well do
something funny something that's gonna
put money in your pocket you know plus
it's just the beginning this what tell
people becoming a web developer it's
only the beginning of your career
there's so many different avenues you
can take you can become a web developer
you could say hey I like the design of
it I want to focus more and more on
design you can switch up to more of a
designer you say hey I want to work more
with databases cool you could switch up
to a database guy
manager of that hey sorry guys I
have an 8 you know I'm like a
prima donna out here when I don't eat I
can't think so these are my
lunch breaks so I come in here and and
pretty much give you guys some some
quick advice
you know almost passing out but hangry
Joe word well yeah so Robert said I
worked at a Shetty Kohl Center yes my
advice to you is start becoming
a web developer man as soon as you can
enroll start learning like I look at the
people look I even worked at as a call
center person one time there was this
place called Universal Universal service
right and we used to call up all the
time like hi my name is Joe Santos
I'm calling for a universal survey
basically we wanted to know if you know
what type of service do you have
currently back then there was the
competition of t-mobile metro pcs little
small wool spring and a whole bunch of
 so my job was just to call people
constantly ask them hey which one do you
use which one do you like have you ever
tried sprint have you ever tried one
more MetroPCS have you tried
t-mobile
where do you rate it like that's the
 job that every day when I used
to come out of that place I'm like man
the train tracks are right there I'm
this close to happiness you know what I
mean like I was literally like yeah I
feel like just jumping cuz I don't see
my life going away but I was so young
alright that's another thing guys never
give up on life like never give up on
life
even if is going bad just be like
y'all tomorrow's another day and I could
just switch it up and do something
completely different
sign of fun right but before you guys
start working those dead-end jobs like
come on man like what was here it was
your future go in there you know what I
mean like what's gonna be the goal that
you achieve you're like now you're the
the lead Kohl Center guy where
now you're dealing with other
people's problems whenever everybody
else in the call center they can't
 answer the person's question
they're like can I talk to your manager
and now they pass the phone to you so
and you get three dollars more than
everybody
that's it definitely a
achievement you know what I really like
so if you're working one of those jobs
is like come on man I work hard bust
your ass sacrifice this is something I
tell everybody I even tell my girlfriend
tell you guys I tell everybody that I
know to get where you want to get to you
need to sacrifice you need to sacrifice
time you need to sacrifice time that
you're gonna give to your family
sacrifice time that you're gonna give to
your friends it's like yesterday right
yesterday I wanted to just relax
and chill but at the same time I'm like
I play one game of Paragon and then
after day I'm like you know what man I
can't play another game spend another
hour on this I'm gonna put a
Netflix watch a little show with my
girlfriend but at the same time I gotta
do this this planning of the next
courses that I made you know I'm
building so I can't just be like oh
it I'm just gonna chill I want to but
you know it's like you have to do
sacrifices you know what I mean like all
the sacrifice time doing right now is so
next year I can be good and I could do
youtube full-time you know so it's the
same thing as you guys you guys work in
a job you can't leave your
 job because if you don't have
money in your pocket you're gonna start
you're gonna get kicked out of your
house you know look crazy industry your
girlfriend's gonna look at you like yo
this guy's broke like she might
leave you you know what I mean you ever
heard that Chris Brown song these hoes
ain't loyal that's what I meant you know
what I mean like I'm not saying girls
are hos but that's the that's the
part of the game man you over here broke
at one point some guys gonna come
through and be like yo ma what up you
wanna come this way you know what I mean
so you can't leave your job but since
you're still working at that
job sacrifice the extra time that you
have sacrifice your weekend sacrifice
your your nights
go on bust your ass trust me if you
really go hard in less than two months
you can do this you can get your first
job we're not talking about $90,000 I'm
not talking about hundred thousand
dollars we're talking about your first
job in that job most likely you
making less than $50,000 right so let's
say right now somebody hires you and
gives you 40 you was earning I don't
know $50,000 in another place let's say
that's $200 less than what she was gonna
make in the other place where you
working now currently but at least now
you're happy you're you know that this
career that you're in you're gonna grow
next year that 40,000 whatever you're
making or even six months later you
could double that money you say hey I'm
gonna work for $60,000 $70,000
then you keep growing then you say hey
I'm gonna work for 80 for those of you
guys that like work in major cities ya
can make up to $100,000 man like tell me
where you gotta make that type
of money especially not going to college
late there is no place that you're gonna
make that money trust me man
there's no other place that you're gonna
make that type of money I don't
especially not going if you haven't got
a college degree you haven't got a whole
bunch of years of experience
so yeah
so let me see somebody said something
that's important too I think beekeeper
says anyone struggle with constant
sleepiness while trying to learn I go
through that all the time
that happened to me all the time so
before you'll be trying to learn
something but you're sleepy you're tired
you're like you don't want to do this
 but it's a sacrifice man you gotta
put you put you your brain to just like
you know what like yeah this thing is it
can get difficult yes I could get
frustrating but you gotta keep pushing
hard you gotta say it I'm just
going to learn this if you
don't understand something watch the
video again if you don't understand it
watch it again if you don't understand
it watch it one more time
there's been times I've watched a video
up to six times and I'm proud to say
that because once I finish that six time
I got it you know I understood it since
the same as you guys you don't
understand the subject replay the video
alright right now I have my HTML CSS
course for those of you guys that are
just starting there are many places
where you can learn this but there's
only one place where you're gonna learn
it the way I teach it the easy way the
money way the way that you're gonna be
able to understand it all right because
there's the thing a lot of the people
that create courses and a lot of people
that create videos here in YouTube
they don't take into account that most
of you guys have no knowledge of like
programming or anything so it's like
they make these videos I was looking at
some youtubers and I was like man they
make videos for beginners as if the
beginners know what the hell they
talking about
you know what I mean like that's where
I'm like that's why I created my own
 website I was like yo I'm just
gonna create my own course
is created for the people who are trying
to get into this but have no knowledge
of computer science have no knowledge of
programming who are just trying to get a
job and trying to get in this as soon as
possible
you know like you guys are gonna see
this commercial that I'm thinking about
a recording somewhere this week is gonna
be like a parody to Tai Lopez but it's
not gonna be like oh hey guys you want
to become a millionaire and listen to
this and that now it's gonna be
something cool is gonna be a parody
which is gonna make the video go viral
where I'm gonna come in and I'm gonna be
like hey guys I'm over here in my rental

yeah you know that's what I'm saying I'm
not saying that there's something wrong
with playing UVO cards I'm not saying
there's nothing wrong with you Gill
cards guys I'm just saying you're a
grown-ass man and you living in your
mama's basement and you playing yugioh
cards you're worrying about which
pokemon you're gonna catch you're
playing Pokemon going you're like oh man
is a Pokemon Center around the
corner like I've played pokemon gold but
doesn't mean I was gonna leave
if I can leave everything that I had to
do and be like hey guys I'm just gonna
 play pokemon like no I got a
goals every day I'll make a new goal I'm
like you know what like last year I was
like no three years ago I was like man
my car kept dying everywhere I
said that I'm about myself a car
bought a car she was I all right I said
you know what man I gotta get my credit
up man cuz I want to get a house people
don't even know about this which is one
of my motivations you guys don't even
know I moved over 16 times in my life
16 times all right and even now
we're me and my girlfriend we probably
gonna get another apartment so we're
gonna move set for me I'm moving 17
times in my life you know what I
really want one of my dreams I want to
buy a house that I'm just gonna stay
there forever I want to buy a house to
just relax and just chill there but I
have goals
I gotta have goals you know every single
day but like even like yesterday I made
a goal of like you know what man I'm
just gonna create more projects in a
vanilla JavaScript this morning oh ma
you know I did a little 15-minute break
from work I went in and started creating
a new project and for another JavaScript
because I felt like I need to you know
just work on it just to do it for the
hell of it
right so what does that mean I mean what
the does that mean you know like
what the hell am I telling you what I'm
telling you is you gotta have goals man
just because you are at some place right
now doesn't mean that's what you're
gonna dye it so that's my that's my way
of living in this world like I gotta
have goals I gotta have something about
it's like a life is a video game for me
I got a level up every day
you know it's like I gotta keep going
the the moment stop is boring like what
am I gonna live for besides my son and
my beautiful wife what the hell am I
gonna live for you know what I mean so
that's the way how I look at it and
that's how you guys should look at it
you should guys should look into what
you have in your life right now and be
like man I can do better than this
whatever I'm at right now I can do
better
last year was I was in a Nissan
Rogue for two years I said this I
can't I can't I don't feel good
in this car I said my buyer Benz
I was gonna buy a Maserati but then the
payments was kind of ridiculous I was
like yo I'm not paying $200 a month for
a car to me that sounds
ridiculous especially when you come from
the bottom anything above $600 you look
at it like I'm not trying to spend
$1,200 that's like rent
that's right money you know what I mean
so that's why I didn't buy it I could
have bought it and I said nah plus wife
you wanna SUV she likes the SUV she
likes to to feel high on top of this
 so I said it so every
year I just keep growing next year I'm
gonna I don't know what imma do but I'm
gonna do it big one more time cuz I got
a level up and it's not about getting
material it's just you gotta have
some type of of goals
I know people who cool their goals is
just a tribal who is like hey in a year
they traveled to six
four countries that's their gift to
themselves that's their motivation for
you guys might be hey I wanna have every
 round on PlayStation game ever
or I wanna have a $10,000 PC with the
best 1080 Titan whatever card
you know what I mean like whatever your
goal is you should have something every
single time that you could just keep
going
so for a man that's what we yeah I'm
just reading the comments I'm reading
what people are saying there's 41 people
in here it's really good that we got our
audience every time that we make a live
video especially because a lot of you
guys are probably working or yeah I just
coming out of school or yeah driving
somewhere or yeah I'm doing something
right but somehow you still wanna come
chill with your boy and I appreciate it
that's why I don't stop this I don't
stop making videos before you guys like
I'll be honest these days I just I don't
want to do it I'm like maybe I shouldn't
do it because I'm tired I'm gonna hang
out with my wifey but and the baby cuz
the baby's looking super cute but at the
same time I'm like I can't do it I can't
leave the alone I have to keep
helping you guys out
not only because I want to help you guys
but because also to you guys might
recommend this channel to somebody yeah
see this channel always you know
dropping new content you never know you
guys might be like you know what I like
this guy let me recommend it to my
friend then your friend shows it to his
friend you know so the channel keeps on
growing if I leave it alone then I feel
like you guys might not now feel the
same way y'all be like man your boy Joe
used to come here all the time but not
anymore
he's Boise now you know I don't want to
do that you know so I want to keep it
here man
but yeah guys so whenever you feel like
hey so you become a web
developer so you leave your job you
gotta ask yourself man do you see
yourself in that job for the next five
years and growing at least 20% every
year if you can't say yes to that
lyric you got to do something else trust
me guys
listen I'm being honest you guys do not
want to be 40-something years old
like before there was this guy who sent
me a message
he's like 40 I think 46 years old and
he's been telling me yeah man I started
I started
