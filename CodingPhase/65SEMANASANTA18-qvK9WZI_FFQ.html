already knows he'll boy chill back at it
again
coding phase comm your boy is back and I
done did it again kids we are out here
we are alive alive from the beautiful
landscape yourself Connecticut live from
the mountains live from the suburbs live
from you know the good life live from
the good life kids yep I got some good
news some really good news some even
better news okay so pretty much as you
guys can see there's a title on this
video call 65 semana santa 18 that's the
the coupon code for the website for
those of you guys that haven't tried my
website yeah yeah like you're tired of
doing you know freako can be a tired of
doing a bunch of udemy courses the
entire signing up for a whole bunch of
websites if you haven't tried this yet
if you haven't tried the site and you
are a new member you can put in that
coupon code 65 for someone on Santa so
65 semana santa 18 and what that's going
to do
you
and I mean that's for the monthly and
for a yearly plan that's not bad
if you do the math 65 percent off 20 20
bucks you're looking at seven dollars if
you do the math on 200 which is how much
is the yearly plan you're looking at I
think 75
I think that's 65 cent off so it should
be 75 I love playing dumb
but yeah so you guys could do the math
man it's a great opportunity for those
of you guys that want to try it out like
I just don't know if I'm I want to
commit myself to 20 bucks I don't know
if I want to commit myself 10 bucks
whatever right give the website a chance
man everybody that has gone to my site
literally like loves it
there's been only I'm telling you right
now in almost a whole year there's been
only six cancellations right six people
have cancelled in over two thousand
people that have been signed up to the
website it's for a reason people love it
people love what I'm doing out here is
for a reason the average user has stayed
on on on my website for six months as
some member trust me guys if you don't
love something you you just don't stay a
member to it trust me I know about
things like that right I'm looking at
you Hulu
right you ever signed up to Hulu and or
like any service like that that's a
membership right and you're like wait
hold on this isn't what I signed up for
and you cancel right away right
out of 2,000 plus members that are on my
website six people have canceled and one
of them was because they actually did a
mistake they signed up for a the the
lifetime and then they were like yo man
I signed up I wanted the yearly and I
signed up for the lifetime by mistake at
full price so they were looking at like
300 something so they're like this
wasn't what I really wanted I cancelled
it and then they signed up right away
for a yearly so I don't know technically
that's a cancel that could have been
like a refund with a change of heart I
guess but oh yeah I think that's great
numbers man two thousand members and
only six people have ever canceled like
there's a reason why people are signing
up to the website guys now I'm doing
this for the people that haven't been
able to try to website out you haven't
been able to to see what's in there yeah
I've been wanting to get in there
guys this is your chance take it you're
looking at 65% off you're not gonna get
this again that's me being honest with
you it's not gonna happen again same way
how did the fallout special
remember what did this the people that
signed up for fire on us until this day
they still pay for us like it's like a
specialist like something that you gotta
take advantage because you see it again
and the reason why I'm doing this is
because it's a - onda it's Easter it's
like hey it's a holiday and I feel like
you know to really give back to the
community and and you know Kumba get a
full r.i.p you know let's do one last
cool bomb you know a last kumbaya move
you know that's it I want everybody to
subscribe to your website because you're
gonna get everything that you need there
man if you're looking to become a
developer like that's the place where
you need to be yet right and then once
you get your skills move on you cancel
you can do whatever you want you know I
have so many people there that they like
y'all got a job but I'm still a member
like you know I mean that's some dumb I
didn't tell them to stay there you're
gonna say once you get what you need you
know even you know you try it out for a
month you say hey cool I liked it but
I'm gonna take my talents elsewhere you
know go somewhere else - you know you
could cancel it but give it a chance
this there's people out there paying 500
bucks man like I'm not lying to you guys
it's people paying 400 bucks for one
course I'm giving you guys over 29
courses that's a lot the other Zillah
you go to you go to a website they got
over twenty nine courses they charging
you a lot you go team tree house they
charging you $30 25 $30 a month you go
to Pluralsight is the same thing $30 a
month you get what I'm saying
and most of these people are now
self-taught so they're not really
teaching it in a way that's gonna be
efficient for you to learn what they're
teaching it is in a way of LaHaye the
technical way you don't need the
technical way is you're not a technical
person you know I mean you don't have a
computer science degree you don't need
somebody teaching it to you and in a way
as if you was a computer science major
like you need somebody that could speak
to you the same way that you speak you
know explain things in an easier way
where things just click you know there's
people that just send me email but your
job the way how you explained it it just
makes sense I've been following a lot of
different websites but when I came here
it just makes sense right now you could
take it from me or you could take it
from somebody else but to take that take
advantage of it you know I mean they
take advantage go in there subscribe to
the website if you have it you're only
gonna get this till Sunday before
midnight on matter fact Monday midnight
Monday at 12:00 yet so once it touches
11:59 on Sunday that's it
the specials no longer there and
especially will not be there no more
everybody that's been here since the
beginning of time someone's been here
what was the the next turn hey Cody
freeze calm five bucks yeah I've never
seen that again I told you guys I wasn't
gonna see that again
right now Cody freeze calm seven bucks
when you're gonna see that again
probably never so take advantage right
now I always I always have the 50% off
for my YouTube community my YouTube
subscribers but most of the people are
finding from Google die find me from
freako camp I find me from medium define
me from high college from a whole bunch
of different different places and
different spots like some crazy area
dude's got carriages and stuff like that
what a hell am i okay so so yeah I'm a
little bit lost I'm in the woods kids
I'm lost
okay so yeah so he's like take advantage
seven bucks you're not gonna get that
that's being honest I think the cheapest
one that I've seen was like Larrick cast
and he did it like that nine bucks one
time that's it but that from there it
goes right back up and you do it they
you know they give you is like a special
for one month oh yeah the first month
you get it for this much I'm like nah
this is a lifetime thing you sign up
right now for seven bucks you're gonna
get it next month the next month the
next month every single month that
you're gonna be a member the website for
seven bucks man
so take advantage right now this is for
the new members guys don't trust game
the game and but I yo I'm bout to cast
and you try to skin it all you're doing
is just spitting in my face now this is
for the new peoples you know what I mean
like this is there's a gift to the new
people the people are scared as people
are scared you know it's sad like people
have sent me an email I want to make
this live so bad but I'm with for
somebody else's sake so every you know
what whatever I'll say so things have
been happening remember a few months ago
I told you guys I was like yo man dudes
is out here charging people are arming a
leg and this just met well people have
been sending me emails and and proof
about schemings schemes that people have
we're pretty much they're like hey they
charging people $400 $400 and then the
person don't even have no content in
there all right and be like oh I'm
traveling and say I'll get back to this
and I'll make a course on something and
then it stand up for 400 bucks and now
they're stuck that ano was refund the
person sending them as our own own is
bringing past 60 days so now people are
sending me emails to expose this I'm not
gonna say the name but I am gonna bring
it to light you know of like the
difference there's a huge difference
guys there's a very big difference
between myself and a lot of these people
the schemers I don't do that man I
definitely do not do that like that's
crazy
you charge somebody 400 thousand dollars
then you extend it you waste their time
until it's two months in and then you
come in and say hey you can get a refund
it's $400 that's
out of money $500 is a lot of money
these people believe in you right and
they looking to better their own I mean
you know I told you let's just say am I
happy about it no do I have a smile on
my face yes because you know how when
you write and you know you write in like
yo this don't seem right right but
nobody believes me sometimes you know I
love YouTube I love you guys here on
YouTube but sometimes it's like yeah you
guys don't understand me man when I tell
you something it's not because I'm an
expert it's not because I know
everything is because I've already been
through the mistakes that you are making
if I'm telling you don't sign up for
something that's 500 bucks man
no matter no matter how much they try to
package it there's something if your
body there's something if your body so
listen to your boy I already been
through this if I tell you don't go to a
boot camp it's because I already
freaking learned this on my own
the are waiting I learned this the hard
way I want to eat and I lost money you
don't know say like I lost money I lost
$14,000 you get what I'm saying give me
a second I'm missing I don't want to get
into accident here
so yeah yeah so I already been through
all of this man when I started this
website
everybody that that knows me that's been
here since before I even started my own
website with course as I said it from
the beginning I go if I ever do this I
just want to do it for the people it's
not for me to come in here and be like
oh how can we make the most money I
could really package this whole website
and be like okay cool
coding phase calm 500 bucks right
nobody's gonna be able to pay for it but
only 3% of the people are gonna be able
to pay for it right and then I make
money but now the majority of the people
who really need this people who wanted
to get into this industry are getting
stuck you know they wouldn't be able to
get in that's why I don't do it money is
great guys who don't want money hey we
don't want to make money I would love to
say hey man I sold a $500 of course I
sell $2,500 of courses per day you gotta
say like who don't want to do that right
I would love to be able to do that but
would I do it off people's backs that's
why we make this affordable that's why
we I constantly keep on but I yeah I
make a coupon that helps the people that
don't even know if they really want to
do this that I know should I do this
should I not do this I still go out out
of my way to say hey I know people need
to help our know people need just that
motivation
can we make them you know get this
opportunity you know I know if they
can't afford it and they can't sign up
for it how can we make it a little bit
more affordable for them alright just
for them to at least try you know what
I'm saying I do that most of these
people don't do that man they over here
trying to cash out man I hate that man
because people have cashed out on me
like that's the worst part man you know
what's the worst part when somebody that
you trust in your man I look up to this
person they cash out on I hate that look
I'll tell you this there was this guy on
not on YouTube it wasn't on YouTube it
was like one of those websites from back
in the days I don't know if you guys
know about deviantart.com so back in the
days I used to be you know I was going
to school whatever before I got really
deep into coding I was doing
communication design so you know I
wanted to become a designer right so I
went out of my way
I bought a course from a guy I was like
man this design is so legit so nice and
this guy he answers my questions
I bought a two hundred out of course
from this guy
I was boredom I bought the course the
course horrible and I'm like yo he's
after man like I could've gotten this
off the internet like literally from
googling it like why did I give this guy
200 bucks on this so I learned nothing
so I'm not gonna do lots of people I
freaking hate when people do that so
whatever so this other person who's out
here selling courses for finding artists
it scheming it I'm not you know his vote
the more you know what I mean like we're
not gonna say his name but vote the more
out here freaking he's out here yo can
we get a refund you try to leave a
comment blocked you try to ask hey was
my money yet blocked hey you were
supposed to create the courses two three
weeks ago blocked
he already catch down on you you don't
say
but I'm you're saying guys like keep
your eyes open man no I mean like listen
when I come here and give you guys a
coupon code it's for your own good man
is to give people who are coming in that
are new to this the opportunity to get
in the industry because if I did it
I'm nobody special I'm just so we're
gonna do you know on YouTube it's not a
special about me I can go to you know
freaking MIT I ain't go to no crazy
internships that my going up the
mountain it started popping your boys
high oh no hold on kids my age is pop

courses my courses are not full of
slides my course is not are not full of
you know explanations of when was things
created why was created no no no no I
don't want to waste your time when I was
taking courses from people I hated that
right if you're somebody like me who
says hey I want to see I want to see
something happen you know if I'm coding
something I want to start building stuff
that it's gonna give me a job right away
it's gonna show that my skills are good
that's where I focus on I don't focus on
showing you was faster between a for
loop or for each loop I don't focus on
that that you can do that on your own
time once you start working once you
start getting money there's no point of
me going in here and giving you the
history of JavaScript you don't need
that there's nobody there's not gonna be
a job interview that they're gonna be
like can you tell me what year and who
was the creator of JavaScript nobody's
gonna ask you that peoples gonna look at
your code and they're gonna be okay can
you help us out we have a website that's
being built in every act we need
somebody to help us out with the
components we need somebody to help us
out with the backend you know either
with laravel No - yes Python what else
Ruby on Rails etc right those are the
things that people are gonna be asking
you about nobody's gonna stop and be
like hey man was faster than a for each
or full-nude like they're not gonna ask
you that you're a junior developer
you're looking to get a job I think a
lot of times that's where things go
wrong with courses it's like they don't
understand the the different levels of
of developers when you're a junior
developer you need to focus on the
things that's gonna get you hired right
this so much that people can teach you
online most of you experience you're
gonna get it on the job like it or not
people don't want X you know they don't
want to share this with people they want
to say hey I'm on instructor that I'm
gonna teach you everything that's under
the Sun it's impossible guys you're
gonna get all of your knowledge from
when you start working at a company when
you have a senior developer next to you
when they give you problems that you've
never seen when you get to test things
out and be like oh this is how I have to
do it to solve this problem when you
start bumping into things that you've
never done before you gotta use your
brain that's what you're gonna get
experience an instructor can only teach
you the basics and teach you how to
basically simulate as close as possible
to an experience of what you're gonna be
doing on a job now that's what I focus
on I feel like that's where my bread and
butter is right when you come to my
website you literally do projects that
you will be doing at a job we're not
doing to do apps we're not doing little
BS stuff just to say hey this is how you
do a little crud when we do a crud we
don't cut for like four videos to
explain how to actually create read
update and delete data there from there
we go deep into the project right you
ever gone that deep where he's just
touching the little top that's how deep
we go you know what I mean so that's how
deep we be going on the website
so that's all I'm saying you know for
the people yeah sexy fun cool I'll make
it easy for you design may be shaky out
here you know
guys you know I'm just having fun man
but like I was saying man the sake of
Vantage is three days only

Saturday and Sunday and then that's it
so yeah man take advantage go check it
out listen we're going deep listen we
going deep in there man we're going to
the tippy-top you ever been to the
tippity-top it's amazing in the
tippity-top that's how deep we going
that's how deep we go into JavaScript
man so man for it have fun sometimes too
don't don't try to kill me because I'm
trying to have fun man guys but yeah man
take advantage you're gonna enjoy
everybody's there on the website they
enjoy people are in there look it's so
crazy
every time I go to the website there's
like 40 42 people online like that it
doesn't matter what time it is
like there's one thing that I love about
you guys I love about the community you
know in the beginning a lot of people
were lazy
and then now people are saying that
there's a lot of people getting jobs
there's a lot of people getting
opportunities out here and now it seems
like a lot of you guys are taking a
serious now because every time I go on
my website doesn't matter if it's four
o'clock in the morning doesn't matter if
it's 3 p.m.
doesn't matter if it's two o'clock in
the morning
there's a minimum of 40 people live
studying working hard and that means
that's worldwide
that means it's worldwide right now that
means that when we sleep in here in the
United States there's people in in you
know in Asia studying when we we sleep
when we got people in Australia studying
we're international now you got on
saying so I really appreciate everybody
just going hard because like I said from
the beginning guys there's no point of
me coming in here creating all this
courses busting my ass working mad hard
for you guys and then only five people
could sign up to the website I could do
that I could be an a-hole and be like
hey I'm gonna have five people sign up
per month and that's it it's $500 we
could do that we could put pay for some
Facebook ads pay for some YouTube ads
and do some you know some a-hole moves

comes in where I see I have 2,000
members on my website active members now

my pride and joy right there
because at the end of the day those
people when they become successful that
trickles down to their family same way
how it has trickled down to my family my
mother was here for 20 years wasn't able
to buy nothing

boot camp and waste my money my much
audience is not for that my kind of
thing is not for that my content is for
the people that's like yo I wanna make
it this guy made it and I could do it
right so that's where I'm at right
that's what I'm doing here
but at the same time this isn't where we
stop so I come here when I come here I
don't do this to like show off or to
talk ish to people or nothing
a lot of times I want to just document
everything that I'm doing right I want
you guys to see how somebody goes from
you know being in a parking lot being in
a parking lot which is one of the worst
jobs that I've had you know I went from
working inside of the mall in the money
exchange to getting fired and working at
the malls parking lot while my excellent
you know my ex manager and my ex you
know other people that used to work
with me our money exchange looking down
on me because now I met I'm at the
little booth they will come in the
manager fired me

little things that you you you go back

late word the other thing so look I just
come in here I try to motivate make you
guys laugh enjoy and also it's like but
there's little nuggets that's what I
call my my live show dropping gems of
coding face you know we dropped gems we
hang out we have fun but we dropped gems
you go to my website you're gonna sign
up for the website you're gonna enjoy it
you're gonna really enjoy the projects
that you're building because we're not
just teaching different programming
languages just back to back back to back
without being how you call is being
connected to the last thing that you've
learned everything on the website is
connected to the last thing that you
learned so every time that you go and
jump from one language to another one
you're elevating yourself said in this
level you're learning something new you
learning something that you didn't learn
on the last course that you did okay but
everything's all connected right so if
you come in in you do something like
let's say in PHP you're not gonna learn
the basics of of web development in the
note say yes course because it's already
expected that you already did that
course right so when you take the load
you yes course we're not wasting your
time we're going straight to the you
know the meat of it we're not giving you
the low taste right no he's a little
piece now we go into the meat no homo
so you going straight to the meat you
know I mean and we touching the
tippy-top you go to the same song let
your imagination go wow yeah guys you
gotta have fun man
I wish yo I wish we could just have like
I want to do a meet-up so bad with like
