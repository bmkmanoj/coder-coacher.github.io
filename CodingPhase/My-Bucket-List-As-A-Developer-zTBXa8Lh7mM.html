man coding face.com listen your boys
back I didn't get it again man we hype
man summertime I'm feeling this breeze
right now I got my little you know all
the time some summer shirt you know we
ain't here man I was thinking about it
man I haven't really talked about my
bucket list right like the things that I
have on my bucket list the things that
I've been wanting to do since the
beginning of time I as a developer right
and I think you guys should have one too
like you don't have a bucket list of
things you know goals and achievements
that you wanna achieve as a developer
right so one of my first ones were you
know I wanted to make 50,000 right
that one got checked off right we passed
that a long time ago all right then we
say yo I want to be able to get a job I
checked that all right I wanted to work
in a fortune 500 company I checked that
all I basically I wanted to be able to
learn the front-end check that off and I
also wanted to learn the backend also
check that off right then I said you
know what man I wanna you know I want to
take it to the next level I want to
hundred thousand that happened to check
that old all right I moved to another
job in and it was great
you know then from there you know it I
think in my third fourth year my goals
were to basically understand on how to
make my own framework and I didn't get
to do that till this year when I created
the rocky step which so a lot of people
has been very successful because a lot
of people download it constantly and
it's it's made in crystal in the
language that I love because it's just
like Rudy right so I love that language
right now I check down and off right
there from there what's left for me is I
want to create courses right and some
yeah create courses in some way to teach
other people now I could check that off
because I'm doing that now also then
from there the other ones the ones that
I have left to do is I want to give a
talk right I want to go to why the
conference I want to go to either a
bootcamp or I want to go to you know
hackathon I want to give like give a
talk about you know just I don't know a
topic either a programming or okay we
talked about how I became a developer
and I I basically I became something
that so a lot of people thought that it
was impossible for me to do and a lot of
people didn't believe me so I wanna
that's one of the things that I have
left to do and let me see what else I
want to do is a developer I want to do
this I want to become remote like for a
whole year I want to become a remote
developer I've always wanted to do this
I I've done it yeah and they're like you
know have like a month or doing every
mall or doing
like you know two weeks three weeks
different kind of high quality contracts
as a remote developer but I would like
to do it like a whole year and like
travel so I don't know go to Thailand go
to Malaysia but oh the Philippines go to
Colombia go to Brazil go to I don't know
even Dominican Republic not my home
country right the country I was born in
I would love to be able to go over there
and and do this remotely you know that
would be amazing
so that's one thing that I want to do
that's that's definitely my bucket list
and I don't know I don't know what else
is left
I would love to create like a a
successful web application something
that a lot of people use I don't know
maybe a hundred thousand users write
whatever a social network or a community
whatever it is but like a web
application that I build myself from
scratch that's one other things that's a
month my bucket list for sure you know
but yeah man so what about you guys what
you guys have in your bucket list like
as a developer you know I would like to
know leave it in the comments or leave
it here in the chat room I would like to
know exactly what what is it that you
guys want to get out of this you know
because sometimes we come into this and
be like man we I just want to get a job
but what happens after you get a job
what's gonna be your next motivation
what is it that's gonna continue pushing
you forward to keep on learning cuz it's
not easy guys I'll be honest like once
you get a job and you start working
full-time what is it that's gonna
motivate you to continue doing this even
after you get home you know like this
days now I'm like man I wanna just lay
back you know and just play ps4 or play
some Paragon and just chill all right
but the fact that I haven't
everything that I wanted to make as far
as my my bucket list like it continues
to push me on and say like you don't
continue doing this thing doing you to
continue doing shrinking courses
continue trying to get my name out there
so people could give me more invites
because I've gotten invited to you know
different conferences but it's not like
a full paid conference is like hey if
you want to come down like you know
we'll give you 30 minutes for you to
talk in a conference but I feel like
anybody could do that right that's like
an invitation right I feel like anybody
could do that I want to get like a full
paid conference you know invitation
where they'd be like hey Joe we love
what you're doing we want to invite you
in we're gonna pay for your flight gonna
pay for your hotel room and now because
I can't do it myself but it's like
that's what I'm gonna feel like oh I
made it you know what I mean
it's like that's what I'm gonna feel
like okay I owe all this time that I've
been busting my ass that's when I'm
gonna notice that I'm gonna be like yo
all this um and all this you know free
time that I put into this I'm like man
it paid off at the end you know let me
see so let me see what everybody's up to
it
you're bored real casted arrow what
upset you and your lunch break to Sun
Microsoft let you out for a little bit
they let you off the fields right now
you're under say right now it's my boy
let me see
so we got kick greatness in here we got
your boy David we got your boy 84 music
you know let me see who was that I was
over here
David Brazil it's in here David's asking
me how much I wait yes I gained some
weight I'm trying to lose it I gained
some weight I ain't gonna lie
I gained some weight in the past month
month and a half I don't know how
because I only eat once or twice or
freakin
I think you know what it is because I
ever used to drink soda and I started
drinking soda again so I think that's
killing me right now
but I'm gonna quit it starting on it
what's today's date
we're in June 29 right by July 1st I'm
gonna start my whole day I'm gonna start
you know eating good again I mean I
already eat good my problem is the sweet
so it's like you know soda what
else I don't even know I think it's the
soda I really do think it's just the
soda
cuz I've been abusing it it's like right
now I just freakin I came to the store
and got soda so yeah that's definitely
killing me right now but let me see what
else what else you guys have on your
bucket list man a Java saying I enjoy
learning more in what development okay
but what else he is gonna push you after
you learn web development what else is
you you have as a goal that you want to
do you know you gotta have goals in this
world man
if you don't have no goals man I'm being
honest if people don't have goals
there's really no point of living like
because we're just a piece of you know
we're just a piece of flesh and that's
it and we're walking around in this
earth but if you don't have a goal
that's gonna continue pushing you
forward to the next day there's really
no point on living you know so all of
you guys gotta you know write that down
write down the the goals that you guys
have and be like yo this is what I want
to do this year
and have like short-term goals and be
like you know in a few months I want to
do this and a year from now I wanna do
that you know five years from now I
wanna be at this spot you know so let me
see what else so the real casted arrow
said build a brand in a business then
give talks out about how I did it
then garyvee slash the Kanye of codeword
where you be like y'all Walt
Disney out here I'm Steve Jobs
out here I'm the Steve Jobs of
web development it's like wow you're
really getting there yeah man just
straight you know I feel like I'm I'm
just struggling to get everything that I
want you know some people get quick
you know some people and life gets
checked quick me unluckily
I guess a year later after I want
it I get it
three years later after I want something
but that's okay cuz I know everything
that I've ever wanted I've got it it's
just a matter of time you know so I just
gotta keep going at it let me see what
else I work as a developer but I want to
work as a freelancer my problem is
getting clients how you go about finding
clients is still possible to do cold
calling I have no clue what to say I
think you could get clients man like I
are saying other videos across this
window cuz probably the wind is getting
crazy I will say check the the
businesses around your neighborhood
right start their post on Craigslist
post on Craigslist is like hey services
go to services I'm gonna hate web
developer for hire build websites for
cheap whatever right cuz all you care
about is getting that client first
getting them to call you or get in
contact with you or giving you that
first website and then from there they
will tell their friends or their other
business partners whatever the situation
might be and then you're going to
actually start getting more clients and
that's it
let me see definitely start doing talks
it will be it it will build your brand
yeah that's what I want to do let me see
it
a Jalla Comfort I want to work as a
freelancer at the side right so that's
what you want to do a freelancer that's
good let me see what else
how long give me a second I don't know
yeah sorry guys man yeah twenty percent
twenty seven percent sugar word yeah I
got a cut in that soda man let me see
what else there's a talk from the
creator of nodejs that really opened my
eyes about knowing about what note is
all about all right let me see what
freelancing websites do you recommend go
to odesk.com go to fiverr.com people
still think that fiber is just about
five dollars no fiber is a way to catch
new clients like you do something simple
like you be like oh I'll debug your
JavaScript on your website right for
five dollars which just means you're
gonna go in there and try to figure out
if there's a problem if there's no
problem then you know they'll say you're
gonna yah I can't figure it out let's
say you charging four outlets now if you
define the problem for them you
basically tell them hey they are
actually something like oh can you do
our revision or something like you be
like oh that's 25 you know rewritten my
 code or whatever right so every
time you do something else it adds
another 25 or whatever you want to
charge them it's like I first is five
dollars but that thing starts growing
you'll be like oh you want me to check
your bootstrap that's $25 do you want me
to change something on your menu that's
$25 she adds up next thing you know
you're charging somebody 500 artists on
Fiverr so you know
let me see
Kang Tron what up Ken haven't seen you
in a minute son where you been whoa your
boy can came through finally it's been a
while
I just want to create this is what 84
music said I just want to create
something functional for the average day
example I remember thinking about car
function that disables phones for Texas
two years ago I preparing the the very
same idea yeah so you know that's how it
is sometimes you gotta just patent
because even though you haven't created
it if you came up with a good idea you
just gotta find out how to pay it or
copyright or something you know let me
say I gotta say I want to expand the
tech field in Nigeria yeah man that's
one of the things too that I want to do
in Dominican Republic like I want to go
to the dr and actually help people out
I'm gonna go these people will be
studying icon is marketing man people
study marketing or they study
architecture
well it's study engineering but in the
are there's no jobs for that but
everybody wants to study that right so
it's like I would like to open people's
eyes and be like man you you guys can
start creating you know technology start
building something I think you know
software or hardware something look at
Japan right
Japan was like a poor country
all right after World War two and then
from there like they said you know what
the economy switching up to technology
well electronic said back then right so
they started making electronics you got
Sony you got Nintendo you got a
whole bunch of companies that came out
of you know after the whole world war
two you got Honda you know so it's like
they were smart so I feel like poor
countries can do the same
okay Lamont says another goes from
another goal is to move from senior
developer to need the developer my
ultimate goal is to start my own
business yeah yeah man
Joseph what happened to you you like
yeah I just want to get out of this
hospital mmm your boy ko knew what

Northwest so it's like we might just
bump into each other pretty soon man you

you know start drinking drinking and

sorry
okay let me see salsa dude what up son
just subscribe man I'm glad that you and
your subscribing man we here we got a
very good community man welcome to the
community man
listen if you just got here make sure
you go to coding face.com
right now go register I have free
courses and a half you know new courses
are coming out there I also like you
know how you call this it's a
subscription base ten dollars a month
you basically get all the courses now
the free ones are free but at least
you're signed up you get to see the blog
you get to see the comments you get to
talk to people you get to be part of the
community
touch a boy Digital jazz in here what up
son
no so then Mac so then you're actually
in for us is like a two-year college
right college over here is like you know
you go two years for Community College
our web TK said Joe where to donate I
want to send you through send you
through some money listen man I don't
want no no money donate I don't want no
nothing for free
I want to earn it right so the way how
I'm gonna earn is by giving you you know
the best tutorials the best courses so
if you really want to support me and
also want to get something out back not
just free videos from YouTube go to my
website right now coding face.com right
register there's two courses there
there's one that says just a regular
course it's $25 right that's how much
every course is gonna cost except the
one start free of course right so now
then from there this one that says $10
that's the subscription that's a monthly
subscription you're gonna get all the
courses all the files basically
everything that people don't get to see
here on YouTube you get it right and you
get it first because I'm releasing some
of the videos from the courses here on
YouTube but they're not actually gonna
be released every single day like on
over there on my website I have it that
every single day I'm releasing two three
videos automatically here on YouTube
you're gonna get tutorial once a week so
I don't know you could wait 36 weeks to
find the whole the whole tutorial series
or you go to the website you register
and sign up for the course the
subscription $10 a month you support me
and at the same time you get all the
courses automatically and once
yeah
okay how do you measure speed for
example your boss gives you an objective
how you estimate how much time it's
gonna take well for me it's easy because
I've already built almost every type of
application out there so I know how much
is how long it's gonna take me sometimes
it might be quicker because if if I
already did it before I could just go to
a previous code and copy it and just you
know repurpose it for the new objective
then you top it go die new whatever that
your component that the person want but
if it's brand new then I'll be like man
I don't know Oh
once I'm done I'm done you know can
sometimes you think oh something's quick
it's gonna be two three hours next thing
you know it takes you eight hours you
know so unless you've done it before you
can't give an estimate
damn man we got a skype group we gotta
get her group we got a slack group like
man the community is growing man shout
out to your boy Matt he's over here
grinding you know he already earned his

word Matt is like the Matt is
the Matt doesn't exist man Matt is a
 artificial intelligence
 that the community created
he's not a real person that video that
you guys saw it was just you know a
hologram he don't really exist in this
this regular world he's actually a
 hologram man where do where can
I check out Joe's courses man go to go
to coding phase calm right now
go register right the courses are free
I'm putting everything up tonight all
the ones that are free so you basically
gonna get also notifications through
email like hey a new course just came
out check it out was free the ones are
premium they're $25 if you want to buy
individually now if you want every
single course that I released I'm
planning on releasing I think I think

beginning of web development to how to
get a job so where to find a job where
to find freelance job how to go remotely
100% beginnings of JavaScript
intermediate advanced-intermediate of
react beginners of react you know like I
still haven't created the titles for it

courses they old air met you know so
I've been doing this for five years guys
I've been but I actually started when I
was 14 years old so I know the web in
and out and I'm actually working on
multiple companies already so every
single type of scenario
already been through so that's what I
want to give to people I don't want to
come in and be like hey guys let's do it
to do it no because when you go to a job
nobody's gonna tell you hey can you
build me a to-do app right you
want to have projects that are
real life situations and that's what I'm
paying you don't bring it to coding
phase calm so yeah man
sorry guys don't drive I got a
 killing with the soda again and
get extra fat again
okay dr is here all the doctors here
alright yo
Joseph take care man I hope that
everything goes good man
let me know man tomorrow I'm doing
another live show
hopefully the real cast Derrick would
join us yeah it's been my experience
that you don't give a timeframe but if
you have to take whatever timeframe you
come up with
then Tripoli yeah it's always good to
actually come in and tell somebody hey
this thing might take a whole day and
then you finish in an hour they be like
oh sure he killed it you know now if you
tell somebody hey it's gonna take an
hour and then you take a whole day
they're gonna look at you like what the
 man you suck right so real casted
arrow has a good point
make sure you give this video like make
sure you give this a like man that's how
people get to find us here on YouTube
it's like you know you can't be selfish
out here man you you're one of the lucky
ones that found this channel there's
people that don't get the opportunity

you know YouTube don't like people
cursing people that come in here and
swags a tower and drip that sauce on
