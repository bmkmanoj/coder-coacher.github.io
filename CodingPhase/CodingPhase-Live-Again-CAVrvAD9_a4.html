hope you guys doing goodness it's
definitely going to be a holiday on

coding all right I want to see some cool
projects I want to see some cool stuff I
want you to ask to go to my website the
ones I already subscribe or haven't
subscribed it check the description man
get that discount trust me come learn
let's do this together man you know I'm
already good I always tell this to
people that you know somebody tells me
sends me a BS message like oh man like
you know everything you know you should
do everything for free and put it out
for free I'm like yeah I don't put
everything out for free right but if I'm
gonna go and spend hours and hours on
something and then nobody's going to do
it you know when you spend $5.00 it
holds yourself accountable you know you
holding yourself accountable if I hate I
invested into this so I'm going to
finish this I'm going to do this this
course in this tutorial
and for most of me I just do it for free
but the point is that people don't
nobody wants to do anything that's free
you know it's like I was looking at
traversée media channel right and I
love his channel cuz there's a lot of
stuff that I don't have time to look at
or like to learn on my own time so as I
got go through this channel and learn a
couple of little things you know like
right now he released the fetch API 3 go
pretty cool yeah I can't wait till I get
home I'm gonna would go over the video
now how many people go and watch the
tutorials on controversy media out of
all those people that watch it you know
how many people actually do the work not
that many you know what I mean like it's
not because the tutorials is not good
it's just a lot of people we are on
YouTube you know they like to BS I'd
like to around like they like
to just play around like if you if you
see somebody releasing some good
tutorials do it because that person is
doing it for a reason is don't if we
your benefit now here is you know what I
mean so that's what was happening to me
I was like doing a lot of tutorials that
nobody was doing but for some reason now
because they are my website and some of
them are paid now they want to do it
right now they want to register and
finish them Oh anymore you know just go
hard man no I'm gonna live bro I'm good
oh it's just I've been releasing a lot

gonna be a video release every single
every single day of the week next week
and then on Fridays what I'm gonna do
from now on is I'm gonna do like I don't

I did on my website because sometimes
people that die no no from here from
YouTube don't know all the things that
I'm doing you know they'll be like oh we
haven't seen Joe like two three days and
it's like nah if you would have been
gone to the website you would know that
I've been releasing a lot of videos I'm
not a concert so what I'm doing on
Fridays is starting today I'm gonna
release a video later on when I get home
it's gonna be about basically going over
all the things that I've done throughout
the week on my website so it's like it
lets people know exactly what I've been
up to throughout the whole week so like
whenever you don't see me going live or
whenever you don't see me doing you know
this and that
at least you know okay Joe was working
on a new sass course right like I just

what I told you guys that you guys need
a restaurant or real estate you need a
digital agency you need a portfolio you
need a couple of projects right you need
5 projects to get done ecommerce so we
already did the beef store we started
the beef store the beef store is gonna
be finished in the laravel course right
if you follow if you follow me right you
will have all those skills that is gonna
guarantee you to get a job like I swear
to God I just helped out one of my
friends get a job and like I went over
his portfolio helped him fix it up one
over his resume helped him fix it up I
told him to do those five projects that
I told you guys and he got higher in
less than a week he was telling me that
he couldn't find a job for two months
yesterday last night I went over all his
things I had to run two weeks ago to go
and start working on the projects that I
told you guys the restaurant the real
estate digital agency the e-commerce and
his portfolio those five websites and
are we gonna have after he finished all
five projects he got hired because now
he has stuff to show for and but I hate
I can do anything you throw at me
because that's what people really care
about they really care about can this
person come in and you know hit the
ground running instead of us spending
three four months training him you know
what I mean so that's what I'm doing
yeah I'm gonna try to get him in but you
know how people are people are shy
people act like like being on YouTube is
gonna hurt their career or they scared
to you know somebody's gonna find them
online whatever I was like no bro coming
to YouTube it's one of the best things
that I ever did you know it's like
people find me you search my name my
name shows up here in YouTube shows up
here on every social network of like
developers like I'm getting to become
pretty known you know I'm
nothing like I'm famous yet but it's
pretty cool you know I keep getting
messages from people sponsors I got I
just got an invite from from Microsoft
they wanted me to go to an event in San
Francisco I told them I can't go because
I don't live in San Francisco then they
sent me another message was like you
can't go to that one but this one in New
York and we're gonna pay for everything
for you I'm like you don't even have to
pay cuz I live already here so you know
but it's pretty cool um I got a couple
of things coming up I'm going to I meet
up for react native pretty soon I'm
gonna record that for you guys too so
check it out see how it feels to go to a
meet-up you know what I mean so
then I recently make an Adobe XD video I
I think I did a video on Adobe XD a
while back but that's definitely a
course I want to come up with to him but
not just Adobe XD I want to do like you
know I don't know how I should name it
design for developers you know just the
basics you know how to use sketch how to
use Photoshop and how to use Adobe XD
you know every single developer should
know how to at least move the elements
around and the little simple things like
that but yeah man yes I know the videos
lagging I'm sorry that's why I haven't
done no live videos because of that you
know because everybody comes you know
complains about oh my god the quality is
not good I'm like yes I know but what
can I do
it's not my fault I live in the suburbs
I work in the suburbs so it's like it's
not my fault you know yes I'm trying to
get back to the live videos but like I
set up
I'm not cursing I'm not doing so much
crazy stuff like I used to because
number one I'm gonna take this channel
to the next level number two I don't
want you to keep on flagging my videos
like literally I probably lost on them
I don't maybe like 20 videos because you
know I was going too hard I was cursing
too much or whatever they decided to
flag me for so what I'm doing is I'm
keeping things clean you know cuz that's
what pays the bills kids you know
keeping things clean and making sure
that we show up on on the search results
you know because if nobody finds us it's
like I know I'm like a diamond in the
rough meaning like whoever finds this
channel they good
but it's hard to find my channel because
YouTube is not throwing me the same love
and that's fine you know what I mean
like I'm not doing top top 10
programming videos every single day
I'm not gonna talk about view j/s every
single day I'm not gonna go in here and
in constantly hit you guys with you know
fake figure you know fake stuff like I
come in it's like this I can have a good
day's days I have bad days days I have I
want to be creative this days I just
want to chill you know what I mean oh I
just want to talk to you guys some word
hashtag fake coding news let me see

don't answer those I'll be honest I
don't answer it because that's like a
spam from folder like a spam freaking
email like I gave that email out to like
one recruiter and then I guess they
passed me or passed me around like a bat
dot and just pass that email around
everywhere they just keep running trains
on that email so they just keep
sending me a whole bunch of like
different jobs that I don't want so make
sure you send it to coding phase at
gmail.com
what is that I start learning to code I
will say like our 14 I just learned HTML
but I said that's all I really know but
I learned to code for real till the age
of 24 I was mad late I feel I was my
late word no because it's like I'm
telling you guys man
freaking recruiters keep on running a
train on that email that Joe Santos
Garcia gmail.com that keeps that's what
I got it's like they run a bukkake zhan
it like the passing that around and
sending a whole bunch of emails like we
have a job for you here in Austin we
have a job for you in San Francisco
yabba job for you it in Florida we have
a job for you in freaking whatever it's
like oh my god and man thank God I
changed my number like now what I do is

cool guys it's kind of nasty
but yeah definitely I call that the
bukkake email you know that's the email
that you give out once it's already done

that email is done you can't do nothing
with that email that that emails you
stop that emails you stop bro

finding you I'm not gonna find you in
there
you gotta submit decoding phrase at
gmail.com man that emails open son that
 got no walls but freakin see this
water like doing live videos cuz too
much of me comes out in these videos and
then next thing you know I get I get
freaking you know i get banned again
from YouTube you know I can't be out
here man you guys that's why I don't do
the live videos with you guys man I'm
trying to figure out a way to do live
videos I want to do
maybe I'll create another an account
where I'm gonna call it call it coding
phase life like a a channel that I don't
care to curse I don't care to do
whatever you know it's like just for the
hell of it cuz this one's like a more
professional channel you know it's like
I gotta keep it I gotta keep it to a
certain a minimum of like
professionalism you know because I'm a
little bit too much man I got loose you
know once I go live man you know what
happens out here man we we got the
bukkake email we freakin loosed the
loose
I lose like an email a professional
gangbanger I'm out here man I'm out here
this way Gmail keeps on messing with me
Google keeps on messing with me man
I'm out of here I gotta go Brandin ng
what you said let me know what was the
question sorry
let me see Brandon and G says hello Joe
I would like to ask what kind of
portfolio materials or projects resume
should I be prepared to show employers
when applying for a job
cheers Brandon number one you gotta have
a real estate project
number two you wanna have a restaurant
number three you wanna have an
e-commerce meaning a store doesn't
matter what it is if it's selling
sneakers selling t-shirts and whatever
it is number four that's a three for
four should be a digital agency and
number five should be your portfolio
website a website that looks good don't
try to send emails or resumes whatever
to any company with a really bad looking
website you're gonna get skipped I'm
being that it's very rare for people to
just look at your resume and better oh
yeah cool we like this guy because he
went to the school he did this and that
people don't care about that no more
because if they land on your personal
website and it looks bad
people are gonna skip through it and go
oh this guy he don't know what he's
doing he hasn't work with professionals
you want to look as if you work for Nike
as if you work for Google if you work
for you know a vice.com mtv.com
you want to look like you've worked for
major companies you don't want your
website looking like oh this guy we just
found them off the street and he wants
to become a developer you know what I
mean that you really
want this this first impression to look
legit because you got to think about it
like this number one one thing that I
noticed there's a lot of talented
developers out there but they don't know
how to sell themselves there's people
who are more talented than me and they
can't get the job that I can get now
because the I'm better than them they
probably better developers than me but I
know how to sell myself I know how to
basically make somebody comfortable in
the interview I know how to basically
show like hey I've worked for major
companies I've worked for companies that
have tested my skills as a developer and
then I always come out on top
even when it's something difficult I get
it done you know what I mean so that's
what you want to show on your portfolio
when you're looking for a job it doesn't
matter if it's a front-end junior role
if you just front-end create all those
five websites that I told you but you
got to do it yourself
from scratch just go to dribble dot-com
find designs and then just build it it
doesn't matter if it's like real real
websites or not all they really care
about is can you make something that
looks good all right I'll see you guys
later
make sure you check out my website :
face comm subscribe check out the
description I have courses there that
will help you out as a developer alright
guys I'll see you guys later bow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
