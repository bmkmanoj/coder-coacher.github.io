again man continuing this you know
tutorial teaching your CSS that easy
wait the money way make sure you
subscribe and make sure you like the
buttons man make sure you like the bunny
make sure you like the video by clicking
the button you dig
alright so let's get back at it very
simple we're worried okay
so let's learn how to target you know
different elements so say an example we
have a div and then we call this but if
I going to start with this how do we
target a dev right remember that you
target a div by basically going into the
CSS and type in div and then from there
you put in your styles
there's the properties of your styles
that you're putting into it that div but
remember when you just say div it
targets every single one so if we had
you know 20 dips and the page is going
to target every single one you see by
the same example we wanted to target
each one individually so we could
actually go in and put an ID and say hey
ID title and then we could go in and say
class subtitle alright now we could go
in here and say hash tag ID what was the
idea that we gave it hash tag title so
now the other div is there but it's not
being affected by this
you know this properties that you put
into that ID so let's say an example
here you see you have that div and then
you have another one that's invisible
because there's no height in this no
background so we haven't
any styles on it but it's still there
but it's not being affected by the new
properties because we're only targeting
the title the ID with title right okay
so let's say an example we could go in
and put in a subtitle read and then
let's name with 300 pixels height 300
pixels and you see now we're targeting
dollar so if you see here we could be a
specific right now let's say an example
inside of this subtitle right we had a
paragraph don't say whatever you know a
bunch of gibberish inside that that
paragraph right how do we target that
paragraph alone right the way how we
would do this is by doing something like
this will say subtitle and then you put
a space and now you will put in the tag
so what that means is inside of subtitle
and how any paragraph everything well
every paragraph inside of it give this
the style so let's say padding 15 pixels
and then from size 20 pixels you see now
it has that padding and it has the size
now the same example we wanted to target
a div that has multiple classes
let's say side menu and then it has
active so now you could target down say
okay side menu that side menu active
that side
that's not a menu and then active okay
right and then you will say background
then high so we can see it let's make
sure side menu sorry active see now
right now what we're saying is inside of
side menu target active this is not what
we want we want to target side menu
devta has side menu and active as
classes together so what you do is you
basically instead of a space because
remember a space means a child inside of
it so for this we just basically say
okay no space inside of it is going to
give me it's just basically saying okay
a devta has both classes pretty simple
all right
you see how it came up all right
now let's see what else what else can I
teach you guys as far as targeting let's
say an example let's say inside of here
right we say span all right
so now we going more deeper inside of
the you know the paragraph so we have
half of it like this so you coul
understand it you have this one as a
parent
this was the peril of pet ah paragraph
and then paragraph is the parent of span
so you could target that by saying
something like this subtitle paragraph
and then expand now you could go and say
color white no let's make sure you see
so now I target it you know pretty much
what's inside a subtitle I'll say okay
inside a subtitle there's a paragraph
and inside of that paragraph there's a
span and I want to target that word
right so that's how you target you know
inside of it basically nesting just call
nesting right now let's see another
example of targeting let's say let's
look at css3 down to three school
introduction let's say CSS and let's say
I want you guys to get used to coming
here and sometimes looking for stuff so
pseudo classes
what are pseudo classes so the class is
used to define a special state of
anatomy so special state would be
something like let's say hovering when
you you know hover on top of an image or
on top of a div what did what happens
when you know when you hover it alright
so how do you do that right how do you
target that let's say an example we have
side menu active now this one we want to
hover and
change Lenna fat keep it like that right
let's go right under it do something
like a side menu that active and then
hover
now there's the lives
right now when I hover on top of the
violet it's going to turn black you see
that's a state so pretty much it's
pretty much you just controlling what
happens on certain states right so
there's a whole bunch of different song
you know pseudo classes here you know
for hover you got a link when it's a
link when the link is already visited
you could change the color
whenever you hover on top of it now when
it's active you could go active it's
when you click now let's say an example
let's see all the pseudo classes
alright the same example in child this
one's super super useful right you come
in and say hey I want to target I don't
want to target okay there's one two
three there's three dibs
all right now I want to target Dave that
half child I want to target the middle
one so the middle one is the second one
so I will say that in the same 50 pixels
save maybe on typing it wrong example
young so kind of fear okay let's do
something else like this target dead
last
eh all right so onto target
let's say B F child letter sale example
you see so if I take this out all right
never like this
all the the bees is going to be like but
if I turn this one on
the second child pretty much the second
one is going to be red and it's going to
be bigger and I can go ahead and change
it to a third one like that I'll put it
to the first one you know what I mean so
that's how you target you know CSS all
right guys I hope that you guys on the
stood what was going on any questions
make sure you leave a comment and let me
know was this video any helpful you know
you know I kept it pretty simple as far
as hearts on how to target different
elements on a page you know with this
you're going to be able to understand
like okay you could go ahead and target
by you know going in there one by one
and say okay subtitle and inside of
subtitle is a paragraph and a side of
the paragraph doesn't Bank you could do
something like that
or you could say okay if sign manual and
has another class active then targeted
by that or let's assign menu active
hover you know sky's the limit this is
just the basics this is going to
basically open the doors for you to be
able to start styling things all right
guys keeping it simple any questions
make sure to leave a comment and let me
know it's your boy subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
