yeah you know that you guys know that
jay-z just dropped the album I haven't
heard if I'm gonna check it out later
man yeah man welcome to the web
developers lunch break man like by the
way man and your boys live for people
that I don't know cuz some people come
here they watch the feed later on on my
youtube channel they'll be like oh man
the quality is not that great yeah guys
this is live feed you know sometimes you
go under the tree and under the tree
there's no service you know things
happen I wanted to just ask you guys
because you know I just finished right
now my introduction to HTML and CSS
course which is on coding fees.com
you know so you go there and check it
out the coding phase comm kids make sure
you sign up right so I went and created
this course now I was wondering what do
you guys think I should do next
should I do basically a course on
JavaScript or should I do a course on
jQuery I know some people that be like
they wanna they want to get to start
making something as soon as possible
right so it's like if I give them the
whole introduction to JavaScript I feel
like that's more the programming side
some of the people they want to get
starveling something like a slider they
want to start building you know little
things you know they want to add a class
remove a class like you know mess around
with the Dom so I don't know should i I
just go straight to JavaScript or should
I just like you know skip JavaScript
from now and just give them jQuery will
do you guys think you know I know
technically you need to know JavaScript
to understand jQuery but there's a
process I want to switch up that that
process right the process of teaching
people programming right first because a
lot of times when you you're taking a
new course you want to actually see some
results you actually want to see
something happening you know with
JavaScript I mean you can get it done
but I don't know for a brand new
developer beginner somebody who has no
idea what's going on what do you guys
think
yeah man that's why we created this
course but you know some people think
they'd rather learn jQuery first you
know so that's why I'm wondering if I
should just go straight to JavaScript or
should I go straight to the jQuery you
know yeah let me know you know like
right now there's barely anybody online
sometimes you know that's one of the
problems like when I take a lunch break
that's super late like right now now a
lot of people be on the on the feet so
maybe I should start taking lunch breaks
earlier you know one o'clock twelve
o'clock it's a slow day I guess it's
Friday right
so I guess everybody's trying to go out
trying to do something else you're not
thinking about coal right now right I
guess so
but just because fourth of July is
coming guys don't slack man definitely
lost like
it seems like it's dead today man seems
like there's not that many people want
any today actually is like everybody's
out there going to a barbecue a sign
this is dying
this is dying today this freak
today is pretty bad
well you know what we wanna
chill one of the people that's here
people I appreciate this and yeah man
I was just wondering man either jQuery
or going straight to a JavaScript so I
guess I'm gonna go to JavaScript you
know from what you guys are telling me
you're doing cold-smoked can't be a man
that's pretty legit legit course man I
advise everybody to take
yeah I get the sandwich
really
you
like the other boys there
right
I just came week yeah so I gotta
eat it and I just come in for this work
well hopefully I know it
yeah it's not gonna be that bad
think you know give it another month
sweet yeah and like I work at that I was
in the city and some some idiot some
girl she's not
oh yeah I made some special brothers
well I'm not thinking like that really
special brownies like who will bring
that to work you know so this
girl brings that shape and then I just
started like I felt like I was sinking
into the chair started getting
panic attacks was like what the man
it's crazy when I put the job that was
like just pissed cuz I'm like
man I know it's been through some I
died and for that to happen at work I'm
like what the man yeah so then
after that I never yeah I never mess
around with anybody
yeah no I know of course is good
all right so you made it you took yeah
I'm working on Monday I don't know I
gotta ask something how does that work
because supposedly now we have July 4th
off so I don't know we're still working
what the lunch breaks man the feed let
the people come in there's a slow day
today man Andrew you're a very smart man
because you say your preferences view
but you're going to learn or yeah that's
the smartest thing you said today
because trust me you don't want to be
learning
spent mad time of you and then there's
no jobs for you you know usually spend
time on things that's gonna put money in
your pocket man
that was hot as hell right now
alright guys little seals in here man
okay I need an earplug Janna today the
stream is dead today man
seems pretty dead that's not that many
people in him and it's like in and out I
don't know what's going on
