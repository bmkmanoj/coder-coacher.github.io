joke back at it again man listen code
and face calm your already know boy
listen
alright so people be asking me hey man
how do you apply for a job especially
when they ask them for 30,000 thanks man
well guys like what you gotta know is
that that's just a wishes you know when
you see an employee asks before this
person gotta know object-oriented
programming functional programming
30,000 different languages HTML CSS
JavaScript Python freaking ruby are us
development they might even throw
Android development like nobody has all
of those skills I mean there might be a
guy you know somewhere and some basement
that is just pretty much doesn't have a
personal life and just freaking try to
learn every single thing under the Sun
but reality he doesn't know anything
because he spread out so much that he
don't know well you know there
might be a guy like that but for you
guys don't worry about what it says in
the description like you know if it's 20
items right and you have several of
those skills you're fine if you have
five of them skills you're fine just
apply for it because what it's telling
you is that's what like what they really
want for somebody to have but will they
get that no it's just like a wish list
right when you acts for Santa you feel
like Santa send me you know 30 girls and
with him tick booties and 73 Xbox ones
and send me you know a flat screen TV
and a brand new 4k camera will Santa
give you that know Santa's gonna come
through and gonna give you like here man
here's a couple of socks that's how it
is for employees so I did throw out this
freaking long list of things that they
want and will they get it
not really you know so for you guys as
the ones that are applying for the job
is you got a dinner weather like this
you gotta say hey I got a look at the
list see how many things I actually have
for me if I have at least 45 percent of
whatever's on the list then gear apply
for it of course you're not gonna apply
for something that it's like hey senior
level 10 years of experience and this
dis isn't this right don't apply for it
cuz one you're gonna look stupid
that's one so when you go sort of
interview they're gonna make you feel
stupid so just don't do it right now for
junior developers if it says developer
or front-end developer or it says junior
developer or junior front-end or junior
back-end apply for those jobs that means
you have a very large chance that you're
gonna get picked are you gonna get hired
you have to understand and so many
people out here right start doing
development but not everybody is
actually applying for jobs or everybody
is actually going for those top jobs at
Google or Facebook most of those guys
don't get into those companies right so
it's like they spend it the whole time
trying to apply for this large company
like you know I know somebody who try to
apply for Google for like ten years like
what the hell like if they don't want me
the first time I'm not applying for
again even after my skills are even much
better like I don't need to be in a
place where I already got shut down you
know I mean like they're not that
important you know so yeah but for you
guys just go ahead man just apply it's
not gonna hurt you to apply it's not
gonna hurt you to go to the interview
cuz you have to understand for me when I
when I started applying for jobs I
started applying for like big companies
right I didn't get hired like of the
first time I got hired on my fourth
fourth time that I went to a different
job interview why because the first one
I was lost I didn't know what the hell
was gonna know and I was like nervous
and I don't even know how to answer the
questions then I learned from that one
the second one I was like okay I'm gonna
show up what I'm a little bit better but
then when I got there they were looking
for somebody who had more experience
they'll say hey you're a great candidate
you know never made like okay and the
only issue is you don't have that much
experience so then I'll say okay now I
have to cut down on different type of
applications right so I have to apply
for companies start looking from one to
three years so then I start applying for
those companies then they call me up and
then they call me up again then a second
interview and for whatever reason didn't
hire me and that was fine I was okay
cool and then I apply for this
ecommerce website so it was an
e-commerce company called ZM
distribution it was like a eBay
wholesaler and pretty much they called
me back I you know I replied to them and
I went in and I said I got the job
