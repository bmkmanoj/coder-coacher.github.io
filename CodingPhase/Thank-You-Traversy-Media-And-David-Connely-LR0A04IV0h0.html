weeing here live once again chillin with
my peoples ceiling with the squad put on
the seat belt to be safe
the full at least we gotta have our seat
though so it'll get a double ticket all
right so I just want to say yo thank you
to traversée media you know for being
the first youtuber with a larger
audience and just emitting and just
being cool you know leaving a comment
and just be like here man
I've been subscribed to you I've been
watched your videos and you know and
it's good because it's somebody that I
respect
somebody I've seen do I remember him
when he didn't have that many
subscribers but I know him from adronis
from a couple of courses from I believe
is on udemy I haven't really put none of
his courses up as one of my recommend is
because the courses that I've taken from
work
the high colistin ojs and I had already
taken an OG yes from this guy called
steel but his course is pretty good too
I actually wanted to review and find out
if he had a laravel course cuz people
constantly asked me do I know any good
laravel courses right and I will say hey
just check on YouTube or check Larry
cast and there's plenty of people that
have good courses for laravel for free
right and also premium others right but
I just want to say thank you time you
know because it feels good it feels good
that you know somebody else doing you
know a little better than me and doing
their thing and you know just the fact
that you know when when I came into this
thing I wanted to get love from other
other youtubers and other peers right
and you know I really never reached out
to him traverse the media because I had
such a bad experience with like two
other youtubers who probably two three
you too
who were here before me and I just felt
like man this dude's or assholes right
like they get a couple of subscribers
and they've been here for three four
years or five years and then they hit
you up with some crazy responses where
you're like what you know what I mean
like I'm just creating content here you
know at me so I never reached out to
them
I never really reached out to traversing
media because of because I was like man
I don't know if the dude is gonna be
cool I don't know if the dude is just
gonna be like man I got so much
subscribers I'm not even gonna speak to
you you know what I mean some people do
that you know you know what I mean so
definitely much respect for him and I
appreciate it also - I'm gonna say thank
you to David Connelly is a new youtuber
he's been around for a minute but he did
a top I think
top five top ten you know youtubers that
people should actually subscribe to like
what developers who people should
subscribe to and I really like what he
did for me he basically added me to it
he basically added me to it and so to
his list right I really appreciate it so
that was pretty cool man and I just you
know I enjoyed it I enjoy his review of
my channel and you know he got his own
swag he got some pretty cool pretty cool
 man like like he's like funny he
has a little bit comedy a little bit of
informational like his channel is pretty
cool - David Connolly I appreciate it
you know I appreciate that people
mention me once in a while they they
mention me on their on their videos man
that's what I'm here for
I'm not here people act like people's is
here like to become a millionaire I'm
not here for it to become a millionaire
I'm here to just I use this like
I don't know like a way to help other
peoples and also at the same time for
network network with other developers
like I told you guys from the beginning
I don't hang out with nobody that does
cold so basically all my friends they're
not into this they find this boring
nerdy you know know what my friends do
this they do other you know
what I mean so I come here when I come
and hang out with you can hang out with
your boy bit cold hang out with your boy
84 like it feels good because these
other people are into the that I'm
into you know what I mean so that's why
I love coming here to YouTube and I
really appreciate it for somebody that
that they use axe Hey what the
traversée du I mean he didn't do
nothing he just basically left the
comment show love you know show love saw
a video that he enjoyed and he agreed
with and left a comment which to me is
great you know it shows that he's
watching the video he understands what I
was trying to say in the video he enjoys
it he told me he's been subscribed for a
while which is great to know because
sometimes you'd be like man I wonder if
this youtubers day they also watch my
channel cuz I watch everybody's channels
right at some point I stop watching
people's channels because if I feel like
you're taking my sauce or taking my
ideas then I automatically put
notifications off I don't want to see a
channel I don't want to know anything so
I don't get mad right
but traversing media's tutorials I've
been watched them traversing MIDI is
like you know he's like almost at the
same level as was this guy's name Banas
banana banners I forgot his name like
they drop really quality videos on
YouTube you know and thousands of people
watch them
you know they got the market man you
certain arable you're gonna see
traversing Michigan you're gonna see sir
it's JavaScript nodejs angular you're
gonna see Traverse immediately he's
killing it right now - as far as the
tutorials man I don't think anybody's
dropping quality tutorials I came on
YouTube but you know like I said
thinking he does this like full-time you
know so you know more power to him I'm
trying to get to that point where I'm
just doing this full-time man you know
drop my own courses my website is there
: face calm the first course is almost
done it's basically done it's just one
last video that I'm doing tonight
because I decided I'm gonna rerecord it
cuz I didn't like the way how it came
out of like you know the audio on it so
I'm rerecord in it and that's fine then
releasing it to you guys then we're
doing the JavaScript learning JavaScript
you know we're real-life examples so
that's where we are right now and yeah
man
I just love getting you know getting
recognition and having other people come
in and show love to say what how show
love you know what I mean like I do this
 all the time
people people could could go back to my
videos to my first video
I'm giving love to everybody I'm
shouting out other people's you know
what I mean it's only right so when
people do that for me - I really
appreciate it because they don't have to
now everybody in this world is nice now
everybody in this world wants to give
any type of recognition to other people
sometimes people think you're a
competition when I'm like no I'm not no
I'm nobody's competition because
nobody's doing what I'm doing you know
what I mean I'm so it's like I'm on my
own name I'm completely different I'm
doing something different my channel is
about you know teaching people how to
code teaching people in a in a real way
meaning like zero yes I curse
yes I come in and don't edit my videos I
could come in and start editing my
videos like Oh chop it up or if I say a
chop up the UH but I don't because the
point of it is just to be real with you
know what I really I don't know so it
was really good to know that you know he
understands it he understands what I'm
doing here and doesn't take it like oh
I'm competition I'm dissing that like
man I hate that word you know
he's like we're youtubers when
we were sharing cool on this world
man you know this videos is gonna be
here forever so long as there's internet
and there's Google this videos gonna be
here forever so people gotta always be
able to come back and look at our lives
you know it's like when I came into this
 I didn't have what is great hair so
you know what I mean it's like now I'm
getting great hearings your boys getting
old swirling is gonna be all great hairs
you know so you're gonna see the
progression but we ain't here man
okay so what's the question man tell me
what's the question man and bit cold by
the way man Thank You Man thank you for
for the donation man you always he was
actually the first one I don't know if
it was you there was a girl who who gave
the first donation I can't remember
exactly her name I'm trying to remember
I don't know if it was Barbara it was
somebody who was here from the beginning
and then Big Coal was the second one
so whatever dual donation in this
channel I would help out this channel so
he got a very good spot in this channel
like he's he's one of those people that
I'm always gonna remember because
sometimes you come here and you you do
this every day you do cool for
people and like you know you don't get a
thank you you don't get a like is a
great now we got 30 people in here and
we got six likes you know what I mean
so it's like we don't get anything back
out of this right all we get is just
that 1% that 2% of people who come in
and say thank you so those people were
the the people that motivate us to
continue doing this every single day you
know what I mean so that's what we had
what up Jerry
I see you okay lol Greek say Joe do you
think dependency dependency on paid
tutorials can flood the industry with
consumer like coders instead of doing
their own work are readily available
resources they would look where it's
spending money I don't understand the
question if the question is people
flooding the industry with tutorials I
don't think I don't think that is
they're flooding it because number one
most of the people that start making the
tutorials they quit after a month right
cuz it's hard it's hard to do this
every single day it's hard to record
this every single day
right so they quit you know so when they
released a video if it's not doing good
people quit and I know whatever I'm not
doing this again right but there's
a few amount of people who come in and
then they go hard create satorious great
videos for people and let's say you like
my tutorials right but you'd be like oh
I love his tutorials right but he's good
for HTML CSS but he sucks for JavaScript
now you go online and you search for
somebody who's good on JavaScript so I
don't think the industry is gonna get
flooded was going to get flooded which I
hate and I you know I don't mean this in
a bad way to any of the Indian
developers out there but I hate when a
new technology just came out like let's
say an example right now is laravel 5.4
somebody comes in and creates a tutorial
like from India laravel 5.5 just came
out that same day and somebody already
did a course on it that
pisses me off because it's like you
don't know the 5.5 right you
don't know it yet so why are you
teaching it and then on top of that it's
not the same quality so that was the
thing that that that really pissed me
off you know but besides that I don't
think it's gonna get flooded man got
your boy Chris Shawn in here man I'm
supposed to you know bump into Christian
man we're supposed to work on sine but
we can't figure out a date
hit him with it dad I can't dad I'm a
righty I can't dive with the left you
know what I mean I'm just a ain't your
wing here having fun man yeah traverse
the media he's cool man I like him he's
doing his thing like I heard of him
a long time ago from Ed wanax and I'll
be honest there was like one video I
think I don't know if it was him or
somebody that they like 10/10 quick apps
for no Jes and I did hate that tutorial
right I'm not gonna lie cuz I don't like
to I hated that tutorial but
that was like so old ago like so
old and so long ago that now when I I
seen his tutorials on YouTube I'm like
yo dis to killing arena he
 improved like like he has
everything order now there's no mistakes
like everything is legit so he's like
the the tutorial that I watch the video
that I watched was like super old it's
like right now people might come in and
see one of my tutorials from like the
html/css building the portfolio right
even though people like it to me that's
my worst tutorial right that I ever did
and people's gonna be like oh we love it
but to me I know it was bad so with time
I've improved which is what you're
supposed to do if you do something every
single day and you continue to improve
upon it you're gonna get nicely you know
so I feel like traversing media right
now he killed the game he out of
everybody that's that's on YouTube right
now as far as tutorials give a free
content his is probably the best ones
how he does it but he's definitely
 killing it and that's one of the
reasons why I was like you know I meant
I'm not gonna be on YouTube doing
tutorials no more I'm gonna take my
I'm gonna take my skills to two other
places because here I feel like he
already got that market controlled and
like Google soon as that you put up a
tutorial it doesn't matter what it is
it's gonna be traversing media it's
gonna be like number one he already took
it so that's why I stopped putting
tutorials on YouTube this is annoying
it's annoying here already got
everything he already did everything
that's why thank God I got crystal lane
so before anybody start doing
tutorials on crystal lane I'm the first
one that did it right and when I
researched crystal Ling at least I get
down I get that keyword at least I get
down right Christian got web
developer Christian got that in a
chokehold that you don't want to
let go of that keyword he's like yo I
got that on the chokehold
right now what developers my Google gave
it to him Google gave him the title you
know what I mean I think angular for
whenever you search angular for is uh
what's this guy's name is traversing
media but there's another guy he's like
a Russian dude damn I forgot his name
man it's not much it's something else
but they're fighting it out right now
they're fighting for that keyword right
now one of them is gonna win it we don't
know who my bet is on traversing media
because you know is I feel like to me
it's better cut better contents is
better put together you know and for
some people the the Russian accent it is
a turn-off you know
oh yeah man
f DFS what up MA how's everything how's
life
yeah man it's good it's good I think
it's good to to have that you know like
half the community know each other and
they you know bump into each other you
know and do something good work together
that's how I feel about it
right that's our feel body I feel like
we should all work together cuz no
matter what we're still gonna get
subscribers people is gonna find us
right Google's algorithm might throw
people to their way for certain things
might throw them to other channels for
another thing right but people are still
gonna find you it doesn't matter like
the way how YouTube works is you usually
have with a little slump where you go up
and then you come back down and then
when you come back down there for names
you stay steady it just goes up up up
and then you'd be good you know what I
mean so right now as far as like YouTube
my went a little bit down which is
fine and it got steady other like 900
900 150 subscribers a month which is
fine but then that just goes up
they know so we leave here man
yeah man I'm kill him
we got a killer with the you know a
little little shirt man
yeah no that's that's the one that
everybody's loving right now I think
people are loving it right now
loving that video where you know you
don't have to be a nerd you don't have
to be a weirdo you just you could be
just a regular dude who in this you know
the summertime you ride around a
Harley Davidson motorcycle
whatever ninja Kawasaki you know you
could be like a a badass all
right dude full of tattoos and still be
a a good developer you don't
have to be this this weird person that
people think that that's what a
developer is somebody told me one time
to like so you're not the typical
developer I'm like yes I know because
you think that developers are like that
not everyone's like that you know
oh yeah man yeah man somebody I want
everybody go tell go tell rules Barry
I'm looking for tell her it's a high
jump so high Joe from coding face is
looking for you mock just tell her like
