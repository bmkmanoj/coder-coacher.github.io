part which is to come here and build
this image right and also I'll create
this section here so maybe we should
just do this section first before we
even focus on the image or maybe just do
the image I don't know either way is
fine it's completely fine okay so let's
go into content area okay let's go to
the home and inside the content area we
have the user image and the profile all
right so let's do the profile for now
and say something like this okay profile
okay
I'm gonna call this profile section and
I'm gonna come back to the index.html
and copy the div and put it like this
profile section okay close the div okay
and come here and we're gonna say I'm
gonna separate this so we got the
content area and inside of the content
area they're going to do a padding all
right so we're gonna say content area
padding of 35% okay okay that's a little
bit too much let's say padding area of
20% yeah seems more mark better or maybe
a little 25%
okay now while I was this all the way
coming all the way down here okay
yeah the padding is kind of ridiculous
so we got to put in padding:0 top of top
and bottom okay yeah that was a little
bit too much okay so let me see it I
mean expect this element why is this
element so ridiculously huge so I'll
just put in zero and zero okay so this
shouldn't be zero so this should be zero
zero and then 25 percent okay now the
reason why this thing is going so
overboard because we don't have
something that is crucial to our designs
and that's box-sizing so we want to make
sure we say box size in the border box
so if we say whiff is 65 percent of the
screen it means we want it to be 65
percent no matter what the padding is no
matter what the borders are this thing
is supposed to be 65 percent currently
how we had it before by default with CSS
if you don't have this box size and
setup it'll add let's say 25% of this
thing plus another 25% because another
25% so it's like it's a mess so always
do this especially when you're gonna
work with specific sizes or you want to
work with our responsive design what
this does is it makes sure that you
basically whatever you say with 100% or
like let's say if you put a box and you
see the width of this box
is a hundred pixels doesn't matter if
you add a padding doesn't matter if you
add anything inside of it it would never
grow any bigger than a hundred pixels
when it's on by default when you take it
off you start seeing weird stuff this
way is like wait what you see like
currently the inside of it is going to
be I believe forty five percent so now
you got forty five percent plus that
twenty five percent okay you want the
box size and to calculate that for you
so you say hey I want 25 percent in here
but the wave of this element should
never go past the sixty five percent
that we already set okay so if you
haven't noticed that before or you
haven't found out about this go check
out the freaking HTML basics like
literally if we check it out HTML CSS
alright cool
now what's the next thing we got this
thing we got this image the stupid image
it's not stupid it's just a large image
so what we're going to do is we're gonna
say let me see how should we do this
we're gonna say something like this
see yes CSS fullscreen background
I know how to do this guys but I just
hate writing everything so I just copy
it if you guys have seen my tutorials
you know I always copy this thing a
million times I never write this thing
on my own because it's annoying there's
no point of me writing it down
okay so content area okay where's the
logo logo logo was a logo or user image
okay main user image why is a content
area profile section you see profile
section profile okay you got a profile
section profile where is the image
images outside so user image it's
outside okay okay what's the issue now
okay I've seen server running see this
the only thing that I hate about parcel
it doesn't give you good sass or even
JavaScript errors at all it just doesn't
tell you why did it break that's really
annoying so for you guys that are gonna
use parcel get used to that
and you used to figuring out that hey
parcel doesn't really want to give you
any good errors okay so it works when we
do this but what's the problem when we
come in and paste this inside this
should work let me see
Jesus Christ Ronnie's to eat I don't
know it's hard picking images I think
it's always going to be hard to pick
images it's one of the most annoying
things because if like you're trying to
find the right one let's pick this girl
she's gotta be makes some asian asian /
whatever Russian all right tell me not
okay so let's figure out what the hell
is the issue here okay so the issue was
the stupid image right okay so that was
the issue now let's come here and put in
the size so we're gonna say with say 35%
height 100% let's see if this works say
500 pixels okay I guess not profile
was to use their image jealousy was the
issue here we stop this run npm run
watch one more time see if if it's
giving me a facial okay
why isn't this user - image showing up
it's inside a profile section and we
look at it again got content area user
image okay so it's not inside a profile
section it's outside so it's right under
content area okay
now let's remove fixed okay
okay so I got this image right now how
can we make this happen so from here to
here alright so maybe we can come here
and instead instead of using the padding
user image stead of using the margin
left of 35 pixels that we have currently
no that's fine
that margin left is fine okay the wave
65% okay the padding instead of using
that let's see how we can make this
happen okay we could say user image and
I say image container and put the user
image in there so have more control of
it so I can put this in there and say
div class image container
okay got that
so miss container use their image you
wanna say with 25% we gonna say
display:inline-block playing my block
and then on this profile section gonna
say display:inline-block gonna say with
75% no way this doesn't make sense
okay so we have this image here okay you
want this image to actually be in
between this tool so you got the content
area okay okay so that's fine got that
in this container which is this okay so
this is fine all right this is a little
bit difficult to put this how I want it
it was container there's the profile
section because I could control this
image and say okay I see your full
section image container
display:inline-block user image so we
have this user image we got the wave 25%
which is fine
this user image we could come here and
say something like this you see before
the image container position:relative
okay and then this one I come here and
say position:absolute and say left- 200
pixels okay so there you go that's what
we wanted to do okay left 200 pesos 200
pixels okay now let me see what else
okay
no cool boys we definitely gotta do
stuff once we start working on the site
responsibly but for this you can make
this say the height go say calc 100% - I
was a 56 plus 56 is 112 so sometimes
that's why this JavaScript is like so
good because it saves you from all this
retardedness Missy position relative
height 100% okay
all right there you go kids so that's
why we wanted to do okay it's what we
want it
I understand this profile okay its
profile section vertical line on top
because we wanted to start from the top
and then we want to control it
here okay now next thing that we want to
do is we want to say we want this to be
top 56 pixels and there you go now we
have that margin which is 50 so well
that pattern that's around here 36
pixels and the image itself is
calculating itself to be 56 pixels of
the current location and then the width
of this is always gonna be 25% let's
make this instead of 25% we're going to
say 30% and then for the user was a
profile section just need to split with
65% margin left you see ya think that's
fine
now the user image let's make this top
56 with let's say 500 pixels okay now to
calculate this let me see the width the
full width of the screen I like it when
it's are 500 pixels right
I'm gonna say what's the full strength
full whiff of this thing okay currently
is 19 by 19 so let's say 500 times 100
divided by 19 19 is twenty six point
zero five so let's make instead of the
whiff to be found your pixel let's say
25 percent is the size of the whiff a
furnace user image oh so that's not good
because now is doing 25 percent of the
current container which is not what we
want
so let's say 400 pixels from there we
can fix that with JavaScript later on if
we really want to dig deep into this
thing okay okay see ya left 300 pixels
let's say 250 pixels yeah all right kids
this is how it is man is how it is when
you gotta align things now and all our
peoples gonna be like man you know you
could try some flex boxes yeah you could
try so CSS grid yes you could try this
this Annette but there is a big but the
problem with using CSS grid for a
situation like this is that it just
wouldn't work and wouldn't work in this
situation because this isn't a sea
says great problem this isn't a flexbox
problem maybe we could have use flex
boxes here to align this to the bottom
and maybe align this to the top that we
could use flex boxes here we could use
flex boxes to align this thing to be in
the center of this area but at the same
time using position it's very powerful
for a situation like this because this
isn't like a regular website you know
what I mean like you can't use CSS grid
in Flex boxes in certain situations like
this are very specific locations where
the designer wants this to be placed at
you know what I'm saying so if you have
to be in that situation then you have to
be able to position it to the right
places okay so that's what's going on
here
all right kids I hope you guys enjoyed
this video maybe learned a couple of CSS
tricks that maybe you didn't know about
and yeah I'll see you guys in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
