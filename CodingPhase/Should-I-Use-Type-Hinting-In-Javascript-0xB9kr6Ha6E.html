Jeff Jeff your boys back
I don't did it again one more time live
for the lunch break alright guys so
today's topic for this lunch break is
should I be using type hinting in
JavaScript um the more I use javascript
the more I realized that the language
itself is just a clusterfuck you know
when I first started programming all the
old man Java scripts the best you could
do in a browser you could just use the
console logging and everything is
amazing but the more experience I become
the more I realized how bad over
language it is and there's so many
errors on run time there's like so many
shit that could go wrong that don't even
give you the right error messages and
now I guess I'm becoming an adult now
I'm becoming a fucking adult now like
now I'm starting to use type hinting
so today I've set up my my development
system or my development I'm a
development system by development kick
my environment to start using flow if
you guys haven't heard of it flow is
like this size system type hinting
system made by Facebook the good old
folks of Facebook all right so they came
up with this thing some people use this
da props Michael to type props or how
you call a forgot I'm sorry
I'm hungry I'm hungry I'm sleep-deprived
but yeah some people they use it with
react you know basically prop types
right sorry
yeah prop types but we've just Java
scripting all your your scripts that you
might be working on in the future I
would consider using float I started
using it today I actually download it no
Clyde I think no Clyde that's how you
say it from Facebook which is also a
plugin for atom which gives you a whole
bunch of new features right it's like
it's an IDE on top of atom I don't know
if you guys have tried it yeah messed
around with it or not but it seems
pretty legit you know oh yeah so I'm
actually gonna start using type in tune
with my code more often because it just
makes your code cleaner and you know
exactly what's going on because
sometimes you know you're putting a
number right you put in let's say the
number two but for some reason somewhere
and your code is being changed to a
string so it's a string of the number
two and you're like what the hell why is
this thing not working now you can
actually know exactly what's wrong with
it
so like let's say if it's if it's a
number if it's a string if it's a object
whatever it is all right so yeah but
that's what I'm doing that I became an
adult now I'm now I'm like one of those
old old developers who who like type
hinting into into their code you know
it's funny because a long time ago I saw
like I think it was C sharp or C++ and
I'm like oh my god you gotta declare
every single type of variable like this
shit sucks but now as I get older and I
start to get into more complex projects
I realize how important that is like it
saves you so much time even for those
people that are using typescript like
type script is good too you know reason
I don't use typescript is because number
one is from Microsoft that's
automatically a no-no for me that's a
and no-go
I ain't using that from Microsoft
because all the fucking products suck
and that's just being honest now then
from there what else angular so angular
2 uses typescript and it just doesn't
call for me you know it doesn't call me
at all it doesn't catch my interest at
all so yeah but flow I could definitely
mess with mess with it
alright you guys should check it out too
all right so let me say what I'm so
everybody in here let me see Matt what
up what's wrong with you why you sick
son yeah you good we got to get my boy
my boy Matt a soup Barbara go go take
your boy Matt some soup man this is your
burden angling right now take care of
your boy man your boy met you probably
catching a cold or something you know is
the weather change kit
so what is it what is it that you have
met I don't know you got anything why
you ain't tell me son
Oh
note
yeah no definitely it just feels better
you know when you're yearning when
you're like a brand-new developer you
don't care about typing thing or you
don't care about static typing at all
like you don't care about that but the
bigger the project is the more like shit
is gonna happen like some shit is gonna
fuck up something is going to mess up
somebody's gonna put in a string when
it's not supposed to and it's like at
least now you know where the errors are
coming from
yeah man you just gotta chill you gotta
I gotta be careful out here man do you
really need yarn yarn is going to be so
much better than using NPM but Jones if
you're having so much issues with uh
with yarn you don't have to use yarn you
can just use NPM like let's say all the
packages that I have them on my project
you could just say NPM install and does
the same thing got out here little
pretzel
you know don't mind me it's lunch break
what up 84 kale okay
I mean you got to learn JavaScript if
you learn jQuery you pretty much know
JavaScript but you got to know is just
from JavaScript itself is like a couple
of little things you know like query
selectors and shit like that arming even
at that man
like once you know the basics of the
language you're good like you don't have
to become an expert on on JavaScript at
all I don't think this is like mandatory
unless you're like specifically like a
UI developer like you're only working on
the front end Clarence what up what up
what up
hey busy ran would op side
what is the best stack beforehand
developer I mean it's just HTML CSS in
JavaScript like that's the front-end
stack that's it I will say yeah angular
or react one of those two you gotta try
both of them and see which one you like
currently listening to the hottest
mumble rapper's word
any good courses I have have a good
course that I took for c-sharp damn I
wish I remember the guys name but I have
on my thing I'm gonna put it in the
comments later
give me like half an hour once I get
back to the sorta office
I'm gonna put it here in the description
for you
what is the tick you're gonna be on your
udemy course I don't know I mean I'm not
trying to charge more than $5 $10 but
like I like I said before I'm not doing
a udemy course until maybe like next
year you know like I'm gonna do it this
year but might not release it till next
year just because I want to take my time
I really want to I want to do what you
know cold steel does he goes and creates
a course like every year every two years
like that's something that I would like
to do you know like those are my my
inspirations my people who influenced me
cold steel Steven Grider was boss I like
Wes Bose I haven't really taken any of
his paid courses but I think what he
does and the way he market himself like
I would love to be that guy you know
he's making like half a million he
probably makes a million dollars already
just off like teaching people cold and
he's he's big-time
Bizzy ran is like yo I got time today
boy ain't got time yesterday boy I got
time today
the new course from Colts Colts neo is a
cold steel's new course for my sequel is
amazing I'm doing a full review I think
on Saturday I'm gonna release it I
already did the review I'm just I have
other videos lined up for the week
they're gonna be released once one video
a day so yeah
that's coming on Saturday for sure
your goal angus is great it's great
language but the syntax it's not good
the syntax on it it's kind of ugly it's
pretty much really ugly plus the thing
too is that there's really no no good
good course to learn golang most of the
people who are learning Golding they
already know multiple languages you know
so they perform you know they're
professionals people who have been doing
this for a while now for brand new
developer out on office golang is like
the perfect language for you guys
because right now it's just there's not
enough resources for it like there's
nobody really teaching it that's really
good I was talking to Steven Grider he
was telling me that he might be
releasing a course in go lang and I say
young please do like I feel like when he
released of course that's why I'm a
learn going cuz everybody else bores me
yes sir
that's why I tell people like you gotta
take the courses man and not only are
the course is going to make your life
easier but they're going to teach you so
much

Beth I don't know what happened to Beth
I hope she's okay I hope she don't give
up on coding who else Andre he knows how
to program he works as a developer
already so he knows his thing he just
needs to improve the front-end and not
to cheat because he's like he came in
where you know something that a
framework like a bootstrap framework
that already did all the work for him
it's like bro you're not gonna learn
like that it's like I could come in here
