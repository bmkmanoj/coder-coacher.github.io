first one today I'm actually gonna do
you know lunch break number one all
right we starting it up kids
what up Matt was good son lunch break
man
much-needed lunch break most people take
lunch breaks really early for some
reason like they take lunch breaks like
11 o'clock well I feel like I like to
take late lunch breaks because number
one when I come back is already you know
2 o'clock 2:00 p.m. so then I have only
3 hours left of work and then from there
I get to go home so I don't know I feel
like it makes the day go faster when I
eat early in the morning or like early
12 o'clock it feels like I still got a
long day to go you know but yeah man I
want to know what's go with you guys
today man let's pop it
man yo tonight we're gonna do you know a
quick get together with the mentees the
squad that I have for you know the
programming mentorship let's see what
what they up to let's see what what they
got done in one week hopefully you know
now everybody has to get everything done
but hopefully they they got pretty far
you know hopefully Bev already has her
first homepage done
at least some HTML done I have high
hopes for her and for him I think she
she could definitely kill this so let's
see how it goes see let me see if I get
better reception back here this is
actually not that bad
Oh shoo I think I found my new location
with the record videos of my lunch break
oh okay oh I'm hype I guess nobody comes
back here and this is hot and then I
could actually do whatever the hell I
want up here this is cool let me see
Oh err from the top I still don't know
how to work this thing you know there's
so many buttons on the freakin apartment
like okay I know this thing is to change
to manual you know change speed I still
don't know which one is the one up here
I know this now I know this is this for
that let me see what else can I do with
this okay alright I just learned some
new okay guys yeah well let me see
what's up with everybody yo it's my my
quality better up here I think I got
like four four bars today back here is
my quality actually better back here
holy
now I know my spot so I can make my live
videos how's the quality today man let
me know oh shoot we got a new spot side
we got a new spot this is what we're
gonna do the videos from now on this is
like the backyard of of the you know
this the store that I usually go you
know you got a little dirt out here
we've got your boy out here you know
looking through the window yeah man
word 3 2014 I'm liking the new ride I'm
loading this I was actually gonna
buy a Maserati and the reason why I
didn't buy it was because the payments
would have been like a thousand
something and I don't know I just don't
feel comfortable for some reason like
spending a thousand dollars on a car
every month I don't know because I still
feel like you know a thousand dollars to
me was like two weeks of work you know
back in the days so it's like for me to
spend that much money on a car it just
don't make sense you know so if I do get
a Maserati maybe next year I'll just buy
it I'll put a big down down payment
because it just doesn't make sense for
me to pay a dollar something for a car
yeah now I mean even right now I'm
paying like 765 for this car a month and
it's good uncomfortable you know what I
mean so but I still think several
hundred dollars is a lot of money I
still think that that's a lot is a 2015
ML 350 I think EMS 765 I mean I did
finance it I did buy it it's not like
I'm listening I'm not renting it so it's
like it's mine I could do whatever the
hell I want
I could put tinted windows all up in
this bitch I could put a booming sound
system if I want to I could do whatever
the hell I wanna put as much miles is I
want into this you know cuz it's
mines that
but yeah man well why don't like I feel
like BMWs I never like I feel BMWs is
like it's like I don't know I feel like
BMWs are oh no I feel like they like
kind of ratchet it's like it's like BMWs
is kind of ratchet to me I don't know
I'm never opinion to BMWs every time
that I see a BMW is like no no I just
feel like anybody could get in that you
know
yeah the x6 is nice x-axis is definitely
nice I just don't like being dumped with
the brand the brand itself I just don't
like it but yeah man so what you guys
are up to man what you guys are working
on right now
what a porch yeah portions are good but
I don't know I like SUVs that's one
thing I like my SUVs I like feeling high
you know I like feeling like I'm sitting
on you know 20 inch rims I'm chillin
that's how I like to feel okay doing the
coke coke course working your portfolio
dang what up you boy dang in Australia
what time is in Australia right now it's
like nighttime right
damn 3 o'clock in the morning what the
hell you doing up there go to sleep you
up at this time boy boy if you don't go
to your bed right now put it out this
belt I'm playing nah man nah that's good
I mean I used to do that all the
time go to sleep late I still do it
oh you finished Matt you finish
your project already you ready for
tonight
where'd the way work at I work all over
the world yeah go to my link thing find
my linkedin man look it up
oh sure Emil that's what's up I did my
first interview for a temp job and they
said that a computer science was
necessary
Emil that's don't listen to
them if they really wanted to hire you
they will hire you
when they tell you that it's sometimes
they there's companies that they want to
put a certain limitation on the people
that they want to hire so they tell you
all if you would have went in there with
a computer science degree they would
have told you oh you will need two three
years of experience and then you would
have went in there with two three years
of experience that woulda came in like
oh we're actually looking for a senior
level sometimes they just say just
to to just say hey we don't we don't
want you it's that simple
but it doesn't mean that you can't get a
job you're going to be able to get a job
trust me I guarantee it there's a lot of
jobs out here especially for women they
definitely want women in the field right
now it's getting the same as github no
it's not dinner is like a service that
you could if you have a github project
and like people want to have a chat
about your github project then you
create that project you create that
getter getter lobby I think that's the
name of it and then that's it it's just
a chatroom it's the same as slack
it's the same as whatsapp it's the
same shares everything else that's out
there it's just a regular chat room only
difference is that you can log in with
your github that's it
make sure you join the getter yeah yo
ray get your cut and get your nephew in
this thing man trust me tell him man
this were the future is that he doesn't
have to be like the smartest
person in the world it's just about
dedication it's just like every other
job that's out there if you like it
you're going to be successful now you
could also hate it and still work on it
there's a lot of people who work as
developers and they hate the job but
they get paid very well so it's like
even if you hate it you're still gonna
be good
and of course it's not always about
money but man if you could live
comfortably why wouldn't you why would
you want to take a career that it's not
guaranteed that you could find a job or
it's not even guaranteed that you can
create your own business out of it like
if you create if you're a web developer
and you create a service that people are
gonna like you can make millions of
dollars and even that you could even
make just hundreds of thousands of
dollars or just in the sense of like I
see somebody create some
application for Facebook right which is
super simple all they're doing is adding
in on adding images on top of images
right so like let's say you want to
create a sticker put a sticker on the
picture put on a little funny hat
put a funny glasses so they created this
app and that app is making I think like
seventy thousand dollars a month just
for Facebook alone so that goes to show
you the amount of money that you can
make as an independent web developer
like you don't even need to be like
hired by a company you could work at a
company to get the skills that you want
well after you have the skills then from
there pretty much is like start building
your own projects look
I'm creating coding phase comm I already
have over 2500 people that have signed
up for for a list that they want to sign
up for it so once I make this website
live there's going to be 2500 people
that's going to be in that in that
community and it might seem small
compared to a place like Stack Overflow
Gil where they have a couple of millions
but that's how the companies grow you
start small like you know it's like
right now I'm a one-man team if I get
10,000 subscribers well 10,000 viewers
to go sign up for coding phase comm I'm
good because I'll make money off the
advertising and all of the stuff is is
because of what development if now
whatever we may be able to make any
money online like so I think even at
that you were like let's say somebody
comes in here and be like hey I always
wanted to sell t-shirts but I don't know
how to how to sell it to people so it's
like now they create a website where
it's like okay let's make it easier for
people who don't know how to sell
t-shirts online and let's make it a
business now they have a business and a
half you know I don't know 100 200 users
dart are paying 10 20 dollars a month
you do the math how much is that you
know what I mean so it's like that's how
that's how a business grows it's like
for somebody who's a web developer like
sky's the limit
you know the web is worth that
applications like full applications are
very good but they all connect to the
internet they all connect to the web
they all need a back-end they all need
some type of place or back-end which to
save the data so that's what I'm saying
so tell your nephew to get in this man
time to come sign up on my on my world I
signed up subscribe to my channel come
show some love trust me he's gonna learn
a lot of
and I'm not here bullshitting it to
people I'm not here trying to act like
oh I'm the smartest person I'm not I'm
like this doesn't now I want to talk
proper time I'm gonna talk to him like
do talk to him in the school how you
know I come in here like this with the
little dad you gotta see me work couple
of you know bad dot now imagine I just
start making this like a music
video and you start bringing bad
thoughts just shaking their ass on my
videos nah man now be to the extreme but
oh no I just want you know uh that's
another thing I want like the younger
generation to just come in and be like
okay I'm sixteen seventeen years old
I'm looking at all this this
rappers and all these people who are
influencing me to do the bad things in
life you know drugs robbery
murder do a whole bunch of
that's not gonna put money in their
pocket the only ones are making money
all the rappers because they don't do
nothing I should you know what I mean
they don't do like I said there are so
little drugs they don't kill
nobody
so it's like the kids who are actually
getting brainwashed with this music then
they go and do something dumb and that I
oh yeah but this rapper does it all the
time in the reality that rap is making
money out of you you don't do none of
that you know what I mean so yeah
man that's what I'm here trying to I'm
trying to just like show people like
what you could do you know
chit chit chit chit chit
where everybody in here man there's 30
people in here you're gonna tell me you
can't give this video a like come on
give it a like so other people will come
in because that's how YouTube works when
you come in here and you see my videos
give it a like automatically like I'm
not asking you guys for anything else
just give it a like because that helps
YouTube's algorithm basically get out
there but okay we're gonna promote this
video and show it to more people so show
some love and you know if you enjoy the
channel this channel might not be the
most technical channel this channel
might not be whatever
I'm not learned code Academy I'm not
 but this guy's name I'm not John
Samus I'm not Chris hooks I'm not
who else
I'm not milk programmer um I'm not know
these guys like they have pretty good
channels like you know club programmer
has his own little to sell
people but you know John Solomon's got
his channel Chris hooks I love his
channel cuz he's just a regular person
but sometimes he gives you some
technical that you might get to
learn you know I'm not fun fun if I was
it functions you know I'm just so
regular dude
like you know when you're coding and
you're like you know what I want to
listen to something in the background I
want to see what the hell Joe is up to
who is another developer just like me
who's working in the industry just like
where I want to get to it's like that's
it you know what I mean like I'm not
here selling no dreams so it's like if
you can't just give it a like
yeah man
that's what I'm saying I got 2,500
people that want to show love and that's
on the solo now imagine one side I just
start going all out and be like hey okay
like you know let's take this to
the next level
like once I start getting money more
more money from the advertising on Conan
face calmly from there I'm just gonna
hire other peoples and be like okay
please guys help me out with this yes
you know $2,000 a month help me out and
then from that I just keep moving that's
how companies grow man trust me
Slanket milk Mountain for real man yo oh
my god I was gonna tell you guys so I
got this this this people that want to
sponsor me right so I'll tell them that
this are this is my rate listen this is
literally my rate any company that wants
to talk to me it wants to tell me hey we
wanna we want you to promote our website
promote our product whatever it is I
don't care what it is
number one I have to be able to use it
meaning I have to be using it either now
or I have used it before or I say it has
to be something that I people could
actually get something out of it I don't
want to say hey come visit this website
sponsored by da da da spunk
sponsored by the Olive Garden like I'm
not gonna come in here like that you
know it's like Olive Garden sponsoring
my channel I'm not gonna say
that you know and I'm not gonna stop
cursing I'm gonna stop cursing for
certain videos but all my videos I'm not
gonna be fake up if if a curse comes out
let it be people love this you know
what I mean so that's what another thing
too if you if you try to sponsor me
there's the REE automatically
videos $100 automatically just one
videos $100 now if you want to sponsor
the channel its $1,000 a month right
just for me to mention your name
out here right plus I want to give 10
people whatever service that you you're
providing you want me to promote I want
to give it out to 10 people here for
free so people could be like okay Joe is
promoting this but people that are
watching the channel are getting it for
free you know what I mean like I'm not
gonna come here and promote some crazy
 the only way is like even milk
money if milk money comes to me
and be like man I know you've never been
to a boot camp I know you don't support
boot camps that much but we have a deal
for you we want you to promote it for a
month ok pay me a thousand dollars plus
I want you to give the boot camp for ten
people that I know from this channel for
free that's the only way I'm gonna do it
because it doesn't make sense for me so
the people are sending me emails I aim
we want to sponsor you and this and that
I'm not gonna sell my channel what
people know of me of being real and
being honest I'm not gonna sell my
channel to nobody for a little bit of
money of just like hey here's 400
bucks a month and make sure you say our
name in every video I'm not gonna do
that unless the people that are with me
on this channel could eat out of it too
if they can't eat and they can't get no
money out of this or they can't get no
knowledge out of it I'm not promoting it
you know it's like even when I say
certain courses from udemy those courses
are the ones that I took like I'm not
gonna talk about um hey join you
Udacity and you know I'm sorry Udacity
you know you guys try to reach out but
I'm not gonna tell people hey join
Udacity
I never took you dancing I'm not going
to tell them that the reason why people
come here to this channel is because
they know that what made me and so
developer was truly on the udemy courses
so people come here to see exactly what
did I take what did I do to get in
they're not looking for me to sell them
a service so if I never took your
servicing that never got got me in the
industry then no I'm not gonna promote
it it's that simple
because it's like it's like you know
it's like right now like Chris Shawn
like Chris Shawn to me it's the guy that
he made it out of thrill you know
out of team treehouse in three months
and got a job in the his thing so if I'm
a user and I'm watching his channel I
want to watch his channel because I'm
very cool I like team tree house I like
what uh what Christian talks about I
like that you know we have those things
in common so if he tells me hey he got
into this industry with team tree house
I believe them but it's the same thing
for me so it's like if a company comes
to us and starts be like hey guys make
sure you promote Udacity your dad city
is the best everybody here is gonna be
like you guys are fake you guys are
 bullshitting because we know
that you guys started with a
team tree house so why is he promoting
some that you never did you know
what I mean
dog they'll develop me oh man you guys
do know like what I do here on this
channel and what I talk about that's not
how I really am in my job crisis there's
just like me there's like me talking to
my friends I hope you guys do understand
that like of course not
don't go to any job talking to two
people with co-workers like yell without
sign like you're not gonna talk to your
co-workers like that you know
how much should a junior in front-end
developer make in New York City it
depends it depends because sometimes you
you when I started I was making like 30
grand that's it but that's because I was
thirsty I wanted to get into the
industry right away I didn't want to
wait like some people are waiting for
that perfect job to come in I was like
 that I just want to work you know I
didn't care about how much money I was
making because I know I was going to
leave that job in like two months you
know what I mean so it didn't matter
word milk Mountain
Krishan is good guys Krishan is
definitely good he he does his thing he
knows how to code like it's not like he
doesn't know how to cope he knows how to
code so it's like he knows what the hell
he's talking about
he has like I did like a year or two in
the industry which is I think that's
even better for any of you guys that are
like branding developers they're like I
will I will watch Christians channel
because I'm like hey he only has like a
year in this and look what he's done you
know so then it's like you following him
follow him or what he's done in in the
industry and you get the tips that he's
given you you know what I mean like me
I'm giving you tips from like from what
I've seen in the past four or five years
him he's he's like literally he's like a
junior developer he's still there but
he's new you know what I mean so it's
like for you guys you guys who actually
get the the real deal of how how it is
to work it in a and a company at a
certain level you know what I mean
you're Clarence make sure whenever you
put my name VAR joke don't put no double
equals man put triple equals man cuz I'm
gonna get like that
man no no double equals man get used to
using true triple equals man three
equals rise come on Aaron BAE this is
legit - it's my boy -
I need to make a rap music video
barcoding imagine coming here like a yo
hey oh hey oh hey oh I was in the city
getting money and cut getting on my
niggas doin know what Oh God
now they know they know I do YouTube
they know I do YouTube like not to the
scale here's a you know some people that
think like oh this person oh yeah like
you telling all y'all do a couple of
videos but they don't think to the scale
that you're doing it you know like I'm
really doing it out here like I got
peoples that I'm I told ya I was
like walking down the street in Queens
and somebody's like yellow coating face
like it's funny to me I'm like oh word
there's no more Jones no no more anthrax
everybody calls me coding phase now but
man I got nothing against milk Mountain
it's just funny to me that everybody is
promoting them in and this and that and
then every single person that's
promoting them they've never been there
I just don't feel comfortable I don't
feel comfortable telling people who are
you know people who are just getting the
interest in becoming web developers like
you guys you guys are brand new
developers brand new people that just
get into spark right I don't feel
comfortable with me telling you guys hey
guys go you something that I've never
used like if I tell you use this is
because I've used it and I know that it
works I don't feel comfortable with boot
camps I don't and the reason why I don't
feel comfortable is not because they
can't teach you anything because they
can you can't become a developer out of
them but it's not to the level of what
people expect when you come out of there
you just get the same level as somebody
else who came in and did in his house
you're not going into it's not like
you're going to get a four-year school
degree from a boot camp where
it's like super respectable it's not
like you coming out of there with an MIT
degree no you coming out of there I'm
just a regular
certificate and that's it so I'm not
comfortable with telling people hey go
spend $20,000 for me to make $500 you
know how many people watch us on YouTube
thousands of people watch us on YouTube
out of those thousands of people 1% of
those people are going to sign up to
that now 1% out of thousand let's
say there's a hundred thousand people
right now a dousing of them a dousing of
them go and and go and
sign up to to how you gonna
to milk money
how much money is that yeah do the math
you know you do a little thousand times
twenty thousand do the math on that how
much money is that and then we're
getting paid $500 or $700 $800 so
 mislead people into signing it
up into a boot camp when we know because
we all done it ourselves in our house
why are we gonna mislead people to go do
it somewhere else it doesn't make sense
people are not dumb they don't need a
 gym teacher in there and it's
like hey guys come on code code code
code they don't need that what they need
is just the resources tell them what
websites to go tell them what books to
read tell them what courses to take and
I say goodbye you know like have a good
day please come again you know like
that's all they need they don't need
people making them sign up to a
twenty thousand dollar debt man
you know what I mean you know what I
mean kit you know what I mean kit
I'm not comfortable I'm not comfortable
making people pay that much it's that
simple
that's too much I'm not gonna you're
amazing I start going like a rap do a
wrapper around the car and be like hey
coding phase car Amana I don't need that
you know what I mean jelly bean alright
guys I think I gave you guys like half
an hour give you guys a little half an
hour already
let's see I'm actually I have a delay on
all the comments I'm reading them right
now I got the studio break it down Joe
killing with the bars make Joe word up
mic up John have you collide with
another YouTube coder
I don't happy if you did a video wearing
beater yeah now I'm trying to I'm trying
to getting in contact with Aaron
hopefully he comes around a lot of times
through the channel I'll check out his
videos all the time but um after this

week once the program and mentorship
stops then I'm going to come back doing
my podcast which is when I bring in
different people different viewers and
you know different youtubers I'm going
to bring them into my podcast again and

but I don't think they they're like
looking at my videos I don't think so
you know what I mean right everybody's
busy everybody got their own thing I'm
like the only person in my in my company
that does this outside of work everybody
doesn't do this like meaning a lot
of developers don't code after work a
lot of developers don't put in the hours
that I put in like you know some people
might come here and talk on my
channel and do whatever the they
want to do but the reality of man
I'm a amazing developer like I'm
really good like you guys just
have no idea because I don't really show
all my here because all the
companies that work for the code is you
can't see it is proprietary it's
like you can't go in there you know I
can't make that known on
github I have a couple of projects
that's why I created the rocky stack so
I could just you know leave my mark on
on the open source you know just for the
hell of it but you know I'm still I'm
still like nice man like I'm
just being honest like you know somebody
can come in here and talk on a
Chandler oh you're a coder or you
doesn't that man even if I wasn't a
coder my bank account says I'm a coder
man like it not even to on you
buddy but you know it's just like man
I've seen so many times there was like
one time on Facebook on a Facebook group
some idiot goes on it and it's like oh I
went to Joe's website and I went to his
LinkedIn and I went to his resume and
the companies that he said that he
worked on they now match I'm like yeah
you idiot because if you look at
then that sense creative circle which is
a company here in New York
I worked for their basically their
development department where we worked
on a whole bunch of different companies
Universal MTV with the chef of
vh1 we did a whole bunch of different
companies you know Random House
so it's like you know what I mean like
I'm not gonna put every single job that
I've done all the websites I've did for
my friends all the small businesses I
did the story that I go to to buy the
 turkey sandwich I built
their website I charged them a little
quick 3000 it's like you know what I
mean like what the hell my resume will
look like four or five pages
long you don't put all your information
on your resume like once you're already
established and you go to an interview
and people know who the you is like
people know me from here in New York
people know me that I go to meetups
people know me when they have
seen me at the digitalocean
offices they've seen me at the
Facebook offices they see me at the
 Google offices like they know
who I am like a lot of this
developers here on on YouTube they've
never didn't even get an invite to
like that you know what I mean like
you're not even invited to like
that buddy like you know what I mean and
when I go to places on my are whatever
like I'm I don't go in there like
 starstruck like oh my god I'm in
the Google office it's like so what who
cares you know what I mean so thing so
when people come here it's like does
this guy even cold and like man you
missed the whole point of the the reason
why I created this channel this channel
is not for me to be technical as this
channels not for me to to come in here
and explain to you like hey this is how
you coding every line
nah man this is more like hey there's a
channel where
ham I just go see my friend Joe see what
he's up to
I'm gonna talk to you exactly how to
talk to my friend you know what I mean
like that's what this channel is about
you know and motivate people you know
because like I always say I always go
back to this you know four or five years
ago I was literally working at some
 job and a year before that I
worked at an even worse job which was in
the more getting you
know how how you go at the end when you
come out of the mall and you
come out your parking lot back then they
used to have people working
there receiving the money and then they
give you a little ticket like oh yeah
you you paid that's what I was doing you
know what I mean
and to be here where I'm at and not
giving a and just having fun and
just like providing for my family I'm
chilling and this is just the beginning
it's like people like me there's gonna
people there's gonna be people that hate
on us because we're outside of the norm
I'm outside of you know most developers
if you look at most developers it's a
whole bunch of nerdy on social or
 insecure people and that's not
saying that you guys are like that
because what I like about my channel is
that it brings a lot of real people and
a lot of regular people you know I'm not
my channel it's not the audience of my
channel it's not the the little nerdy
kid in the back who was taking
AP AP Calculus tool in
high school and going to this
four-year school it is great for your
school my channel most of the people are
just regular people who are like you
know what I want to become a developer
you know what I mean like that's my
channel you know and I love having that
that type of crowd because it's like
we're like we coming from the bottom we
changing this thing this thing up like
we're bringing in more minorities we're
bringing in more girls coming
into this shape I know them well like
you know how many girls
get emails from that sent me oh thank
you I love the video you did for the
girls that coat our unicorn they love me
out here because I'm just here
just being myself and and wanting to
pull them in bring them in into the
industry instead of other people who are
trying to act like oh they're the
smartest person they're like oh I'm the
smartest person this you're supposed to
love code to become a developer and it's
like no man this is just a job man
you know what I mean
the website is not done guys
like I said like a million times Jesus
Christ I'm bout to just bring
down the website for a million
times the website is not done I'm doing
a million things at one time
right it's impossible for me to finish
the whole website and the reason why I
always say coding phase comm is not for
you to say to go to the website this
right moment like it's done these videos
are going to be here for the next five
ten years so ten years from now
somebody's gonna watch this video I want
them to go to : face calm the website
we'll be done by then
of course it's gonna be done by then
probably the end of the summer but it's
like I have to take time now
everything's gonna work on it because
when the hell am I gonna find time when
I got to do videos for you to do the
mentorship program take care of my
 girlfriend about to have a kid
work from 9:00 to 5:00 what else I got a
other websites that our lives that are
