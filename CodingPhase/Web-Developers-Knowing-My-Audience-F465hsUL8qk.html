you've been around trying to learn web
development and what level you are just
so like dr. no cuz I need to make a list
of you know maybe I should make like a
survey or something just because I want
to know I want to get more information
on my audience you know King flipped
with Kim flip TV he said it is he's
going through the same ways like
you know he don't know exactly what type
of content he should be making and you
know to help people out like me and him
got a similar channel I think he has
more like reseller like selling stuff
and you know stuff from ebay soon I'm
gonna have him on my podcast because the
podcast is not just about coding the
podcast is like me hanging out with
friends and asking them questions it's
not just about coding I know some people
is gonna be like oh man well he doesn't
Cody doesn't doesn't match Shh you know
what I mean like like my podcast is my
 podcast like the podcast is just
for me to talk to my my viewers and the
podcast is for me to introduce you guys
to new people new channels new new
friends of mines and ask some questions
that is gonna you know somehow relate to
you guys you know to my audience
something that you guys can learn from
you know what I mean
where do I live I live in New York man I
live in New York City well not anymore I
don't live in New York City I left New
York State you know man we we bring in
this week making this too high right now
we gotta bring it back down you know at
one point I'm gonna stop cursing so much
but right now is just I just like have a
fun you know Wow six years for use in
school two years out of school Wow nice
so you're pro by now
yeah cyber sound the understanding
JavaScript understanding the weird parts
of javascript is a very complex course
is one of those courses that you have to
use it as a encyclopedia it's like it's
like whenever you're you're stuck on
something you come back to it but to be
able to watch it back to back I wouldn't
recommend it
word man they got a subscribe to the
kick my boy Christian out here Amanda
you know lunch break chronicles man man
I'm out here bro she is she is cheers
man word
cursing equals be real I mean not really
man I think cursing cursing can be bad
you know it could definitely be bad
especially now with YouTube I think I
think because I do curse a lot youtube
has been not sending me as many
subscribers as as I should because most
of my subscribers come from I think
people sharing my videos to other
peoples and people somehow falling into
my video feed somehow but it's not like
some other people's here on YouTube that
you know their channel is clean so
because their channels cleaned at
getting more more views from YouTube
searches or YouTube article is YouTube
related videos right and that's what
that's what's kind of messing it up man
like i like the age restriction I like
that cuz I wouldn't want a
twelve-year-old 14yo watching my channel
and I'm just cursing all the time I
understand that from YouTube but at the
same time it's like if the person isn't
an adult or whatever like my channel
should be shown to other peoples you
know what I mean but at the same time I
don't even care because the viewers that
I have work 10 times more lawyer than
anybody else out here on YouTube like
and I know that because the stats are
there like you know what I mean half of
my subscribers always leave comments
half of my subscribers watch every
single video which that is almost
 impossible for a lot of people
like most people when they you know they
start getting big their channels
drop a lot because all they're getting
is views from nooses for new viewers
people who are not subscribing like
sometimes you might see a video on the
front page and you're like all this
video's cool but
I'm not subscribing to this people
come to my channel and they're like okay
soon as they see the videos they
subscribe it's like a good good fifteen
percent that don't subscribe but
everybody else subscribes you
know what I mean it's like we're growing
steadily nothing too crazy you know what
i mean but because i haven't been making
none of those trendy videos like you
know top programming languages top 10
programming languages top 10 Oh
I don't know JavaScript libraries which
I am gonna make one somewhere this week
I'm gonna make one but it's not to get
clicks it's more to share what I
actually use so I'm going to make my top
10 JavaScript libraries that I use every
single day you know so that's what I'm
gonna share but yeah that's why I
haven't gotten like you know my channel
hasn't been exploding exploding looks
like it was growing steadily but it's
not like hey man overnight
sensation like I'm fine and I'm fine
with that because man by the end of this
year I'm gonna have over 10,000
subscribers which was my goal and I'm
probably gonna have around 18 to 20,000
subscribers which is more than a lot of
people who's been here and God knows how
 long like they've been here
there's people here that it's been here
since like 2008-2010 and it took
them this long to get you know
fifty a hundred thousand subscribers
like man for me I know it's not gonna
take that long I don't like me I
probably do that by next year you
know
well yeah man
let me see what's good the crew will see
let's see let's see let's see yeah like
that's one thing man like I'm not here
trying to profit off people's struggles
and like that like I just pretty
much give people the tools that i use
and that's it like I'm not you're not
gonna see me coming and be like hey guys
sign up for this boot camp
because i'm getting paid you know a 700
hours a month to say that or i'm not
gonna come in here and be like hey guys
it's going by these windows pc
this aces because it's the best in the
world which people sponsors have
hit me up to promote aces and
I'm like I don't even use
windows so how do I look like promoting
something that I don't even use you know
what I mean so I mean hopefully people
can can appreciate that appreciate that
I only show you guys what I use I don't
show you guys anything else besides that
and you know then there might be other
channels who are you know windows users
mainly from windows uses antic if your
windows user you to check those channels
out but most of the time Marcia is going
to be a Mac you know what I mean like
that's my preferred system and it just
works you know but yeah
Miss Emma see what are the benefits of
laravel who there's so many benefits may
benefits of migrations benefits of
having in order knowing where
everything is at so like let's say right
now somebody could give me a larval
project and I know exactly where
everything is that I know where the
views are all right I know where the
controllers are at our know where the
migrations are at so that makes my life
much easier like we're both it's like
speaking in the same language you know
so laravel was legit man like my
co-worker who's new to laravel he was
just like man this is so
cool that we were working on laravel now
I'm like yeah my like there's a reason
why I strictly work with laravel like it
just saves you so much time as far as
like a developer so let me see what else
people are talking about here missing
what car you in well my car right now is
a nissan rogue why am i driving a nissan
rogue well happened like this this
is story this is the story kids and this
is why you gotta be careful out
here all right so there's the story
right I used to have a brand new 2700
Civic right when I came up from there um
I had lost my job and what I did was I
basically sold it sold the car and then
I got my money off it i paid off the car
great fast forward to 2012 2014 2014 if
that's worth 2014 I had a on Saturn V
which was legit it was nice right there
from there fast forward to that so 2015
2015 I have eight thousand dollars cash
almost 9,000 right and I go show up at
the dealership number like yo I
want to get the mercedes-benz ml right
so when I get there everything is good
they're like okay your paperwork is fine
and then whatever to start going through
my credit they find out that my credits
 up at that time in 2015 and that
was because somebody somehow they they
got my social security somehow I
don't know what the happened
somebody stole my identity and basically
opened up a whole bunch of gas
that well they opened up a gas gas line
and electricity in Wyoming which I've
never been to why only alright
so the open that up never paid on
it and then they up my credit my
credit was like a 5 580 and I don't even
know because I never really took care of
my shall never really pay mind to it cuz
I'm like most of the time
money on me if I have money on me i just
paid cash or i pay with my credit
cards that i already have so when i went
again to go to the dealership and they
told me that shells like what the
so then they were like you know what man
what do you want to do I said you know
what man give me something that I could
live with now a car that i could leave
with right now and they're like you know
what we got this nissan rogue which is
this piece of which i'm dying to
get rid of it because i'm not happy in
the nissan rogue man like i could
literally be buying another car now but
the car i'm about to finish paying it
off on September so that's my last
payments so once I do that I'm gonna
give this card to my girlfriend and then
from there I'm gonna get myself a nice
 car a car that I could be like
you know why man your boy work hard your
boy came in and it's driving on that
soon nigga you know what I mean but yeah
man so that's what happened but now
thank god man I have always an experian
a credit tracker I keep track of all my
 man right now my credit
score it's at seven hundred and I think
80 something the last time i check maybe
it went up again this month i gotta
check it later on but man credit
super important man because you know if
you have a good job you if you have
money you can get certain without
the credit like you go come in
and be like you know i have all my
paperwork i have my taxes that have
money for a down payment but if your
credit is not up to par with it they're
gonna you over me so make sure you
guys are take care of your
yeah so yeah laterals like more MVC and
 abdo whatever when I would I would
owe it up
yeah man I got that straining out
man like I don't play no games no more
man like I keep track of my I have
I pay a company that also basically is
like twenty dollars a month just to keep
keep me protected from you know from
people up my credit so
now I'm completely protected like no
matter what if they see anything
suspicious in another state like the
other day I want to New Jersey and I try
to order something love with my own
credit card in New Jersey and they call
me up right away that I hate are you in
New Jersey right now we just saw that
there's like traffic coming in from New
Jersey with your name and I'm like yeah
it's me it's like now I'm like super
protected like I'm good yeah I don't
know the the quality from my phone
remember guys up I'm over here outside
man it's not Wi-Fi this is not I'm in
the outskirts of New York I'm not right
in the center of the city it's like you
know you know what i mean so
yeah man plus that's another thing to me
I don't know if you you know you guys
want to be seen me talk about my life in
 like you know that's something that
I want to know like I'm gonna add that
to to my website like a survey to give
you guys a survey just like hey do you
guys even give a about me talking
about my personal life like if you don't
I'm not gonna talk about it like you
know what I mean like I'll just keep it
strictly code you know just call it &amp;amp;
programming
Jove like yeah I want a vlog but it's
 hard man because then you have
to do a lot of editing and it's like
like I barely have time to do everything
that I want to do that's another thing
to let this guy King flip TV set man
like for me to motivate you guys I feel
like I have to do it I have to be able
to show you guys you know that I code
and I create cool projects so that's
what I'm i'm finishing coding face i'm
focusing more on that because it's like
I think it's like like this
 people on YouTube that be like
oh man like this is how you make money
this is how you survive in this
world this is how you do doesn't that
but most of their time is on youtube so
a reality they don't they don't
have time to do now that that they
they say for for people to do so it's
like you know what I mean like do I
really want to become that guy you know
yeah editing is crazy man it's a
 pain in the ass it's like I
bought that Windows PC thinking that
that was gonna you know make shift
faster but soon as you put our fact or
you put anything on on the on the
footage they say is a wrap that's just
gonna take half an hour just to
export so yeah man
he started out with tree house yeah
treehouse is cool tree house is cool
tree house is definitely good I think
our tree house is good for what it's
worth to get you know get all the basics
you could go in there and get all the
basics the problem that i have with
treehouse was that i found myself using
treehouse and multiple things like I
would find myself on tree house and I
will find myself in a couple of blocks
and I will find myself watching YouTube
doing like 30 different things just to
figure out how to make a website the
probably that's the only thing that I
have a problem with it now I'm not
hitting on treehouse man treehouse is
good to learn the basics if you you have
no idea what the hell you doing
treehouse is good but most of the people
that I know and I people hit me up there
like you know I haven't learned how to
put everything together because
sometimes i don't know i'm the type of
person that I need someone to tell me
like hey this is how you create a menu
this is how you create a side menu
that's how you create I don't know for
is this how you you submit to an
ajax form whatever you know what I mean
like sometimes I'm more about
project-based instead of learning you
know all this what a variable is this
what a for loop is this is what a
whatever it's like I learn more when I
just learned from the project you know
so that's why i usually like you to me
better than a then treehouse treehouse
is like treehouse is where i started
treehouse i went in the first month I
went in for one month and I played
around with it I learned a CSS and then
I still was still signed up for a whole
year on treehouse it was more for the
community because now for nothing the
treehouse communities is legit everybody
there it's really cool people people
that's trying to learn people just want
to help you out that's why that's what
reasons to why I'm bringing you know i'm
creating coding face calm because I I
got the idea of creating such a cool
community from Team treehouse
yeah everybody's everybody's different I
know some people that they call me
 learn from reading books me I
look at a book and I'm like oh man I
gotta read like that's all I
look at both know oh yeah man I will see
you guys later man listen guys by the
way again I'm reminding you guys this
