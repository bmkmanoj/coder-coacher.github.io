back at it again man coding face.com you
boys backing out and did it again once
again you know somebody's somebody's
every resident telling me like yeah Joe
you don't you know he came back again
and then you done did it again and then
welcome back again I know he's a funny
man but yeah man
today we're doing basically a countdown
you know we don't know countdowns every
day from now till let me see till five
days from now pretty much from now til
Saturday the last day pretty much on
Saturdays the last day for you guys to
be able to get the five dollar special
on my website like I said guys take
advantage sign up now even if you're
just not even gonna do the course right
now right because you're gonna keep a $5
man only reason I'm doing this because I
really want everybody to sign up as soon
as they can because you know I think
about 10% of the audience ten to 12
percent of the audience got to sign up
this month and that's great man
pretty much we kill the game like
nobody's doing this right now right
nobody's coming in here and like yo man
we got you you know we got almost 2,000
people in in a website and we we made it
happen right so that's like 10% I don't
know was I was like 15 almost 20 percent
of the audience I have nine thousand
subscribers I think last time I check Oh
Missy yeah I got nine thousand ninety
three subscribers right and we got two
thousand people signed up now guys
everybody who signed up and signed up
for the fatherís question you basically
you came up in this world pretty much
because although this course is selling
like
hotcakes right now on you to me and
pretty much people are paying 10 $15 you
guys came in and said hey I get because
I came from YouTube I get everything for
five bucks and that's great man you know
that's why I'm here today we started the
five-day countdown today is day 5 guys
I'm gonna do it every night I'm gonna do
a little quick live video just to remind
you guys what they were in because I
really can't do the five other specials
no more I'll be honest like somebody
would be like oh man Joe's killing and
he's so profitable right now because he
got 2,000 people to sign up by five
hours guys it's not profitable but it's
like my gift to you guys you know what I
mean so it's like I'm trying to get as
many people as I can for this last month
because next month I'm going hard
meaning I'm you know I'm pumping a lot
of money into advertising I'm also
getting a whole bunch of different
avenues of letting people know about all
the courses that I have on my site now
all of you guys that came here from the
beginning you know that's why you
getting at this amazing price five
dollars guys trust me
team tree house is $25.00 Pluralsight is
I think 30 something team tree or
Nothing tree house you to me each course
is a minimum ten dollars sometimes 12 if
you already bought a whole bunch like
which kind of sucks because I remember
when it used to be ten dollar courses
and now I was like oh wait you bought
too many courses at ten dollars now you
got to pay twelve it's like okay I guess
I'll have to create another account you
know what I mean like that's that's how
I cheat the system you know what I mean
it's like man you trying to make me pay
so much I'm creating another account you
know what I mean now but they definitely
worth it but yeah man I'm trying to get
all of you guys in here man and just
keep it there and trust me there's gonna
be courses that you guys gotta see for
the next few months that you're gonna
want
and it's like in reality you pay five
dollars for it you know what I mean
now any questions you guys have right
now for me or any comments let me know
send me a message right now well leave a
comment here on the life field or the
super chat yeah man we here live right
now this is cool man
I'm just doing this to remind you guys

I'm gonna do a little video a little
half an hour video with you guys hang

the fight out of special is leaving
cause in reality guys I told you guys
I'm doing this full-time
I even quit my job and to do this
because I pretty much say you know what
this what I want to do and I have enough
to survive a few months you know almost
a whole year but at the same time it's
like this is an experiment you know what
I mean there's an experiment of can I do
it for it like you know full-time you
know if things start going bad you know
seven months from now but like oh man
times is hard then imma be like yo bro I
can't do this full-time but for now we
good so I mean to to get it to a certain
point where we could say hey we doing
this full-time and just
do we have been doing it I've been
dropping three videos a day dropping you
know like four or five videos on my
website which is like constant constant
videos which are pretty legit today I
started the nodejs course for those of
you guys that want to learn nodejs
I'm breaking it down a very simple term
something easy for you guys to pick up
and understand it and learn it yeah so
we kill in the game right now but at the
same time is like you know we gotta make
this profitable and in the sense of like
I just want to pay the light bill
I say pay the light bills and pay
whatever the cars and and you know keep
everybody happy so I don't look like a
crazy person when they'll be like oh man
you you quit your job for this dissing
this and it's like this is my passion
this is what I want to do you know what
I mean I want to teach what development
I really wish there was like a you know
like a college program where you could
say hey I'm gonna come in and teach two
or three hours or baby like four or five
hours in a day right I would do it like
you know heart because I really love
doing this all right so that's why we
here that's why you know I want to say
to you guys thanks to those that
supported my channel supported this new
venture coated face comm what I'm doing

people that bought in into the you know
the lifetime you guys are set you know

game right now man yeah I almost forgot
like how fun no js' was man
I started today I was like yo I almost
forgot how fun this was you know it's
like I've been saying a lot for people
hey go learn PHP go learn PHP go learn
PHP you know but at the same time PHP is
great for you guys who are brand new
developers who who need a job as soon as
possible right cuz you're always gonna
get a job in PHP but no js' is just fun
you know it's like it's JavaScript like
I love JavaScript I love and I hate
JavaScript there's days I love it in
this days that I hate it you know
but at the same time no js' is fun you
know so I I would definitely tell you
guys go check that out all the people
that have been on it
check out the website just started
putting it up it's like because you know
how I do it when I come in
I'm not here to waste your time there's
the problem I look at a lot of people
I've gone through almost everybody's
course to learn from them and learn what
they they write learn what they do wrong
and I find myself that all the time
people come in they give you a long
explanation they bleh
hey guys know Jes was created in 2008 by
such and such and such and it's like bro
I wanna code I want to start learning
this don't give me this history this BS
history for an hour and a half of like
BS of nodejs it's like bro I'm here to
learn I'm here to start coding because
it's like if you're going and you do an
hour and a half of just like prep work
meaning like hey do you know JavaScript
do you know this just net do you know
promises do you know is like bro if I
got to know Jess and I want to learn
nodejs is because I know those stuff
already I'm here for a reason you know
what I mean like I've never met somebody
who has gone from my hey I know how to
spell HTML and you know what let me
learn nodejs nobody does that you know
what I mean so it's like when somebody's
paying for coins
give them what they there for you know
you know Zeke let them get their feet
wet let them code a little bit let them
get their hands dirty you know what I
mean like don't just spoon feed people
for two hours three hours just to say
hey I got a 42 hour course of nodejs or
whatever you know what I mean like I see
that all the time I bought like three
courses yesterday of nodejs before
started mines because I wanted to
compare the ideas that I had I was like
okay this is what I'm gonna do this how
I'm gonna start it and then I started
looking at other people's stuff I'm like
man I don't know how people do it like
how the hell do you go through an OGS
course when they give you an hour and a
half of like BS and then that's if the
person is nice if the first thing is not
nice he's gonna come in and teach you
HTML teach you CSS teach you Java Script
teach you a whole bunch of things and
you're like wait I'm just here for
nodejs why are you teaching me all the
stuff that I should know before I even
start learning nodejs you know what I
mean like hello
like that's how I look at it like well
like if I'm here it's because I already
know this stuff like why are you
teaching me why are you telling me what
a variable is like if you don't know
what a variable is you should not be in
the nodejs course you know what I mean
like you know that's what I'm saying man
yeah man
daniela hernandez team Emma okay Logan
where you want me to help you out you
say I guess dumb just trying to install
everything that frustrates me yeah I
feel you on that sometimes that can
definitely happen if you try to learn
something like golang which is pretty
annoying but for all the stuff that I
got on the website you should be easy
you should be easy for you I mean which
one are you working on right now I saw
you I think I saw you you you signed up
on the site so Daniella let us know what
you working on so I could help you up
let me see let me see let me see
Janna job I can't mess with Java to me
is also boring by me I don't know maybe
it could be fun I mean the last time I
learned Java when I was learning it it
was more for Android development and I
hated it I was like oh my god is just so
boring this is like ridiculous you know
Larry bells legit guys for those of you
guys start throwing shade at Larry well
you guys pretty much don't know what
you're talking about
yes Father our specialist for all your
subscribers right yes Robin
the final specials for everybody who who
sees the link it's on the description it
should be there on this video right now
as we speak
should be able to see it I I know a lot
of people they enjoy all the questions I
told you guys to check out and I'm super
happy about that and at the same time
I'm like yo that's definitely so many
people that haven't gotten them but if
you haven't gotten any of the courses
man it's fine but check out my watch
that man a $5 I think I found out a
special man this is great
especially for people who just don't
know if they really want to do this cuz
I saw this from another person who sent
me an email is Oh Joe I just bought all
the courses you had on the description
and and everything that you had there I
spend like $60 on udemy and it's like
I've been doing web developers
what develop is a bootcamp and I just
don't know now trying it out I'm like I
don't know if I'm I wanna be a developer
and I'm like you see you messed up there
buddy
like if you're not sure don't go all out
and start buying a whole bunch of stuff
buy one you know what I mean and even
for you guys that don't even know don't
even know if yeah sure and you wanna
learn how to code I think going through
my website will help you out to decide
that because I break it down pretty easy
and pretty fun in the sense of like I'm
not giving you a history of like hey
HTML was built in 1987 by such and such
like now you're there to code I'm gonna
get you coding like yeah yes it's five
dollars for life meaning far Alice as
long as you you continue the the service
no matter of fact I think it's even
better than that because I used to think
it was until you continue to service but
like let's say an example you sign up
now right and then two three months from
now you stop it you were like okay I
already went through all the courses and
I'm gonna stop it now so in reality you
spend $15 and then you stop it when you
stop it and you come back let's say a
year from now it still fought out us so
reality is like is like holding down the
spot and saying hey I want this at five
at any moment that I want to come back
it's always gonna be five so you know
what I mean like you guys should
definitely take advantage I want you
guys to take advantage it is and and do
what you gotta do and take the coins man
there's so many people enjoying this
right now man like I look this is
something that's super cool too
you know like I look at my
my website right and I look at the stats
and I look at my Google Analytics and I
look let me see it look at the stats
right now how it was today so okay so
yesterday yesterday there were two
hundred twenty eight people at six
o'clock right 228 people at six o'clock
taking courses at the same time like to
me that's mind blowing
that's like imagine imagine trying to
fill up two hundred twenty people inside
of my house that's how I look at it like
two hundred twenty people are inside of
my house looking through my you
know like that's crazy like I did this
with love I did this with you know
dedication I really work hard and I'm
like man this is this is dope you know
what I mean like because I was the whole
thing when I was doing it here on
YouTube or even sometimes when I put it
here on YouTube like look I put the HTML
or CSS course with the dashboard right
I'm pretty sure out of the 9,000 people
that saw it on their timeline maybe
twenty did it but when I put it on my
website
I can look and see that a hundred
sixty-eight people actually took the
course and they're taking it right now
right so it basically separates the you
know the kids from the adults you know
what I mean like the people that are
just there to you know here on my
YouTube they love when I rent they love
when I come in and do whatever and then
it separates it to having all the people
I really want to learn and really want
to bust their ass and work on this and
become successful and then I could see
that like I
come in and be like and see who what
courses people are actually taking which
ones they completed which ones they they
looked at it and then left out of it as
soon as they got there or you know etc
you know so that's why I did this thing
cuz it's more of like you know it's more
of like a thing for me to know like who
are the people who are actually working
on it and appreciate the work that I've
done here on YouTube and the people that
appreciate the the tutorials and the
courses you know what I mean so yeah man
yeah man so that's the thing man that's
and that's what we're doing today today
we basically hanging out for a little
bit it's a reminder of you guys if you
haven't signed up to the website
literally it's write down the
description get access get access to my
site for a limited time only for $5
trust me use this link on September 30th
it ends so pretty much it's gonna go
back to being just a 50% off to all my
subscribers now the 50% off is $10 when
you think about it it's $5 more and it
is worth it right it's definitely worth
that especially when you think about it
it's like I just thought about I'm like
wait I'm like this is the same thing
what what the people from you to me told
me like this what the people from you to
me told me the people from you to me
told me like this they're like hey you
know what you should do you should
create all your courses first put it on
our platform of udemy let us promote it
first and two months later release it to
your website for the people who signed
up to your site and I
yeah but then it wouldn't make sense for
somebody to say hey I'm gonna sign up
for the unlimited course and they're
like yeah but you're gonna make more
money you're gonna be able to be good
and I'm like yes it makes sense but at
the same time it's like what I don't
know I feel like I want my subscribers
to have unlimited access to all my
courses now and then whoever finds me
and you to me then okay they found me on
udemy you know but I definitely want
people to just have unlimited access it
makes sense you know it makes sense to
have it like a Netflix where you just
come in and be like okay today I want to
learn HTML CSS and then at the same time
as you guys can see if you still like
let's say you took the HTML CSS course
and you still feel like mmm I'm iffy I'm
still dropping courses of HTML CSS every
week right probably gonna do 10 courses
so pretty much if you say hey I'm gonna
continue learning HTML CSS on time
pretty good then you actually have all
the the resources you need on my website
and it's the same thing for JavaScript
like you take the JavaScript course you
still feel you need more experience to
be really good I'm still dropping more
courses on JavaScript it's not like I
dropped one course in JavaScript and
that's it you're pretty much getting
JavaScript courses every month like two
courses at least a month right you know
so it just makes sense you know where
are we getting the next project the next
project for five projects you need for
getting hired have you finished a Rena
state one I don't even think anybody has
gotten to the last part of of the react
course with the five projects yet
you finish them in the last part Rohan
all right let me check I'm gonna check
right now
emoji check them right now let me see
let's go into the course let's see let's
see who's who's made it to the last part
okay go to the reports okay let me see
how long video stats I missing one
little visitor there's like four people
have actually made it made it to the end
of the the react course of morality only
four people you know Robin Congrats
congrats on signing up you know take
advantage man styling the listing box
it's like a movie yourself yeah you know
definitely man like that's what I'm
saying like that that project loan is so
big but one thing that I have to
reconsider with the five projects I was
thinking about this I was like wait if I
come in I give you guys all five
projects and just react then it shows
you're really good with react but it
doesn't show that you well-rounded right
so what I wanted to do I don't know if
you guys would you guys think
yeah this is a very good question from
me to you guys what do you guys think do
you guys think all five projects should
be in react or we should sprinkle the
projects into multiple different
sections like half 1 and react right
half one in laravel half one in nodejs
have one in pug which is basically to me
is like a superset of of HTML and the
portfolio have a like I don't know we
could have it in nodejs again or laravel
again or even angular for you know what
I mean like wouldn't that be cool now
this one I'm asking you guys questions
you know what do you guys think should I
have everything in react or should we
sprinkle all five projects into multiple
sections great idea great idea yeah I
mean you guys let me know what do you
guys think how we should do it
because at the same time it shows you
that it shows people that you like yo I
can do everything pretty much I mean the
project's the idea even if you did this
projects in HTML CSS it shows somebody
like okay this person he knows what he's
doing
he's good but what if we just say you
know what he is in no GS he is in plain
HTML CSS he is in pug he is in laravel
which is PHP and then another one you
could choose on nodejs or PHP I don't
know you guys tell me do you guys like
the idea do you guys not like the idea
what do you guys think
let your boy know man we here we live
man coding face.com your boys back and
out and did it again reminding you guys
this day five of the countdown the final
re yeah probably you know you're like
why is he singing somebody got that mean
phase like boy well if you don't sing it
oh god yeah man why are do we in here we
in here we are in here let me see let me
see let me see what you guys think I
think this should be a react and then
the onus onus is on us to try and
convert it hmm that's smart Jason's all
right like that song yeah to convert
that and just wash my hands off that be
like okay guys I didn't react it's on
you to basically build this right now it
makes sense you know but I don't know I
think personally me like after I was
building the whole real estate app and
react I was like man this is there's a
long course like I'm just thinking I'm
like yo we're gonna build this exactly
like this for every single one like
that's gotta be a long time we gotta be
building react courses you know what I
mean
I don't know I was like thinking like
man maybe you'll be better to have a
little diversity in a portfolio where
you'll be like okay I got react I got
angular I got no js' I got laravel like
it sort of makes sense you know but it's
up to you
we need no one courses not short courses
missing stuff ya know sometimes it
depends man because there's the thing
like sometimes you could take a course
and the course might come in and have
ten hours of stuff right and it's a long
course but what you're doing is is
following along this long-ass course but
if you want to learn something
in reality the best courses are the
shorter ones it's not really the long
one because the long one is like more
like okay guys build a project of you
know like right now like the the real
estate app the real estate has so many
different things it has UI features it
has sorting it has searching it has
filters it has so many things that a
reality is like man that's a lot you
know I mean but let's say an example you
take a course like pug a course like pug
is about 10 10 15 videos and you got it
done and you learnt what pug is now it's
on you as a developer to be able to
create whatever it is that you want
because there's two things this course
is to learn which are to me are 10 to 20
videos and each videos like five minutes
and then there's projects right
based you have ones that are huge you
know like freakin like the one we just
day like that the realistic
that's pretty huge like I'm missing how
many hours that is so far and we still
need like 2-3 more videos to to
summarize it like we got almost
everything now we're missing just a few
more things let me see how many hours is
that you to me tells me is eight hours
just on the real-estate course alone is
eight hours that's a long time guys
imagine if we do that five times guys
eight times five forty hours man you're
looking at 40 hours of react that's a
long time that's like a if you wants to
sit down
full-time at a job like you know I'm
doing react for 40 hours this whole week
now of course you got to think about it
you got to multiply that by two because
or sometimes even three because every
hour comes for one hour of you watching
and then the other hour is more of you
building it you know going back and
forth copying and pasting and then from
there if you smart with it you want to
go in there and play around try to break
it whatever the structure to show you so
like that you could really understand it
you know and I'll tell you guys man
those guys are are zooming through the
real estate app guys I would tell you
guys man go back in there and you know
pay some pay some some time and say you
know like don't just zoom through it
because this is a Netflix man you know
what I mean like you're now here too you
don't get an award to try to finish it
first you get an award to understand it
nobody is gonna come in and be like give
you guys in a war like oh man
I just want to attend our course in two
hours do you only play yourself you know
what I mean so final countdown
wait I need to stop I sound horrible
come on Tonto let me see
so what's good everybody that's in here
man
leave her a question leave me a question
let me see anything you guys want to ask
me anything that you guys want to tell
me let me know leave a message right now
take advantage we here live man you know
you guys not only do live videos once a
week now so for this whole week we're
doing it every night you know for a good
half an hour so take advantage while I'm
here guys the word that's true
Jeanette Ruby Ella isn't Jeanette miss
Jeanette a girl on Jeanette a guy I
never could tell because you know
there's so many people that come in here
and but I got a girl's icon and it's
really some dude oh yeah I'm about to do
that right now
let me see me do that right now
a Google Forms it should have five
projects bien
let's say yak only Academy had another
one react only laravel nodejs angular
for HTML CSS ugh template and Jana
alright so see should we make
okay cool
now let me see acceptable responses
obviously show progress quizzes no limit
to one response yeah okay cool
now let me see how let me share this
okay all right so let me add this here
so here's the link guys there you go
if you're on our computer
let me see if you're in a computer a lot
of five projects save this all right if
you guys want if you're on a computer
right now you can refresh this page so
you can see the link to the to the forum
you can vote to see on what the project
should be on do you guys want it to be
straight up HTML CSS JavaScript whatever
you want
kay Ellis what I personally was what I
personally hire a person that went
through your courses yes I would because
that person will have all the skills
that they need to have as a developer
even before I left my last job the kid
who who got hired last month basically I
told him to go through my website and
even him I wish I could show you guys
the message like he was like yo thank
you I appreciate it so much
cuz he knows all the things that I've
shown him in one month I'm not even
lying to you this kid he did not know
anything about the web and now he
basically he's the one holding it down
over there at my old company in one
month right so I got him to the certain
level where he is now comfortable with
react comfortable with JavaScript
comfortable with PHP in one month that's
like just being under me and just like
me helping him out showing him the ropes
super smart kid you know sometimes you
know we can't deny his talents too but
at the same time it shows to me it made
me feel good when I'm like okay he
texted me the other days I go I got it
you know I got it under control cuz I
was like how you feel now you know
basically there's no senior developers
there everybody there all the senior
developers left so it's just on him and
he's holding it down I was like yo how
do you feel and he's like it's like yeah
I got it
a most 90% of the things is the things
that I show him he still have access to
my course he still has access to my you
to me account cuz I shared it with him
so it's like all the things that I have
are the things that that pretty much
like you know he learned all that stuff
what the hell did he did the teaching
college guys you gotta understand this
when you go to college they're not
teaching you web development none of the
guys start going to college know
anything about web development they know
programming we could we know programming
you know they we all know programming
because programming is not that hard but
the problem with college is that they
give them so much theory their reality
you can't put that in practice when you
come out here you know it's like yeah
you can put in practice some algorithms
and you know you know freaking
hexadecimals and and lo BS like that
depending on what job you're doing but
for web development those things don't
apply they just don't because it's like
you still need to learn the frameworks
you still need to learn how JavaScript
work you still gotta learn the Dom tree
you still gotta learn HTML you still
gotta learn CSS so in reality is that
where he came in he came in you know
let's say out of a hundred percent he
came in at thirty percent the rest I
helped him out to get to the next point
you know but that shows how good the
courses are and in reality he just
weren't he skimmed through and like he
learned a lot you know this like so many
little things and of course also I was
there with him the whole month teaching
him load things here and there but
that's how it is ya know that's what I
tell you guys it's like a junior
developer is holding it down you know
it's like this like one of those stories
where people be like man you know five
10 years from now he's gonna tell that
story he's gonna be like yo when I came
in here the guy that was senior
developer he quit and then the guy that
was a senior developer coming right
after him he quit and I had to hold down
the company like right now he's in the
trenches you know what I mean he's at
the bottom like every day knocking
things out but the same time it's like
we built everything already tax is don't
worry he's not like the anything that
he's doing is credit
right now it's not like the websites
like about to crash or anything all this
stuff is already set up for him we
already built all those things it took
us nine ten months to build it but it
got done you know what I mean you know
to me which was so funny when I think
about it about you know a year from now
we'll go back into that website and I'm
like yo I built that I built that I
built that I built that you know that's
my blood sweat and tears my stress my
freakin figuring all this things out
when Lera when we were switching to Lera
I built that you know I mean like I set
the whole project up and that me and my
other boy we went back and forth and
found different ways to to make it all
better for the company but I'm the one
that started old the whole project
because he didn't even want him my other
partner to work on it so he's like a
year from now I'm gonna look back on the
em up like y'all it's crazy I feel all
old of that you know what I mean well
that's how it is man but I definitely
you know my hats gets off for this kids
like y'all take my hat off for this kid
he's handling in there by himself I feel
bad but you know I was like if people
weren't assholes in there then it would
be a little bit different you know I was
gonna quit anyways and but if they
weren't just I don't know just giving me
the bad vibe I would have been a little
bit different you know what I mean I
would have left at the end of the month
and finish helping him out better but I
know he's probably stressed you know
like today he text me he was stressed
out but I didn't want I didn't want to
put all that pressure on him that's how
I felt you know what I really like when
this other my other boy just bounced as
I came in
you working on this project but now you
hold down the whole site by yourself
he's like now he gotta hold it down by
himself let's see how long he survives
in there you know I wish I'm nothing but
a bad
you know yeah but Rishta says his
college they teach all the basic HTML 5
CSS bootstrap JavaScript I don't know
what college you go to but those are
like those are not the courses that
people focus on that's dozen other
courses that teachers focus on or even
when you go to your guidance counselor
or whatever to help you out set up a
schedule they don't focus on that
those are like extra extra credit
courses like those are another the focus
of it if you look go into like let me
see I'm gonna tell you right now let's
say and why you curriculum computer
science I'm gonna tell you right now
what's the NYU's curriculum let's share
the screen right now let's see what
share the screen all right
this is NYU right okay so you got
programming solving engineering problems
traduction to Java introduction to
seeing game development studio one you
got C so you're better okay object are
and object-oriented programming
introduction to computer science which
is intro to computer science 101 data
structures which is algorithms so ok
there from there let's see discrete
mathematics oh it's math ok design
algorithms our architecture ok all of
this stuff that you see here ok computer
security application security all this
stuff here they're important but if
you're a web development when do you
focus on man you know I mean so this all
the stuff that you're gonna do for like
two three years all right two three
years from here and on it's three years
you get one one class in introduction to
database one class in Java and web
design right so pretty much there's
still only two courses that you get as a
computer science major in NYU which is
one of the best schools then of course
is on you to basically go and find the
electives right so let me see elective
offerings so let's say you want to go
into introductions of databases
you see what I was saying so this is
actually an elective this is not even
like telling people that hey man you
should study this stuff you know this is
just an elective meaning that if you're
a kid who who pretty much you know you
just go into school and doing your
projects and nobody tells you hey man
you gotta take this computer you know
this is what class is serious because if
not then you're not gonna be able to be
really good when you prepare and when
you graduate you're not gonna be
prepared if nobody comes in and sits
down and tells you hey take those
electives most likely people don't take
it they're going into programming games
and doing a whole bunch of other stuff
and robotics and things that look cool
but in the long term
there's not that many jobs in those
things is those fields are super
competitive you know what I mean so then
now you can't find a job in a company
right you can't find a job in a company
and now you're basically stuck with a
degree and you're like man I don't know
web but the only places that they hire
are in web development let me see if I
could get it this happens all the time
this is not a new story this happens all
the time so if you go into a company now
you don't know all that stuff you know
what I mean and that happens to
everybody that happens to at least two
of my friends they're like oh yeah we
had to freaking take a year to learn web
development and they had computer
science degrees like that happens all
the time
let me see see who else is in here man I
wanted to see the updates yeah I know I
was supposed to release one today I was
supposed to release an update today it
was just guys I've been doing so many
other videos and videos for the courses
you know it's been hard it's hard to
keep up and be like hey man also I got
to do a weekly video on talking about
you know what did I work on on coding
phase comm
yeah people's are young yeah I want to
be an engineer not a developer see that
makes no sense
you know what don't be an engineer but
not a developer is like if you're
engineer if you're an engineer you're
supposed to be a developer already you
support it's the same it's the same
 only difference is different titles
if you're when I think of engineer I'm
thinking about civil engineering I think
of mechanical or freakin electrical
engineering like dot that's engineer it
to me
computer science is programming like
people try to make you something that is
not you know what I mean like most of
the people are not building 98% of the
people are not building a computer from
scratch 98% of the people are not gonna
be dealing with transit trans sitters
forgot the name of it Oh freaking tired
I'm sleepy sorry guys being on a
computer for like 12 hours
um but yeah it's like you're not
building stuff from scratch you're not
coming in in and be like hey man I'm
gonna make the next robot it's like who
does that let's be honest who are the
people working on those projects you
know what I mean like it's not everybody
it's not everybody who graduates from a
computer science degree that's for sure
you know I was like very few people
software engineering myself the word
software engineer died like three four
years ago look it up it kind of died
like people don't really use it no more
but that's how it is man like I said
guys check out the website Cody face.com
there's a quick reminder this thing was
supposed to be 20 minutes it ended up
being an hour of us hanging out but
every night I'm a Buddhist for short
tomorrow
I'm only gonna come here for 20 minutes
because I'm tired like think about it
guys I woke up super early came in did a
bunch of videos did a bunch of videos on
my website I did all the videos for this
week for YouTube what else I had to do
research I had to look into my finances
paid taxes I had to do a whole bunch of
things so I've been here for a long time
in front of this computer like this is
crazy but you know I want to say thank
you to everybody who supported the
channel everybody who supported my
website we are killing the game right
now I hope you guys take advantage and
yeah man let me see let me see the
results man oh you see 38% of the people
they want to keep it and react only let
me see react only and then it
tie between and unifor and larva let me
see
people are saying that we should just
mix it up so what I see is a lot of
people want it to be a mix not just
react but the majority won't react in
the sense of like forty percent of
people who voted for react only me so
I'm not a baby
Oh God okay Sicarius leaf said i watch
is Ruby or rails dead and I understand
it's beneficial as most modern languages
principles are based on Ruby and rails
will you recommend learning it as a
first back-end language for that purpose
yes I would definitely recommend will be
on Rails if you're just like hey I want
to learn the backend then yes Ruby on
Rails is the perfect language well
perfect framework because the language
is Ruby but it's the perfect framework
for anybody to learn how to do things
right on the web alright so yeah man
yeah now that's for sure guys to be
honest with you guys man experience
Trump's education by a longshot
that's why I told you guys from the
beginning man check out the website I
know this sucks of me repeating the same
thing but guys that's why I say five
projects that you really need you don't
have to wait for me to build them right
you could just go ahead and build on
yourself build a restaurant build a real
estate build a ecommerce build a
portfolio for where you're gonna put all
those projects and then I forgot the
other one I always forget the last one
restaurant real estate ecommerce
portfolio there's one that I'm missing
real estate ecommerce portfolio digital
agency there you go AJ I got you son
good-looking I'm like I'm burnt out
right now guys but yeah man take
advantage man listen last five days to
be five dollars this is official last
video as really of the day take
advantage other people that are watching
this video you know you know England all
the people are watching this in India
watching this Philippines watching this
name in Australia take advantage man
this this is for you guys
tool because you know it's way cheaper
at that price you know and if you can't
for whatever reason you can't you still
can't do it
semia send me a message man the idea is
not for these videos to stay on the
internet hidden the idea is for people
to do it and learn and that pass it on
to other people and tell them about it
like oh where do you learn you know I'll
be happy you know like one of you
guys come up with like the coolest app
with the next amazing framework and then
somebody access you ten years from now
but like where do you learn and there
were like honor from this guy called a
coding phase man he had to sauce you
guys say that I'm good you know what I
mean like that's all I want
you know so I'll be happy with that eNOS
Johnson say is that four hours a month
yes five dollars a month sign up now
because in five days from now on the
30th basically it gets shut down it goes
back to being ten dollars it's actually
20 dollars but everybody that comes from
YouTube gets a discount automatically
which makes it to 50% off on everything
so it just makes it makes sense I
started to think that college degrees
are obsolete I don't know if they'll be
obsolete because even right now like I
would love to be teaching in a college
but I can't teach in a college unless I
have our masters in computer science
right so there's still certain places
that they're gonna put that in front of
you and be like nah you ain't coming in
unless you got a degree right now for
people to make money you don't need a
college degree that's for sure if you
care about the money and that's what
you're really there for then you don't
need a college degree now you know
there's some places where your junior
developer and they'll be like oh man you
know I be let's say an example IBM I
heard about this IBM doesn't let no I
don't know if I'm happy em Intel Intel
doesn't let people come in unless they
have a degree so pretty much you know
this companies that don't be like nah
but who cares because when you look at
it it's like people on Intel they're
making 80 grand a year right now you
could go to let's say an example Twitter
or let's say something like facebook
facebook hires people without no degrees
and you go over there and you may
180,000 so pretty much now you you how
you call this you defecating I don't
want to say on people
you're defecating on people that work on
Intel because it's like hey man you're
working on in town didn't want to let me
in because I didn't have a degree but
now Facebook pay me double then what you
guys are making and I get to work here
you know what I mean so if you care
about the money then yes who cares about
degree if you care about certain places
that you want to get into then a degree
might be better for you you know what I
mean it's just you got to do your
research you got to see which route is
that you want to do like for me I'm all
about you know just taking care of my
family hanging out with you guys that's
it like I'm not really worried about oh
man like me a degree for doing this
stuff like nah man if I don't get a
degree you know ten years ago who cares
now you don't wanna be on 29 years old
you know making money I'm surviving this
where I got a beautiful kid beautiful
family and you know I'm good you know so
that's why I tell you guys you guys got
to decide what you want to do you know
that's like this people come in here to
this world of the web development
program inning whatever development in
general right there's people who'd be
like man I'm just here for you know for
my intellectual purposes and as I bro
you could do that on your own time me
I'm here to learn the things that's
gonna get me a job get me working give
me that money because I got things to do
I don't have time to be like oh I'm
gonna be in front of a computer for no
reason like if I'm in front of computers
for if for a reason I gotta be making
that money you know what I mean so
that's what I'm saying but you guys got
to make that question to yourself and be
like yo what exactly is it that I want
do I want to be the smartest person in
the world and be like hey I know every
algorithm I know every single thing
under the Sun or do you want to say hey
I know HTML CSS while I'm still learning
job
let me apply to a job get myself into
Jenny's development a job learned on the
job and then be there for a month or two
get the experience that I need jump to
the next job
make double-dating what I was making
there and then just keep moving like
that that's what I do you know what I
mean like I come in
you know that was in the beginning like
now if I was too if I was so I would go
back to another company it'll probably
be like a remote or something like that
I'm not trying to work you know office
environment
you know I was like I love coding but I
don't want to be dealing with people so
that's just how it is that's my swag you
know what I mean that's my little sauce
as well there's like hmm makes sense you
know I mean but man I'm just saying for
you guys ma'am ask yourself that
question and it's the same thing like
imma keep hitting you guys over the head
with this thing man the site is $5 right
now take advantage even if you come in
you sign up now you cancel it and you're
not ready to do it right now a year from
now it's still five dollars right if the
day that you're ready to start learning
is five dollars as long as you have that
same email now if you lose the
opportunity when you come back this
thing might just be ten fifteen dollars
twenty dollars whatever it is I don't
know what the future holds but at least
now that you guys are here and you're
part of the first you know first people
to sign up take advantage this I told
you guys I was gonna do it for one month
only and I'm not lying I'm keeping it
for one month only and that's it then
from there we're going right back to
tankers you know I got a I got a survive
kids you know I got a kid I got family
to feed I can't be out here looking
crazy you know what I mean like I'm
working super hard I'm knocking out a
lot of courses doing a lot of videos as
you guys can see super tire came in woke
up by 10 o'clock in the morning from
10:00 till now
I've been making courses making videos
for you guys on YouTube knocking it out
even if you didn't even care about the
courses and you were like damn Jos
knocking out a lot of videos for us and
just coming out here showed the support
man you know what I mean
like we're doing it for you guys how I'm
holding up I'm good
money-wise I'm good like I told you guys
um months I had it you know if you guys
look at my videos from like me or
something like that I said I was like yo
after September I'm gonna quit my job in
and start doing this full-time
so there's an experiment you know what I
mean like I got a couple of companies
that hit me up I got this company a
subsection from mercedes-benz that they
want me to work for their company
basically building sites with react and
nodejs
I haven't I'm trying to see how this
this month this next month go to see how
it goes if it pans out and evens out and
things are good and I can say okay I'm
gonna stay here for the long run then
I'm gonna stay for the long run and you
know what I mean if not then probably
like in eight nine months then I'll go
back to working on businesses you know
what I mean because people want me to
work with them and I was like that's why
that's the best part about it it's like
I've built such a solid foundation that
pretty much people know me already and
people want me to work with them and
they know what I can do like you know
what I mean like I can come in and build
a project knock it out
you know you know so let's see how it
goes I really want to just be doing this
full-time so I'm taking it to the next
level I'm coming in like I said this is
like my gift to you guys the last five
days for $5.00 right and then from there
on everything is for hours now from
there
starting on October 1st I'm focusing on
releasing all of the courses here on my
on my website
but at the same time I'm not gonna
promote my website that much everything
that I'm gonna tell people to check out
is gonna be on you to me cuz you didn't
me the people from you to me is gonna
you know they're gonna sprinkle the
sauce on your boy so they're gonna
sprinkle some promotion on your boy cuz
you know me I come in I hate them you
might see me like you know and alo
freaking you to me commercial like ya
trying to learn how is the commercial
that they do for Python is like like oh
yeah it's like you're trying to learn
Python it doesn't that I'm like hey man
you trying to get the sauce stop hit him
with it you want to come here to my you
know me course you know what I mean I'm
gonna be dabbing in that whole
commercial they put me in a udemy
commercial is a rap I'm just dabbing I'm
gonna a hit him with it you know what I
mean
but ya know like I said right now
there's like my website is my gift to
you guys right because regardless up
like I said I'm always gonna be
successful and everything that I do I
never take chances like you randomly I
planned things out I have enough for a
whole year I know what the hell I'm
doing I might even have enough with I
have another client that wants me to
build another website for them with his
website I might be able to make another
two years so I will be good for two
years on YouTube full-time right and of
course I'm it's not like I'm I'm freakin
bumming it is I'm still making some
money from here and then taking a little
bit from whatever is my savings so it's
like if I was making seven thousand
seven thousand from my job so you know
after taxes there from there I will come
in and now if I'm making like four five
then I will still take a little bit from
the savings put it into here and like
that you know so that's how you survive
sometimes you got to learn how to how to
have and managing your money man like
that's one of the best things about I
mean I got
like I know how to manage things I have
no debt all right
zero zero debt except for my car but
besides that I have zero credit card
debt I have no problems with any company
nothing on on foreclosures or
anything like that
you gotta be on top of your you
gotta be responsible so you you're gonna
be able to take risk you know what I
mean
so you you know especially when you have
a family you got to know how to do
things so you can't just be a crazy
person but you know I'm dropping
everything and I'm out you know what I
mean
you got to think about things I had a
time at and plan it out properly so yeah
don't worry about me I'm good you might
see your boy out here wolfing you know
with the with the ghetto with the ghetto
freaking the ghetto shade I love that
