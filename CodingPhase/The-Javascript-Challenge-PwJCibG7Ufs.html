on how's everybody doing how's life life
is good man got to enjoy your life man
you'll need this more man my boy Matt
back from vacation back from chilling
with wifey
all right so being here kids
all right so we're gonna start this up
man you know me I like to challenge you
guys I'd like to see what you guys come
up with all right so I want to start the
you know the JavaScript challenge right
now I want to do two things with you
guys one is going to be basically write
as much as you know of JavaScript and
what I mean write as much as you know I
want you to go over every single thing
write down how to write a variable right
now how to make a loop how to make a 42
loop how to make a regular for for a
loop how to do a switch statement how to
do a one-line if statement how to do you
know everything that you know of the
syntax of JavaScript that's what I want
you guys to do that's the challenge
right now the challenge comes up with is
basically you can look at the
documentation you can look at you know
was a mozilla s-- documentation you can
look at w3c school this is a challenge
for yourself there's a challenge for
yourself to see how much you know about
javascript I want you guys to challenge
yourself I'm gonna do this to myself
I'm gonna do this later on tonight about
not tonight I don't know if I'll do it
tonight if I do it tonight I'm gonna do
it tonight and then release the video
tomorrow right so I'm going to basically
record myself without studying without
looking at documentation just as much as
I know about JavaScript you know
straight off the head and I want you
guys to do that same challenge try to do
it just to see how much you know how
much is it's on your head how much do
you know about it right so just write as
much as you can
from the back of your mind you know not
everybody knows everything right but the
idea behind it is for you to know what
you know about JavaScript if that makes
any sense right that's the challenge to
find out how much you know right and
then from there you could but okay I
know these things
I know these things by memory I already
know how they work now let me work on
the other the other parts of the syntax
right so yeah that's my challenge for
you guys man
hopefully some of you guys take it
serious and then you know come back
share your code pen you know share your
copain of what you guys actually got to
up to you know some of you might just
know how to make a variable that's it
and that's all you know some of you guys
might just know how to do a for loop and
I say you know some of you guys might
know how to do a while loop and that's
it all right so challenge yourself let's
see let's see how much you know just do
it for yourself don't do it on the
Internet to like show off and be like oh
I freaking got every single thing of
 of JavaScript because you looked
at the documentation nah man
do it for yourself is this the way that
you're gonna actually know which areas
you need to study on it and get better
on right but yeah man
so what's good Kyle okay Dave my stairs
ciao all that child your boy Matt I
better put on my seat belt man I know
I'm like I'm not even half a block away
so I didn't need to put my seat belt man
it's fine if all you know how to do is a
variable that's fine then you know you
get to show that at least you know how
to do a variable you know challenge
yourself you know in Albany I was in
Albany I don't know if I'm ever going
back to Albany I'll be honest with you
I know I never want to go back up there
I got a speeding ticket 94 on a 55 which
I've never gotten stopped ever in my
life so I'll be honest with you guys I'm
never going back to Albany that she left
a sour taste I've never been stopped in
my whole life since I've been driving
since the age of 17 I only got stopped
matter of fact one time and that was
because one of my friend like he was
very suspect so if I was a cop I would
have stopped myself right so but
definitely I've never been stopped ever
in my life so for me to get stopped in
Albany it showed me something showed me
that I don't want to be around there
yeah a speeding ticket man right now I'm
going to court for that I'm paying
man money man and then hopefully I pray
the guy man they dropped that they
dropped that from a speeding ticket
to just like I don't know a regular
ticket I don't know they could drop it
to something else man because even right
now man me and my mom are in the same
insurance right and she got a ticket for
I think talking on the phone or
something like that
which I do all the time which well I do
it smart you see how every quarter I
record from here and like I don't pay
attention to the phone right but she got
stopped like talking you know texting on
the phone and they gave her like I don't
know like five points or some like
that I don't know how much points they
gave her but I know that the insurance
went up I know that she went up
so when the insurance went up it went
off for me and went up for her
so now I'm paying $500 in insurance man
so I'm scared I'm not high I'm scared
they don't drop this speeding ticket I'm
scared how much they're gonna put
up this this insurance man like
I'm really scared like I really
don't want to be paying imagine if
they'd be like oh we're not dropping
this tick game we're gonna give you like
eight points on your license
that means my insurance is gonna be like
I don't know probably like just by
myself it's probably gonna be like four
hundred dollars almost five hundred
dollars and I'm like I don't want to be
spending that much money on
insurance you know you know what I mean
so let's see I hope so I hope that man I
paid his lawyer good money man I
saw him listen man even if they don't
drop the speeding ticket bring it down
to like one point two points and I can
deal with eight points on the
license man for the next year and a half
because that's going to be
expensive
I don't know man Matteo's it seems like
you know a lot already so
yeah I always tell you guys you guys got
a build projects man for all of you guys
that haven't gone to my wife on my
website coated face come right I have
the let's bill Instagram clone right
that's a very good example for you guys
to actually you know if you want to
practice HTML CSS that's a very good
example right and then I have the
introduction to HTML CSS which we're
basically building a Facebook clone
alright so everything that you need
you're gonna learn it from there and
it's also good for people that know
already HTML CSS for practice you know
you go in there you practice
building this new Facebook and yeah man
also guys man listen whenever you go
through my links on you to me right the
ones that are on my description whenever
you click one of those links if you're
going to buy any courses from you to me
you know show love to your boy just come
back to my channel click on one of the
description one of the links on the
description and that basically helps me
out right that's like you throwing a
dollar to to me right personally on
courses that you was gonna buy
regardless right so I really appreciated
the people that could always come back
to my channel and use the links because
even if you already have two web
developer bootcamp or you already have
reacted course but you want to buy
something else you want to buy how to
learn web development or how to learn
Android development how to learn game
development right if you go through my
links for the next seven days any
courses that you buy they basically
throw like a dollar or two admin right
so it really helps out and what you do
is basically helping me out without
having to spend any money on me
right it's just like the course is gonna
cost you $10 anyways so you might as
well say hey I'll give it give like a
little tip to Joe you know just because
he was there
you know but yeah man right now I think
I think you do me right now has a sale
of ten dollars right now and I'm gonna
start doing this thing where I'm gonna
do like four reviews of courses I've
done there before but I'm gonna go
through my whole list all the courses
that I've ever taken
I'm gonna review every single one and
I'm gonna release one video a week I
don't know maybe Thursdays I'm gonna
make it to be just like a udemy course
review all right I'm trying to push it
on a schedule where I could be like okay
Monday is I don't know an advice
Tuesdays are live videos at night
Wednesday's can be just a random video
Thursday's is gonna be like a udemy
course review Friday is maybe I'll
release one of the videos from my paid
courses right and Saturday I don't know
I'm still I got a right down I got
a letter see how I'm gonna structure
this channel because I want to drop you
know I want to drop content and
different type of content every single
day so it won't be the same you
know but I'm always going to do this web
developers you know lunch breaks just
because just so you guys can you know
hang out with me with my lunch right
here we can talk it out
see how life is doing
do I recommend a four-year university or
a two-year Community College I mean it
all depends I went to a two-year college
and I went to a four-year college but I
would say if I had to do it again I
would have just done the four years
straight right now
the advantage of having to go to a
two-year is that you go to a two-year
and you get your associates degree a lot
of companies you know or even regular
jobs if you have an associate's degree
they still respect you more than
somebody who who basically all they have
is a high school diploma all right so at
least you got a little something ahead
of other people you know what I mean but
when you're in a four-year college then
it's different you know
yeah I try I try to reply to as many
people as I can you know I can't do it
every single day but I try to reply as
much as I can you know cuz what the hell
people when I used to send emails and
and messages to people nobody responded
back to me so I know how it feels you
know sometimes we want somebody on
YouTube you respect and like they don't
send you no message back or they ignore
you and or whatever right sometimes they
got so many people maybe you know that
would have been some crazy look at
this my phone drop right here in
the cut right and then it was right at
the edge and there right at the edge was
the sewer my chickadee just fell
right through this house some
happens man this one final destination
type for the phone the phone almost
lost his life
yeah man you got to start early
at 16 man
that's sort of like when I started I
started at 14 man and I left it alone I
started messing around with other
you know because I didn't know what I
wanted to do with myself and life you
know but if I was to go back man and I
was 16 I would just focus on this
because no matter what nobody tells you
people are gonna tell you all get off
the computer all the dualism that listen
when happens at the end of the day
you're the one that's gonna have money
in your pocket not your parents not your
 mom not your dad not your
 friend who's telling you all
let's go hang out let's go party not
that time can come later you know if
you're 16 you could bust your ass and
learn what development about 18 you who
got a decent job sometimes you might not
even have to go to college you know what
I mean
so yeah
that's crazy if my phone drops
in the sewer I'll call it a day
I'll be like oh that's it
it's gone I'm not calling the
fire department or or whatever
the sewer Public Works and
petrushka
what up what up MA
what's good yeah now if you're 29 years
old
listen I'm 29 years old 20 nights still
young trust me this is not there's no
limit to this thing you know this I've
seen people come in at 38 39 and they're
junior developers right so nobody cares
nobody cares how old you are
they just care is can you do the job can
you you know work with others can you
get to work on time can you stay a
little bit late if you know for whatever
reason you have to stay late to finish a
project that's what they care about you
know that's it
nice everybody's taking cold steel's
full-stack course man I'm gonna do
another video - about this cuz somebody
wanted to know like what are the top
courses on you to me and like I'm gonna
make this cuz I get emails I get emails
and I get information from you to me
they send me information like oh which
are the top courses of you know July or
June or whatever whatever the month is
right so I'm gonna put that out there
because sometimes it's cool to find out
what other people are actually you know
learning you know what I mean like I
didn't even know that people were
learning Kotlin right now a lot of
people are learning content right so for
Android development it seems like it's
the new thing is everybody's jumping on
it and I didn't find out so this morning
about it right so I'm going to make a
video about that just for you guys -
because it's information that's good for
you guys to know it's like you know it's
like what development knows you know
whatever it's how on udemy means that in
the community in general that's what
people are searching for that's what's
hot in the community so it's good to to
definitely know what's actually popular
right now
listen if you think coding is hard trust
me 3d modeling is even harder but it's
up to you a man and like FinTech said
man it's a whole complete different
industries totally different
what's the JavaScript challenge 84 your
boys in here shout out my boy 84 Kelly
okay all right um the challenge is
basically I want you to today open up a
coat pen right go to cocaine calm well
cope and dial and then from there I want
you to just take your time and break
down every single thing that you know
about JavaScript and I'm when I'm gonna
write it down don't you say oh there's
for each loops it's switch statements
this of variables no I don't want that
 I want you to basically if you know
how to make a variable write down a
varial you know the clear variable right
if you know how to make a function make
a function if you know how to
you know make a Swiss themeing make a
Swiss thing if you know how to I
don't know do a for loop do a for loop
don't just say oh there's four lose
their switch statements for each nah
show me what you know that's the
challenge right and the challenge comes
when you don't cheat and you don't look
at the documentation and you don't look
at anything else you don't look at
previous work that you did it's just for
you
nobody's gonna come here and judge you
on it it's for you to basically test
yourself and see how much you know of
JavaScript like by memory that's
already in your head that you
already retained let's see how much you
already retained all right so that's the
challenge for today now if you guys want
you guys can share the link of whatever
you know so far
don't cheat guys cuz you're not cheating
to seem cool and be like oh I created
this or why did this No
it's more for you to share to the world
as I Oh
all I know is variables all I
know is how to create a function it's
fine right nobody's gonna judge you it's
also for you to just know how much you
know right how much you know of
JavaScript that's retaining here without
having to look into the documentation
cuz we all can look at the documentation
and we all should but there's certain
things that we know by memory right it's
like right now somebody tells me hey I
want you to create a function that
returns my name and from the params I
want to be able to put him the name Joe
right so how can I return that back and
that's a string right how can I do that
so I want on the function to say hi my
name is Joe can you do that right create
a function that does that all right so
just challenge yourself can you do a
switch statement can you do a if an else
statement you know do else if statement
what else do a while loop to use that
filter use let's see what else you know
do our arrow function for es6 do
everything that you can remember and
then share the link on the comments I'm
going to do this tool tonight I'm gonna
do this to tonight and I'm gonna record
it for you guys so we go I shouldn't do
it you know together or you could see me
do it and see what the hell I remember
and some of you guys might remember more
 than me I'll be honest I know so
many different languages that
sometimes she gets mixed together so you
guys are probably better than me right
now with JavaScript because all your
focus are
just JavaScript right so that's why I
tell people like doesn't matter how how
long you've been doing this it's more
about how much time you put into a
certain topic or a programming language
or framework whatever it is right you
know I could be a developer for 15 years
and you know more than me
in nodejs because I've been just
focusing on PHP or Ruby on Rails or
whatever it is and you know more than me
and you're only being here for six
months you know what I mean like that's
how it is
all right guys so I'm about to eat I'll
see you guys later we talk later in the
little bit all right love you guys take
care and yeah we in here man
Wow guys matter of fact before I leave I
want you guys to go on my description go
to my website : face.com if not and you
want to buy any courses from you to me

boy out right now they started the $10
sale on udemy so today they starting the
rest of the month is gonna be $10 for
everybody so you just go through my link
and just support the channel man that's
