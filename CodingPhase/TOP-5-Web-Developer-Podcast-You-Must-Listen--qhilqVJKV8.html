boys you're back at it again man listen
we're gonna talk about the top five
right top five podcast for web
developers man make sure you subscribe
and make sure you like this video man
all right we're gonna start like this
man listen we got design versus depth
right this podcast is really cool
because you get to see the point of view
of a designer and a point of view of a
developer and like it's too pretty cool
guys like I think they they work with
Ruby on rogues and this company called
the agile League I think I think I
remembers to add the agile League
something like that um in Atlanta right
and they all work remote so that was
pretty cool and like listening to their
podcast and seeing how how they actually
work with each other you know remotely
always you know fascinated me because
I'm like that I kind of I want to work
remotely at one point I'm going to work
remote you know what I mean
but yes so design versus def you could
check it out on on iTunes if you guys
want to check it out them there or go to
their website also - there's this other
group you know another podcast call
mostly note is usually one guy and his I
guess is like his best friend who they
they basically talk about nodejs and I
don't even know if they're like really
professionals like I think they're like
brand new developers they probably have
like a year or two or something like
that
but they seem pretty knowledgeable and
it's cool because then you see you hear
stories about them like you know when
they were getting the first job
interviews and it gets pretty much
talking about you know how it was to go
to a job interview how it was to learn
node you know some of them like they
have sometimes you know people that come
in for that for interviews and I think
it's pretty cool I like them because of
their personality and the way how they
talk like they seem pretty cool they
seem like you know people who are
actually be friends with you know what I
mean and then you got Ruby roads man
Ruby rogues is like this guy's is
legendary like
they've been around for a long long time
and pretty much is it's about groovy
right so you got Ruby on Rails Sinatra a
whole bunch of different stuff that they
talk about you know ruby gems but at the
same time even if you're not a ruby
developer they really good at explaining
what's going on in in the industry you
know in the community either open source
or you know it startup so pretty much
it's good it's a very good podcast you
know I like them you know because they
constantly have new topics and and new
people that you know that come in and
you know do interviews talk about how it
is to feel like to be a brand new
developer and they talk about how to get
a job they talk about a whole bunch of
topics that as a web developer or our
brand new junior developer like it's
very informative and you know I will say
hey listen to this guy's you know they
would have JavaScript Java right this
guy's is all about JavaScript you know
so you will hear whatever new framework
is out there whatever's making a buzz in
the industry mocha you got view Jas you
got react angular you got ember
everything that you could think of they
actually already you know interview the
people who created it or people who are
actually in the team like you know you
got Visual Studio you got immutable Jas
you got four game Microsoft guy you got
gem stack you got Cold War's Cold War's
calm you got JavaScript Ellen I don't
know if you guys have heard of that
that's their like the new JavaScript
basically like a new language that
comparison HTML CSS and JavaScript what
else functional programming Cypress Jas
for like testing so they have a lot of
good interviews and so brand new
developer I think you guys should you
know definitely listen to this guy's now
running happy hour I love this this
podcast
because this are like really really
really good professionals like everybody

for Netflix they either work for
LinkedIn that'll work for Microsoft the
other work for the hellos the other
place I forgot but it's like seven or
eight different developers that work in
different all companies guys who are
engineers this is not like you know
you're dealing with like Johnny from the
block and he decided to make a podcast
like this or like grill you know Netflix
manager is like guys who are like pretty
legit man like you gotta listen to happy
hour man like straight up like there's
no way as a developer that you're not
listening to this guy's because they go
over everything they go over you see
talk about ember they talk about you
know mixed languages wasted on workflows
like they talk about hope a whole bunch
of stuff that you know in the industry
is like a standard or like whatever is
happening in the industry that you might
hear it or you might see it online on a
blog or something like they actually
talk about it and it's cool because
they're actually in the industry it's
like well we all in the industry but not
at that level you know I mean like they
really up there like you know working
for Netflix Evernote I was a elysian on
LinkedIn you know whole bunch of
different companies like they're legit
man like if you guys want to get a
little taste of what it's like to work
for one of those big companies man you
got a sign up man you got a subscribe to
these guys I usually use something
called stitcher right so you quietly
user on your phone it's on iOS Android
or you could listen to it and like let's
say on the computer so you can actually
come in and go like I'm sorry about that
click on listen and then from there you
got your your your stations that you
actually put in
and you see you got the big web show
JavaScript Java mostly known when we
wrote running happy hour design versus
dev like those are the people that I
listen to and why is good to listen to
like you know podcast why well if you
are developer like you want to keep
yourself in in a bubble in the you know
in the developers bubble until you you
Matt's like you've mastered everything
like that once you feel like hey I'm the
man and I don't need anything if you
ever do feel like that then fine then
you can do your own thing but if you
want to be part of the community like
trust me listen to podcast it's like
that's like a standard thing cuz when
you're driving around or you're
listening or your you know in a gym
working out or you're like coding you

links below support the kid if you
decide to buy a course on udemy remember
that we keep that to basically help out
other developers who are less fortunate
as you know than us and pretty much and
I'll take a little cut I'm not gonna lie
take a little cut you know but it's
mostly to help our people here on
YouTube that you know they can't go in
and pay for a new course they can't go
take a bootcamp they can't go to a great
school so at least I'll try to help out
the community by giving back most of
these youtubers nobody gives anything
back they'd be like oh yeah we given
away the iPad like an iPad is gonna
change your life I'd rather give you
like five courses and be like hey here
