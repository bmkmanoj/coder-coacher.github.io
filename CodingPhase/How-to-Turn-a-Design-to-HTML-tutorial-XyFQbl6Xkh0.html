right so we have a design we're going to
follow what this is I have but we're
going to use our own images what I want
you to do is follow my instructions
follow what I do trust me you will be
able to succeed in this this is going to
be such a cool project because it's
going to show you what it feels like to
be a full stack developer from scratch
hey guys so let's get back to it man all
right so I want to tell you guys
something right if you come here and you
click the star you know it's gonna take
you to you know the gate right now I
want you guys to help me out make sure
to let everybody know about this because
I just want to know who's actually doing
this Satori I know a lot of people watch
my videos but if you don't give this a
start I don't know if you're actually
doing their tutorials so all I want you
to do is just give it a start and make
sure that you check over here you know
it's gonna be different branches which
I'm gonna do right now I just created
one which is you know based on one big
story - so babe store one is where we
last left off which was just an
introduction right so if you guys ever
want to find out exactly where you guys
are up to it
if the code that you're doing is right
then you're gonna have this here you
know just for reference you know what
you could just look at the video and say
okay this is video - let me go to bake
store - right so show you this okay it's
refresh you see now you have paste or
more big store - all right guys now
let's do this okay let's get to it
okay so let's get the design worst of
the time I think I have here there's a
public image and then we have supreme
cool all right so we are found with the
header
this whole section here matter of fact
we're gonna break it down into sections
we're going to say okay header image
content but all of this area is going to
be like content area all right so I'm
gonna break it down so probably two or
three parts forget about this this you
know components for react he's going to
do that later on for now
let's delete this and start so like I
told you guys I'm going to break it down
like this right right this here okay we
got this little wallet let's expand see
right now let's create a section right
section this HTML five kids if you don't
know about this
it's alright it's just pretty much like
a like a div right so we're going to do
a section just to be fancy I'm gonna say
okay we want to start with the header
right so you have two header let's put a
class on this or we're gonna do an ID
just name it a header and then we're
gonna say this I should be using I
forgot what's the name of it the little
thing when you pressed ask I forgot
I'll tell you later on Larry number but
but I'm talking about a stick then you
go like that you see it actually does it
for you I forgot the name of it but
let's continue all right so we gonna say
okay section live we're gonna name this
logo alright you're going to copy this
okay now you ask yourself why am I doing
this okay remember I told you this whole
area here this whole area here is a
header alright so inside of the header
we have the logo in
then from there we have the menu so
that's what we're going to do right now
there is like a side area matter of fact
we only have two sections for now so
you're going to say logo and then inside
of a we also have plenty
so yes logo smell it all right cool
now this list Minges baked you know and
then we're gonna go in here create an
order list and then we're going to
create a lie and then inside of it we're
going to create a clicks or we could
even just put it outside say your course
so then I create this into an anchor
link so a giraffe we have home lookbook
which is usually a gallery okay
let's feel like that what that like that
okay
put this here let me open it up so you
guys could get used to this and you can
actually see that the menu basically is
inside of the header right and then you
have the logo and the menu inside of it
now it's out of the menu we have the
unordered list and anchored link and now
inside of the answer link we have a list
this item right the reason why I did
this is so when I click on the list item
I want it to be a link I could have gone
and put this anchor link inside here I
couldn't did that but the problem with
Dyess
it's not gonna cover the whole you know
the whole list the whole disarms thing
sighs all right so then I cover the
whole claim songs
you gotta see why I'm talking about it
all right so let's say home now let's go
and copy this for lookbook okay woman
okay sales stores what was it I don't
know like sales and stores it there
that'll make no sense for me okay so we
got home I like how that sounds
I'm gonna remove the sales we're gonna
call it let's go to the base store let's
find out what they got and I just want
this thing to look as realistic as
possible one of the reasons why I chose
the Bape store is as you can see it's
super slow it takes forever they haven't
updated this website and God knows how
long and it's kind of a shame I hope
that one day they see my video on the
bed you know what man
we should update our website like we
make millions of dollars so why do I
have to I have this old-ass website you
know what I mean song all right so we
got news okay so watch store make our
table arm baby my little store so cool
let's go back to this Oh as you can see
as we fight this shows up here cool
all right so we got a duel with the news
cool
all right move got it
so right now let's look into lil this
freakin thing okay okay so now let's do
this area which is the content area
let's create another section sections
are just a great way to separate things
and that you know a brand new section
just started so let's do this content
area now inside of it we have two which
is main photos and context
all right let's see this class so now if
I call it model model all right and then
Saturday we have this area this is where
we gotta break it down we're going to
come here and I say okay we have aa
meaningless differently this area we
could call it I don't want to name a
Content area
okay capillary already exist I don't
want to name this content I should name
a info cool all right
so we have let's say H five men's all
right then we have h1 now remember this
H you know when you see H 1 H 2 H 3 H 4
or 5 H 6 they're all used for headers
that's what it means it means header 1
so basically in order
so what you know h5 is going to be
smaller than h1 like super slow now h1
is going to be the biggest front that
you're going to have on your page plus
is usually used for our title so this is
perfect
alright so let's see then we have four
paragraphs and then you have another
section that we're going to call it
sizes all right okay now let's see how
we should do this maybe for now and we
gotta create a div kind of a close-up
yes to do it yeah I'm a little disc size
and then we're gonna call this title
right and then copy this and then it's
out of Silas we're gonna put each one of
these so this is where it's going to get
interesting how should I do this should
I started with unordered list which I
could do it like that
I couldn't do it on a list and then from
here I come and say Li write a fraction
only did ya a lie then I and then I
start putting in the things besides s
large extra large oops
extra extra large because that's what
she said
but let me see what else custom cool now
that's fine thing we got everything on
this now let's come to this let's create
the button area so this named is ok this
then we've got H 5 H 1 let's say Jackie
O so jacket dripping sauce alright now
let's get something from hipster if some
it's where I get my hipster ipsum
because I don't like lorem ipsum because
it gives you a whole bunch of weird you
know words this at least you know are
real words or is like when is very core
wholesome Yannick for local pop whatever
right those are real words so continuing
with this put this here okay now what
we're up to right now okay we got the
bugs that we got to create well let me
see the class okay we still got the
synthesizers what else we got to do find
the store well the bottom right so just
to live class actually sneaky ends
action body now for this let's create
supreme with Jackie what else or two
bytes so we're gonna start with this you
actually do it this in with a tax
so we say red collar VPN set aside of
everything span class large touch text
okay and then we're gonna put in the
dollar amount so 195 well if you're
talking about
you know beep you're talking more like
495 alright right kids all right let me
see and then here you can just name a
card now you ask myself why did I do it
like this why did I put a span this out
of it so this is the link right so this
whole box right here this whole button
is a link now why did I make it to put
you know the span of Saturday well you
see the 195 is bigger than this so let's
say this right here the axial cart is
actually that the font size is going to
be because of the font add up sorry the
link right so it's going to have the
font of the link now because this is
different we have to give this a
different font so inside of me we use
span span is perfect to just give a
second text a bigger font or if you want
it to be bold or whatever right so
that's why I used it now let's create
the otherwise let's copy this let's
create three
or say light gray light gray BTN and
then delete this and create find a store
now we have all the elements of the page
we're missing this well we might be
doing that later on not now all right
now so we basically got through this
whole part of you know laying things out
as far as HTML now we're going to jump
into the CSS all right I'll see you guys
in a little bit wow you already knows
