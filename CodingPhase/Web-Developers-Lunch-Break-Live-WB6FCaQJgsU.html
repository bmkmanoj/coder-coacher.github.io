like bait arena so there's like you know
like you got an understand like this is
straight-up beta right now we're like
we're getting there
you guys are getting the you know the
first look there's a lot of stuff that
that needs to get fixed
CSS wise this a whole bunch of stuff
that is in there you know and that's why
I was telling you guys man if you guys
you guys see a mistake man the thing was
open source at any moment you guys could
just go into the the basically the
project and do changes yourself in and
fix up a couple of things like you know
it's fine it's also good for you guys
for a portfolio to have as contribution
you contribute to a project
and like yeah man so coming is up to you
guys if you guys want to help out or not
it's fine I will try to get all the bugs
fixed throughout this week but right now
you could post you could leave comments
you could basically have a dialog where
other people's share a link I think you
guys should take advantage of that I'm
gonna be sharing a lot of interesting
articles that are fine in a couple of
the blogs that I watch and the ones that
I read and any videos that are fine
interesting I'm going to be sharing it
there that's pretty much gonna be the
hub you know the place where we all
gonna meet up have the community a lot
of people signed up so I know this is
just the first date you know and I'm
looking at the analytics and every time
I checked there's at least ten people on
it so that means there's a lot of people
going on the website right now right now
of course you know throughout this the
next three weeks we're going to start
implementing other pong other parts of
the website which are you know the
stacks
you know basically it's like a check a
checklist for you guys so let's say you
want to learn the know stack you know
nodejs you know the mean stack or you
want to learn Python or the lamp or
whatever or PHP right so there's going
to be different stacks and it's going to
have like a checklist of all the the
skills that you need to learn to be able
to to master that so it's like you're
going to be able to keep track of all
the things that you need to learn and
then as you go as you're already
comfortable it's like you check it off
your list you're like okay I'm
comfortable with creating divs creating
different layouts I'm comfortable with
CSS I'm comfortable with CSS flexbox is
I'm comfortable where
whatever right so and then at the same
time it's gonna be good because you guys
control that you guys get to add new
skills that people need to have meaning
like hey if you know a year from now CSS
changes right and new features get added
to to CSS you guys at that moment you
guys can add new features and say hey if
you're learning CSS you also have to
learn this new feature for CSS or CSS
for I don't know
right so the that's websites for the
long long term you know it's like you
guys definitely going to be able to come
back to this and trust me man the ideas
that I have for this site in the
promotion that I'm planning on putting
out and rolling out for this website is
is pretty huge you know so I want you
guys to take advantage and and also give
me ideas what what should a website like
this what should I have for you guys to
you know make your life easier to learn
web development right um right now I'm
looking on how you coalesce AWS to see
how much is going to cost to have like a
dedicated server for people to upload
videos themselves so because I know a
lot of people they want to upload videos
or tutorials or anything so I want I
want this to be also a hub for people to
be able to upload their tutorials for
free for people you know cuz sometimes
you go on YouTube in you know you have a
tutorial it's like they giving you you
try to watch a tutorial right but then
at the same time they're recommending to
you a video about a little cat
or they recommend you some from
Jimmy Fallon or they recommending some
 about whatever right and like
sometimes all you care about is like web
development or programming so I want
this place to just be like a hub just
for that just for you guys to say hey
when I want to find content for web
development or programming coding in
general I want you guys to come to this
website right
so that's the plan so what happened okay
cool um yeah man
so that's what we at right now we
getting there man it's a pretty cool
project man I'm very proud of myself to
actually get it done I feel like I kind
of needed that that for the baby to come
out so I could take those extra days to
just focus on coding it and working on
the things that I need to work on it's
like this week I'm going to spend a lot
of time with the baby but you know here
and there I'm gonna take some time to go
in there fix the bugs also to create new
videos for you guys so yeah yeah man I
got a fresh cut man I was going to let
this be a girl for a whole year I've
been saying this for so long I wanted to
do this for so long but people keep
stopping me people don't want to see me
happy they don't want me to see me half
that beard I've been wanting to have
that you know the nice hipster beard
with the little thing on the side like
that below I've been wanting to do that
for years but I can't do it
wanna gets too itchy and to somebody
don't let me do it
the baby the baby don't let me do it
alright guys so here man I just came by
to say hi make sure you go to coding
phase comm if you guys have a register
go register guys take your time and
whenever you find a cool video on
YouTube whenever you find a cool article
on a website share it there because
there's always people on the website and
it's you know the community is the one
that's gonna make this website I can
only add the features but only you guys
can actually make this a pretty cool
community if you also share content
alright and yeah let me see FinTech if
you if you really want to actually
remove the last the last github uh push
that I did was like fun on like a few
days ago but that's outdated already I
actually moved everything to bitbucket
to a private private gig so if you
really serious about helping out I'll
send me your email and send me an email
saying hey this is FinTech give me
access to the big bucket I'm gonna give
you access to the big bucket and then me
and you could talk and whatever you feel
like that needs to get fixed let me know
and yeah you can just pull the project
and just run on NPM install and run
composer update and I say order the
website is going to be on your local
computer it's that simple and like that
you could help our in I'll be cool I'll
put you down as a contributor all right
