need me for the intro you know be like
yo 84 you wanna come outside and play
you know what I mean so listen we here
we laughs guys I have a new link for you
guys on my description and I want all of
you guys that are here and everybody's
gonna see this video if you watch this
click on the link and go subscribe to my
new channel I need you guys to do this
so what I'm doing is I'm pretty much I'm
cleaning my channel so in the sense of
like I'm doing another channel where
it's gonna be smaller clips you know how
sometimes I do this live streams that
are like 2 hours long 3 hours long you
know a lot of people they like
didn't like that you know I mean and
it's fine I understand why because
sometimes you know you want to see a
smaller clip ten minute clip of a video
better edited you know straight to the
point
not a lot of the arms that are a you
know sometimes you want something a
little bit more better bite-sized so
pretty much it's called coding face
bytes so yeah man so that's how that's
how this man and a couple of new videos
is gonna be uploaded there and a lot of
the videos that most of you guys missed
cuz I know a lot of you guys don't watch
every single livestream right and
sometimes you miss out on the gems right
sometimes you miss out on the drama
sometime and sometimes we miss out on
like the funny parts sometimes you miss
out on things that you didn't see at one
hour and 33 minutes in you know what I
mean like sometimes you come in here you
say hey what up Joe I'm out of here
after 30 minutes right and that's fine
right but there's so much content in
those two our videos that now thanks to
your boy Jake itard and any of you guys
if you want to be part of this if you
guys want to be part of the coding phase
family let me know also too as the
channel grows I'm also basically paying
you guys whoever's part of this what was
part of the family it's also getting
money out of this I mean right now
YouTube we don't make that much but
listen you come in here you help out
listen $150 $200 a month it's not gonna
hurt you you know I mean yeah a little
sign it's a blessing you know what I
mean and then as a channel keeps growing
we start bringing it up you know what I
mean the more people that we have coming
to the channel and like the more views
that we get you know I'm more than
welcome to spread that out I'm not
trying to become a millionaire from
YouTube like listen if we somehow we get
to make this a huge community bigger
than what it is and somehow we we get a
little low benefit you know our me a
little a little black bag full of money
you know I mean like
we spurt in that that alright you
know what I mean so that's how we doing
it right now so yeah man that's the new
channel it's called coding face bytes
you know so it's just small bites off of
videos that you know we do on the live
stream and sometimes like I might do
like some sketches there I have somebody
who actually wants to make animations
for the channel
he hit me up he said Joe I know how to
you subscriber mr. black you know what
that means
Hey and also we in here but yeah so we
got animations and yeah I got this whole
idea from Joe Rogan you guys don't know
who Joe Rogan is I also got this idea
from what's the guy's name I think his
name is Dave Ramsey is it Dave Ramsey I
really like this channel I don't know if
you guys have ever seen this guy um so
let me see where is he Dave Ramsey see
if I could share this with you guys so
yeah so Dave Ramsey does the same thing
he does like three hour shows right
where his livestream he has people come
in ask questions live they call him up
on the phone he answers the questions
and they're from there his videos get
broken down into multiple different
smaller videos okay cuz most people
don't want to watch a three-hour show
you know what I'm saying like nobody is
in the mood for that I wouldn't be
watching that you know like if it's
something like this one like yeah you
know like there's a lot of different
different good moments in this channel
especially when I do a livestream like
right now somebody say hey Joey I love
you live streams but the the only
problem that I see is like sometimes
like ping pong or he's at pinball is
like it's like a pinball game you bounce
around different ideas and I'm like yeah
it's called a show you know it's like we
bounce around different ideas they if
you think like I must spend three hours
talking about one single topic like
that's not what you're gonna find here
on coding phase
come right so that's what we have this
new channel is gonna be called coding
fees bytes you know we're not gonna have
no curses we're not gonna have no Wiley
now like we're gonna have fun in there
but it's not gonna be like it's more
straight to the point
right it's like different bytes me
answering questions straight to the
point
right if I'm gonna talk about something
like and I took the body on the live
video there from there you know from
there basically it's just gonna be one
video talking about one single topic
without having to talk about $30 30,000
different things right and another thing
guys there's 51 people here ain't
probably a little bit more cuz this
little counter that you see is always
late no matter what so if you see in
this right now and you're here make sure
you hit it a low like button click that
little like button show us some love
so we go actually you know we could get
promoted out here on YouTube man but
yeah man so yeah we just trying to make
the channel a little bit better you know
definitely somebody that that's helping
me out is Jacob's heart he's also hero a
lot of the descriptions for the website
he's also in the chatroom on this court
you know we got a lot of people man that
help out but definitely shout out to
Jacobs are definitely part of the coding
phase family if you guys are you know
this this guy's out here who are high
coolest graphic designers guys if you
see a video on my channel you say Joe I
got a way better thumbnail than that
send it to me I'll upload it right away
I'll put it up for you
you don't know saying like help me out
you know there's only so much that I can
do I was telling somebody yesterday like
yo there's only so much that I can do I
can't do the courses I can't do the the
YouTube channel I can't do you know
coming here put the thumbnails put
upload the video do the livestream I
can't do everything at once so I have to
focus on basically three things creating
the courses doing the live videos
recording my youtube videos and
answering emails that's about it those
four things is what I'm trying to do you
know other things like helping promoting
the channel
doing the thumbnails breaking down the
videos into bites I can't do that by
myself so I'm gonna need to help the
channel is growing you know the more
that we grow the better that is for the
community and at the same time also to
the people who are here with me from the
beginning
you all gotta benefit out of this you
know me already I'm not wanting to snake
snake guys dudes out here but I oh man
Joe's trying to get some free intern
tonight man if we make some money we get
a little something our channel gross
I'm spreading that around you get
what I'm saying I'm giving it right back
to the people that helped out right so
that's what I'm doing
yeah go ahead ask me questions guys this
way we start answering questions this is
where we gotta start going hard
so go ahead ask me any questions I I'm
gonna answer it right now let me check
sometimes the the chatroom pushes them
up a little bit too fast so let me check
over here where I could actually scroll
so James
Aaron says what up Joe I want to ask
will doing all your course prepare me
for a full stack position yes if you go
in and you start doing everything from
the timeline from the beginning to the
end you're gonna be more than prepared
you know what I mean I'm also bringing
in on my sequel course in a MongoDB
course in the next two weeks in every
course that I I create and I do anything
that has to do with the backend I talk
about my sequel you know my sequel and
MongoDB um you know in an easy way
right like the be the most basic things
right but I'm also creating like two
major courses for so you could be even
more prepared so give me two weeks
you're gonna see the my sequel end of my
MongoDB course on it and you're gonna be
legit you're gonna be good so yeah man
are you gonna do another subscriber
hangout yes I will yes I will when yeah
I'm planning on doing it like I don't
know once or twice a week today I don't
think I'm gonna do it because I'm not
gonna be here for that long usually
that's when you're gonna see like the
the long long icon is long live streams
whenever I do it with multiple people
we're gonna do like a two-hour live
stream to three hour live stream but we
just talk about a whole bunch of
different topics okay but today I'm not
gonna do it today yeah I actually got to
do a whole bunch of courses that I want
to work on because somewhere this week
I'm gonna take a day off to do like a
bunch of different things that I have to
do with me
we got to do a couple of like things you
know normal things that people do you
know go out gay go to Motor Vehicles get
you know okay okay an ID like I'm not
even I don't even have an ID from
Connecticut you know what I mean like I
just moved out here I'm out here with my
New York license I'm like yo what up and
it's like now for you to get certain
benefits and certain things that are
mandatory to get you need like a freakin
and I stupid ID from Connecticut so I
have to go do that this week Joel do you
have to code so I have to call my own
portfolio can I just buy a template
doesn't matter oh no you don't have to
call your own temp your own portfolio
you who actually buy a template and say
hey there's the template that I like
this the one that I want to show to
people when they come to my website you
could definitely do that for sure all
right but one thing that I will advise
you is make sure that whatever design or
whatever features that you have on your
portfolio you can actually build
yourself and the reason why I tell you
this because if HR person alright HR
person sees your website says oh great
this is a beautiful website this
developer is legit they don't know that
you bought a template right now when you
go to an interview and I developer
actually oh you build your your page
you're gonna say oh no this is actually
a template I mean technically no but I
don't think nobody's gonna ask you if
you build it to be honest with you I've
never asked anybody oh do you build it
no i already assume that you built it
right so assuming that like let's say if
there's like peril of parallax scrolling
there's like filtering with you know the
different projects like let's say if i
choose show me HTML CSS projects or show
me PHP and nodejs projects and it
filters through and it looks all nice
and low pretty whatever make sure you
know how to do that because a company
might hire you expecting that oh this
person know how to do
so we actually might need this for our
website so if you don't know how to do
it now when you're at the job and that's
okay you do this the same thing that you
do on your portfolio you're like you
know a little filtering and isn't that
and you say oh I'm gonna have to google
that people is gonna look at you like
like yeah you just you schemed it you
know what I mean like you don't you
never want to do that so pick a design
or a template something that you can
actually build don't try to go in there
and pick the most amazing template and
then get embarrassed later on when they
ask you to do that okay so yeah let me
see what else let me see what else what
it says what up Joe wants us to actually
do and prepare for me I read that let me
see what else does it say people
let's see Forrest and says I just
watched your last video about the
YouTube algorithm I remember when I
first started looking at coding videos
they were beating me over the head with
your videos but I usually have to see a
youtuber many times before before I even
check it out I don't know if your videos
get promoted like they should but just
saying that we're showing it to me a lot
I mean that's good you know what I mean
I'm glad that they showing it but I feel
like they still not they don't show it
as much right and they used to show it
even more way more and I was because of
like let's say for example like you know
I was walling out in the beginning like
you know people were freaking flagging
me people were doing a whole bunch of
stuff right so then my channel started
dropping I also changed my content my
channel started dropping and then
whatever let's see I mean let me show
you guys let's say socialblade.com right
let me show you see windows capture
which one is a display capture okay so
there's the website so this is cole
socialblade.com where you co actually
come in here and look at the information
of any youtuber you put in the name say
coding phase okay and right here you can
actually see all the information okay if
you scroll down you'll see exactly how
many subscribers they're getting per
month see 92 6750 for 70 some days 12
sometimes when you see 12 like that that
means that they didn't add it properly
so then you'll see something like this
was like 129 when in reality it was like
split up between this two days and then
now it comes down to here so it probably
like 40 so here was probably like 40
sorry right then you start scrolling
down and one thing that you're gonna see
here is
as you can see my channel in my first
month two months my channel just started
blowing up right and it will continue
going up if I didn't change my content
and also to I was like cursing too much
and while I now I mean I was young you
know I mean you're coming here and you
to you you're not thinking like you're
not about to take the series you know
like when I came in out I wasn't
thinking like oh I'm gonna take this
serious alright so then my channel
started dropping dropping dropping
dropping so then now what I dare say I'm
just gonna focus on my content the
content that people like and then now
slowly but surely the channels going up
as you can see way more than even before
but there's a huge but all of this new
subscribers and all of the people that
show me love that's more of like let's
say how you call this of people sharing
my my content and showing it to to other
people alright now let's say when you're
in the algorithm like let's show you
right now like this is when they have
you really good in the algorithm let's
say like the dreaded different you look
at the dreaded death you know I hope
that he continued creating his content
and they don't drop him because I want
him to blow up like you know what I mean
that he's super cool I love his content
right but as you can see right now his
channel is getting like 191 138 201 4285
200 you know what I mean like the reason
why is dad's because they start showing
his his videos more on different search
results you get what I'm saying
and it's the same thing if you look at
let's say I see another one let's say
Chris Sean alright Chris Shaw
Shawn's right Krishan is being slowly
but surely growing you know slowly but
surely growing but one thing that you're
gonna see is that his channel never
really dropped his channel was always
like steady right when I came in my
channel would have been you know pretty
either going up or steady if I didn't
start you know Wilin out right now
because he stopped making us much
content his channel started dropping but
now that he's working back on his
content is going back up you get what
I'm saying
you see in total views as you can see it
starts going back up right so it's all
about the algorithm right if you're in
an algorithm and they have you good like
let's say if you do all the right things
for YouTube your channel is gonna blow
up right the type of content that I have
here nobody else has the source that I
have here I'm pretty much the originator
of this you know what I'm saying
so it's like nobody was doing this
before me period so pretty much is like
I know when people come here and they
see the content they love it but if they
never know that this content is here
because youtube doesn't show it to them
and also tool they don't show me all my
notifications right like if I drop a
video my videos don't get the full like
I say I got six was sixteen seventeen
thousand subscribers right they don't
show it to everybody they show it to
like a thousand people right they don't
show it to every single person
people don't get notifications they
don't get none of that stuff so that's
why I'm creating this other channel so
pretty much do everything right this
time now knowing how things work on
YouTube and you know just let's see
let's see how it is right and have both
channels growing at the same time okay
Plus at the same time is good because
most people don't want to see a two hour
livestream 3 hour livestream people just
want to see the questions like you know
when I read one of your questions right
there
sorry if people want to see that they
don't want to see you know uh freakin
30-minute ran they don't want to see all
of that they want to see that here
coding face.com at the channel but on
the YouTube algorithm I said no go you
know what I mean so we playing it smart
now we we bout to take this to the next
level I told you guys what I was trying
to do and for me to be able to take it
to the next level I need at least half a
million subscribers and I'm not buying
subscribers I'm not doing promoting or
Facebook I'm not promoting or Instagram
I'm not doing none of that because
that's fake subscribers I want organic
subscribers that people really find me
you know what I'm saying so it could
really be like loyal fans and people
that you care about you not just like so
random dude like let's say Chris was
this guy's name or Chris Hawks - Chris
Hawks right he did a video where he was
talking about his daughter and that
video got him a whole bunch of whole
bunch of views and a whole bunch of
subscribers and that was around yeah
that was around like April so let me
share this with you guys this is like
the behind-the-scenes you guys are seen
the behind the scenes of things right
I'm breaking it down for those guys that
want to create a channel so um Chris
Hawkes came in he created his channel a
long time ago he's been here for a while
but around April 2017 he made a video
about his daughter so there's like
what's it like to be the daughter of a
software engineer right and then that
basically became viral and got a whole
bunch of subscribers he got him a whole
bunch of subscribers but the problem
with that was it wasn't quality
subscribers a lot of those people were
creeps we're like oh oh your daughter's
sexy your daughter looks like Sonic your
daughter do this and that and it's like
that's not the type of people that you
wanna have you get what I'm saying
so there's situations like that where
you create a
video and it brings in the wrong crowd
to your channel I don't want that right
you know freakin other people that that
pay for their views when you pay for
views that brings the wrong type of
people you know what I mean like I want
people that's dedicated people that
really want to be you know that I really
want to code I don't want to have like
random people that are not even part of
the community or people that don't even
check alright you know what I'm saying
so yeah man so anyways let me start
answering some questions from you guys
what up cam has been a while man still I
was in Cameron a minute cam you need to
stop watching The Bachelorette you know
what I mean like stop watching come back
to the hood let me see another question
on Joe for practice should I use vanilla
CSS or use SAS we're practicing listen
if you already know what CSS is and you
know how things work or CSS just use SAS
that's it because it's like nobody's
gonna give you an award for using
vanilla CSS they just gonna be like okay
cool what could've taken you 1 minute it
took you five minutes to do whoopty do
you want a candy for that you know
that's how people's gonna look at you so
you might as well just use SAS SAS gives
you a whole bunch of different cool
things like you know variables it gives
you you get to import different of this
different SAS you get to inherit
different CSS you get to do arm loops
like there's so many cool stuff that SAS
gives you that there's really no point
of going back to CSS you know what I
mean so yeah man
let me see what else what else what else
so when is the next portfolio review /
stream I'm gonna do a portfolio review
probably after this video I'll do it
another video right after this so like
that people who have something new to
see you know what I mean like having
just live videos of me talking out here
sometimes it could get boring so I
release a portfolio I have a whole bunch
of portfolios that people send me man
and that's another thing to listen if
you start seeing any other youtubers
doing portfolio reviews call them out
man be like yo okay Cody just put coding
face on the chat room just put co2 face
on on the freakin on the comments man I
really hate when people start taking my
stuff man don't take my ideas man like I
spent a lot of time you know thinking
about things of what to create what to
give you guys and then I hate one
another youtuber just comes in and says
snap I'm gonna snatch this and I'ma run
with it don't do that
alright so don't take my ideas man
whatever I do here please don't take it
um okay so let me see what else I'm
reading this thing shows you helped a
lot
my first okay says magical trap says
thanks Joe you've helped me in landing
my first web developer job how should a
junior guy like me act be high act or
behave around other more experienced
developers I want to show I'm committed
but I don't want to be an annoying guy
how should you act around like senior
developers and mid-level developers
listen just go in there be a sponge if
you get what that what that means right
soak up any knowledge that they can give
you you know sometimes you might know
some things that you might think like oh
I know more than this person like let's
say somebody might come in you walk into
a company and they do all that net right
they don't know that much about nodejs
right if you know something about nodejs
or new technology share it with them but
don't show off with it
right you want to come in
humble your first two three years you
want to be a humble developer you don't
want to be in there like oh I know more
than you because those guys are more
experienced than you no matter what you
might know the latest framework you
might know the latest OB what you know
what I mean but at the end of the day
they have more experience than you
they've been through the struggles
they've been through the trenches you
gotta say so going they're humble hang
out with them if they actually hey man
what you doing for lunch you want to get
some peace that go with them you know
just be humble and at the same time if
you have any questions ask them right as
long as it's not something that's super
easy if it's something that you could
find on Google Google a find it yourself
nobody wants to have a junior developer
on on their tail like a little brothers
like please here Joe can you please help
me out with this I don't know how to do
this as I bro there's Google you get
what I'm saying like you get hired for
this for a reason right so yeah man so
you just make sure that you come in here
and and just like you know just do your
thing show respect for everybody make
sure you you get in there early try to
get there early if you can stay your
extra five minutes at work like okay
it's five o'clock in don't start getting
ready at 450 you know what I mean like I
seen this done so many time where it's
like you bout to leave high five o'clock
and dudes is already turning off the
computer at 450 as a bro like there's
still work to be done and then just
you're like hey man it's for 450 for 449
man it's like I'm turning off the
computer now nah bro you wait until five
o'clock show that you want to be this
show that you want to you know be part
of the team so that's what I will say to
you okay let me see what else
okay reading reading hey Joe for new
developers boom - enough or there is
some problems with the software like
Photoshop or IDs I would install Ubuntu
listen if you want to be a Linux
developer and open to developer like go
ahead you know what I mean like if
you're a developer is rare that
somebody's gonna come to you like a
designer is gonna come to you and send
you a PSD most of the time they're gonna
break it down for you already like is a
bad bad practice for a designer to
actually send you the PSD the designer
supposed to send you the assets the
design is not supposed to send you the
PSD he's supposed to come in and give
you all the assets already some meaning
like if there's a design he's supposed
to break down every single image out of
it and send it to you so in reality you
won't need Photoshop okay so you're
gonna be fine so just go ahead and store
boom - and most company there's another
thing - most companies will tell you
like hey you can choose whatever your
computer you want right like you could
go in and say hey I want a Mac and
they'll buy you a Mac hey I wanna brag
so you'll say ok by order the parts and
you could build it yourself like that
has happened to me a couple of times
even my last company they bought brand
new iMacs for us all of them right we
have some iMac minis and that was super
slow and then at the end of like yo
listen you guys want imax get the latest
iMac and that's what we did ok
so that happens all the time oh let me
see what else man let me see yeah
reading reading really really really
reading burn skull what up Hector
see Hey Joe can we still send our
portfolios yes guys please send me your
portfolio at coding phase at gmail.com
send it to me i go over everybody's
portfolio with time right so I try to do
one portfolio per week or sometimes even
two okay
the reason why I don't do all of the
videos right away because if I do order
of portfolios in in one week then it
doesn't give us you know content I mean
we don't we won't have content right
it's better to spread them out and have
something to look forward you know so
let me see Joe when you did freelance
were you doing core WordPress work for
people was there a lot of coding evolve
or was it just manipulating the themes
that you enjoy or was it boring when I
was doing freelance I was doing some
wordpress stuff like I did a couple of
themes myself um a lot of times that
what I would do is I was sure the the
client like a design if they liked it
that okay I will say okay cool let's say
somebody comes to me and say hey we want
you to build us a web site for a
restaurant right and we want to be able
to change the menu and this and that and
we want to have our own back-end but we
don't have money to pay you know two
three thousand dollars or even more for
you to build it's like a custom back in
right like if I'm gonna build something
in laravel you're gonna have to pay me a
lot of money because that's gonna take
weeks to build and to build all the
features that you might need right so if
they don't have that type of money and
they only have like 500 bucks 600 bucks
and 100 bucks I would just go in there
get a theme or let's say yeah theme from
WordPress that was about a restaurant
used to features that they already had
and then just redesign the whole front
end but the whole back end was from that
theme reign meaning I already had the
plugins already had the menu setup I
already had the login section so it was
just like more I did the front-end I
will use the
can of that team and from WordPress and
that's it and then I will give it to the
client
that will take me two days and I was
like $700 right there you know what I
mean like you can't be mad 700 hours in
two days how much is that I was like 300
a day or let's say if you work eight
hours
was it 300 divided by eight so that's
like what 37.5 that's like 37 dollars an
hour that's not bad you know I mean I
see people be like oh but those guys
talking about they cook a $100 support
per hour and it's like you know what to
do more power to them but most of those
guys they're constantly looking for
clients right that's another thing
switching topic sometimes developers
come in and they'd be like hey man I
want to get $100 an hour now as a
developer and you're freelancing can you
get $100 an hour yes you can but is rare
right it's rare to find those jobs so
what happens a lot of times I see guys
that they're looking for those
high-paying jobs online and then they
don't take into account the time that's
gonna take you to to find that find that
that project or find that that company
that's gonna pay you that much now if
you take less you find a job like this
or you can also do multiple jobs at that
same thing and get paid more than $100
an hour right so let's say you're
working on a project for a company and
to tell you hey we need you as a
freelance we're gonna pay you $100 but
the the work that they gotta have you do
is super difficult which is gonna take
you all day and then not only that when
you leave your computer you're still
thinking about that job because it's so
difficult so complex it's so much work
that you got to do that you're like oh
man
even though after you leave your
computer you're pretty much working 24/7
because it's very complex that's why
they're paying you are $100 an hour now
you can say hey I could
take two freelance jobs that are paying
me $40 an hour that I could do with my
eyes closed right and that's the type of
jobs that I like right when I'm doing
freelancing I'm not trying to do nothing
complicated I'm not trying to come in
here and recreate the wheel I'm not
trying to go in there and create robots
now you could keep those jobs I'd rather
do for different jobs for different
clients they're all paying me 40 to 50
dollars an hour and that's more money
than what you will get paid getting
stressed out getting worked out with
whatever your job that you do it for
$100 an hour I rather do for jobs that
basically pay me for 40 to 60 dollars an
hour
I've from what I've noticed for me that
is better because number one you're less
stressed
number two usually it's like super
simple jobs like you know somebody comes
to you as I hang could you build me a
restaurant web app or restaurant
application or a website or a landing
page hey I'm creating a new video game
for you know iOS I need a landing page
could you build it for me I'd rather do
that then go in there and recreate the
wheel right because I could do that with
my eyes closed I could probably do that
was like two three hours of work a day
and then go do something else or go work
on another project or come back here on
YouTube you get what I'm saying so it
makes more sense
some people they they get stuck an idea
of trying to to make the most money for
one single job but you gotta understand
the reason why they paying you $100 or
even more than that is because the job
is very complicated very complex it's
not a type of job that you're gonna be
like oh I'll do this and I'm working
from home and I'm just gonna do 3-4
hours and now I'll play them in and
charge them for the full eight hours
it's like now buddy they're gonna have
you doing some complicated work and
you're in reality it's not working you
know what I mean because if they paying
you that is because they like they don't
want to pay multiple developers so most
of the time when they paint you that
much is because they want you to be like
a one-man team doing the front
during the backend during the database
uploading into the AWS doing devops like
you doing like you wear five different
hats to earn that little on to
the others I rather be smart get fifty
dollars an hour and basically just do
like something super simple that I could
do with my eyes closed
I've had situations that people pay me
to do work for you know two weeks right
for two weeks and I oh they have a
project for me that is the deadline is
that two weeks from now right I never
worked on it till the last two days I
work hard for those two days and then I
handed it in so meaning for the two
weeks I had nothing to do I had fun I
was going out I was back you know back
then I was going clubbing you know
listen putting in that work let's just
say some people need to get their backs
checked out let's just say that you know
I mean so I was out here so I was
chilling right so for two weeks I was
chilling hanging out with shorties and
at the last two days I remember it was
like a Saturday and a Sunday it was like
doing the Monday so I did the whole
project build everything Bill freaking
uploaded it and freaking put it online
and I got paid man money and I pay like
I think it was like $1,800 for two days
of work you get what I'm saying cause in
reality it they were planning that I was
gonna take me two weeks I did it in two
days cuz it was that easy
now when you're in a when you're in a
situation where you're like working in a
very complex application you can't you
don't have that luxury you can't just
say hey I'll get back to this nah buddy
you're doing a lot of work man trust me
they're gonna milk you for that hundred
dollars okay so you gotta be smart out
here let's see what's the next subject
let's see
so how long should take me to learn
WordPress WordPress is very simple man
if you know PHP and you understand web
development you're gonna go in there
with your eyes closing and be like oh
cool this does this this does that
there's already an admin section that's
already a login I mean what could get a
little bit complicated is creating
custom plugins but that's like regular
web development you know what I mean so
it's like you go in there and do it
yourself
so it's not that bad but yeah man so you
should learn that pretty quick it
shouldn't take you less than a day you
know to understand the basics all right
Joe you should put your sauce on
Soundcloud yes I was doing that before
in the beginning but like I said it was
getting too much you know it's like I
had to download the full livestream
download a re uploaded to SoundCloud it
was a lot of work hopefully Jake guitar
to help me out with this you know me and
him put do more work together and get to
spread you know spread the sauce all
over the place if people's faces
Ayoo that in sound right but listen you
take it how would you take it you know I
mean but now we try to put the sauce
everywhere man so damn now now I'm
thinking about that now thank you for
asking for this question so what's the
next one let's see what else
can a link to coding phase go ahead man
link it
please I hope I hope not I hope nobody
nobody starts reviewing portfolios
please man just call them out whoever
does it just call them I was like come
on bro like let Joe live man could you
give Joe some time to like you know what
I mean that's like right now if I was to
be if I was gonna be an a-hole and be
like you know what guys I'm just gonna
make another channel that's gonna create
a whole bunch of tutorials and I'm gonna
compete with traversing media I'm gonna
take all his idea like he did yesterday
he day or PHP authentication today I'm
gonna do PHP authentication like now I'm
not gonna do that that's like some
dirtbag stuff you know I mean but yeah
man
so ma please don't
okay I'm reading I'm reading what will
you learn first JavaScript or Python if
you had to choose between them I think
if I wanted to understand programming I
will probably choose Python because I
think JavaScript can get complicated for
people as their first language
some people think like oh is in the
browser it's like listen it's in the
browser you could even use it with a
console log it's that easy you don't
have to compile anything you don't have
to install anything okay buddy like but
besides that you know besides that is it
easy to understand the Dom it's easy to
understand objects is it easy to
understand a whole bunch of stuff when
when you go in there and and you say
console.log this and then you find what
the hell is this thing down here that
says proto and then is like thirty
thousand million freaking features
different methods in there and you're
like wait what I'm supposed to learn all
this stuff for people that get
complicated right for people to be like
now I don't want to see this as my first
language so I think I would choose
Python as my first language just to
learn programming there's a big
difference between becoming a web
developer and just to learn programming
let me see Joe Hey Joe how did the
hourly work in freelance works what what
does that mean how does our hourly work
freelance I mean it's just estimate
I think Elaine's try to do something
where they you have to turn on your
browser and then the browser
you know calculate you know just
estimates the time that you bring on a
computer and like that's done right
because you could leave that computer
right there the whole day
you know what I'm saying not do anything
what I do is just estimate I'll tell
somebody hey Mandy this is a big project
is gonna take me three weeks that's it
if it takes me a date hey is the
estimate you know I mean like that's not
my fault
it's not my fault that that day I was on
fire you gonna say like that's what I
tell people listen like hey it's not my
fault the estimate was two weeks I did
it in one day it's not my fault that
your boy was on fire you gotta say I did
it in one day that's out of my that's
out of my hands that was God's gift you
know what I'm saying like it was
supposed to take two weeks but God said
here you go jump get that little sauce
get this project done as soon as
possible go in there can't you know so
you still gotta pay me for my two weeks
you know I mean that's that's out of my
hands
you know I said jesus take the wheel
Jesus Jesus take the keyboard you get
what I'm saying like I say well I'm out
here
I miss your voice start wailing let me
continue to the next next question man
instead of learning and going to a
company can you just open a digital
agency yes you can
you could definitely open up your own
digital agency like let's say you work
in a company right now even work in a
company sometimes you you in your area
right and you've realized that there's a
lot of small businesses if you live in
I don't know somewhere in Wyoming
there's not another digital agency in
your whole area you can go and build all
the websites for that whole area and
just take over this happens all the time
people move into different towns they
move to different cities and they
realize there's not that many people
that is creating cool or cool websites
and you know get given that service out
there it's like right now like I live in
a part of Connecticut where I looked
online I'm like whoa it's not that many
people doing this around here like I
could literally take over in st. I'm
setting up shop Deebo you know I mean I
could just do the whole the whole market
out here right cuz ain't nobody messing
with me in this area right but do I have
the time no right so you have to be like
one of those peoples everybody okay I'm
gonna open up my agency I'm gonna put my
office because in reality you could do
it from your house but when you open in
your own agency you need to open up your
own office so it could look like gee you
could get somebody your business card
you say okay here here's X Y Z the X Y C
agency you know the Harry Potter agency
the you know the Betty Boop agency the
the freakin Bugs Bunny squad you know
Bugs Bunny designs you know here's my
card
you know what I mean so now you have a
place to go so when your your clients
come in you have that office space and
they're still okay there's a real
business it's not something do it in a
basement you know you never want to have
a digital agency starting from the
basement like some people do it but it
just doesn't look good because now when
you tell somebody hey man it's $5,000
then I'll be like come on man like you
live in your mama's basement I'll give
you 500 you gotta say like there's a big
difference when you got our office you
got our office you got a designer you
gotta have you know maybe you was a
front-end developer another backing guy
because the more projects that you get
in the more money that you're gonna have
right the more money that you're gonna
make so technically you're gonna have at
least two or three develop
first in one designer it may be one
intern you know and another girl who
picks up the phone so it's like it takes
a team you can't just say I'm just gonna
open up a digital agency here's the the
XYZ agency you gotta do it properly you
know I was thinking about doing that at
some point in New York cuz I have my
friend angel who's a designer he works
for a Capital One now I mean him was
thinking about that I got my other boy
Joel who was also thinking like yo we
should open up our own business but the
problem is like I'm out of New York you
know what I'm saying like I am driving
to New York to do all of this stuff plus
the rent in New York cost a lot of money
you know like if we rent a office space
something decent like a storefront you
gotta you talking about $3,000 and up
right so let's say for the first six
months you don't get not even one client
right you gotta have how much is that
three times six is like why 18 you gotta
have 18 was it yeah $18,000 just to pay
for the storefront and nobody has came
in there you know a lot of people come
in a lot of people come in into
storefronts in in acts to see if that's
here your business or whatever like
that's the best way to really get new
clients I learned that from that that
agency I used to work in in in how you
gonna sing a story of Queens where
people would just be walking by and be
like Oh what is this oh there's an
agency you know whatever you need you
need designs you need website need logos
like we built it for you you know I mean
so it's pretty legit and like the
mistakes that people make when they
start their own agencies is that number
one they want to do it from like a loft
oh I'm gonna do it from a loft unless
you already have the clients I mean like
it only works if you work for like
another agency and then when you leave
you leave with all the contacts of all
the clients your goal your good
you're golden but if you come in and and
you pretty much just just go in there
and you're like you know kumbaya you
think you're gonna get our agency going
without no clients without no upfront
money without money that you're gonna
pay to the developers and the designers
like your business is it's going to flop
so let me see what else
you
let me see let me see
I'm see Nelson Cynthia Sandoval Kel okay
was guessing - yeah I see you MA
oh sorry super immature but yeah we here
we got to squat it's just I just wanted
to make sure you I see you it's just I
haven't gotten to to your question yet
so I'm reading through the people's
questions let me see what it says hello
Joe from Nelson Torres says just started
Cold Steel web developer course any
advice on how to get the best of it cool
okay so let me see okay hey Joe or
should I go for getting a website name
oh no sorry messed up
you're my mistake I'm just reading
through everybody stuff so yeah hello
Joe started cold or cold steel's web
developer course any advice on how to
get the best out of it listen just go in
there watch one video and do it with him
right and then on another page build the
same thing that you're building with him
but do it on your own if you understand
what was going on on the video why you
was doing it and then now you could do
it on your own then you're gonna be good
that means you actually understood what
was happening and how things work right
you don't have to remember everything
meaning like you don't have to remember
every single method every single CSS
property that's why Google is there
right your whole first year your whole
first two years it's gonna be googling
right because you got to remember the
concepts but you're not gonna be
remembering every single thing that's
under the Sun of web development what
you want to do is remember the concepts
if somebody comes in and tells you oh I
want to put this this thing multiple
times on the same on the page but it's
the same thing then you will say oh I'm
gonna use a loop I don't remember how to
do a for loop well I know that I could
loop this and show the elements
six times right somebody comes in and
tells you hey I would like to have you
know a little box that has little
rounded corners box radius you not going
to remember that the first few months
but what you're gonna remember is o to
make a circle so make the corners round
eight
I could Google that and then somebody on
the internet soon as you put that is
gonna say box radius now you understand
the concepts somebody comes in and tells
you I want to save you know I want to
save a data when I submit a form you
don't remember how to do that but you
remember the concept
you got a post so you know how to do a
post request so then you google how to
save a save data from a form you
remember the concept you gonna say like
you're not gonna remember everything so
go in there and just follow along what
he has and then do the other thing the
same thing that you did before but do it
separately oh another file I did a video
about this you should go to my channel
this channel coding phase and literally
the number one video that showing
offices how to learn to call it the
proper way
it should be there alright Cynthia I got
you
Cynthia's underwire says how long did it
take you to learn PHP
basically I learned I'm not gonna say I
learned everything about PHP right away
but I learned the concepts of PHP and
probably I don't know like a few days
right because I already know how to
program because of JavaScript and I
already know how to program with Ruby
and then when I started touching PHP and
the reason why I started touching PHP
was because of WordPress and everything
so I needed to do a couple of like
custom plugins so I needed to use
WordPress so I went into learning into
PHP and learning how things worked with
PHP but like the concepts of a like for
loops or you know for each what else you
know post requires get variable still
other things that you're gonna learn
from PHP but a lot of the stuff the the
meat of it you already learned it in
other languages okay so it's just more
about learning the syntax okay now let
me see
and by the way if you're looking to
learn PHP go to my website there's a
video well course there's about I don't
know like 14 to 20 hours of me going
into PHP and teaching it and to be
honest if I were to tell you hey man go
watch Edwin Diaz or go watch my PHP
course I will tell you go watch my PHP
course you know what I mean so that's my
advice you know there's not really that
many good PHP courses online so sounds
like a douchebag move but I will
definitely recommend mines because
that's the most the most complete course
that I've done like it's really legit if
you go in there you're gonna get
everything that you need to learn from
PHP anyway so I'm gonna make a youtube
channel in a star reviewing portfolios
go ahead Tyler Brennen
and then from there I'm just gonna call
you out that's exactly what I'm gonna do
you know me I'm the type of dude that I
just I don't keep my mouth shut you know
yeah man oh now I'm look Taliban says
Joe the other day I found that I
Philippe comment you was talking about
look as calming him going back and forth
from the freelancer video
yeah like whatever I'm coming here I
will say the sky is red I mean there's a
lot of people that do that but not to
his level
right you could come here and give an
opinion that's totally you know
different than what I'm doing and that's
completely fine but when your your job
is to basically go against everything
that I do or everything that I say then
I have a problem because that means
you're you're constantly just you're
just here to basically go against
everything that I do is I bro why are
you here like when I don't like a
channel right I just don't go there you
know what I mean like I was subscribed
to another channel that pretty much as
soon as this person say oh well
WordPress PHP you're stuck at 60,000 I
say bro you have no idea what the hell
you're talking about and say peace I son
subscribed and I moved on from me
because I know plenty of guys that make
way more than $100,000 doing PHP and I
know guys that make way more than
$300,000 doing WordPress themes so you
know what I mean like when people talk
on the internet and they don't know what
the hell they're talking about
I just love it okay cool I guess I'll
subscribe if you feel like I don't know
what I'm talking about
unsubscribe you get what I'm saying like
that's why I tell people so I just don't
take it on my hands to be like I'm gonna
go against everything this person says
it's like it doesn't make sense
let me see
you
you don't know Jas is like you're
watching everybody's livestream let me
see
and what the mean is just address
hosting will allow you to you know
internet that make sense okay I guess he
was talking somebody else
84 music yo Joe out here like what up
depth
let me see hey man right over the border
in New York yes sir is the Craigslist
course finished oh not yet
Craigslist course still got at least at
least another five hours in there it's a
very big course I think it's not that
many people doing it and that's because
I think a lot of people are still
working on the beginner courses and
that's fine because a month from now
they're gonna go back into the next
projects with react which is gonna be
the corrects of this clone and they're
gonna be like wow this course was so
complete there was so much work so you
know what I mean like they gotta be like
damn you know but before I was like
taking a little bit I was like damn I
released of course not that many people
were watching it but after looking at
the data and doing everything that I did
you know this past week I was like y'all
wait most of the people are still doing
the beginner courses it's like I'm doing
more advanced courses now it's like of
course not they're not gonna do it now
because they're not up to there you got
what I'm saying so that was a good a
good feeling that I had the sweet girls
are oh it's like sometimes I stress
myself out I'll be like damn man
I'm putting in 20 hours into this course
I'm doing this and that and not that
many people are doing it and it's like
slow down Joe don't get upset
it's like people are still in the
beginning courses like they're now up to
there you know what I mean so that's how
it is see
let me see where we got the Wolfpack
somebody Sammy's like yeah there's been
the Wolfpack since the beginning the
sauce please don't copy the sauce okay
Tyler been in a company you have a
designer who designed the website my
question is do you just get a PSD with a
desire to the designer give your style
guide I mean you get a started depends
on the company like there's so many
different workflows man like you go into
a company where they give you the design
the full page and say okay builders
right there's companies that come in and
give you even the CSS Styles right the
designer might come in and give you
every CSS style so you don't have to
even worry about the styles or anything
there's companies that they might just
give you the assets meaning just the
images like the you know the sliced up
images of the design and say okay build
it like this design and here's the
assets some companies might give you the
PSD it all depends how big the company
is and how organized they are okay this
companies that they like let's say um
what is it Atlassian Atlassian and
Netflix right their workflow is
different their workflow is they create
components right so like let's say if
you see a bunting on Netflix every
single person on the company is using
that same button component it's not like
you're creating on a brand new button no
you're importing the component and now
you're using that button so now is like
reusable components and then when they
change it once it changes through the
whole website you know what I'm saying
so it's different flows man every
company is totally different and that's
why I tell people build your portfolios
send it out to people to different
companies don't worry about all can I do
this can I not do this no matter what
company you go to they're gonna teach
you how they do things on their own way
doesn't matter what company it is okay
so don't worry about if you're doing it
the right way if you're doing the best
practices if you're doing this and that
guy's every company does it difference
so be honest with you
where is at the top is the one that
decides how things are gonna be done
throughout the whole company
unfortunately that's how it is
let me see what else
I see Dada Dada reading
oh you could always try co-working
spaces like we work in New York
Cynthia's on the wall said saying this
on the watch says I'm the bomb I'm the
bomb here you know me
let me see I'm really what else what if
there was no Google will be on bing word
or maybe like ghost or maybe axe Jeeps
you know or axe calm we could be on so
many different things I wish there was
another you know search result company
or another search engine cuz how given
Google that much power people don't
understand it's like a monopoly and it
sucks cuz back in the days people will
say oh I'll go on my EOS search and
searching they will find you your
website like right now we could create
the most amazing application right or
online the best social network right
unless we spend a lot of money into
marketing nobody's gonna know that our
social network even exists that our
application even exists you know and it
really it really sucks cuz Google
basically controls that Google says okay
cool you gotta pay us you know five
dollars per click it's like that's a lot
of money it's like if you create
something like you nobody gets to see it
back in the days having multiple search
engines was the best kiss you could rank
number one on one of them and that will
bring traffic and it's like now having
just google it sucks okay let me see
see what else is that a good idea to
just focus on vanilla JavaScript after
HTML CSS you could just focus on if
another JavaScript just the basics don't
go in there thinking I'm gonna master
everything under the Sun of JavaScript
you're not gonna be able to do it I'm
being honest most people that think like
that that thing like oh they're gonna
master everything and they're just gonna
focus on know-it-all on JavaScript alone
it's gonna take you years this is not
something that you're doing one day so
just learn the basics and then move on
to whatever you need to be able to build
a full application when will you say is
good some more from JavaScript like once
you you're able to go in there and
change things around I mean out of
classes and know how to create functions
and if and else statements once you know
that you know JavaScript the basics so
move on should I use PHP or firing base
for back-end contact phone I haven't
touched the backend bounced and the
basic from visual basics and C++ like
variables and loops yes
building in PHP firebase is cool if you
want to say oh I'm just a front-end guy
I'm never gonna touch the back end if
you want to be one of those losers then
go ahead right now firebase is great for
people like an iOS developer if I'm
building an iOS app right or Android app
I don't want to be worried about doing
the application and also build in the
backend where I'm gonna save all the
data nobody wants to do that right it
doesn't make sense so you will use
something like firebase but if you are a
front-end developer and you're saying
hey I'm gonna be working with forms I'm
gonna be working with data listen learn
PHP learn the basics learn the basics on
my sequel my sequel you can learn the
basics of it in like an hour it's not
that hard at all you know it could be
more complicated when you start creating
complex sequel queries but you don't
have to be like the best
sequel query developer out there you
know what I mean like you learned that
with experience the more you build
applications the more you see oh this is
more effective this is more optimized in
another sequel query you get what I'm
saying like that's how you learn you
learn about making your mistakes but if
you start thinking I want to master
everything you're not gonna get nowhere
okay let me see no Jay has learned
Braille don't build your portfolio
course they're gonna build your
portfolio course yes I'm actually doing
a whole different nodejs course like I
said I'm doing well for dynasty yes the
nodejs course that I built I might even
make it for free it's not complete the
ending of it is not complete I might
even make a free I'm I just released it
for free for people that want to see it
right because people say Oh Joe I still
want to see it so if you still want to
see it there's a lot of gems in there
that I put into it but the problem is
that I'm not supporting it meaning I'm
not going to go in there and tell you
this is how you install nodejs this is
how you do listen that because I just
don't want to deal with it a lot of
people I felt people should know certain
things if you're jumping into nodejs you
should know the basics of the
console.log you should know the basics
of the terminal you should know the
basics of working on your computer if
you don't know how to use your computer
you should not be touching nodejs I tell
people this all the time people don't
believe me they think I'm like crazy
like I'm telling you something for your
own your own good you know it's like nah
man like don't try to jump into nodejs
if you don't understand the whole
ecosystem meaning if you don't say how
web development works if you don't
understand how to even install it on
your computer don't touch it
I'm being honest with you guys don't
touch no js' unless you know what you're
doing because all its gonna do is
confuse you more if you
really want to touch the backend learn
with the PHP seven course it's way
better like for the people that I'm
building the nodejs course is for people
that already have taking some type of
back-end language or they understand
certain things about databases they
understand things like installing you
know different languages on their
computers like I'm not babysitting
people on there's no js' course because
no js' could be a mess and I'm just
pretty much telling people ahead of time
this is not gonna be a babysitting
course this is a course that is like hey
man if your computer's on Windows 10
point seven point one figure out how to
install in Windows 10 point seven point
one that's your job my job is to teach
you how to code teach you how to build a
website it's not to teach you how to use
your computer what that's it okay I'm
buying a lifetime access to Joe's course
soon as I'm I'm worn with apps what I
lost it I'm done with the apps with one
of my ass okay cool sign up to the
lifetime man I'm gonna be building
courses forever guys this is a career I
told you guys I did a career change I
basically I quit my job to do YouTube
full-time to be able to travel the world
and teach people code right what you're
gonna see right now and on my website
you might see the lifetime is like 300
bucks it's worth it right um you might
see the yearly is like 200 bucks you get
the 50 percent off it's a hundred
dollars you know what I'm saying like
there's like the best time to sign up
there's people that believe to me and
are paying five dollars a month right
the people that came in in the beginning
and they subscribed to the channel
subscribe to the website for five bucks
that's a they get access to everything
it's like the best deal online I'm not
gonna stop making courses I'm gonna
continue making courses for the rest of
my life this is gonna be this is the
journey that I took I already took it so
I was like this is where I'm going so
for you guys I come in
you know five ten years from now if I
have let's see there's just an example
right if I have like 200 300 courses on
the website you won't you won't see it
at 300 dollars the lifetime I'm being
just honest because the amount of
content that's there and even monthly is
not gonna be the same price that it is
now so knowing that the best thing that
somebody could do is say hey I'm gonna
buy the yearly I'm gonna buy though the
lifetime I gotta buy the monthly sign up
now so you can say hey forever I own it
I basically I'm holding this price you
know because later on the bigger the the
the site becomes there's either two
roads there's the road that the price
might go up or the price so many people
might have signed up that say hey man
the price might go down but most likely
the price will go up you know five years
from now not now but five years from now
and one thing that are I could tell you
guys is like we blink sometimes and time
goes by super quick like we see this
websites I know it's just Joe five years
from now this thing might be a
multi-million dollar company you know
with our eyes closed because I'm working
super hard I'm really promoting this
this website I'm doing all my work I
mean look at arm this guy called steel
cool steel making like two million
dollars a year all right he got multiple
people working for his company you know
I mean like that's just how it is
right now he makes deals directly with
you to me you know me personally I don't
want to deal with other companies I want
to if they want to do partnership they
bring it to coding phase calm and then
everybody that's on coda face y'all get
to eat you know but it's just I tell
people all the time just take advantage
man you know so it definitely true
trinny troph Aniela true meaning I don't
even know what's your name man thanks
for thinking about signing up for the
lifetime
Oh Joe what do you think of WordPress
this man wordpress jobs in my area but i
don't want to see myself back because i
read that it's dying
listen man stop reading stop reading
from people that's telling you things is
dying things is going away because it's
not guys i've been hearing this since i
started in 2012 and there's more jobs
than before like you know what i mean
like when I first came in I was just
doing front him number one I was scared
to do the backend cuz I said oh it's
gonna be a mad work I gotta learn so
much I gotta be a expert it was like nah
you don't have to be an expert you don't
got to learn that much you already
learned programming through JavaScript
and then now it's actually easier cuz
how does you guys can see JavaScript is
a mess this constantly new frameworks
this constantly new frameworks in the
backend it's like okay there's one
language this one way to do things and
that's it most companies are usually
using our super older version of the
language or they're using our framework
that's older so meaning they gotta be
using that for the next five to ten
years is rare that our company comes in
and and up like you know up update their
their whole frameworks in the whole
libraries it's rare that they do their
so the back end is actually easier
because you don't have to deal with that
like once you learn it once that say you
good let me see what else
if I had somebody Albert Lewis says if
you could rule if you could travel back
in time and rebuild a famous website or
app eBay Facebook or Google why would
you build I think Facebook Facebook has
a lot of potential because it already
has everybody on there everybody's on
Facebook the problem with Facebook is
that they don't know how to add new
features like every time they add a new
feature they piss off half of the
audience and then the new audience is
like oh man we got to learn something
new that's the problem with Facebook so
I would love to just like redo a lot of
stuff for Facebook and just like you
know create a better website than that
okay which is better to get a job
focusing on Ajax API before moving to
react or should I move to react after
doing JavaScript basics listen you need
to learn ajax no matter what right you
need to learn ajax no matter what right
so I'm not talking about you have to
learn Ajax like vanilla vanilla
JavaScript Ajax like you could just come
in and use the fetch or you could use
axials you could use jQuery to use Ajax
you need to know those things as the
basics and that's it and then learn to
react because I mean either way if
you're gonna use react you still gotta
learn know how to use data and it's like
how to get the data from the backend and
it's like that's all part of JavaScript
man like that that's not even a good
question to be honest with you it's like
you have to learn Ajax that's like Ajax
it's like how you gonna work with the
backend as a front-end developer you
know there are some development jobs
acts for computer science should I still
apply even though I don't have it yes
apply no matter what
guys we've been here for off one hour I
think I'm about to start heading out
yell dreaded death without without
without without
let me see what else
hey joel of your courses came away for
e-commerce website caused by you and PHP
or Ruby on Rails I see what up chat if
you could Wes already shout out to Joe
for these gems yes sir which is better
to get a job faster focusing a jack I
saw that already there are some
development jobs to ask for computer
science I read that already I'm reading
stuff that I already saw already
I'm currently working as a digital
marketer and while on the job I've
learned HTML CSS to build clients
landing pages I'm taking a bootcamp in
me after that what would be an
appropriate salary range Oh Cynthia I
was saying you gotta look what's in your
area right you gotta look at how much
you need to survive right even though
you're going to a boot camp don't
believe the hype
I'm being honest this is just me being
100% truthful don't believe the hype
boot camp might tell you hey you're
gonna get eighty dollars in its one
hundred twenty thousand dollars most
likely that's not gonna happen if it
happens more power to you all right but
don't go in there thinking that's what's
gonna happen you gotta understand how
life is right this is why I tell people
all the time you gotta understand how
life works
and how life is life is a you fill in
the blank right so the idea behind you
know what boot camps tell you they say
hey we we could guarantee you eighty a
hundred thousand dollars unless they
walk you in there holding your hand and
basically they already have a deal with
the boot camp right a company is not
gonna hire you at that price right they
say oh you're gonna get a hundred
thousand dollars it doesn't work like
that the only way is if the company and
the bootcamp already have a deal where
they say okay give us the top to the top
three developers in every class that you
have send it to us right but you don't
understand that that's the key word the
top two in the top three developers in
your class your class might have ten to
fifteen students right now if you don't
make it to that top two top three
developers you're not getting those jobs
so you have to be realistic wasn't more
realistic
as a junior developer who has never
worked as a developer but you have
actually a plus because you say that you
have done landing pages for clients so
that's actually a plus so I will say you
got between $65,000 to $80,000 that's
your range depending on the company that
you go to right now my advice to you is
don't stay at home waiting for the
perfect job don't stay at home waiting
for the perfect amount of money don't do
that apply to every job out there go to
every interview try to pass every
interview studied study algorithms if
you like let's say if you want to go to
for example a company like Google or
Facebook or something like that study
all of your algorithms because that's
what they care about that's how they
excel people right but if you go into
other companies and smaller businesses
and you just regular businesses out
there just basically build your
portfolio build a really nice portfolio
something that looks great shows your
skills and make sure that when you go to
interviews you basically you always give
your minimum to live meaning if you
already have bills you have a car you
you know cuz you already work you
already work it's not like you are 18
years old straight out of high school
you're already an adult so you have
responsibilities to pay mortgage car
payments whatever right so whatever is
your minimum make sure you always give
your minimum right so you say hey I'm
looking for seventy seventy five my
minimum is 68
all right this is what I'm looking for
and always mention mention it like if
somebody's trying to giving you only the
minimum that you have be like I have
other offers and you know just put it
out there but like y'all I got other
offers you know what I mean even if you
have no offers I don't just put it out
there because I'm lets them know like
okay this person if we don't pick her up
right now she's gonna get another job
somewhere else and we need that extra
person in here you gonna say yourself I
hope that answer your question as far as
your range just also just go in there
just you know go in there and just like
work hard and beyond that just make sure
that you always get your minimum amount
that you want right also too you gotta
take into consideration how much you
know how much your boot camp is gonna
cost you and you know some bookends they
might even do it for free at first but
then you got to pay 20% of your your
first income so you gotta take that into
account so just make sure you do the
math on your own you know okay this is
what they're paying to most developers
in my area I'm a junior developer I
haven't worked as a developer I've done
landing pages I've worked in an hour
digital agency marketing agency right
building landings pages which that gives
you a little higher up then most
developers are gonna go into the boot
camp because you actually you actually
have something on your on your portfolio
or on your resume that says this person
has already been working in a company
most people don't even have that most
people come in and say hey um I'm Joe
Joe Schmo the mechanic they go to a boot
camp and they think like Oh Joe Schmoe
the mechanic seven years of mechanic at
Sears
that's not gonna help them out that much
but you that says hey I've been working
at digital agency that's gonna be a big
plus that shows that you're already in
the industry okay so yeah man Cynthia
thank you Cynthia says I've also signed
up for your website lifetime
subscription so thanks Joe go over the
whole timeline you know learn the things
that you already the things that you
already learned you could skip it right
but just skim through it you don't have
to do it just skim through it like okay
I know this I know that I know that but
just go next on the videos something
that people keep on doing they make a
mistake they say oh I already know HTML
CSS but then there are no certain things
about it right so then instead of
skimming through the videos which they
already pay for like you already pay for
it it's like it's yours you might as
well skim through it whatever you you
don't know you watch whatever you do
know you you basically just skip it so
don't make that mistake just go in there
and do your thing so you already knows
