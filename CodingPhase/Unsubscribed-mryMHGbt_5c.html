I hold you down what is my view on
October see CMS it's cool I like it it's
I feel like oh sorry I feel like it's a
it's a legit thing you know it could
definitely help out with a lot of things
because not every website needs to be
built in laravel or like a big framework
like you could do you know certain
things on on a CMS like WordPress or
October CMS it depends for the person
right in depends on the business or what
type of website it is you could use it
so yeah man yeah man I'm out of here man
I'm out I'll see you guys later
Joe has sent me an email I got you we in
here bow if you need to unsubscribe
before I leave if you need to
unsubscribe go ahead if you cannot take
people's opinions and you cannot take
the fact that people think they're
friendly than you and you need to be in
a bubble go to your bubble people need
to stop looking for places where they
only think like them you cannot be
like that in this world you know what I
mean like you're going to fail in this
world the people there are successful
they make it anywhere right it's not
about coming in and be like oh man
you know people treating me bad in this
area I gotta go to where people treat me
good no it doesn't work like that
it's not about like oh I'm poor today I
almost stay poor forever no it doesn't
work like that you work hard you try to
get out of there
the moment you give up and you be like
oh I gotta be in a safe space that's it
you lost you get what I'm saying so
that's what I'm doing out here and when
it comes to net neutrality like I repeat
myself ya got me repeating but I don't
care because at the same time every
business out there every company out
there is trying to get money from us
right so was my point of view in life
plus stay here sit down and cry about it
oh my god they might charge me five
dollars for Facebook no what's my job
I'm gonna make $20 you gonna say like if
in my job and in the work that I do life
is becoming more expensive what am I
gonna do am I gonna sit down and cry
about it
know what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make
more money so I could accommodate myself
to the world that's around me and that's
what I'm saying
like when you are a person like me
you're just like you know what I'm not
fazed by it when people are freaking out
well oh my god Trump is about to go like
that okay whoopty-doo the president
before him Obama the president before
him Bush Clinton none of those people
affected me in my everyday life at all
so Trump wasn't gonna affect me
single day I don't I made myself who I
am today and that's just how it is you
gotta think like that you cannot you
know because then people hold on to this
ideas and then they make excuses for
themselves and for their situations you
know
god forbid you know I'm not saying that
this is gonna happen god forbid you know
two years from now they like you know
the charging for I don't know this is
like some crazy idea they charging five
dollars for I don't know for downloading
anything above you know five hundred
gigabytes or whatever for example and
you need to download a program that is
like 500 gigabyte see like oh my god now
I'm gonna pay $400 gigabyte I don't like
what development because I gotta pay
distances in that and it's like bro like
know what you do is like you shut the
hell up you freaking get your job done
and you don't say you become successful
in your way you know what I mean like
you do what you have to do life is
that's how life is life is a bitch so no
matter what you do you cannot give up
you cannot fall into this world of
complaining bitching crying you can't be
one of those people lately social media
everywhere in the world it seems like
everybody's crying about something else
if it's not about the Weinstein thing if
it's not about all the freaking net
neutrality if it's not about everything
about racism everything about Trump
everything about all this stuff we need
to stop crying about stuff and be like
yo you know what this sucks but I'm not
gonna be one of those people crying on
the internet I'm gonna be one of those
people that's just gonna be like you
know what somehow there's other people
that became successful with all of this
bad things coming at them and they made
it and I can be one of those people I'm
not gonna be one of those people that's
crying on the
tonight you know what I'm saying like
that's just not me
you know people is like freaking out
like it's the end of the world like I'm
not giving myself up you know you got
what I'm saying like that's how you guys
gotta think you know so I wish nothing
but the best for you guys and like I
said I'm here to help you guys out
that's what I do see a boy joke back at
