introduction to HTML and we did some
real basic HTML layout and before you
can go pretty much anywhere in web
development as well as HTML you simply
need to know CSS which is basically the
style inception so HTML is like your
definition of document structure and
layout and the CSS is the styling of
that so we're going to go ahead and and
get a very limited introduction to CSS
but we'll go through the key concepts
there's not much to know about CSS
it'sit's pretty simple to do so we'll
cover just the basics in this video and
then go into more detail you know the
subsequent videos but we're gonna cover
there the basic understanding in depth
so we'll start with just making a new
folder we'll just call it web and then
in here we'll make a new file or let's
just open visual studio code and making
new file and then in here I'm just gonna
paste in what we had in the last video
in the HTML so we've got the document
type HTML the HTML element the header
I've added this matter which I didn't
put in the first video just to not
confuse things but good practice in
html5 documents or HTML documents in
general is to specify the format the you
know the file encoding of your will of
this HTML page and we're specifying
utf-8 as the standard which is the most
common file format for it's mainly when
you insert special characters into the
document you know outside of the ASCII
character range so for now we don't need
to know much about that just simply
place this in and understand that it's
about formatting special characters in
the document everything else is the same
as the last video the title of the web
page I've also added this which will
take out for the moment which is the
stylesheet so the structure
you know your blank HTML document so
we'll save that file and we'll call it
index dot HTM and now we have a haitch d
ml document ready to go if you haven't
already go to extensions install live
server by just searching for it and
clicking install then HTML snippets is a
good one to install as well that will
give you some tooltips as we're typing
so install those two you don't need to
install the sass we'll get to that in a
few more videos so just install live
server and HTML snippets and then with
those installed you'll get basic in
tally sense like type hidden' h1 and you
know for a header and you get this you
don't get any any real info that I would
say type div and this is the HTML
snippet thing probably not giving you
some you know details about it so if
those installed not ready well its first
to put something in this documents let's
put a header on my heading one I'll put
a paragraph as well my taxes in here and
save that now in order to view and edit
this live with you when you've installed
this live server you can see down the
bottom here you've got go live so just
click that button and it will start and
then it tells you that it's it started
on port 5 500 and then it opens up let
me just quickly toggle on my inverted
colors for now to not blind the eyes so
this is the HTM document and we just
drag this to the corner and then use
this as an ela corner we've now got
basically side by side editing so I can
go ahead and change this and you'll see
it live update here so got like this
nice layout this is how we'll work also
instead of having a file just individual
files open we'll click open folder and
to do that in case you messed up click
top here first so the the file icon then
open folder and then select the fold or
working in an open
and that just gives us a bit more you
know any files that appear in that
folder will now appear here in this
folder we can also create a new file
directly in this folder which is what
we'll do next you can just click to open
the files so that kill'd go live so we
just have to click the go-live again
just to store that backup that's up
there so now we have a nice working
environment for working with HTML so in
order to then style this document you
need CSS so you need to either add CSS
directly which is not recommended which
is add here which you can do style and
then you could say h1 and I'll explain
the syntax later I'm just quickly
showing you that you could put in there
you know directly in here and all right
turn off my then they can see it's red
so you can embed Styles directly in the
head of a document but that is just
simply not recommended so we'll remove
that instead what we'll do is create an
actual CSS file so we'll just click new
file over here and you'd call it styled
up CSS for now and it's blank let's put
a head of one buck in and again I'll
explain the syntax in a minute
I'll do color red and save now if we
save this with no style you can see it's
gone so in order to get that style back
we want to link this stylesheet and it's
all you have to do is specify what you
saw when I initially pasted is link and
then hate ref for the location do
forward slash at the start which means
the relative folder where the whole
websites running not specific to this
file of this was not subfolder so
forward slash and then that brings us to
effective or the top folder which is web
and then just style dot CSS and then
we'll also put rel stylesheet which is
basically the thing you need to do to
make it correct HTML so it would work
without typing these but this is the
correct structure of a link as that's
the route and then you've also got
I've to tell the browser that the type
minimize that the type is text /c SS and
then your closing tag so that's the the
standard way of basically including a
stylesheet and the only thing that ever
changes is simply this the location so
that's kind of a get that ingrained in
your memory and all you have to do then
is change the file name so I save this
file you can see now it's updated here
right press f12 in Firefox and I doesn't
make a change back in here to reload you
can see here's the file uploaded the
over then their index are HTM and you
can also see it loaded the style the
style sheet the style that CSS so now we
have a link to a style sheet for this
webpage so now we can start styling this
page so that really brings us on to the
actual CSS so we've done all this HTML
and what this means in the last video so
we don't know what the basic HTML means
you can watch the previous video and
then all's we've had to do is include
this link here and pass it into you know
the actual file path of where this this
document is so now we have a style sheet
we can start working on so CSS is
different than HTML has been very
similar to like WPF which we've been
doing videos on so it's a xml style
document style sheets so CSS is not
really the same it's got a vague
similarity to c-sharp and all the coding
languages in which you have you know I
care a name and a you know your curly
brackets and then stuff inside it's also
similar to say jason if you've ever done
jason but it's really easy syntax is
basically what you're looking at now is
the whole of CSS right there there's not
really anything else that you do syntax
wise for your attributes having
potentially you know some brackets in
with some path sent or defining you know
colors in certain ways with hash tags
and you know real simple things but in
essence what you're looking at is is all
you really need to know about CSS
so we'll get started we have the this is
called the selector so let me just zoom
in on this we don't need to you're that
big book might as well keep it huge in a
minute so this is known as the selector
and this is what tells the code inside
here where to be applied to so we have
selected the heading we've selected h1
which in our document this is an element
it's a you know an elements the way
we've selected it is by doing an element
when you simply type a name without a
special prefix then it's classed as an
element selector so this is a selector
and this means what do you want to apply
the style to and in this case it's a
heading of 1 and then inside here you've
basically got your property and your
property value so you've got the
property of color and this is where this
is a CSS property so color is now
specific to CSS so we did another
property and called it background and in
black then you can see I'll change the
background of the heading to black so
this is where you start styling this is
this is where you'll learn all the
things in CSS of what these properties
are and what they mean and then the
thing is wrapped around here is
basically selecting and filtering down
to what it should be applied to in this
case a heading 1 so that's that's the
real start that we can now select
elements and style things so to first
get this nicer on the I just so I like
everything dark I'm gonna select HTML
the element HTML and if you look in here
that means it's gonna select this whole
document it's going to select everything
and we're gonna then say we want the
background as black and now it's turn
the web page or black if you don't want
to tap specific colors and you've got an
exact RGB value you can simply put
hashtag and then your value so then it's
red green and blue and it's a
hexadecimal value so you can either do
as a f-f-f-f-f-f-f which means
all white if you wanted red green blue
so the first one was full red and bleep
ffs and then no green no blue you'd get
red so this is just basic hexadecimal
color values you can play with this as
well to select a color so I'm gonna go
with say a slight purple you can also
see you can do RGB a as well which
includes a transparency to the color
which we don't want to do so we'll
remove that for now and you can select
colors here you can see if you click
here this is the helper this is either
built into visual studio or built into
the HTML snippets I think it's the
snippets atom and this shows you all
different ways of defining a color so
you can do hue saturation or luminosity
you can do a hexadecimal red green and
blue value you can do red green blue as
a decimal value so 0 to 255 in each
value and then you could don't really do
include the Alpha Channel for all those
as well so you can play with that to
figure out the colors I typically just
use a hexadecimal value if it's the most
common when you're working with graphics
Photoshop things like like you tend to
have hexadecimal values so I can also do
a shortcut if you have say Redis two F's
blue-green is non blue is non and you've
got basically pairs here so that's blue
that's green that's red if the two
values are the same then you can simply
remove one of the values of each but
they all have to be the same so all
three groups have to have a single value
so if this was FF II oh well then you
stuck with a 6 character definition but
if basically every each of each group of
two is the exact same pair repeated you
can just remove the second one and have
basically a shorthand you know
individual character and this expands
out then it simply doubles it so this
would expand to FF this will expand to L
and this lecture I will show you you'd
end up with the same color I don't
usually use the shorthand I do in some
cases but
say we want to go slightly off black you
could go e I thought let's wake up like
let's go say three three three three
three three like that then that bring
you to this so gray so instead of doing
all those three you could just do three
three three and they'd expand out to the
same value I'm gonna go one one one to
make it just slightly off black so
there's a background and a color and
we've applied it to the HTML document
entirely so right now what we're doing
is selecting elements
so we've select these are elements each
one of these as an elements each you
know tag as an element so we've selected
we can basically select anything we can
select head even though that's not a
visual element so that won't do anything
weak it's like body we can select header
select P anything we place in here we
can style and so we could do don't know
let's do another paragraph this is a
wrong sentence with some p.m. emphasis
so adding plenty of tags to a paragraph
aside for maximizers a minute you can
see we've basically reduce that down
slightly
you just made a bunch of elements or all
these are elements so we can select say
the strong review first take a look we
need to all the text is black because we
made the background black so we also
want to change the foreground colors the
text colors by default so in the HTML
again
let's change color which mean it really
should be background foreground is what
makes sense but obviously CSS isn't
necessarily like that so instead we have
background and color so color is
foreground and it's usually you know why
like there's always text it's the
default color of you know anything in
the foreground text element so if that
will just make it white and then that
brings the text back to visible and this
resume in a bit you'll see you can
probably see that's bold that's like a
stronger value that's the default style
so as well as was making these styles or
CSS also has or the browsers rather all
have their own default style so without
those applying styles if we were to look
at this text so you can right click on
Firefox and inspect element and then we
can take a look at the element itself
and you can see we have it'll actually
show us the default styles let's have a
look you have the strong will show so
this isn't going to show us the default
styles here see we can get computed nope
so it's hoping that would've shown us
the you know the browser's default rules
but it doesn't but bear in mind that
basically this has been styled already
you can see this is bold so this has got
a font weight that's heavier than normal
and yeah it doesn't show in here because
it's a browser default if anyone knows a
way to show the browser defaults that we
cool but base for this is you've got a
bear and man that the browser will by
default already style HTML without any
CSS so if we removed the style
completely you can see the headings
already big the strong is already strong
the emphasis already got a tilt to it so
there's already Styles involved you know
the font size is the spacing the margins
and all that is classed as the default
CSS and that's different per browser so
we'll get into another video in future
where we neutralize all those things and
we normalize the standards because all
browsers are different so that we can
create a single style that's the same in
every browser because we open this web
page in Internet Explorer and Chrome
things would be slightly different that
the margins would be slightly off the
headings might be default the font might
be different that you know the style
things differently by default so before
we can be assured that we write a little
bit of code that turns a heading to red
and a background to black and we expect
you to always be pixel perfect and
looking the same
we'd have to normalize things so we'll
save that one for a future video but in
essence you just have to remember that
there's certain things that are already
standard in browsers they've already
styled
that's kind of got a little bit off
tangent there but I needed to explain
that you know they do have styles ready
applied it's what we'll do now is let's
say they're strong has got this default
style applied let's select all strong
elements and let's change that back to
normal so we don't want that so you can
either do the keyword normal and say
even you can see it's gone back to
normal strength or you can specify a
value an integer you know a font weight
so 100 and it depends on the font
they're using it within 200 just
typically getting it's still thin it's
like semi thin 3 to 400 is usually
regular and again this change is based
on your font that you're using what font
weights they're they support 500 starts
to usually go bold 600 is then gone to
back what it was basically you know 900
it was really bold but again if you if
your font doesn't support awaits it
simply won't show any different instead
of specifying that the 900 and things as
well as I mentioned you can specify bold
and you can see here the helper says
bold as the same as 700 and bolder
specifies the way to the font bolder
than the inherited value so you can use
either you know normal bold as a thin
one no lighter so that you've got all
you your specific values that you can
use here so that's how you change the
thickness of a font of your well the
weight of a font and then we've done the
same thing we've selected here emphasis
has got the tilt on it so let's say we
wanted to remove that I know you don't
typically style things to remove things
but this is it's showing you what the
default styles are and then we're
removing them so the emphasis on it
would be I think it's font style and
then you have the italic which is
default so if we went to normal it
removes that italic we could also swap
this around and let's make the strong
italic
instead of bold and there we go so you
can see we're styling things and all
these all these specifics we'll get into
you know will mess with lots of
different styles and CSS but the the
point here is to get used to this syntax
so you can see the top part is the thing
we're selecting and then you encompass
it all in curly braces and then inside
here you have the property that you want
to change for the background and a
semicolon and then the value that you
you know for that property and a
semicolon so it's very similar to you
know coding in different languages like
say it's familiar flavor to c-sharp your
end all lines with semicolons you you're
wrapping if you will this section in
curly braces and you've got you your
definition at the top here so there's a
I don't think that Wheeling is much more
explaining it's fairly straightforward
it is exactly that this there's nothing
special you select something you group
it you type in the name of the thing you
want to change :
give me the value semicolon and that's
it so these are selectors as you
mentioned let's go a bit deeper now and
let's do multiple selections so jump
back to the HTML a minute and let's just
put say three different headings in so
now we have three heading elements let's
just remove the style from heading 1 for
now so you got a heading 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 here
now say you wanted all of them to be
color of red again and you'd do this and
then you go all right now I want heading
2 so I'll copy and paste and do this and
heading 3 and so on and if you're
applying the same style to multiple
elements over and over you don't need to
keep redefining like this so if you want
to simply do the same block of code but
then selecting multiple different
elements you can just put a cult a comma
here and then the next element and comma
and the next element as many as you like
and when we save now we've updated all
three all three have the same style
so then if we were to do say font size
14 clicks or say and they've all now
gums at the same size so you can do you
know style them all the same then
there's nothing stopping you're having
multiple groups for the same element so
we can define h1 here there's a group so
all of them go red and then in this
specific one we can say we want the font
size to be say smaller than the large
ones so we can readjust we can also put
another one right below so there's no
limit on how many times you define a
block for an element it doesn't matter
what does matter is the order in which
they defined so say we have three things
in order here and we've actually got a
style for H 1 H 1 and H 1 and I'll
change the color here to blue now when I
see what you think will happen do you
think this will go blue or red because
we've told it to be both colors so if we
save you'll see it's gone blue and the
reason for that is it's quite simply it
processes in order so the pass will come
into this HTML document they'll work its
way down it'll hit this element here
first then it will go into the
stylesheet and it'll work its way
through a style h1 red then the size
then blue then it will come out to the
style sheet it will go to the next one
below if we have two style sheets then
this will come afterwards so it's
literally a linear order and it steps
through and applies them one after the
other and when it hits a multiple item
you know something that's gonna be in
apply it simply gets overwritten so it
just gets replaced each time that
happens so CSS is in order of importance
if you will and there's also once we get
into more detailed selections there's
also an importance of how defined
something is it's hard to explain until
we do more HTML on CSS so I'll leave
that little bit out but in essence it's
basically a simple case of it goes
through in a natural order and the
further down you go is more important so
it gets overwritten
you can override that behavior but you
should use it very very rarely so it can
get abused and the way you do that is
once you specify the value of any value
put a space before the semicolon
exclamation and important and unsaved
and you can see now the red is basically
trumped the blue an important means that
now it's taken out of context of simple
flow of you know this is this one than
this than this and this is more
important there's literally jumps the
chain and says hang on I'm more
important than anything that comes after
but this can cause a lot of issues with
styling where if you imagine you'd done
this and say somebody made a little bit
of a a framework for you with some
default styles for things and they
forced this important on but then you're
in a special header for a document and
you want it to be blue because you need
to highlight the importance of it but
now it won't go blue and this is in
somebody else's shared CSS so it's not
live rewards it's in your own code but
quite simply you've got this important
thing fought in a color and then the
only option you have then now to ever
make that heading to go blue is to then
also include this important - then you
know reach rump the the previous one and
you can see this ends up leading to a
nasty forceful implementation of
constantly having the word important
everywhere and then you know as you go
down the chain further and further
you've stuck in this constant cycle of
of having to use that so there are small
situations where important is needed but
don't typically do that instead of you
wanted if you find yourself with you
know two properties that are clashing
and something's wrong with the order
simply fix your code fix why that is if
this should have been before red and
this is more important simply move this
above make it that way so that it is in
the correct order and so that's the
selection multiple selection and then a
bit about the you know the order in
which things get applied we've spoken
about properties so as I mention these
are properties and and these are the
values to the properties and this is
where I'd say a lot of the things will
happen there's a lot of properties that
you have no.you
just press ctrl + space on a new line
you'll see ever pop up with you know a
lot of properties in CSS and you can
simply step through a mess with them one
at a time and google them and you know
work your way through probably covering
most of these and in the videos as we go
we'll simply be making a real website so
instead of me just going through a list
of properties you know you're gonna
learn them by actually making use of
them and a few of the main ones
obviously our background and color that
we've used is the farm weight the font
styles we've messed with then we have
well in fact background you'll notice
there's something special about this so
even though this is a property this is
technically I don't know the official
word even if there is one but I'd call
this a combined property because it's
combining all the well let's do a more
obvious example first let's put a border
around something that's a much more
obvious one so on this head of one we're
gonna say border and then what we're
gonna do here instead of just saying one
thing we're gonna do is gonna be one
pixel and a space I'll do solid say then
a space and then green and then
semicolon and save and you can see now
around the heading we've got a solid one
pixel green border but you'll notice
here what I did was I separated the
values by a space so I ended up with
three values go into one property so you
might say well how does that work and
this isn't really a property as such and
you can see as you hover over background
as I mentioned which is not as obvious
and you hover over border the popups has
a shorthand property so whether that's
the technical name I don't know what
basically just means that this property
is a quicker way of writing a style for
setting the border width the border
style and the border color independently
so this is one way of doing it and this
is where you usually do it to make use
of shorthands if you weren't doing that
you'd have border - and then you can see
you've got all these options so you got
border - width would be one pixel border
- style solid would be another order -
color green would be another so instead
of doing all that
this is basically the exact same thing
and this is what's call it then a
shorthand property and this is a quicker
way of writing you know those three
things
so if we were to delete that one you'll
see of exactly the same output it's just
that that's more compact and easy to use
and and there's lots of those around I
don't intend to mention them when you
use them because the they're just so
natural and obvious but say another one
is margin for now we haven't spoken
about margins and padding yet but you've
got margin then you can do margin - left
and say 50 pixels nice big margin and
you can see this is bumped over the
header and then obviously you can
imagine you've got margin left top
bottom right and the shorthand for that
is to simply say margin and then in here
you do 550 100 200 and obviously put
pixels for each of them so they know the
unit of size and you can see there if we
were to remove the 50 you don't see a
change remove the hundred don't see the
change here - so in order to get the
order of these I'm pretty sure it goes
left top right bottom but the order
always changes so let's just double
check this and to check this let's do
let's just swap this over to padding
from an X I love the same effect that's
the inside so we should see now this
spacing out around wherever it is let's
also do display don't need to understand
this a little bit for now I'm just
proving the order so
display:inline-block will make it not
expand the full width and then we can
see now here the padding the first one
is the top so if we remove the 5 and put
10 say so it's gone top right and then
it's going to be bottom left in this
case and then bottom and left so in WPF
it's fairly obvious it goes around
clockwise in CSS you'll see that it goes
top right bottom left so when you're
doing margins you don't always write
this shorthand here and I don't always
do
in fact I rarely use the margin
shorthand for that reason that you're
constantly going which one is it is it
where's top is it there where's left
it's not in my eyes the CSS order in
this is not a logical order top right
bottom left it well I guess it is if you
think of it as basically still clockwise
it's simply starting at the top instead
of the left
so actually you just have to remember
the order but when you're jumping
between things like you know WPF CSS and
I work in many other languages as well
it's easy to forget the order so if
you're in doubt you can either mess with
it and figure out or for cleaner looking
code room for more legible code you
could do you know margin left is 50
pixels margin from bottom 10 pixels and
it's more explicit it's a little bit
longer code but it's more obvious you
also have other different shorthands as
well so a margin you could do the top
and bottom together which is where it
gets even funnier so in order it goes
top right bottom left but then every
shorthand it to two values like say 50
pixels and 10 pixels what will happen is
the top and bottom will be this and the
left of rat will be this so you can see
the top and bottom will come to 50 the
left and right gone to 10 so again this
is you don't need to use these but you
just have to be aware that you can do
shorthand and then you can also remove
it to a single one and it'll make every
single margin 50 so that's that's really
short hum properties will will make you
softer more as we go but I just wanted
you to be aware that if you see a
property with more than one value or
even my margins got one it might
actually apply to you know more than one
underlying property but if you hover
over you got the tooltip anyway that
tells you it's a shorthand so we didn't
margin he should tell us that you're
short and again so there you go
and then it gives your descriptions
that's that HTML snippet that's what's
good about that little add-in so we've
got the shorthand ones and now let's
just talk about I think the last thing
we'll do in this video and then I'll let
you sort of absorb all this because I
will be delving into more things and I
don't want to carry on in one
video and kind of overwhelm you I'll
give you a chance to you know comment
and question things in this video and
and fully understand what we're talking
about here because these are the
building blocks to CSS this is the
foundation that you really need to
understand and I know you haven't done
much yet but you do need to understand
the concept of this is the thing that
these styles have been applied to and
this is a select and this is this is
what is almost like a regex filter if
you will by a lot simpler this is what
defines what the styles get applied to
and you can you know do multiple
selections you can do you can do more
selectors than this as well which will
go into depth in a minute with a few
more but you need to understand that
this is the structure this is a group of
styles if you will that are going to
apply to this group of elements and this
is what's going to get applied and you
need to know that it's you know the
property name : and then the value all
values with spaces in between and and
just get that really understood and then
the ordered room which is important you
know it's flowing through the document
if you have more than one of the same
thing which order is you know important
and then obviously to include into your
HTML document like this so that's that's
the key things you need to understand so
let's do a few more things on selection
now and to give you a feel for how you'd
you know style specific things so if
you've seen this all these elements
we've styled so far have no special
prefix they don't have like a dart they
don't have a hash don't of yabbos they
have nothing the just that what you
called no prefix if you will and what
that means is this the type of element
you're then selecting although the type
of thing you selecting is an element by
element we mean things inside of angle
brackets in the HTML so we are styling
those things now there are say you have
let's do let's make this into a header
or rather this yeah well let's leave out
html5 semantics for the moment let's not
confuse things
I should wrap this in a generic div and
you'll see why I'm future videos we
won't be using many of these so we have
a div to wrap all this light in and then
we have some headers inside the div and
let's say we have a paragraph in here
and paste this will be second paragraph
so we're just creating some kind of
structure here which is just it's not
really changed much as we've simply
dumped a few things in and then put this
content in but now let's say we have
also had a two or this paragraph
paragraph and sideways right past a
fourth so I spell fourth I think so
let's make the second paragraph and
again I'll jump the gun a little bit
here but well in fact now let's cover
this as well so you can do style in two
ways or again essentially jump back
again you can do styling and a lot more
ways but you can style by selecting
elements in here or by telling it
specific elements once selecting based
on other things so the elements are
within the element itself let's say this
heading 2 has an ID of special heading
and we wanted to know style the special
heading well instead of having to select
h2 or a div and h2 inside a div or
anything like that we can actually
select based on ID instead of element
name so to do that steadily just
starting with nothing just put a hash
and then special heading another
difference here is when you've got a
hash it changes from selecting an
element to look him for any element that
has an ID of this value and in true HTML
specs you should only ever have this ID
should be unique to this whole document
so you should never have two elements
then with the same ID so this should
never happen you can think of that like
having a you know a property and
of a class in c-sharp and you can't have
two properties with the same name now
the problem with HTML is that you can do
that it will build it will compile it
will style but it's technically invalid
cxeh invalid HTML so an ID is used when
it really is the single identifier of an
element in a document and to select an
ID you do the hash
so now inside this hash we will have
selected the special heading to be
styled so now this element is what we're
selecting so we then change that to say
background of pink you can see the
styles we still got turned off yeah the
styles in pink so we've selected this
element not by the fact that it's a
header - by its ID so we could then move
this say we want the ID to go on this
paragraph instead and save in your style
is now on the paragraph so we've
selected an element there based on ID
and this is the prefix of a hash tagging
than that the ID itself so you've got
elements your selector there's no prefix
you've got a selection by ID you can
also select by class so if we want to
style an element specifically I wanted
this whole div to be in a blue
background we say class equals you
wouldn't typically say blue background
to you like you know give it a class
name you'd typically style based on you
know given anything say this was the
header of the the whole so this was in
navigation header or no it isn't but say
it's the navigation bar at the website
where your browse you know at home about
products blah blah blah so you typically
call this like say navbar or something
whatever you'd want to call it and that
would be the name of the class and then
if we wanted to select the class instead
of the ID instead of a hash you simply
do a dot and then the name of the class
a new background of command what's that
blue was it and save and now you can see
everything inside of this div which is
the three
as the four paragraphs as now goes back
around Balu and obviously this head has
been styled to have its own background
color so that's pink so that's how you
select by class and then obviously class
is you can have multiple classes so this
could have two different classes say we
wanted or the navbar to have or rather
let's say we make a generic class in
here and we call this big padding or
something and the padding is the spacing
inside of the element and the margins
are spaced on the outside but we'll go
through that in more detail in another
video cuz they want to the padding to be
50 whenever something's in the big
padding class so in here just like we
did with the values of the properties in
CSS to specify multiple classes just
simply do a space and then the next
class name and you can see now this this
div has been styled with the navbar
style and the big padding style so you
can combine you know you can pick and
choose multiple classes or you could
simply combine it and say this is a nav
bar and I want the nav bar to have the
padding you know and you don't need this
big party man so that's kind of
preference and we'll get a lot more into
that in future videos in terms of when
you embed certain things together all
the time when you create helper classes
that are used for you know specifically
styling elements tweaking things and one
one example I'll give just so at least
you can think about it is what you tend
to have is nice shorthand classes say m
0 and what listed do is removal margins
and then because you can use that any
way you like you can kind of go in to
say the heading one here and just say
class and 0 to quickly remove all
margins around the header and we apply a
to all three headers you'll see the all
then collapse together and so that's
where you can have like a class where
you you want to chuck a style on
you know a bunch of elements now you
wouldn't use it in this exact way
because you shouldn't be you shouldn't
be defining your style in the HTML you
should simply be giving it class names
or references or structure so that the
CSS can select backwards correctly but
again you'll see why there are instances
in the future why you'd do that but
that's just an example of selecting by a
class and you can have multiple classes
by just you know doing space zero you
know and have multiple classes that way
so let's select him by class selecting
by ID there is another way of selecting
well there's two more ways of selecting
which you might as well touch on there's
there's more complicated ways but
there's two fairly common and pretty
basic ways of selecting things so in
this one let's do a paragraph this is a
link to Google on do hate ref or rather
this is linked to a href Google dot uk'
do roll a so if I just maximize that a
minute so you can see if we did a
paragraph then we start putting the
content in the paragraph this a which is
an element as an anchor this is how you
create a link in a website so we save
this and take a look you can see we've
got the classic blue link and you click
it and it takes you to Google so that's
a link that's how you make a link in
HTML I know this is CSS but I just
thought Chuck that in so we can start
styling something on it you can also see
was blue now it's gone purple because we
visited it again this is the default
browser doing this style so we haven't
made that style wind told it to be blue
that's where the browsers have done
their own styling and it's also got an
underscore but ensure that age stands
for anchor the hate ref is the link to
the website you want to go to and then
inside the anchor is the the physical
text that obviously you clicked it to do
that link to go to that link
so let's select the a by element first
so you can simply say all links in the
website will have a green color instead
of the blue or whatever so now you can
see it's gone to green and now there's
another way of selecting something and
it's called a pseudo selector and that
is something that isn't it's not really
an element it doesn't appear in here so
there's no there's no definition here
there's no class there's no ID that's
why they call it pseudo or pseudo simply
means well I guess the definition on
Wikipedia might be different but my
interpretation of pseudo simply means
you know not real it's fabricated if you
will so a pseudo selector and one that
we're gonna do here is when you hover
over a link what you see the link
sometimes on websites changing color or
behaving differently so how do you style
that in CSS well the way you do that is
with these pseudo styles and one of them
is called hover for a link so when
you're hovering over a link you want to
style it differently but in order to
select something that isn't really a
physical element in the HTML we use the
pseudo selector and that instead of
starting with something like this it
technically does start starts with a
colon but because we want the we want to
select their anchors only so the links
only first and then you do a pseudo
selector coal on and do hover and that
is then saying I want to select all
anchors and then I want to select the
pseudo element of harvest and when it's
hovered so when you're hovering over a
link now let's change the color to white
and now if we hover over the link you'll
see it changes color to white so that is
a pseudo selector and there's many of
those again so if you do a half a cold
one and then press ctrl + space it will
pop up with these pseudo selectors and
you can see there's lots of them and
again we'll go through specific ones and
I think there's one for visited as well
so as you mentioned once the link is
visited you might want to change the
color so color could go to
I see brown so once of links been vested
he's gone to this brown color have we
changed the link to a website we've
never been to which is Google which I
don't think exists mind you it probably
does no in the internet I don't know
other day I click this now nothing
exists
so once you've not bit once you've
visited the link it goes Brown and then
you go to a website whenever versity
goes green I don't tend to style links
on visited and doing any website in the
modern age does anyway as you don't want
your website looking different just cuz
you've gone to a link but that's another
pseudo selector to do that so we've got
that there and I think really that forms
a lot of the the ways in which well
almost all of the ways you'll you'll
typically use in ninety percent of your
style to select elements and then we
simply need to style them so a lot of
this intro video has mainly been about
how you would select and style certain
things and not so much about the
specific styles we'll go into that in
the next video but again this is really
what a lot of people struggle with when
they get into CSS is I think they
overlook the importance of this first
step is you need to understand how you'd
select something with a style and you
need to understand their you know the
importance of drilling down getting to
the specific elements you want to style
because you're typically had somebody
going well I don't know hey why isn't my
heading styling or why's me why is my
head are always blue when I've told it
to be red or vice versa because they
haven't understood the importance of you
know the process of which it selects it
or they think they've selected it and
the door may be a hash and h1 or they
put a clasp on something called navbar
and the oven put the dot in front and
and all of the issues you typically see
with CSS revolver um the fact that they
just dumped on this bit right so you
really want to understand these
selections and have a play yourself you
know move things around create some
things that aren't even any like great
to spam and then you know try and style
the spam I could type and talk at the
same time there we go you know and try
and style this and say make that text
and then do all the things and that's
that's really you know the major
importance there so get that down and
then I think the next video we will well
in fact unless carry on and do a little
bit more first I wasn't gonna do the
selection of going into depth of
specifics
you know like nailing down and say like
a good example here now is what have you
on a style a spam that's only inside it
navbar so you want just the span here
and if we put a span here outside you
want this span to be say read text but
only inside this navbar so in your style
here you have nav bar but then how would
you style a span inside that
unfortunately in CSS you can't nest
things you can't go inside here and say
spam and then start typing in here we'll
move on to sass very shortly which
allows this but for now CSS doesn't
allow that so what you have to do is
start a new class below and this time
you can do a different type of selector
basically it's it's kind of combining
the two selectors if you will so you
still want to select the navbar but then
if you want to select something inside
of the navbar just press space and type
the next selection so as if you were
doing another selection so if we did
spam like this we styled all strands say
dude when anyone see black say do brown
again
so all spans have gone brown so that's
how you select to spam the enough bars
got background of blue so that's a it's
like two navbar but if you wanted to
select just the span inside the nav bar
and you do dot nav bar space span and
now this unlike the values that combined
this isn't a combined selector this is a
span that's inside a nav bar this is a
combined selector so this is when you
put a semicolon semicolon when you put a
comma between them this is one item this
is another this another and this simply
expands out to being you know the same
style per one when you do a space this
is still a singular items this is
we're gonna select this specific thing
you know can select multiple items but
it's only one one thing that you're
selecting and that is a span inside
enough bar you're not selecting the
navbar you're selecting the last element
in this set of spaces and it's a span so
ultimately you're styling a span but
you're only gonna style it if it's
inside a navbar class so in that case we
do color what's a really obvious color
different go purple that's not really
obvious that doesn't show let's go white
in fact why it's the default nothing
good here mustard green there we go
in fact let's remove this blue
background that's what's really throwing
everything off now I'll get rid of that
just put a border around us instead a
minute so you can see here now we've
selected just this spam and the other
span is unaffected because it hasn't
matched this prefix so when you're doing
this kind of selector and you do just a
space between two elements it means that
any span inside of nav bar is gonna be
green and that also means if you have a
span and then you have a div here and
that's a another div and a span inside
ah my embedded spam I think I keep seen
spam I'm not eating the spam meter span
with an N so this is an embedded one you
can see even though it's it's in tied to
Devon sided another div and then it's
there it's still green so when you do a
space it doesn't matter about the the
level of descendants how many children
how many parents is gone so technically
this is a child of this div and this div
attached either this to have a nest of
the child or this div which is the
navbar so a space doesn't care about
that
it'll can simply keep searching deeper
and deeper and deeper and everything
ever finds a span it will be styled so
if you want to go slightly further and
you only want to style
the span that appears as a direct child
of navbar and not any embedded spans
then you can do same thing again now
past man but all you have to do is add a
greater than symbol which if you kind of
think of that as the the closing bracket
to the nav bar here it's kind of saying
it's it's within the nav bar thought
directly within so it's the basically
anything that goes inside of say a div
now when it's inside here this room gets
back this room gets styled so it's a
direct selection so we have all spans
going green and only the direct
descendants going blue you can see then
we've got a you know this one blue this
one green that's from red through a
combination of selecting so these two
are important
these are I'd say these are more
complicated ones let's do one more and
again there are more than this but at
least if I show them you you can have a
play before the next video and I'm a
mess around and do things like this just
test styling things on it so let's do I
think we'll do two more let's say we
have four spans in a row or spans are
bad because the well will jerry-rigged
this just you can see a span is going
one after the other because the span is
what's called in line it follows in line
it doesn't start a new thing like a
paragraph does so let's do the
paragraphs instead actually so in these
paragraphs here you've got four
paragraphs say you wanted to style the
first paragraph
well now let's ignore that because
that's just a pseudo selector well in
fact there's a good option I can show
you it say you wanted to style the first
paragraph inside of anything you could
just do peephole on first color blue or
rather not that then as now ignore that
bit
we will do the so you want to select a
kind of think which one I'm doing here
who want to select a power yeah say we
want to select a second paragraph or the
next sibling of you will that's how I
guess you'd describe it so you make a
selection but then you want it to be the
thing after that selection so let's say
we selected well that's a good example
let's port P this is right after the
navbar and again there's very few cases
where you do this but so you have enough
bar and you have an element after it and
whatever that element is doesn't matter
what it is you wanted to style that so
what you'd want to do is select the you
know the elements after the navbar so
how would you do that
you're basically selecting a navbar
first and then you do I believe it's the
tilde and let's just say star so the
thing we're selecting after this could
be you know P could be span it's just
another selector star means select
absolutely anything
again you should rarely use this but for
an example this should do so let's do in
this case black growing wise for
whatever that does and you can see now
this is selected everything after the
nav the nav bar and turn the backgrounds
to white now this is because we've done
the tilde here which means every child
after the nav bar and it only works
inside of its its siblings if you will
so here's the nav bar we collapsed it if
we select the nav bar and then do a
tilde to select everything after it it's
going to only select these things it's
not going to select anything you know
outside of its parent so we wrapped the
nav bar inside a div like this and we
included just these two elements and
saved you can see that it stops at my
span as soon as it breaks out of its
parent which is here the thing that's
containing the nav bar the selector
stops working
so that will only select things what
called siblings so you know its own
children it was nice children as
brothers and sisters of you well if
you're talking about you know like
family trees but it basically means
siblings so these are the siblings and
this is the parent so this selector is
basically a sibling selector that
selects anything that comes after this
element so anything that comes after a
navbar and because we did star will gets
tell Dwight if we wanted to style only
paragraphs so it's copy and paste a few
of them if we want to select a few
paragraphs that come after nav bar but
not spans then just change the selector
to paragraphs and it will only style the
paragraphs so that's a sibling selector
to select every sibling and finally I
think the last one is a you can select
just the next sibling I think it's a
plus and if we changed it to blue
background you can see the plus similar
to what I was going to explain is the
first thing which we'll do in another
video I don't want to go to that level
yet the pseudo selector first this plot
is just like the tilde and in which that
it simply selects the first element
after though so you can see this is
right after the nav bar it's gone blue
but all the others have been caught by
this and have gone white so you have
these four really are kind of advanced
selectors and they might have gone over
most people's heads and we will go into
depth more about them in future videos
so don't worry if you haven't understood
these because we've covered quite a lot
in this video and you might be
scratching your head and going well you
might not understand anything past I
should certainly hope you understand
element selection ID selection class
selection you should understand pseudo
selectors in terms of it's simply a way
of selecting a state of an object if you
will it isn't really a thing as I guess
way of explaining it in the the classic
one is like a hover on a link so you
might get this it might take a bit more
learning but these these ones really are
more for
or people that really want to know a bit
more maybe you found this video a bit
easy and maybe don't HTML before you
just want to you know try and get a bit
further while I waiting for the next
video
and so don't worry if you don't
understand these these four I will go
into more depth about these in the
future videos but I did just want to try
and cover all the selectors at least in
the starter video so that you have a
good example of you know how to select
anything and we'll just quickly run
through these again so this one it
selects any spam that's inside of an app
bar at any level so that means there's
the nav bar it will select this span but
it will also just like this span it will
select any span that's anywhere inside
the nav bar to limit that to just the
first set of children so just this lot
here and nothing else you use the
greater than symbol and then similarly
this is siblings so instead of things
inside of nav bar it's the the siblings
of the nav bar anything that comes after
it or in this case not anything that
comes after whatever there this
selection is met so any P in this case
that comes after the nav bar which would
be not here because that's enough by
itself it would be these piece here so
the tilde would catch all these and it
stops once it hits the parent it doesn't
carry on outside and start selecting
these and then finally the plus is the
same again it selects the siblings of
the nav bar but it'll only select the
very next sibling so that's kind of the
selection there again there are even
more complicated selectors which I
believe one is like you know colon not
and things but again we won't we won't
go into pseudo selectors as in-depth yet
this is like one example there's more
but they really all get into a bit more
advanced level we don't want to confuse
anything further so hopefully this has
been enough information to get you going
with CSS to help you start playing with
some CSS and HTML and then in the next
video I think we'll cover you know let's
go into some now you don't have to
select things and you know you don't
need to focus too much on selecting we
can start focusing on
styling again any any questions you've
got do feel free to just comment I do
get back to every comment anything that
wasn't clear let me know and then I hope
