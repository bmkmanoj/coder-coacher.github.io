data formats and understanding binary
we're gonna move on to ASCII which is
the way we talk about install basic
English writing and text files so the
Latin alphabet so ASCII spelled AFCI I
standing for American Standard Code for
information exchange it came about many
years ago in an attempt to make a
standard in America for you know
exchanging information on computers and
this standard defined 128 characters
which included letters from the English
alphabet symbols exclamation marks
commas things like that and with being
computers they also had 32 unprintable
characters and this were formed
effectively the ASCII standard if you
will and it was 128 different characters
so that means in terms of a by cuz we
opened a calculator and we went to
binary and we simply got 8 bytes here so
8 bits he of a byte and if we took up
the first 7 bits you'd see that we got
127 in decimal plus 0 so there's 128
different options and ASCII takes up 7
bits so it takes up these bits so the
ASCII standard is 7 bits and it's the
lower 128 values of a full eight bytes
and that means it's up to from 0 to 7 F
in hexadecimal and the problem was well
I'll say a problem at first there was no
problem so in a file you could store
ABCD efg you can store a b c d e f g and
capitals and if we save this file and
open up say hex dump in Visual Studio
and we open this test file and then we
take a look at the hex
you can see abcdefg abcdefg and here's
the hexadecimal values so 41 in hex is
65 in decimal so the height uppercase a
is 65 in decimal and 66 67 and this
forms the whole ASCII table
it's simply stored in a value from 0 to
7f in heck so you'll never see anything
above 7 X for the true ASCII values so
you can represent every single ASCII
value by going between 0 and 7f so I
made a quick application here which
you'll come to this bit in a minute but
for now let's make a range so we change
this to 0 to 128 then we have we
basically create a an enumerable range
that's just simply loops if you will
from 0 to 127 because that's the length
you know the number of times so this
goes from 0 to 127 and then we cast it
to a character for that value so we'll
cast it through a character for the
value 0 then 1 and 2 then 3 and so on
turn it to a list enumerate the list and
print out each character on a new line
so if we run this now we should see that
we get every character printed out
so we start from 0 which 232 is
unprintable so these are the special
characters like new lines tabs making
sound you know all all values that don't
represent the printed character and then
if you get to 32 it starts with the
exclamation and the quotes and the harsh
dollars and it carries on down and this
I've printed out also the actual value
here so that you know the 0 on so we can
see so as you see here 65 in decimal is
the capital letter a and then there's
all the alphabet printed out and
a couple of symbols and you finally get
down to you know the bottom there so
this is effectively the ASCII table this
is what we mean when we talk about ASCII
and pure ASCII this is the whole thing
right here so you can run this code and
see it and you can also see it on a
website that I've got open so we're
gonna go through these in order I found
some good reading points to supplement
the video so if you go to C++ like typed
out com forward slash doc /aa ASCII you
can see here they've done a write-up on
asked in a bit more detail and they've
also dumped in here the table we've just
been talking about so there's zero one
two three across go to the next line go
across and to turn into your values you
can just cross-reference the table so
you can see you've got all the values we
just printed you can also just Google
for ASCII table and they'll be hundreds
of different visual tables to show you
these values but the reason I picked
this website is because it goes on a
little bit to show these what's called
the extended tables so ASCII in itself
and pure ASCII is just these first 128
characters and that's all it ever
represents and it represents the same
thing on every computer and everywhere
so that is a hard define thing so the
first seven bits in the ASCII table
which is effectively the whole ASCII
table is always these characters and
they're represented by simply creating a
byte on a computer as we have done so we
just created a character which is you
know represent obviously more than that
but we could turn into a byte if we
wanted it still does the same thing just
won't display correctly there so a
character will naturally taking a bite
and display it as if it was a single
byte that's no problem so we've done it
to output a value so if we ever wanted
to you know write a specific value
or do it wherever we wanted we could do
console dot write line and then just do
65 for writing down to bite and the
first one now should be the capital
letter a again have we cast it to a
character so it prints correctly or yo
something's gone wrong there okay let's
just change it to O if we're doing hex
it's 4-1 not six five that's why there
we go
so you've got the capital letter A so
ASCII you can simply create via making
the bikes ourselves or you can type in
an integer 65 and cast it to the same
thing you can represent it however you
like but the the bottom line is the
underlying value is simply the first
seven bits of a byte and so hopefully
laughed along with a quick read up on
this website and any others you need
should give you an idea of what ASCII is
but like I say that the simplistic solid
answer is ASCII is the first seven bits
of a byte that always represent this
specific set of data and that's how we
originally communicated over computers
and over you know any form of digital
communication we represented these
values here now the issue come when we
were then going multilingual we were
extending outside of the US and we
wanted to talk to other countries and
other languages and we soon realized
that obviously 127 values has nowhere
near enough to represent most languages
so we've got you know Chinese has got a
huge amount Arabic got thousands so it's
you cannot possibly represent it with
127 bits of information so we'll step
back a little bit before delving into
how we solve that issue
and the what happened as soon as the
ASCII standard come out and 127 bits of
information were used in a computers
bite so if we look here we've got this
one bite left and computers have always
stored in you know eight bits if you
will you've always worked in bytes in
general so everybody that started using
the standard was like well I've got this
extra bit which means I've got another
hundred and twenty-seven values so
everybody had this idea at the same time
and everybody started creating their own
versions of what these extra value
should represent you know what these
symbols should represent so on computers
have you then put in a value of 255
what's that meant to be it's not defined
anywhere so people started making these
extra values and these were typically
well the really the official definition
for them as a code page but in the
original dot machine so you know ms-dos
and all the older computers around that
same era created this OAM standard I
think IBM created the standard and have
you ever seen in like Windows 3.1 and
maybe on some you know computers in
stores you love notice they've drawn you
know boxes around things and put
advertisements in or and you know in a
DOS command prompt to highlight stuff
they've drawn things so these characters
might look familiar to some of you and
these are the characters that were used
in the extra 128 bits of a byte and it
was simply interpreted by the machines
at the time that this is what they will
represent there was no hard defined
standard it was up to the manufacturers
and the creators of systems to decide
whether they did this but most places
and most companies started using this
was until now called the OEM extended
ASCII so this first bit here as you can
see has a toe which in decimal is 128 so
this is the first bit of the new
extended piece of information so if we
then went to this this first bit enabled
you can see we got a toe it would
originally represent this on a DOS
machine so you'd have to see with an
underline and then as you go up but now
all these values you can represent once
you toggle this eighth bit then all of
these are going to define this table and
that's how it happened back then but as
I mentioned the problem was everybody at
the same time had an idea of what this
extra piece of information should
represent so they all started making
their own different tables so this is
one table and this was the standard for
like ms-dos and what most of you are
probably familiar with but then what
happened was if we go to Wikipedia and
type in code page you'll see that
basically the again this will give you
more of a read up on the history that
I'm not going to bother going through
but you can see here it starts with
ms-dos and IBM created the initial one
and blah blah blah and then what
happened was each one of these is a way
of representing the extra 128 bits in
the code pages and then these will go on
to define things outside of those but in
general you'll find here is the bulk of
the standards of what become the code
pages and I believe one two five two so
this will be an C one two five two is
the definition of the Latin alphabet in
the extra 128 bits of information so you
can see here again you've got the whole
set going out the way down to the 128
which is up to there so all that is
standard ASCII and then it's this but
you're interested in from here to here
is the new this is the code page right
here
so this is the code page we're talking
about and the standard for this is
called Windows one two five two so we've
got that open here I'd already pre
opened it for you but this is what we're
then looking at on modern computers
so now we created a file in using this
code here which you can simply look out
and copy yourself it just does the same
thing here creates a range but creates
the whole range of a byte so it includes
the extra 128 bits and it writes it to a
file so here's the file so this visual
studio code doesn't represent it
correctly but we can see in the hex dump
so ignore this bit here that hasn't
shown right there but you can see here
the file is nothing more than a bunch of
bytes from 0 to 255 so it literally goes
to 0 1 2 3 4 5 all the way up to 2 5 5
and that's all the file is so if we open
that file in notepad which we have here
you can see this is the output so the
first bit will be the 0 up to here will
be number 65 in decimal and it goes all
the way up to here which is the first
128 bits of information so this is the
ASCII data and then this is the extra
128 bits of information so this is the
code page this thing afterwards values
that are represented after 128 so
starting here this is where I've then
dumped out the values from 128 to 256
this is given as this information and if
we then look at this you'll notice that
they match so if we have this open
you'll see that the first one is this
symbol and then that's missing this is
not a printable character and then it's
a like a comma but with a visual style
to it and then the airf and so on and it
ends with the the Y so this can change
on every machine and have you seen in
the file format there is no kind of
definition to this file format it
doesn't define what it is or how it is
it's simply a dump of bytes there's no
no header no tag for the machine that's
reading this file to know anything about
it so it simply has to make a
presumption that this is an ASCII file
if it wants to open it as text say and
then it also has to presume what code
page these bits all these bytes are
relating to and as we've seen there are
many many many different code pages so
we went to Greek then it might expect
the machine might expect to interpret
them differently and you can see 2 5 5
is different and all these are now the
Greek alphabet so you could open this up
on a computer that has somebody's
language set to Greek as the locale and
they could open this exact same file and
it would show differently it would show
these symbols instead of these symbols
so there was a major issue with ASCII
and what they called the ANSI standard
so it still exists in notepad we did
file save as and you can see it here
encoding ANSI and this is a real typo
that still exists in Windows 10 there is
no such thing as just an I see an ANSI
encoding or format it needs to be a
specific version so it needs to be like
ANSI sorry aunt ans I 1 2 5 2 for
example or 1 2 5 3 it needs a number but
because Microsoft back in the day didn't
really know much about encoding or
multilingual believe it or not they
simply interpreted the ANS I as a format
in itself and encoding in itself and
disregarded the prefix or the postfix of
one two five two so that's why I ended
up in Windows and ended up being simply
defined as ans I and is technically
wrong but if we save and it's usually
certainly on my machine it will save as
this Western format but again the
underlying issue is dependent on the
receiver of the file or receiver of the
data they could well be using any one of
all of these different code pages which
means the values you are trying to
represent to
them won't necessarily match they could
be different values and they are and
that's what happened so all of these
different you know representations of
those 128 bits were called code pages
and you can find them all here to read
up more but basically the standard on
Windows machines was defined as us one
two five two so that's where we got to
with that so the mass that was evolving
around the ans I and the the format
there and extending out of 128 bits and
and then going beyond also to correctly
represent all of Arabic formed Unicode
so we'll do Unicode in a separate video
but if you can imagine if we looked at
the Arabic here that's doesn't represent
all the values represents hardly any of
them so there was also need you know
many other languages too to accurately
represent all of these values and also
to have them so that every country and
every machine and every standard
regardless of language represented the
values the same instead of differently
so instead of having we go to here
instead of just having a single byte and
noting starting the file and no
understanding of this structure we
needed a proper file format you know
something that defines when you open
this file what is the file how is it
defined what does each byte mean what
happens when I want to represent a sixty
four thousand seven hundred and thirty
two in you know a single file at a
certain point well you the files are
made up of bytes so you could like
combine by its together but have you
then decided if you represent let's try
and make it easy to understand we have a
hex value and we want to represent say
FF that's fine that fits in a single
byte but say one to represent FF III or
65 thousand five hundred and seven and
that's in the middle of our file now if
we were also represent you
the latter one all rather the number one
you want to use a single bite so you'd
have say I want to represent zero then I
want to represent one then in the middle
I want to represent there's much larger
number so then would you just put FF ee
ee here then how would you know that
these two bytes should be combined as
opposed it being to actually represent
you know FF on its own of trying to
represent 255 or are you trying to
combine them so this issue it's fairly
easy to solve and I say easy it was a
lot of work but it might seem easy now
but this was solved with you know
Unicode which we'll come onto in the
next video but I hopefully this is
explained the basics of ASCII and what
ASCII means when you hear the word
asking it's also overused and
misunderstood and you know people think
it represents all of the values balls
have to remember as ASCII is simply the
first 128 bits of information from 0 to
127 and it represents the Latin alphabet
and it's always the same symbols and
those symbols can be found by just
googling or going to you know pages like
this and it's always this set of data a
set of represented characters and he
never changes that is ASCII right there
and then when the confusion stars as
when you start talking about extended
ASCII or you know code pages beyond this
point and that's really when you want to
move to Unicode so if you ever start
delving past 127 you know you you really
want to not save your file is just raw
bytes you need to start adding you know
Unicode format into the the file
structure or some kind of structure so
that this specific code page if you will
or that all the whole code pages of
information are defined and explicit so
they can't be misinterpreted so all that
will co pages and and that kind of
interpretation will come more in the
next video with Unicode and then anybody
wanting more information
and a longer read up I've tried to
Google for a good resource to find
something good for you to read and you
know sit and get a bit more technical
info and this seemed to be a really good
article so I'll post this link in the
video or you can just google for this
title or this guy here and I'm sure
you'll pop up but this gives a really
detailed background of basically what
we've just talked about but with a bit
more technical detail and a few more
links and again it goes over the
problems then it also starts delving
into Unicode which I'll cover next and
I'll go into detail of exactly how
Unicode works but you can sit and read
this whole article if you like and get
some information that you might feel is
missing or again just comment in the
video and I'll you know answer any way I
can so sometimes I explain it one way
and other people might need explaining
differently so if you don't understand
something I say it's I always answer the
comments so simply leave a comment and
I'll try to explain any
misunderstandings or confusion you might
have but hopefully that was enough for
you to understand and clear up the mess
around what what ask you really is
compared to when people are talking
about things and the extended code bases
and code pages and things like that so
hopefully that was useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
