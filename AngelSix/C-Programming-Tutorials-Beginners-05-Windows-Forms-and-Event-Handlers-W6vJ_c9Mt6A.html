go into windows forms applications so
you've seen the console application and
that's a plain black screen and you
can't really do much other than read
than write to the console now a modern
application I would use WPF so use this
thing here you wouldn't tend to use
Windows forms applications anymore the
quiet outdated but for beginners and
simplicity it really is the best place
to start because WPF applications are a
lot more coding when it comes to
creating the UI
whereas windows forms you can just
drag-and-drop and visually see things
easier now WPF does have tools like that
but again it's a lot more complicated
than just a windows forms application so
we're going to create a windows forms
application but I would not use this
once you've learned WPF in future videos
but it's a nice way to get some you know
visual UI like a window like this we can
start creating we want to cover things
like event handlers so we're going to
start by the simplest thing I could
think of that was good enough to be
interesting and a little bit challenging
as a basic calculator so we've got the
calculator like this seven times nine
equals and you can see the result and
you can see what you're typing up here
minus five plus eight and the results
are working out as you're going times
five equals this now we've got things
like pi and all these extra functions
and memories and we go to the side
you've got programmer ones that show
different styles we're not going to go
into that depth because it's more about
learning the code so much as making the
application and future we might go ahead
and create a full calculator but for now
we just want to make you know form with
some buttons so you can learn what
happens when you click them and some
text entry so instead of this individual
box here and all these number
and having to click instead of type I
mean you'll know you can type on the
keyboard in the new ones but still
visually seen just a text box like this
to type in what you want we're going to
do that so I will have start by just
creating this application first so go to
new project and templates Visual Studio
C sharp windows form application or
let's just call this basic calculator
and press Enter
and similar to the console application
um this has we right click open folder
you can see you've got your been an
object follower to the temporary ones
you've got the project with the assembly
info like before you can now Steve also
got these extra things resources and
settings again because this is only a
temporary thing we're not going to go
in-depth into Windows forms applications
I'm not going to bother explaining you
know in depth about these extra files
because we're not going to use them
we're going to get into WPF we've also
got this app config which you can see
over there your solution and project
file and your code files and then this
is a new type of code file that you
haven't seen before it's a c-sharp file
and then this design which is
effectively this visual window you see
in here so structure wise it's very
similar the app config you've seen
before and again it just tells you what
framework to use so the only real
difference is we've got a settings file
which we're not going to use anyway and
a resources which we're also not going
to use the the very old and outdated so
just ignore these two additions you
don't need to know about them and now
there's one new addition here which
we'll go into in a second let's take a
look at the program you can see again
it's very similar to a console except
now we've got this thing sta thread
which I believe stands for single
threaded application again it's a sorry
single threaded apartment there's been a
long while since I've done
windows forms I wouldn't worry too much
again about all this just think of this
is the main where the program comes into
just like the console application and
instead of doing like console dot
readline and blah blah blah
instead we run this application which
then runs this form and then this call
to application run doesn't return until
the form here has been closed with that
you know the X button at the top so very
similar to a console application it will
come into here and it will run to here
and then it will close but the
difference is now instead of a console
application appearing and closing we
spin up this new form again don't worry
about these two with they're not going
to be used when you come to WPF so let's
just take a look at what this looks like
first let's press f5 you can see there's
our nice little form already so we're
going to form with a name form one we've
got the little buttons that expand and
minimize and close and then you see when
I've closed the form the application
stopped running I just make this text a
little larger so you can also put a
breakpoint by just clicking on the right
hand side and pressing f5 to run again
and you'll see it steps into here press
f10 f10 and when you hit f10 here it's
going to spin up the form and it hasn't
come back yet as soon as we close and
then comes out of here so that's the
real basic quick overview of the program
where it starts and how it runs so now
let's go into this windows form you can
see you can expand here and you can see
the CS file and also the designer file
now this designer file is auto-generated
an exe is as Windows forms designer
generated code so this is code and you
don't need to visually use this you can
completely construct in here which is
just not recommended because this file
like says auto-generated but just ignore
this designer file for the most part but
you can have a browse and see what's
going on in there as you're creating
things and see what's happening and see
how it's done bring general you just
looked at the CS file
this is your main code file for the
forum you'll notice double-clicking
actually opens this visual designer as
well so there's a few things you can do
to get to the code-behind class the
actual you know the code of the form you
can either right click over here and
view code and that will open up this
form you can be in this visual designer
and just press f7 and I'll take you to
it as well so I start with this form
let's just drag it larger so click the
handle here drag it larger let's press
f5 let's see that that's visually gone
large you can see the difference and now
let's change this title so you just
click you can see this white dots around
the form here
that's the selected object so right now
the only thing in our form is the form
itself so we've got the form selected
you can see down the bottom right the
properties you can see form one here and
there's a drop down for every part of
the form and right now there's only the
form so with form 1 selected you go to
the properties window you can see here
text and form 1 and that means this
title at the top of the form so let's
just click here and type basic
calculator and press ENTER and you can
see up here now the names changed so
that's the start we've got the tile so
now we want to create some buttons to do
things so as I mentioned if we spin up
the original calculator we're not going
to bother with all these buttons well to
be honest we can umm we might do yeah
let's do these but you won't need them
because instead of this box here that
you can't click in we're going to have
an actual text box you can type in and
change values - and then you know press
Enter or click equals to get the result
so let's make the we'll make this
section in fact it will be will be this
whole section here this gray section so
let's just copy this section
as well as adding a text box at the top
so start with the textbook so to add
that click toolbox let's just pin this
because we're going to be using it for a
while
all windows forms when we get everything
and these are all the visual components
you can use so you want a text box click
and drag and let go you can see we've
got a little text box here then you
hover to the right and you can change
the size so let's make it nice and large
and then if we run that we press f5 so
you can see we got a little text box and
we can type away what you'll notice is
if we change the size of the form then
this text box doesn't resize so let's
fix that quickly and they are with
anchor points so if you click you notice
the and trail a little grey dots all
around the box that's what you've got
selected so when you select the main
form it's around the form when you
select the text box it goes around the
text box also in the bottom right it
changes from the form one to the text
box one now also this name this text box
one and this form one is the name that
you access this text box within your
code so when we come to get this
information or want to show it or do
anything with it we access this text box
with this name and if you go to the
properties and you scroll down you can
see here name with parentheses around so
similar to variables let's give this a
new name so let's call this user input
text and press ENTER so it's a little
bit more descriptive now thinking on
this we also need a result so we're
going to add a label also let's first do
this anchor point I was talking about so
you can see here and cut in the layout
and it's anchored to the top left so it
means it's going to the top and the left
are going to stay based on the relative
position of the parent which is the form
so we also add that right by clicking
here and now you can even do it visually
in the designer you can see the size has
changed
with the form and that's what we want
let's also make a label now for the
result so when you've worked out to
calculation you want to see what the
result was so find a label here drag and
drop click and drag and you can see it
sort of snaps to these blue lines these
are sort of auto aligning based on some
default sizes and you can see also this
label you can't resize by default
there's no drug and that's because a
label by default us I believe it's an
auto size again I haven't done this in
years so you'll have to bear with me
let's see if we can find it there we go
Auto sighs let's change this to false
and now you can see we've got the dots
all around so we can now click and drag
and let's resize this to the edge and
let's also and create the same as the
text box the label we want to call
calculation results text and for the
default value instead of saying label 1
here let's put please enter an equation
and press Enter or equals
so now we've got this will be changed to
the actual result when we've entered
something so now we've got effectively
this top bar now we need all these
buttons and these are all going to be
buttons because they're that's what they
do you click them and they're going to
do something so we need one two three
four one two three four five so we need
four by five now you can do I believe
tables a table layout panel and there we
go and we click and drag and that's
position to the edges let's anchor this
will also anchor this to the bottom so
as well as the right we'll do the bottom
and what that means is when we expand
downwards this table will now fill up
all the remaining bottom now we need
four across five down so click this
little arrow at the top right add column
add column that's four columns add rows
we've got two three four four five and
now I've got to remember how we do
anything with these columns it's been
that long
edit rows and columns there we go so
columns we've got 50% 50% now you can do
I believe if we do auto size on all of
them they're going to equally size as my
guess see if that's true
and not so much okay so we've got four
let's do a percentage of 25
so there we've got four columns and now
let's do the rows as well so and it rose
and then we've got five so on 20% for
these again don't worry too much about
remembering or understanding how to do
these this is this is a one-time use
this is just a quick way to get some UI
when you come to do some UI for real
project she will use WPF and then we'll
go a lot more into detail about how all
the UI is constructed this is just
really to get you going to you know
visually create this and and do more on
learning the event analyze and things
like that not so much learning this UI
so we know that this grid ready to
accept the buttons so let's label this
table first so you can see it selected
here and we've got table layout panel
one so let's just call this something
like button panel so buttons panel I'll
do and this is all just so when you're
in code you don't see all these random
names it's more descriptive so it always
helps to to name everything so let's
click button in the toolbar drag and
drop and you can see we've dropped it
inside of the first row in the first
column and by default a button is a
druggable size which we don't want we
want this to to really fill this space
so for that I believe there's something
called a dock I'm not mistaken but it
arranged it alphabetically instead
there we go dock so I think we can do a
dock fill by clicking the center and
there we go this is now filled that
whole area and call button 1 which is
the name at the top so let's call this
take a look at this calculator see e
button so
see button and then the text inside we
want to say see II means you've got c/e
let's press f5 to run visualize this and
you can see I can see that for one the
labels slightly too high because we've
gone over the bottom of the text box but
you can see this is important this is a
you know a clickable button and it's
also a quarter the width of at the
screen because everything resizes and
you can see when we get to a certain
size like I'd say here things are going
to be too small to fit so visually you
can you can place it next to it and see
that the minimum size you probably want
to calculate to be is here so let's try
and remember that position there and
then go into here and sort of we can't
change you while it's running click stop
and let's drag it to let's say about
here and you can see that's also off so
we want to I'd say there's about the
smallest you want to allow this window
to go so you see the size here 506 by
five to two let's change that to 500 by
520 and that's still fine so let's now
use this as like a minimum size so with
the form one selected again I think this
never go minimum size let's type 505 20s
but out
if I could actually drag it out I condor
drug it out I lent it maximum sized
that's why glad to put it in the right
place minimum size now let's drag this
back out let's fix this label so let's
just move it down you can use the arrow
keys so I'm pressing down on the arrow
key and you can see it move down out of
the way and then it should resize that
just underneath press f5 again now you
still see it's overlapping okay sir move
down quite a bit and let's check it's
actually moving there we go so we're
finally out of the way and this is to
deal with this is a high-resolution
screen and you can see how the text is
slightly blurry that's Windows 10
attempting to auto scale up a non
scalable form so an old windows form so
the positioning isn't exactly as you see
it in the design but again ignore that
for now it's not about windows forms so
much about just getting this thing built
so we can start doing some functions
with it so now you've made this one
button and you can just basically do
exactly the same for the rest of all of
these buttons and you want to give them
a name of the title so what they're
doing so CEC then we'll have we don't
really need this one but we might as
well put it in and we'll just call that
back that's to delete a character so as
you're typing it deletes one of the
things you've typed and then divided
times minus plus equals we can call that
dot or period and call that sign or plus
or minus that basically toggles between
whether they're the values are plus or a
minus again that's not so much useful in
ours because we're going to be typing so
in fact let's leave that one out and
leave it as a blank and all the others
are numbers so just give them names and
always through this I'll just
fast-forward the video so you don't have
to watch me doing this but in essence
you click the button you drag you drop
you go over to the right side properties
you change the dock to fill
you change the text to the visible text
of a button and then you change the name
to a descriptive name and then go ahead
and repeat this for every button so you
can see how I'm really quickly adding
these all's I've done is clicked on one
button press control-c and I click
inside the the cell of the table and
press control V to paste and click again
and paste so this is a quick way to get
the buttons in I'll then go back and
change all the names
so there you can see we've got all the
buttons added and we drop down this box
you can see all the names see button ze
doll for delete or back or jvo and
divided dart or period 8 equals oops as
a mistake equals wants to be equals
button 5 button that's the form for
bottom - 9 1 + 7 6 3 times or multiply -
user important zero so everything's been
labeled and named and created so let's
press f5 and take a look so here's our
little basic calculator with the buttons
that we can click to do things the texts
telling us what to do when the box low
going to actually enter our equation to
work out and then you can expand and go
down to the minimum size and it's still
a fact that's a nice size to start at
let's resize our form to the smallest
size there we go now when you run this
program you'll be expected to let's say
we did 4 + 5 you'd expect to press ENTER
and to get you know the result that
would be a natural response that you'd
expect got a little bit of a spacing
going on here
I'm just see if that changes with the
minimum size ah yeah so when you make it
minimum you get a weird space in so
let's just leave it at that size for now
yeah so see you type 4 + 5 new press
Enter you'd expect that to give you your
result so to correct that it's going to
be the same thing as when you press the
equals button that's going to be the
thing that does the calculation and you
can see here the intellitrace is sort of
given as a some visual output of what
we're doing which is quite cool so let's
first make this equals a default button
which means when the forms focused in
your press ENTER it should press that
button
so if we click this equals button and
then we scroll down I believe Dioner
sorry it's the form I believe you click
the form and you scroll down and you
should have you got a cancel button it's
remembering what it's called it except
button yeah there we go so except unlike
the default button of your when you
press the Enter
I believe the cancel button is when you
press the escape so we can also link the
C II which should just clear the current
text which again in our program the C
really is the same as C because we're
doing the whole calculation in one it's
not like we've got an ongoing
calculation so saying that let's delete
the C so let's select the form now let's
change this accept button to be our
equals button now you can see it's gone
blue which is like a sign that it's a
default button so let's first see if
this works with having a textbox test
and then you can see now when we press
ENTER for one over here it showed that
we've pressed enter and two we don't get
that annoying Windows beep so we now
know it's effectively pressing this
button when we press ENTER which is what
we want
after we don't do anything yet so you
can't really see anything visual and
then also want the C to be pressed on we
press escape so escape now we we just
get the beeping noise so let's close
select the form go to the properties and
the cancel button change that to the C
ebon run the program with f5 type some
text press escape you can see there over
here it's saying we press C and we also
don't get that annoying beep so now when
we press escape we're effectively
clicking this when we press Enter
or effective looks like in the equals so
now when we link actions into these they
will you know be useful
so let's start by creating an event
handler so now we've got the form
visually made we want to actually do
things so they would simply thing to do
is this C button which will is clear
this textbox so it will get rid of any
input so there's multiple ways you can
add event handlers but an event handler
is something that responds to an event
it handles the event hence the name so
the event being you've clicked this
button and then the handler being
effectively a function and method just a
special type of method so you can see
down the properties you've got this
events arrow or lightning bolt you click
this and you can see a load of events
that are specific to a Windows forms
button and you can action any of these
events so visible change tabindex
changed size changed all these are
events the default event for a button as
a click you can see this drop down here
this is a drop down of all functions
that it can find inside this forms code
in order to do something when you click
the bottom so a really quick way of
doing this is you can just double click
this button or you can double click
inside the click event here so let's
just double click here and you can see
it's gone it's basically jumped into the
code behind of the class so if we went
back to the class and press f7 it's jump
to the code behind which is just this
file this form 1 dot CS you can see
their form on dot cs and it's then
created this private function for us
it's private function returns nothing
it's called C button underscore click
and it's got two parameters one's an
object so we can be anything sender and
the second is event augs which is for
handling you know the event that happens
some information about the click event
in this case and then this is now the
function that will run when we click the
button so let's just make a message box
pop-up so if you type
each box dot she'll need to do hi press
f5 to run and when we click the C button
our code now runs because it is hi box
there's no tie or we just literally pass
the string just to show that something
was happening we should also be able to
test that here we press escape on the
keyboard we get the same thing so this
function is now being wrong we've we've
linked in this button click to this
function so how did that happen we
double clicked here to add this and it
automatically did it for us so let's
just delete this from the list here and
now that's gone away nothing will happen
you can see in the drop down it's
automatically found that this is a
function in the form in the forms class
that's able to accept a click it's the
same type that the click expects so it
can assign it as reassigned let's just
take a look at what that does and what
that means when this happens and then
we'll do it manually so I mentioned this
designer class here which is
auto-generated so you open this file you
can already see it's added all these
private variables and these are all the
things we dragged and dropped onto there
the visual designer so that has all the
buttons reality there's the label the
input text the table layout panel so
it's created private variables and then
we go into this region you can see
initialize component which if we go to
the form 1 dot C S Class you can see the
constructor when it's created call the
initialize component and that function
is inside this auto-generated class so
when when form 1 is created in the
program here when we do new form this
first goes into the constructor which
then call the initialize which goes into
here which then effectively creates
instant eights all of these variables so
we create instances of the text boxes
the labels the buttons and then remember
this is all auto-generated code this is
what Visual Studio has done for us when
we visually created the form
it's then taken the buttons panel which
is the panel where all the buttons are
and suspended layout so that the window
doesn't keep redrawing itself as it's
being created
then it suspends the hole forms layout
as well so these two things just stop
the form from drawing then it goes ahead
and creates all the properties and
possessions everything to the exact
place that we visually designed and it
does the anchor points and all you can
flick through this yourself in and see
again I won't go through explaining this
because you won't need to use Windows
forms you'll be doing WPF it's nice to
see where everything is and what's
happening if you you interested so let's
go to this C button here and you can see
now here the single-line c button click
and if you hover over or better yet we
just delete and press dot type click
because it's a lightning bolt which
means it's an event and well isn't it
bent handle in this case you can see it
occurs when the control is clicked and
the way you work with event handlers you
don't assign them directly you can but
you don't usually do a plus equals which
if you recall when you're adding values
together it means that click equals
click plus this event handler so you're
combining two event handlers into one
and this works because you know event
handlers are a special thing they can be
there's a single property if you will we
press f12 on click you can see the type
of property it's a public so we can
access it and then it's got this
additional thing an event before the
variable type so the types an event
handler which if we press f12 on that
you can also see is this thing called a
delegate which we'll get into in future
videos but in essence it's it's a
function that has two properties and
object in an event args which you'll
remember is in our function C click
Seaborn click so what happens is when
a property or variable is of type event
you can use this syntax of plus equals
and basically it means you could just
say multiple functions can run when this
button is clicked so if we added an
extra function if we go into the form
really quick and just copy and paste
this function give it another name click
one
hye-won we go back into the code we copy
and paste and we do click plus equals
this function click plus equals this
function so now this is added two
functions to the single event of click
we press f5 to run and we click this
button let's see we get hi we click OK
and we get hi 1 we you can do this
entire thing yourself in code if you
want to instead so if we deleted that
line from the auto-generated file and we
run the code you can see now nothing
happens and then inside of our
constructor this is our normal class not
the auto-generated class we can just go
after the initialized components and put
that code ourself and then if we run we
will now get the message box appearing
so you can hook in the events yourself
if you don't want to use there the
visual designer but to be honest there's
no real reason it's just nice to see how
it's constructed that when you open this
and you double click this doll that's
created the function for us then in the
design
it's added this click event handler so
it just does that for us it saves us
some work so that's fine
and the seee you can see the see doesn't
have it here because this this
properties pane is populated based on
this auto-generated file it doesn't take
into account what we do in our own code
file so because we added it after here
it's not recognized in the design that's
let's just delete our code and let's let
the designer do it automatically for us
so click see it already exists let's
just click the drop-down and select seee
so now to add event handlers so
functions that will run when we click
these buttons all we have to do is go
through and double click each button and
you can see we get the function
you
and there we go as all the functions
ready to do things with so before we go
start organizing this class again let's
add the XML comment three forward
slashes and basic calculator I'm going
to be a little bit lazy on the comment
descriptions you know how to do comments
now and when it comes to your
application you can make these a lot
more descriptive I'll make them
descriptive enough that they useful but
you know we're not going to go super
descriptive because it will just waste
time on the videos this is the
constructor so we want a region with
hash region let's call it constructor go
to the end point end region there
because this is the start and finish of
their constructor give the constructor a
comment as well because it's a public
function anything public should really
have the exportable comments the three
forward slashes one will just say
default constructor collapse that to get
it out the way and now these are a load
of functions so we could group these all
into one big region just called public
functions and but let's be a little bit
more definitive so we have I'd say the
plus the minus the times that divide the
operators so let's group those so
there's the divide start the region here
operator functions divide x minus plus
and equals is no really part of that and
region and as the operator functions
will comment these functions as we go
now you've got the dot I'd class that's
part of the numbers dot 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 these are all the numbers let's call
it number functions or sorry methods is
what we not functions remember when I
talk about functions and these things I
say the word function because that's
just how they've been for so long but
technically termed that we call them
methods because again when we get
further down line you'll see something
called a function which is basically
here a func as they call it shortcut
capsulation method that has no
parameters so because you know we call
this a function then the definition of a
foam-core a function here wouldn't make
sense so we call it a method so got
number methods and then they finish here
and then finally we have the delete and
the seee so let's pull these hair
clearing from Android cleaving methods
so we're keeping the class nice and
organized so we're going to work our way
through these functions and I'm going to
split this video up to keep it nice and
short so right now we've made a class
we've made a windows form project we've
got a form that we visually chopped a
load of buttons and texts and labels on
we've run the form and assigned the
enter to the equals press and the escape
to the C e which now runs a function so
you can see something happening in the
very next video we're going to start
adding these functions one by one and
and creating the actual function of the
calculator so really all you've learned
here is a very quick overview of
constructing a UI so we haven't really
gone into depth about how we've done
that again because we will be learning
WPF but if you've watched the video it
really is as simple as opening the
toolbox dragging and dropping components
on and then taking a look at the
properties which would go back to here
and just having a play it's sort of
self-explanatory just by trial and error
and playing with things you really can't
figure out the windows forms and then
we've looked at events so actually how
to do things here so in this case we
just double-click C E and once there's
already a function on the button if you
double-click it will just jump you
straight to that function
as like a nice shortcut so if you want
to go I want to press 9 I want to do
something
double-click I'll jump you to the
function so a nice little shortcut and
then we've had a quick look at the
design the auto-generated file to show
you what's going on and how those
functions and events were added and how
the whole form came together in the next
video like I say we're going to go over
adding functions to these buttons
and passing the input clearing the
output or things like that so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
