with the DNA web web design series and
we're gonna carry on with the angle
search website that we're doing is the
template so I'm in a new folder and I
just try a new template fabric dot more
than one to get the website where we
last did it now I did a tiny bit outside
the video a while back just to start
moving on you know the website so I
added this little hello pot so when you
scroll down for the first time it fades
in so I'll quickly just talk over what I
did there because that's like say
already made its only small and simple
so to do that I added a section with a
class name obviously single vCenter so
if we haven't already use that which we
have here so we've already got the
single vCenter class from the mascot
banner so you know what that one is
my name is container will be in the SAS
modern one home and we have all the
mascot stuff we've already done mascot
code we've already done and I just I did
this bit here so we have a background
color of the theme color which is ready
set and then the header have we opened
this on a separate sides you can see
both we have the you can also zoom the
text there we go so we have the my name
is section that's got your normal grid
wrapper single grid sync column so
that's like your single full width grid
like we've done for the one above and
then in here we have the the header
style which is for just open this up
line hype so the line height one is to
get the text Spacey like this so we were
to move line height one for example and
then you'll see the default text is a
lot closer
so line height one brings that in and
I've commented this as usual so you can
see text-align:center so there's a lines
central then the header each line of
text as a header will make this font a
lot larger so again if we didn't have
large font then a normal head to size is
this which is you know way too small we
set the color to the bright color which
is this color and then the mark that we
do which is here that we set to you the
neutral light color so we save that then
that's all there was to it so that was a
how simple it was to make that you'll
notice that when we scroll down we got
this nice animation fade in so to do
that I just made again a really small
and simple JavaScript class here using
the helpers that we've already got the
onload the for each and we first get any
element that has data scroll interview
and then for each we fade them out which
is something will change in a minute I
will improve on this and then every time
the page scrolls we get the position of
the page we keep track of whether we
scroll down or up based on of the new
positions further down than the you know
the last position of you will and then
if we've scrolled down for each item as
in each item that's got a date to scroll
interview tagged on to it we then check
every contains the class that he wants
to which is the value of that attribute
if it's already got the class you ignore
otherwise if the items scrolled past 25%
of the view of the webpage size of the
webpage then we add the class that's in
there
so in short and to actually see that
happening we have data scroll interview
here on the header so every time this
header Scrolls 25% so about here on the
website so about this line sort of here
and we can see when we reload reload
there
so we scroll and once the headers sorry
25 cents up from the bottom so it's now
within 25% of the screens height it will
then get a class added to it and the
class will be whatever we bought was the
name of the attribute there so it's very
similar to the you know the other things
we've done that delay data out that's
right I kind of did that bit there was
no point doing that in the video it's
it's nice and simple so other than that
that's the initial model the slight
change in work that have done to give
you know that and then obviously the
class that gets added a sliding group if
we just do vaginal group and search for
it you'll see we have a style here that
we made with basically the group so that
the class itself which is this the
header then every items for any kind of
item extends a slide in up so every item
inside of it becomes position:relative
becomes hidden and then plays the
fade-in animation and then the forward
keeps the property at the ends which
states faded and even though the opacity
0 and then for each item based on the
enth child we delay the start of the
animation by different amount so for
example this one is and child of one so
this will delay by 0.1 seconds the next
one wants to be this one so that's why
you get the staggered effect of when we
load you should see it that that loads
then that loads so if we were to change
these delay times which we will let's
change this to say two seconds and make
it really obvious and we scroll down now
that fades in two seconds later that
fades in so we're using the you know the
classes there as the delays so I'm
actually going to tweak these to be a
bit more exaggerated as well so we see
them so the first one comes and straight
away demo lava almost half second delay
and then kind of point two second delays
between others so that's all the ways to
that I say there's nothing nothing
difficult where nothing you shouldn't
understand based on the last videos so
we've done that there the next part now
is to do this area I'm not really a fan
of this color now it blends too much
with the writing so I'm just gonna keep
it all dark for now so we'll need the
same physics logo which I have that I
can copy and paste in and if we go to
web root assets images I'll paste in the
logo text it's called so we have like in
ready to apply we've gone through the
animating file but we also want to as I
mentioned fix this file to do something
slightly different or generally I'll add
something to this file in this video so
you see it but we won't make use of it
in this actual video so if we were to
for one I don't like the fact that this
data scroll in view could be anything so
it's a nice modular class almost that
simply you want when something's tagged
with this to add this class to the
element so again I forgot to show you
that hot if we press f12 reload the page
and inspect the my name is part which is
the header inside so this header he has
the scroll interview watch now when we
scroll interview and keep an eye on this
class here you'll see adds the sliding
up group so that's what's been done
that's the you know the point book is
not necessary necessarily saying that we
expect as the JavaScript is to fade
every element in because we might want
to scroll interview and do something
like shake something so adding this here
to say every item that has that has a
faded class I want to remove you know
that's thus a presumption that we don't
want to make otherwise it's not as
generic as we want it to be then we will
want to make this bit more flexible here
so where is 25% interview the user might
want to change that to a different value
as well so instead of doing that
let's just do it user specifies a
specific clients tax offsets user so for
specific offset equals and then get
attribute and we'll call this date to
scroll interview offset so we can add an
attribute to change the percentage and
that will be you know a percentage of 0
to 100 of the view height or it can be
anything to be above that technically
but that'd be pointless so if we said
data from to view 50 then it wouldn't
load until it was 50% into the page so
that a lot of flexibility there
we'll get back reality bounds yet I'm
client reps I think it is yeah pictures
up and now finally we'll do if we
specified a specific posture so we have
specified offsets greater than 0 then we
want to do if the item bounds dot top
plus the item bounds height times the
percentage which is mercy
yeah specifically divided by 100 so as
mentioned it we said 50 there then 50
divided by 100 is 0.5 so then 0.5 times
the height is half the height of the
item so that basically means then if
half of the item is it half the item
plus where it starts obviously is then
above that's how we'll work out that
position if that is less than the
viewport height which should be our
helper function
then we know we've scrolled in more than
50% so if the item has rolled up plus
the percentage of the page in specified
offsets then we'll show you this in
action is easier to see it in action
than do that then if it was right we've
got the desired class so that's of the
user specifies an offset if not
otherwise use the default of in fact we
can simplify this well no it's just a
simple din in here or is it no it's
actually simpler to I was going to be a
1 wait let's change it so if the user
hasn't specified an offset that's it -
absent so if specified offsets do have
not specified officers greater than 0
just to be double sure that if it's not
a number this will still fail then a
specified officer 2 equals 25% a simple
logic and now we don't need that now
it's just we have the value and we can
set it there so that cleans up that part
of it that when we scroll down that
should happens let's just check we
haven't broke anything so when we scroll
down now but we have broke something
yeah so oh I say we've broke something
we technically haven't when it's 25% and
it fades up but as I mentioned we now
remove the fade eClass so now we
expected to have you know a specific
class to handle the fact that he doesn't
have that so we need to add in our class
here data scroll interview because this
is you know specific to like I say we
can have this is doing anything and be
in any class now
so let's do add a class by default
school will H which record will slide
off say we will add that to probably the
animation in fabric probably bake it in
because this is a baked in animation
anyway so we have the where is it think
it's in here yeah hello so I hope the
sliding up here has baked into the
framework anyway so we might as well add
here a class that says will slide what
will slide in thought so it matches the
sliding up will slide in up as a default
class and then by default that will be
will do it extend the faded so it is
still faded and we also want it to fade
in nice this all do a transition on the
opacity so we get a nice fade effect and
we'll use the transition normal that we
have and that should now by default have
that class above save the file there we
go
I'm fading up so that's now working as
it was basically what cleaned up a bit
and we called for example to show you
that new featuring work if we say data
slide interview offset equals 90 and say
if it should pull that in now and not
fade in until almost completely up we
could do maybe a hundred so it should be
technically not fading until the whole
things in view okay so that isn't
actually working let's take a quick look
at that
unless I've specified the wrong value
just do that so it's a hundred so it's
getting that value if it's not or let's
do in fact let's prove this logic if we
could probably do what the value is like
we can actually check of its nor if we
do the proper check so it value I
solving that's the correct way doing it
the value is not that yeah we'll keep it
like that
so I would check here for some reason
is invalid so let's just do console dot
debug output the item bounce top top
item bounce dots and then we'll put this
one out as well and then the third one
will be the viewport height and let's
just see what's going on with the values
and we hit this we go to console and
scroll so you can see the three values
so you got seven five nine is the
accidents top which should change so
that's getting further and further off
like you know closer to the top which is
fine some bits right the height times
the percentage of the offset which is
the other height so that's saying the
height is always fixed so pretty sure
that's fixed gear so the height never
changes and the height of the item is
probably up a hundred as one times the
height so that should be height put four
out to second let's double-check the
height so yeah so the height is two five
six so if we inspect that and confirm
go to inspector computed and the height
is not that the click there oh you just
say the heights that two five six so we
have the right height so we've got this
this item and we have the right hide
there so we've got the top we got the
heart which we change the percentage on
here to say fifty we should see 50% of
the height coming in now
so one to eight so yeah that logic track
and that's pulling in but the thing is
scroll into view oh I know why it is
working it's just that you can't see
this is based on the height the opposite
of how much of the actual item is in
view so we could do it right it's just
that I'm thinking of it differently so
what's happening is now when the whole
and we can see this if we simply remove
simply wait to see it as we move that
class just put two up so now as you
scroll up you can see it's there
it hasn't faded in yet so it'll fade in
once it's a hundred percent in view so
they're not when what I was looking at
was the the fact that the this section
here is you know one pH 100 percent of
the view so I was expecting to kinda be
once we are you know all the way down
here and you can do that if you wanted
to fade in the section instead but we've
got you fading in based on the height of
this you know when this whole thing is
in so he wanted to fade in late you
could do like 300% to go further and
then you go down and then you know he
never reached through underpass on there
so that's working and there you go
that's near the end so you can now use
that value if you want to adjust when it
fades in and by default it will fade in
when 25% of the item itself is visible
so I hope that kind of makes sense of
what's going on there so let's go back
to what we're doing we will put that
bucket in so now it will fade in as
normal so there we go that's that
now I don't like this this is a bit too
bold I think based on the Photoshop file
let's just go and fix that it's a nice
little one that will be in 30 minutes
the SAS DNA settings so the other thing
I noticed here we have font weights
we've set specifically which we could do
but then I had another thought why don't
we make use of the existing names built
into CSS which are I believe lighter
normal would be normal
bold would be bold black would be bolder
and then default one I think will go to
normal for this font for the headings we
don't want bold headings at the point so
we change those weights there and then
all we have to do is match up now the
actual fonts we make use of which is in
quicksand in our case so now where we
specify regular font is now normal and
then here now so the medium font we will
make into I think the bold font so
change the 500 weight now fold the bold
font now can be the bolder like there
the black all most of you will and the
light can now be what's called the
lighter so those two now match off and
then with that in I think the headings
should already be thin enough so us now
we've got the heading back to sin so
that's also changed that sort looks not
a lot nicer now so now we can get on to
actually making the rest of the site so
let's start with this one which is
practically the same as this one
so we'll do a copy and paste of that to
start with so we just go to the my name
is push shift alter that as well first
to just format this document so it's
structured and we will copy and paste
this section now it'd be like extra
space and this one
we'll be called what we'll also known as
so we'll just say also known us and then
we can change the class name as well to
also know an ass still contain a single
all that's the same we still want a fade
in the same style that stays completely
the same and the only real difference is
we will change the header to say I'm
also marilyn house and then in there we
will now have instead of a h1 of your
shoes dip and in the dip we will have an
image and the sauce here now instead of
specifying sources directly in the in
here you know like going assets blah
blah blah will use a variable so we'll
do images docked logo text say and then
we will go up to the top for now I'll
just chop it in here and then we'll move
right now I won't bother driven it he'll
actually make a a class so we'll do a
new file underscore variables dot d HTML
and then here we'll do a DNA web
variables bracket and then to do that
you do data caps lock on data data
variable name equals images dot below
the text I believe we called it and then
value and I'm gonna probably change this
to Jason formats but for now it's what
it is for social assets for slashing
images forward slash I think it's logo -
cap dot PNG save valuables in the header
for i think we use header everywhere or
shall we just include it now as include
as a variables
and I presume that should build and we
should actually see an image saying that
yeah so we've got the image in there now
we want to Center this text make it
bigger and just like this I'll probably
have a little shake on the image itself
so we will want to go to the actual
style close-up variables how they we
don't need
surfing's don't animate end on home
right so the style I did for the first
one
my name is really we can change that to
all sections on the home page because
this is the home so we're only going to
include this style in the home page so
for every section because that's what
these are sections so we'll just tag it
all as a section background color the
same the header can be the same height
centered text large text you know we can
make that all the default this mark we
will move out of the way that mark is
the the white text here so we've made it
white because the header by default it's
that color that's not a standard that's
not like you know the normal for
everywhere if you will
that's just specific to that one thing
so let's just remove it for now save so
all sections have that style and let's
see what happens so now you get the
default mark which will then reapply the
style but now this one's now gained all
the default style which is large
centered header text which is you know
what we're going to do because most of
the design and if we look tell Photoshop
file is large text centered so we want
to keep that kind of style shared
throughout and that's what we've done
there we have the header we will want to
now make I think all the headers because
bar that one we have enough to be honest
all the head is a different colors so we
can style them separately I guess
yeah is that well so look at the colors
a second and this one through
so six is that two is default and I will
leave that bit there so the header there
oh there's the other bit that's also
specific to this header the headers
aren't default that color we set it here
so let's remove that from there and
there we go now we get the white headers
so now it's more standard header so then
we will just specifically restyle my
name is and we'll do that you know then
just apply the styles we actually need
to the specific branch straightaway is
the header h1 that's in there and we'll
plant that collar back in because
there's only one thing we'll cook it on
one line I should bring back in the
header color for that and then we want
to restyle the mark the mark or
compactive is going to use that
throughout all the other parts of the
pages so I want to I'll make that motion
Eric style you have our general section
each section in the home page they all
get the same dark background color text
inside centered large font then that one
gets that style and now we'll also have
the let's go to the also known as
section I want this image to shape so
it's going to be the only image in that
section so I'll just do also know and
asked we can make use of the outside and
on page they want the you know
specifically the image make use the
existing one we've got but you don't for
the header which is a shape class and
shake the large although we'll go save
that and let's check that out
so they fade in that fades in that fades
in and now on hover that shape skadoosh
is in the same style so just adds a bit
of something to the page that's not
boring
we'll go back to now the next section in
Photoshop which is as I develop software
and hardware so we'll copy this section
again
and it will do I develop I guess and
then we'll make a another class called I
develop and you can see how easy their
starts becoming once we've got these
styles it's kind of copy and paste and
just fill the content in and you get the
same kind of setup so this will be a
header and I develop software and
hardware is the header and then inside
that we'll just have a paragraph and we
can open up the Photoshop file press
text change this font for now we don't
go copy that paste that and ctrl alt F
to bring it on to inline if you well
doesn't done a great go on it's smaller
than that just so it's visible then do
we have that's all online that one will
be mark because we want it to be colored
and then we save that let's just gonna
look at that so we get there also known
as I do our pottery software so now this
text is in will stylus mark after we
want that font to be bigger as well so
we go back to the style and we'll do the
dot I develop the header again where the
main content is
I develop header we want the the main
header and the paragraph as well or the
paragraphs firstly to space out a bit
more because they you know quite
condense there
so we'll do a margin off and then we'll
match the font size of the header so
that it looks equally spaced basically
we want the top and bottom margin but we
don't want left and right so but zero is
the left and right and we save that and
we should get the space in there we go
and then again for such as common this
much spacing between headers and
paragraphs and in fact that will
probably work the same for all areas
again
standards let's move that in fact into
now be totally standard we don't need to
do anything move that into the general
section area and in fact it was in the
header slash trivia in the header area
then again as standard for everywhere
heavy section instead of making that
font just bigger in this one I'm pretty
sure in all sections as home pages got
this kind of big style about it so make
all head of paragraphs the larger font
so we'll do paragraph style largest
spacing so do some line height of 1.5
just to space the text down more than
default a larger font so font size font
larger let's give that a go so we have
this section this one on that nice and
out so now we got a big just again
chunky size this will also obviously be
fully mobile responsive because you
already done
in you notice how this thing's been
built so now you can scroll naturally
kind of all just still works it's all
styles and you know it's really a nice
size so I'm happy with that
let's go over to the next part copy and
paste what did we have I know it just
adds another paragraph so I love
paragraph for the other one and copy
this then same again bring it in line
control shift control yeah
shift alternate rather before Matt in
the document like I do that continuously
put a mark on the hardware as well with
you on a style and I think one of them
will have to do an alternate style
though because the Photoshop file has
two different colors there so by default
I'll probably have this color as the
default mark style so we'll make this
one have a class of alternative and then
we'll put that in again keep it in the
fabric because it's a general thing
within style it with a theme I think the
theme should have this style so in the
theme we will put a mark style default
style for marks
we'll get rid of that background call
that was normalized so in our design we
want this transparent no background
color and instead we'll have a
foreground color that matches our theme
so around four of the themes bright
color
and that will be coor too
and then we'll make an alternate mark
and that will just have the color of the
alternate color three isn't it that's
the second root or secondary theme call
for alternative mark a nothing left
again now just work so that one's now
got rid of the style and that's become a
mark of this color which we'll fix
because this is a specific one that we
want to change to the you know inverted
if you will so I'll sort that out often
on ours and now we have the two colored
mark so the alternative in the regular
so I would like the Photoshop file let's
just fix this mark here so for that
because it's specific to really that
style you know that homepage section the
my name is will specifically style the
marks in there so we can break this off
to header go into a class come be there
header is break that off again head it
is bright polar right thing for mark
inside here is right
neutral core and this will be more
forward and its course
six I believe is the brights neutral
color and so long as the order of
importance is maintained there we go we
now got that having the white so then
you get the wire you scroll down you get
your little hover then the text fades in
yes that's another step done so now
we've got let's take the loop and I got
the Photoshop file as you can see I
haven't done that style I haven't put
the TM on there yet you know this is you
use your Photoshop as a general thing
you
follow it exactly so like you know
things are slightly different but in
general you know the site looks the same
so this is the site I'm happy with you
don't have to go verbatim here I just
did this to start getting a flow a feel
for what the websites gonna have and now
this was like the ending part but I
think we'll chuck some info in the
middle of this positions and off yet so
let's start with the ending part I guess
but I'm pretty sure on an instruction
thing I was in there so go back to here
as usual copy and paste the section and
we'll call this one are you still
reading are you still reading containers
the same well shake or had a one and
what I'm going to do is just get rid of
this get rid of this that's kind of a
blank section I'm gonna paste a couple
of box I'll probably add a few and then
we'll come back to them now the cleaned
up so if I'd yeah I'll leave them in
that means we'll have a bunch of blank
stuff we'll come back in a minute are
you still reading so the head of there
here is gonna be are you still here
question mark and we had again I don't
like this that this you've got a button
here and this is gonna be a clickable
thing but it's not button so I'm gonna
have that bottom style there and also
read my life story instead gonna have
like an about page I think so we'll just
have it an anchor with a class or bottom
so it styled like a button and in the
anchor will then have the sort of hate
trap you need and again for this we want
there's a point where to the variables
go for the header top menu oh I didn't
do the link chatter that's why I was
gonna say we haven't got any will also
move these into valuables
so logo flat can be images dot logo for
that
and we will chuck that in two variables
way to go flat
that was a nurse save that top menu is a
partial file so you don't need to
include the valuables the master index
page will do that the hatred there
should also be fills dot home I guess
and then we'll add URLs into here as
well that's a forward slash so right I
can paste that and you can name these
whatever you want but this is just
coming up with a panic convention and
then you can see it's much easier in
your website to you know edit where
things aren't so they get into the HTML
so we're gonna have a blog we're gonna
have YouTube only enough too many menus
here so it works so let's just remove
that one makes not too many contact and
then I'll up there now about me page so
I'll be about me if we add all those to
here without me the log
then YouTube SolidWorks and then contact
so we can make use of all those ills now
now that also means I can use the about
me page ill I got my boy I come into
this menu here so this hatecraft now can
be the about me reference and in here
oops
will have the bottom saying continue
reading more or continue reading key or
something will do something with that
let's see what that looks like
then we'll have the other header that
says or maybe you need my help
question more and we got a paragraph for
that we have websites product training
of teaching do and then we have again
the bottom copy and paste that and this
will be ones like me it's like a bit
contact and the same style so I think
that's the actual HTML structure check
of thing save yep so it's built we've
got that page got that bear got that bit
of a bunch of blanks and then we've know
about this so are you still here need
some color because it's not the right
color continue reading then we need the
button styles that's ready the right
size I'd say so we need to just call
these two headers and make the bottom
style so we go to then we've done with
the variables for now it's the home page
and say are you still reading
Dutch are you still reading thank you
all that I stole even or was it I still
hear how you still reading we did that
so there's the class for that and then
we'll have the head of ones but this
time we'll have the with any luck - so
we can just do first of type I think
we'll do yeah first of type and then
last of time and we'll set that collar -
the first one is - the secondary color
first header is satin theme color and
the second header is first theme core so
that'll be the last of type and call it
- I think and if we look at that scroll
down
that didn't work whatsoever as written
something wrong there Oh Oh still
weeding header because I've done the fit
you know a child will in so I want the I
still reading to get this general area
then Jim right the way to the header and
then find the first header ones and
header well yet the first header ones so
now we should have there we go so I
think that one that please the Photoshop
yep
so now we just need to style the buttons
I'll turn into a button and again for
the button it's really it's a general
style for I guess this modern one in
general so I'm just gonna chuck it in
this file for now and we'll do an anchor
thought and to always be as specific as
you can on your styles don't just say
button in case you don't want another
style of a button on a different tag
development so always keep your CSS
right as specific as you can be like to
only apply to certain elements from
larger fonts font size font larger on
the border
one pixel solid call it three the bright
polar border radius and that can be a
spacing normal to match the you know the
sizing that we use in the whole
framework to keep the consistency and
spacing and so same with padding inside
side button pull off padding all around
and I'll be the spacing normal again and
let's have a look at that go to the end
so that's not far off now we need to
style these anchors so we want the X
polar right neutral it looks like a
normal button to start with color six
and then extend the focus which is hover
on focus so it looks like the normal
like this and for that we'll use the dry
why is that not is that moving about so
if not extensions include a bright
secondary before to match the bottom
which is three so now we should get
hopefully a button there we go that
Styles not bad nice and easy so now as I
mentioned we have got the home page we
have just a splashy intro thing where
people just go oh that's nice scroll
down this doggy an introduced my name's
Luke I'm also known as then I develop
software and hardware and this is really
just a very short implant-- statement
but then the next thing would say are
you still there but you'll really read
much so I'll took him to more lot of
statements here because it can always go
to about Tim blog and stuff but let's at
least put a few things in here so I'm
gonna put
in like a loading page because obviously
I do these YouTube videos so I might as
well Chuck that in there so this one can
be it will say learn for free under the
star the same alone or free and then
we'll have a header that says the same
thing for free I will do if you want to
get some free knowledge and then
software apartment or other things I
know I freely give up anyone I really
give away my knowledge on my and then
link to URLs dot YouTube
Yushu channel and I think that's it so
we'll take a look the page or Satana
software of allah and then learn for
free this is a nice little statement
again all the nice space around keeps
you really clean and uncluttered so then
people are more likely to focus on the
little statement as opposed to just
being a lot of text and people not
wanting to read this kind of space is
everything out and adds a bit of color
and action and change in general so
people feel like they still want to read
it's that's that section I had one more
and I just put hire me so when I get the
time I you know help people but
obviously people that want more
professional help for business or paid
higher then obviously you can contact me
as well so this will be high and me and
that's it and then here you can hire me
well our paragraph again I do contracted
work
training guidance what we changed these
best book generals just Poppins in that
dance on projects or even complete
projects from scratch another well had a
ever you want to hire me comma another
link and this will be old dot contact
again contact me and we can work it so
nice and informal well that's you know
all you need save that refresh so this
should be the page really the you know
the homepage I'm pretty happy with so we
scroll down hi my name is Luke I'm also
known as a little thing is this brings a
bit of course straight away from the
text so you've started with some cool
stuff you've been told me name then he
instantly had a bit more color so you
keep scrolling and then it starts now
you really want to know some it so you
can you can hit them with a bit of you
know bump so it's not huge it but it's
enough that they should read and then
they scroll down another hit with
something that's like positive began
it's all in for free something
interesting and then the people have
actually further interested all other
and carry on reading to the higher me so
we kind of structure it in that flow if
you will and again I'll just separated
these two clean sentences and then you
scroll down are you still here continue
even here which will take them to the
about page and I can fill in more
details there or maybe you need help
website product in case they're thinking
about something in the head like I
wanted review websites or products or
apps so even though we've mentioned
things it's just the short statements
are what people read so continue we
don't go to about which if we hover it
should say that yet I'm not sure all so
much and the contact amis contact so all
the links are working and then I think
the last thing on the this page is this
little footer here which we can add
which I'll just be the logo again at
probably a match width so let's just
chalk that footer in so the photo really
will be
a section I guess got the header/footer
so the footer of every page can be
fought a class call it photo everything
else is the same single big column nuts
were happy with that will slide up I'm
in fact we don't want the slide up thing
we don't want to animate Union the photo
should just be there how do we don't
have a header we more likely have the
image without the angel sex image logo
text so we don't want it shaken either
so again just Chuck the image indirectly
and what else do we have your image and
then copyright so all of that and then
just copyright and there's actually
limited I don't think we need a link
there I can just be as is the ampersand
for the copy I can't remember I think
it's just and coffee I think then we
have angel six limited logo text now
this would be too big because of the
massive so we'll probably want to put a
either a fixed size on it but I think we
will we'll have like a fixed width of
maybe yeah that will be like a fixed
width so in that case actually we could
port will get squashed this into a
column because that'll always be smaller
so instead of it just being a call we
can have four one six
I think is like that scroll down and we
haven't got the dark background yet but
wow that's big officer that didn't
that's not the that's not the name of
the column because then we have width
okay here put a comma B colon six and in
fact we should just probably chalk back
in the template which was in fabric
sample grit or we just look in here
actually
yeah let's just chalk back that in so I
can have a look and pick what we want
before the true photo let's just shop in
include fabric sample grids and that
should find aij fabric if we file our
public sample grits do I humbly doc
sample grids Oakland folder the thing is
inside there we go
it's always the simple things right so
take a look at where we wanted this
Fattah to be so we want a center column
single centered one so we have centered
here so let's take a look at all you
want it about this big may be so inspect
and then obviously we'll have it
responsive so put in a grid horizontal
Center which is to do photo photo photo
W so I'll have grid grid horizontal
Center and I'll have one for to simply
centers
and we'll do a responsive one so we have
things like these have specific
responsive on so below desktop below
laptop below tub so I'd say probably be
well tablet with one and one let's make
it I don't really want make it the whole
plus star the darkness see so now we
have as at the bottom of this so there
we go so it's still not quite there yet
I will do backgrounds red let's take a
look so but within the grid which is
fine the size I'm not too bad actually
but obviously we've got a huge huge
spacing from the original style so let's
remove and that won't be in that style
it'll be in the main modern one because
it's just the photo style and we'll have
what did we put in their section dot
four to Celeste B section dr. FATA um
we'll have the P in there have margin:0
let's just see what that looks like
first and in fact we can now just remove
the sampled grids so it's not going away
go to the bottom see here we've also got
I think going on because it's a section
we have the container padding so to be
honest we either don't expose report
containing let's get rid of container
from the FATA we don't want that and
then I got there and there we go so just
make the background of this a minute a
column as well so we can visualize
easier so just section doctor background
read and go to the end so there you can
see the footer so we need a bit of
padding top and bottom so it helped
cutting and again make sure you keep
using the spacing spacing normal top
bottom nothing like that right
in fact we probably still want it left
and right when we're on mobile just make
it all so that's actually not bad there
we resize and go to the bottom and that
fonts a bit big there and that gets a
bit small so in your mobile but we have
also a two we need to make that more
responsive so we'll do that afterwards
because that's actually goes a bit too
small now this is a ridiculously small
screen that wouldn't happen but we'll
still fix these kind of overlays after
so this font we want to make responsive
so we have some padding around butter
dark background let's go to the palette
we have actually don't have a a dock but
it is the background you see so by
default it blended in because we've kept
the background the same this time so
what that means is it would just blend
down at the bottom as opposed having any
kind of color I'm kind of okay with that
because this homepage adjust all mono
color anyway so to be honest I'm not too
fussed about that for now so we won't
have dark background where we move the
background after remove padding from
section style and then the padding size
then the on the responsive one so for
that we want to do social media and we
include media desk is how we use those
so we can do include media desk
and then in here we can do font size fun
normal say so below say be a little
laptop will start reducing the font size
I think that should now already be that
hasn't kicked in I move that to that
side bring out a bit and inspect and
font size is 32 it's not kicked in so
it's my media wrong media query so where
are the media queries I'll just do below
let's have a look anyone using it with
the only ones using at the minute media
query breakpoints the factor no I'm
doing that's much easier to just look
for it settings SAS fabric animation
breakpoints there we go so we have below
laughs yeah so below laughs should have
worked so what am I doing wrong here a
lot is including yeah I think I should
work doing something obvious wrong here
again styles
does it have to be in the style directly
there we go yeah just put it in the
wrong place I'd done the include then
but it's you know you need to be in the
peak it's that's smaller there
I'd say also the photo below tab as you
can't be below tab that's mobile billing
laptop one hole so once we're below
there we go large I think they're on to
another step so by the time we get to
even or do make it bigger mainly because
it's text I think it's text is just a
bit too big in general so we will reduce
the font size and you know smaller font
size font size font I think to be honest
font normal throughout just probably
fine I don't think we need to adjust
that there after all that I think it
doesn't need to be huge for that Chester
statements there's that as we go down
then he gets huge there so we don't want
a whole so we'll change that to below la
1/2 and there we go that's better so the
biggest then would be in fact that it's
still too big there so that break point
bill over laughs so laughs one one third
say after that's desktop I think we're
it
because we started at a quartet I made
it bigger with 1/3 1/6 and then 1/2
maybe quarter smaller bigger it's kind
of going that doesn't make sense I slip
in big smaller bigger yeah so not quite
right there we could also just do which
is kind of smarter in a sense instead of
using the grid for this part we could
just make this column specifically a
width of the viewport like the third of
the width of the viewport with a max
width but then when you're big now we'll
stick with grids so I'm messing around
with this we have full screen as a
quarter and that's fine so that isn't an
issue so what's the issue with I had to
put the lock up in there where do you
have the issue the issue is when we are
going to that's fine that's fine it's
this snap point coming up that we then
that's too big at that point so we
change in too soon so below laptop 1/2
is too soon so what we want is tablets
1/2 probably mobile well Bob 1/2 or
rather that is the same thing as now so
below laptop 1/2 is too much so that's
all we needed to do 1/3 there we go
so there is a nice photo has seemed a
lot more work than it should have been
never mind
so now we remove the background comment
on remove
section margin style and now we should
have the completed homepage scroll
through got all the effect on that got
all the text then for free
I am a still there continue reading
contact me and there's the bottom of the
page which is actually quite like now
it's all blended in so I'm quite happy
with that be honest so we press a feel a
bond go full screen and just refresh it
wasn't refresh so this guy fades in you
got a nice all had to hear that shakes
or all this effect going on scroll down
nice clean text big logo but a
description learn for free I am II still
there and then all had a lot of footer
so I think that I'll do is for the home
page and you can see from this as we are
growing it the more you grow it the less
work you have to do in terms of it's a
lot of just and copy and pasting and
tweaking because you've got your
pre-built styles one thing I thing I
want to do with DNA web and this is up
for you know debate or question if you
like so you've got opinions on this let
me know I know as much as I do with DNA
wherever keep everything still just take
40 ml so even though we're typing here
and it's injecting stuff for us we're
still handling HTML cuz that's what he
always said there was the problem with
all the frameworks as you're never
actually variety HTML you start messing
with the language and your writing you
know completely different styles of
things and then you lose the kind of
point of HTML you still need to be at
the level where you can type in HTML I'm
all for that but what you can see here
and that's kind of driving me nuts
already is copy and pasting of section
class repeated classes class wrapper
then a grid then a cold then a header
and really all this I prefer to probably
wrap in some kind of DNA web thing we
can do so maybe the no DNA colon and
then we make a control name so this
could have been called
single Carl or something I don't know or
home column and column know anything
like that safety and then that would
inject section class bar line you could
have then similar to WPF I think it's a
class is playing me and this would be
presumed because we've already made a
say this control would be made and it
would be this HTML but we'd like we
place this with in the template section
this with sort of dollar dollars class
dollar dollar and then wherever they put
class here injects here that kind of
satyr but I I think you're following me
I should hope you following me and then
all you'll end up with is this class it
already presumed that stays the same
that stays the same that stays the same
this whole thing here could be injected
based on a boolean so you could say
slide in off the equals true as simple
as that and then you'd either get that
or you wouldn't
and then this bits really your content
this is thing it's changing so then this
would close out and then here you would
have this and that's kind of what I'm
thinking so that then when you've got a
bunch of boilerplate stuff that you're
cloning you can bring it into a nice
clean thing like that and then say you
wanted to change this layout or change
the style you don't have to go through
every single one but you're still really
in hich tml at Luke's like HTML you've
got the content in there and this DNA
home column would just be this thing
defined here with a bunch of like the
content there would then be you know
dollar dollar content or it could be
because it's a special one
maybe DNA call on content so I think in
the template that you make but all
that's you know whatever we want but
just generally I'm wondering what you
guys think about that
because I think I'd be a really cool
feature and then going forward it clean
up this HTML more but without you're
losing HTML it's still there to just be
in a template file but you can start
making controls and templates of known
things so you can you know inject them
this way as we're doing here much easier
so hopefully this video was useful it
was basically mostly unplanned
I was simply going for it s time and and
working our way through that's white
Bennett you just seen me working and
figuring stuff out but I always think a
video like that every now and then is
also just as helpful instead of it being
pre trained if you will and I've done a
bit of prep work and stuff so you see
the clean-cut versions these videos are
more like they're you know completely
unplanned let's just go for it but I
like to do them every now and then so
you got a feel for mainly just how my
brain works and how it solves the
problems how I think of things you know
the constructive side so apologies it
was a bit you know me babbling on a bit
and not focusing but at the same time
you know I kind of think they're also
useful in the videos so we've got the
homepage now we shall be able to go
through these other pages pretty quickly
because we've like say started to build
up the the framework in the structure
and now I'll show you how to publish
this website and actually we'll carry on
with a WPF and web server videos as well
but hopefully this one was useful and I
think we just needed to get back onto
this website to get it moving again so
you stay familiar with HTML on that
