that the solid DNA framework can add
command groups and tabs and menu items
so I'm going to combine that with doing
a bit of file exporting to PDF DX apps
step files things like that so as it's
been a while since we've done a solid
DNA video I've started with a very blank
one so clone the angel six solid DNA
from github the link will be in the
description add that to your project
make another class library give it
whatever name you like
as called its solid DNA exporting right
click properties assembly info make sure
it's convertible then allow do the new
files is called solid DNA integration in
the references of added references to
all the SolidWorks Interop files which
again can be found in the github repo in
the references folder so just add all
these and then once you've added those
check them all and make sure that you
change the embed Interop type to false
which by defaults true and then in the
file you create it's really easy make a
new class call it whatever you like and
have it from add an integration which is
a solid DNA thing and then you simply do
a these two functions override them you
don't need to do anything by default so
that then becomes now a SolidWorks atom
and then create another class and
override solid plug-in this is a solid
DNA plug-in again then you can set your
add in title and description that
appears on SolidWorks and here so I'll
just give it a name solid DNA exporting
an example of exporting items and then
we go over in the connected to and
disconnected from SolidWorks and then to
check that works you can run the add an
installer tool which is something I made
and show it off in the last few videos
just makes it simple to install you've
added so first make sure the project
builds
it does and then in this tool just
browse to the location and select the
name of the solution which is solid DNA
exported and select the DLL and then
click install ad then was installed and
that's it so now if you right click on
the project properties I get debug and
then you can select start external
program and just browse to your
SolidWorks exe and Program Files and now
you can just click the grey line here to
put a breakpoint on the start of
connected to SolidWorks and press f5 and
now this will spin up SolidWorks it
should load your atom because we've just
installed it so you should see pop up
here in a second there we go and then
you can see we've hit this break point
so we now know where we'll load lead
into SolidWorks you've already got an
add-in now in SolidWorks which was you
know seconds work so we go to tools
add-ins and scroll down because these
solid DNA exporting the path where it is
and the title and description we gave so
it doesn't looking at the many but you
you've seen that we've now gone add-in
into SolidWorks that easy so we want to
go and we'll just dump it inside this
connected to SolidWorks for now and
again I've made this really simple so
making command managers and command
groups and tabs and boxes and items and
callbacks is actually a quite a
complicated well unless L it complicates
but long winded and messy jobs so if you
go into the solid DNA source code you'll
see all these files that have been
involved in just making a command group
and you know the substantial amounts of
code in each file so that all boils down
to what you need to do which is nice and
simple now so a command group has the
big buttons that you see in SolidWorks
when you open a part and you can click
extrusion or new sketch or all the tabs
at the top that big area that's a
command tab you can also have menu items
and toolbars live all part of the
command manager of your other command
group so by default solid DNA will
create the menu the toolbar
and the command tabs basically create
everything by default and then you can
toggle those on and off so we just make
a new thing we'll make it for what is
called a part group you don't need to
actually save the variable but it gets
returned DNA that application or command
manager create commands it's asking for
a title that's title of the menu and
title of the tab so we'll call this
export path then once some items will do
that the second icon list path I haven't
finished making the tool yet I'm making
a tool that generates these icon list
pngs for you from icons so for now we're
just going to roll without the icons
it's I'll do an update to this source
code and do a comment on the forum when
that's ready so for now let's just
ignore the icon path tooltip exports
part and for the former hints or just
call same as the title of an hour export
position you can see you got the
description basically zero adds it to
the beginning of the all the tabs so
that go like before the extrusion of the
feature tab by default it's minus one so
it goes at the end probably because that
and ignore previous version is if you
want to save it in the registry so again
we'll leave that as default so also we
need to do to create the entire menu
system so now we're just going to create
the items here so for that we need to do
a new list command items I will do a new
array and we'll just serve all right
think it's an integer new array there
and then we'll create a new command
manager item
and there we go so now we've got a new
ice and this is going to be effectively
like a a menu in the tool so if you go
into tools in SolidWorks it would be one
of these menus well the menu would
actually be export part that the group
itself and then the inner item that you
click like this will be these icons the
toolbar to be a button like this so I
could do one of these buttons and then
the command tab it a lot it would be the
big tab so you also you create a item
you've got things like name so we'll do
this as the excess because one for
explore it is DXF against other tooltip
again we'll do a tooltip of DXR you can
set the hint or set that as export part
as vxf and then you've got the option I
was mentioning to by default it's shown
everywhere and you can toggle whether
it's shown in the command tab for ever
it's apart or drawn or assembly so by
default the true so we want to hide this
edit 7sm a bit to draw lean or an
assembly so visible to drawings is full
there's a bolt assembly this fall so
it's hidden for those and then we just
want to run something when we get click
so that's not as simple as making a
lambda function so now we put a
breakpoint here that's all we just have
to do now to get a new command tap a
menu item and a toolbar with this
information and then when you click it
we can do something so just press f5 or
let's run and see if that works
so now if we go to file will open the
sheet part of me and there you can see
export part and DXF you right click up
on the top part here you should see that
you'll have export part there so this is
your toolbar you can drag around and
have any where you should also see in
the Tools menu got export path and DXF
as well so you've now got three places
to access that command and when we click
that we should really go hit this
unclick so it's that simple
after the like I say it's a lot more
difficult in SolidWorks natively but
that's the point of the solid DMA so
we've got an export to DXF we'll do an
export as step as well I'll just do a
few examples because I think you get the
gist of it almost straight away so we'll
just copy and paste our change the sort
of step and then when we click we'll do
something which we haven't done yet
we will then copy the whole part group
so part command copy this entire thing
we'll do one for assemblies and again
you can actually keep them all on the
same one simply add all the commands to
one group and change this visibility
property
it makes no real difference but I'll
separate them right this fit keeping
them organized seamless to assembly and
then in the assembly we'll just do say a
step for now D except I don't think
supported in assemblies so just leave
the step we'll change this to visible
for parts of stuff that's any visible
for assemblies export assembly in on a
format export assembly so now we should
have a menu for when you go into an
assembly as well so let's just run that
and find out
so we open a path we should see the part
menu which we do we also see the step
that we added we open a assembly let's
close that down open up this farm motor
assembly I made you can see we got an
export assembly there and we also got
the two menus which you'll notice are
always visible so again you can toggle a
DNA but we'll just leave them there for
now so finally we'll do one for drawings
so we'll just copy and paste that again
right explore drawing and I'll be
drawing will do a PDF because that uses
a export data so you'll get to see how
that's done so there we go that'll be
one bottom running that we know that's
going to work and so we've got the three
three tabs now so now let's create a new
file
let's do ADD and we'll call it a file
exporting
I always make the static glass
I want to make some functions ready so
we want to do a export path as DXF we
want to do a export drawing as pxf again
as PDF rather and then step can be both
I believe and thinking it can so we want
export model of step we'll call this one
I've got little names right about export
model of step rather so there's the part
only the drawing only and this is a part
and assembly function let's just quickly
link them into the clicks so file
exporting dot export part of CSS it says
export model of step
this is export model of staff as well
these export drawing as PDF that's the
whole menu systems on a whaler command
so you can close that and now we just
need to fill these functions out so call
it topic methods for now and then we'll
have some helper functions for things
like getting the file name so this
function is going to be exports the
active part to a DXF and then for this
the first thing we want to do is
actually check when it is apart so make
sure at the park which is TNA
application DNA application active model
make sure this dot one a man is part
which will now be a notable boolean
because in matthew's another model so if
the path isn't diesel to true we have to
do that because this isn't a boolean
this is now where a nullable boolean in
case this is nope so it could be null
from this or it could be true and false
from this so if it's null it's also
false so you can to save it's false
because it could be not so you just have
to do it it makes me have to define
whether you want it to be equals to true
or not equals to true and that defines
the true or false of inaudible booyah so
basically if the active part is either
null or is not a path because it's not
true then we want to tell the user that
effectively somehow they probably
clicked the button before the files
finished opening or something like that
so just a telling user again DNA
application dot show message box
as if the path is the exit model is not
the past and what spaces are the icon
ads of stuff like their exclamation and
I just returned so that's a check to
make sure of the part and we know it's a
part will now want to get the location
where the user wants to save it still do
education equals get save location and
we will need to give it a guess a title
of what the well a filter for what the
looking for first and the save dialog
box still call this DSX DF DX s flat pan
and this is a filter basically you're
doing or and then a star and their new
extension so this will be the tile
you'll see when you go to like file save
us in any sort of windows so we did like
this file save us just drop down here
like this text files is the first part
there and then once you do the all the
star doctors the bit afterwards the
extension so it's just a way that you
define the so tile first then and all
then a star in menu extension so we want
to filter to DXF files and we will have
a title for docs so see part of the XS
we need to create that function control
dot and enter and create as a function
that's kinda close put it into the
private houses ask the user for a save
location of a file this is going to be
all call this one I guess the web can
never sell two letters mrs. Kyle so copy
them in
and then the filter is filter for the
save dialog and the title of the save
dialog and we'll be returning a string
we want to return the class that the
user selects of this elect one so we
just want to create a dialog
she's supremely dialogue is new save
file dialog and control dot to find your
namespace the filter is the filter title
is the tile and then you want to
automatically add the extension of the
user doesn't IP so they don't add DX s
or dot PDF you want to add it
automatically you want to know ask the
use of the specified folder so we'll get
the dialog result as a dialog show
dialog says true sort of the didn't
click cancel and we know we're going to
value you can return whatever they
selected which is stored in the file
name otherwise we just return false yeah
well not false I don't know so they
didn't select that again so we now know
as I select something we'll get this
file name otherwise we'll get not so
let's just put a breakpoint here and
check this work so far
so just press f5 to run SolidWorks and
then when we click the DXF button that
should call this action check it's a
path and then it should ask for a save
location so we just open a part up
and then we click DXF is even now going
to pop up I type test and don't put the
excess and you can see there's the
extension the filter click Save and the
location is D home desktop and the names
that's working so it could be null as
well as we click cancel so we need to
handle if we actually selected that so
ask user for location and then if string
that is normal empty location return
because the user click cancel so we do
nothing check every user click cancel
and so now they didn't click cancel we
need to export the file so DXF DXF right
so to do with the excess this is also
the benefit of DNA if I haven't done
anything or if the community hasn't
Patty damages so we go to the active
model which we knows apart so in Casa
two apart well this actually this is
already stated but so you've got the
active model and this is a DNA model and
you wanted to get something on the model
dock to you can just type unsafe objects
and that get you the raw underline
SolidWorks file and then you can do
whatever you want with any features that
I haven't implemented yet in DNA so it's
perfectly fine to do that but just bear
in mind it's unsafe that anything you
start doing in here getting calm objects
you need to maintain and release
yourself so we'll see that in a minute
but I forgot this one because we're
doing the last part or casting it to a
native part doc anyway and on that part
we've got export flap I'm you because
that's what we're doing with the excess
the location that we selected and then
in the options we will do it needs to be
an integer and I believe it's the side
with export and view options II and
again I'll probably add this to while I
will add this to DNA eventually so this
is stead of typing or less than doing
the Nate
of stuff it'll be a nice DNA function
just called activemodel dot save parses
flat partner or something that will be a
you know I could put this into a
function but for quickness I'll just do
it natively will remove the bend lines
and that's it
so we export that and I believe that
will basically return a true or false so
we can then say if that succeeded tell
the user we succeeded so DNA the
application dot show message box
successfully so path as DXF otherwise we
didn't secure you to a stop icon failed
to save cost as the answer press f5 and
let's see if that works and again this
is it couldn't be any easier doing the
exports actually a really simple thing
you can obviously expand this as much as
you like the main point of this was to
to show you how easy was to make the
command groups now go at the XS button
we click that do test oh and then this
is the other thing I forgot to say as
well it seems to be a bug in SolidWorks
per minute it's on the forums as well if
you get this command into Facebook
basically if you've not opened a drawing
yet then SolidWorks is not loading the
references into memory I did a
workaround on the forum till I would all
the references into memory but it's
trying to find WPF resource files that
don't exist in the install folder so
they must get loaded a different way
that nobody knows about so for now if
you've got this error which I seem to be
getting and quite a lot of people on the
forum deal just restart that and just
make sure that you for now just at least
open a drawing or create a drawing when
you first you know you're using
SolidWorks for the first time it's spun
off otherwise you get this this era
where something that's needed in
obviously these commands
all be needed to to reference some
actions they won't be loaded so now
we've done that that said the loaded so
we can just now open up a sheet metal
part and click the button again and
hopefully SolidWorks will fix that board
will gives a workaround type test again
and then let's see this works and then
we're successfully saved path is the
excess it's going to be desktop there's
the DXF let's take a look at this DXS
and there's the flat part metal part so
that's working
that's the DXF them let's do the step
one next so this is like a universal one
for the assembly and pop copy and paste
that for the most part for two
assemblies because you can do it for
both so it's not a part and it's not an
assembly then let the user know
otherwise return go on to step file and
stop step so model this time a step
check is a bit cancel on the location
and be didn't and we want to do the
actual function now to export so we need
a error integer warning integer and then
we want to save as a specific version so
version a and again I'll just use an 81
from now how do it save as version and
we just want to do the current version
just a standard save option options for
the save we'll do a few by default these
are just wanna know is be the ones that
seem to work Universal for everything
this is from you know making batch
process years ago this is a stall
knowledge I've still got
so the options we'll have is one good
copy we also want to have silence we
don't it popping up and asking the user
things we've already gathered the
information we need I want to update any
inactive views on drawings as well and
there are three sort of best options to
have so created those options and now we
can do DNA application or active model
and then this is where we're now going
to use the unsafe because we've got the
extension in the extension I haven't yet
done the save us there's basically
nothing in the extension yes other than
custom property editor so just drop down
to unsafe to get to the native
SolidWorks variable of that and then we
can just do save us once the location
which we've got which the coordinate
name below that save locations a weird
thing to do version is the version we've
got there options on the options is done
export data for this as an also come to
that with the PDF and then it even
succeeded or not we'll get an integer of
the error in that reference of the error
so save model as step and now we just
change the success check to a if the
errors isn't equal to null basically
because null is that not normal
zero is success so basically if ever
even people do zero failed so I noticed
a typo there failed so it sites fails
got these the long way around now
failed to save model step it's actually
same model a step and that's it
so I think that should work we can also
enhance an fad let's move or do we move
that out yeah we'll move this to a
helper function because this is actually
a lot more Universal than just this one
step file you pretty much just call save
us for almost all files so let's take
other than the location take all this
and let's move this into a helper
function and the world that little bit
there seems a bit smaller a minute but
we'll take that and make subscribe it
however we don't want to I'll just call
them this directly it succeeded or not
same model as now on the location to
save and the export data has the only
real valuable where tasteless in all
that stays the same the locations
already the right name the version and
options we've got passing the export
data and then just return if the error
is 0 it succeeded which is success
results so same model us and then
whatever is defined in the extension is
what it does so temps to save a model as
a different format absolute
that's what tasks to save the model they
export data of any which actually by
default will do is milk so I'm just
going to try and save the file and then
there's actually another way I think as
well remember so this fails so let's do
one more check this fails try one other
way
so if Evers isn't it's the zero then I
believe the other way is DNA application
act is model and then it's on the model
itself so it's unsafe again on the model
and save us yeah just say nothing on the
actual model instead of the extension so
we use for or there's a location the
version the options ref in the error
after the warning basically just doesn't
accept the export data it's a slightly
different way this is apparently I think
then you or one of our remember and this
was the old the up-to-date old one but
sometimes that fails if I remember
rightly where is this at work so you
know what's always works is like so
all's we do if that fails then we just
try this and then the result of this
will be the result returned as well so
it's sort of a double attempt at saving
a file so that's the helper tumor for
saving a Model S so now we just need to
do instead of this error is that we just
want to do is save model us location so
if it's not successful so we don't save
as then it's failed
otherwise it's true so let's try that
how it's a better workbook and just
mainly cleaning up and making a helper
function so it's easy for the next
function we make
so now we've got the that we did
actually this will work for both now
we've got there we should be able to the
past as a step file and also the
assembly is already linked in with that
call so we click step on this fully part
and it'll do part step successful have a
look at that you have to step in and as
the part is a step file open up the
assembly and now we click this over on
the exact same function for this
assembly when that's worked as well
let's check let's actually work
I keep closing down the see drawings
have to leave it open now how look at
the assembly one and there's the
assembly as well
so after step them so the last thing now
is just to do the drawing which is the
PDF so I won't commented this either
what do we call it on exports it's
currently his model a step and you'll
find if you want to expand on this but
actually it's very few options that
change between export cannibal all types
you simply pass the file name and to
save model ass and the odd thing you
need an export data so you can almost do
this as a universal function in itself
that just accepts this the whole
function can and then it can just run
and save a file as a specific tag so
we'll show you exporting a drawing
because that doesn't need export data so
you can really see how you do export
data export the currently active drawing
as a PDF will start with again been a
little bit lazy with copy and pasting we
can probably share some of this data
like I say but it's mainly just for
demoing purposes to show you how it's
done you can expand on this as much as
you like make sure it's a growing and it
doesn't these will be true active model
is not a current looks then we can get
this to fire if we use the menu at the
top the drop down tools in SolidWorks so
we can click the action you know run the
action one we're not meant to and we
should see that this will warn us ask
the use of the location for PDF file
save as PDF checked they didn't click
that and now it's not same model as
because this is well actually does say
model as would you need to create the
export data so do export data M equals I
think it's export PDF data yep let's
export PDF data is a type we can get
that from the the application itself so
I'll drop down to the unsaved
application get exports data export file
data it's expecting a file type then
which is exports so there we go
export data file type it's a PDF the
only option and that's it so it's going
to get the export it's basically going
to create a new export data object from
Tallinn SolidWorks to create as the
classroom you will and now we need to
set the export data you have a look at
what's on there now I use our options to
get sheets set sheets view PDF after
saving export is 3d but now we're just
going to export the sheets of the
drawing so we just want to export sheets
set sheets
and that will be a string array an
overload filler I don't so which is the
valuable first which is again export
data sheets to export oh we can just do
all sheets going ok so you can well ok
what I'll do specified sheets so that
you can see how to interview wanted to
filter the results so we just want to do
var sheet names equals and string array
DNA duplication active model as drawing
get sheet names and that'll get you all
the sheet names and then what you could
do if you wanted to filter them if
you're only say starting with the letter
A I only want to export sheets beginning
with the lighter edge you just do sheets
is and then you actually want to a make
this easy at the query you could do a
new new list of string which is just
faster than the string array and the way
you could do is sheet names equals sheet
names we're sheet name and then you can
do say sheet name dot starts with a n if
you wanted to be case insensitive you
could do that and that's to be dr. list
so this would only export only export
sheets starting with a and then this
would now be passing in those sheet
names of an array
that's your export data and then you'd
pass that into the save model eyes so
for now we will just comment out that so
we export everything I fail to see
drawing as PDF successfully saved
drawing as PDF so we can run that and
try it and then we'll just test out this
filter and again all you gotta do is
pass the passer array of strings of the
names of the sheets that you want to
export so you don't just have to do this
a little lambda you could do any kind of
filter that you like you can literally
just add them manually read them and say
any matching they start the other up
them this is just again an example
that's over the straw Reno's made a a
drawing of the assembling they're just
two names for now two sheets so let's
just go you can see we got the export
drawing load PDF click that call it
drawing and successfully save let's have
a look as the drawing and there's the
two sheets with the views on so that's
worked so let's just quickly test our
filter we will called sheet1 sheet2 so
i'm going to just change this to say
contains and contain say one wrong with
that i want to character it's a string
or a character as there's nowhere you
know case sensitive on contains which is
fine finality just again a quick example
so now we should only export sheep
starting with well not starting with
containing containing one
let's just run that again and you should
see now we should only export sheet 1
now put up a drawer in
click the PDF drawing one we'll call
this let's assume it does soon see it's
obeyed what was told it didn't look like
it now we go yet so is only exported
sheet one legacy there's a few examples
of exporting data and drawings
assemblies parts so we've got this
drawing open I mentioned you've got all
these all the time in the menu what was
left on there so now let's try and
export this part of the DXF you can see
it's telling us active model is not a
part our code telling us that so um
that's really all there is to it you
even know what your command bar you've
got your quality the command tab so if
you want to do so into its native code
it's like so it's quite messy you start
with a command manager which is sort of
the overall manager that handles
admitted then you create a group which
again is really nothing specific it's if
you've grouped your information the
group I believe make the effectively
makes toolbars and menu items so it
makes these makes these toolbars and
menu items the group is this so when you
group it you'll get a toolbar with a
name that you can't see because it's
short but they should say the name and
it creates their menus you can set the
commands to have a group or a menu in
the actual create commands view to step
into the code well actually it sir yeah
actually activates by default so we do
the create so this is like a quick
helper function that I've made for
default options but you could just do
this yourself and I can also expand this
easily so that you can change the
options of the command group and you'll
see you've got things like where are we
has menu and house toolbar so you can
turn off the the menu and toolbar for
specific groups and then from that group
you can then create a well not really
from the group you can really create
these
tabs and add command items and they can
be inside of any of these groups so
these are really sort of independent
these command tabs are sort of separated
from groups but again for simplicity in
solid DNA I've kept them together there
was also a few questions on if one Adams
created this tab I believe Matt just not
with the tablet market they want to be
in the actual group but you want to
multiple add-ins to add to the same tab
I'm pretty sure because I've just made
this so it's quite easy it's a simple
case which is passing the exact same
name so you pass export drawing in one
added as the title to your command group
and you pass that exact same title into
the other group that you can then add
things to it I have mothered testing
that yes I'll try and get around to that
now I've done this at tutorial but yeah
it's only really as to creating the
command groups now so it's nice and
simple inside of solid DNA as a hell of
a lot of work inside of SolidWorks so
your entire add-in now is this to make
new menus so 120 lines and then another
160 to do all the file exporting that
we've done in this example so you can
see how nice and easy that is again this
is just a very beginning if you have any
questions of candidate this way can I
change this just simply the comments in
here or after post an issue on github
where the source code to all this is it
can always be expanded I've just made
the initial function to do there you
know the what we wanted to do initially
which is create that begin and then at
least hide and shield buttons on certain
types so hopefully this was useful again
any comments either github the
SolidWorks forums or this video so
hopefully that was useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
