scroll bars it's been longer with you so
I run our windows dark theme which
really makes this obvious of how much to
stand out it's one of the things that we
haven't styled in the application yet so
we're going to make a custom scroll bar
style now I've never done this before in
WPF if I have I can't even remember it
whatever years ago so this is going to
be a good example of I've seen how I
figure things out and everything I
figure out really is always self-taught
which is fairly obvious but the way that
I figure things out is not necessarily
always obvious to other people so I like
to say it's I solve things by first
breaking them and then building them
back up again and that's always a good
way of not just in software but in
general a good way to you know figure
things out if you manage to break
something that you know the things
you've broke is directly related to you
know that piece that is now broken and
then you can put things back together
and see how they work so to start with a
scroll bar we first want to make a new
style so we'll just copy so let's call
as one and call it scroll and then we'll
include it in the zamel
and I'll just open that file and clear
everything out
now this is one of them things where
it's not like you've got C grid for
example or you know any element late and
collecting the UI and select like the
page host and it's right click edit
template and edit of coffee in order to
get access to the template so with the
scroll bar being more of a you know
thing just gets added for you and it's
needed
there's no way to right click in here so
the other option you have is to
basically go to C Drive Program Files
x86 Visual Studio 14 of your on 2017
otherwise you'll have things like ten or
eleven thirteen for 2016 there wasn't
one was fifteen so thirteen might be
2015 but basically you'll have a version
number if you're running 2017 and it
says fourteen and then design tools
system themes WPF and then this is where
all of the the themes are so I'm going
to pick the arrow to which I believe the
standard one and open with code which is
Visual Studio code and this is all the
styles for every WPF control so we just
control life to find entire scroll bar
I'm guessing that's always cool there's
a lot of places that will go up on the
name so we want something that's got
like this style where the key is scroll
bar so it's going to end with a curly
bracket closest procure Li bracket on
the search and that all hopefully there
we go
so line 4430 here is a scroll bar and
that's the style you'd normally get just
quite a big style
so let's collapse that copy the whole
style and paste it into our scroll that
didn't work
the only clap part of it okay let's just
expand down there we go copy that paste
the style in and you can see that's now
the scroll bar style so let's just press
f5 first make sure everything still
works we have them broken again just by
adding that style which we apparently
have so now it looks like we are using
in here things like static background
static border for colors so let's just
kill it those for now we don't want to
use those because we're going to
customize this style anyway scroll bar
buttons go to style just leave that for
now again we're going to completely
customize this so we don't really care
there's a path for the arrow so this
repeat button I'm guessing by the loops
of it's an arrow tops fairly obvious
it's going to be that arrow like this
scroll bar over here you've got a level
so that path is going to be to do with
that so I'm just going to delete that
path just it's got to style it with on
find seam there that's not going to find
it fill I mean we could actually just
change the fill let's leave that in and
change the fill too
I don't know red and then we should at
least see red scrollbar arrows if this
is what they are it's using quite a lot
of places let's just run and see if that
runs first now so we've still got repeat
button transparent
and that's because a lot of these are
you know these styles and things are
part of this style sheet so we're just
going to strip out all of these styles
so let's get rid of left get rid of that
song that rid of the style
that style basically everywhere you see
the squiggly on the line will just
delete for now this is a day to trigger
chatter filk it will just delete that
whole thing same for that same flat and
on that and if we were planning on doing
a small tweak to the style of the scroll
bar then we'd fix all these things would
actually find this glyph which I'm
guessing you're just finding here by
typing less so you've got certain things
like it's going to be inside this file
I'd say if not then you can do some
digging through some google search and
you can find out where the styles are
stored or you can just do a file search
inside of this folder and you might find
that it's you know somewhere around here
but either way that should be an easy
find but because we're going to be
stripping out this entire scroll bar
really for the most part and restyling
then it doesn't really matter so much so
change that to red
you
and a warming mouse click jumping to the
bottom of the screen I've become a mare
clicking in anything so you can see this
is a really big control as well
scrollbar is not a simple control as
much as you think it is this quite a lot
that goes into it and will clean all
this up anyway our controls going to be
a lot simpler mess we don't need a lot
of this stuff so all them do install it
clearly can just everywhere weathers
never so now there's nothing in the as
unable to sports let's run this and
hopefully it will build and not crash
there we go and you can see for the most
part we've kind of got the scrollbar
it's really hard to see so we've got a
little red arrow there that we changed
the color red to we've got just about
see the center scrollbar there and you
can see these little areas here which
are the the blank parts of the scrollbar
so let's start now we've got we know the
Styles working let's start taking a look
at things and generally trying to figure
out what's going on so we've got a
scrollbar style we're setting stylus as
press and hold enabled it's flex enabled
so I'm guessing they have to do with
touchscreen things and the pen based on
the stylus so we'll just leave those
ignore them foreground so that's going
to be let's just change that blue and
run and see if that appears anywhere so
there's no obvious use of that for
grammar so I'm going to simply delete
that border thickness 1 0 let's do 1050
again having no effect so don't be
surprised half of this some of the stuff
is either part of what we deleted or
just legacy stuff that doesn't need to
be their width and mem went pass up to
vertical scrollbar with key which is a
system set value well we want to
customize ours to suit our application
so let's change this to something like
let's change feel like 50 first to make
sure we can it's actually working and
see the stretch is the scrollbar which
it does so there's the first start we've
got a big fat scrollbar now so we know
this is controlling the width so in that
case I don't know that we need min width
I'm guessing min with as if there's no
content so we'll keep them in within and
we could just do bind into actual width
or in fact will you just divide into
width because we're setting it relative
sources relative source self and what
doesn't it like about that
okay.what syntax going on here relative
stores as relative straws oh yeah we
don't put that equals Justin space slash
you just bind to the width so let's just
change that to say 30
and there we go so that's worked so
we've now got the width we can set which
will leave big for now then we go into
the template so we collapse that we've
got a template then we've got triggers
and that's it so you've got a trigger
here for horizontal what you're guessing
then is styling the control to work
covers on fully so we'll come back to
that afterwards but we know here's the
height to undo a similar thing whatever
a lot I'm going to take a gasp you want
to a width or the height of I don't
let's say say eight maybe let's try ten
we could always tweak this and then
we'll make this the same binding high
relative sauce
okay so self and then we'll touch all
this after this is going to clearly
style it when it goes horizontal so
we'll add a horizontal bar afterwards
and figure that out so now we're
focusing on really just a template of
the scroll bar so you get to here this
is the main grid then you've got grid
triggers so line down button the
condition is fulfilled and then it's
doing nothing because we deleted those
elements that were styling things so
actually all of these are just simply
triggers that we're going to style the
control so I'm guessing when you were
pressing down on like the arrow up here
it was to change the color like that's
changing it to light blue so I think
that's all these were these were all
styling and they're just basic bindings
so that you can you know you can figure
that out ourselves for our own style
notes we need so I'm just going to
delete all these triggers we can always
add them back as we want
then we've got the role definition so
there's three rows we have a height of
guessing these are the top bottom arrow
buttons and then this will be expanding
to fill the remainder we've got a border
a repeat button okay so let's just group
these and the real quick way of figuring
out what's going on here is let's start
by deleting the border and seeing what
goes missing
so nothing obvious we've made it thin as
well so that was in grid one so that was
the main part there um background that
so let's change the background first we
might be able to see it better
background to red
so I think what safety just to leave
that border as well line up bottom truck
line down so I'm guessing I'd almost be
assured that this repeat button both of
these are going to be the up and down
arrows so just delete those as well
because I'm going to just have a scroll
bar don't want to up and down arrows so
go see the up and down arrows have now
gone and we're left with the gap of
where they should be and that's because
of this row definition so let's just
delete the row definition and see if
that still works see we get rid of those
white spaces now yep so now we're down
to just a bar which is what we want and
we have a name part truck so we have
then inside here a repeat button for
page up and page down so we don't leak
and just remove this out of the track it
might need old parts book looks like a
track as a control with an increase of
decrease in a track itself there we go
so we've deleted the bottom the bottom
part of the scroll bar there in that
case then so that looks like the
increase port in them is the one on the
bottom and the decrease button is the
one on the top noticed I saw somewhere
that only we deleted it there are there
is direct remover so I'm guessing this
single flip the order around so we
delete that again so that we're missing
the bottom half there now let's just
change this is directional reverse to
false and see if that flips it around
which we expect so based on the name
yes and on the scroll bar
oh yeah it's kind of cool
so the scroll bar sort of reversed in a
kind of strange way that I'm not used to
seen and down on the mouse so the mouse
we lost memory inverted just the visual
there you know the buttons up here if I
click this bar down that goes down so I
guess that's if you prefer reversing the
scroll bar will leave us just true for
now and we want those to repeat button
so let's start by well really the repeat
buttons we just want to make them
visible on ours so let's just do a piece
of your 0:50 of zero and then this thumb
is going to be the mean I'm pretty sure
it's going to be the main bar the part
we want to really style which it now is
and I guess because there's no bar there
it's so just messed up there the whole
thing so it looks like we just want to
we've hidden the top and bottom parts
here but this should still work so we
still clicked them because they're just
opacity zero they're not removed and now
we just got this bar which is what I'm
after I just want a nice simple bar I
want to bring it out from the edge down
from the edge a little bit with some
padding all around really
and then just style it a nice simple
rounded rectangle so that's the thumb
then obviously of the scroll bar so
let's start by we want to put some
padding in first and we have I kind of
don't like setting this width here I
prefer to just do party than the inside
one is what sets the width so I'm going
to be tempted to just delete the width
all together and then I'm going web
settle with here now so I'm just going
to go to
some kind of default sighs there boss
let's now see if I specify if the truck
has a width yep let's do a track width
of eight and then we should be able to
do padding and if not we'll put a border
around that and do padding so it's done
eight and then it's just it's actually
no so something's overriding the width
value so that's probably the scroll view
that contains the scrollbar so let's put
back in the width I guess we need that
in order to override the default
behavior so what we going to have to do
is instead of having a pad in which we
normally do we will set the track width
so let's set the width to eight seemed
okay there and I noticed it was not
aligned so do horizontal alignment
Center
and let's see what that looks like
so those left as a you know pixel either
side I think the thickness of this is
right but we want this to be slightly
wider now let's make that 14 so that's
better that's okay there now we want to
have a little space off the top and
bottom so for that I think we can just
use let's see if there's padding no so
let's just wrap this track which is in
grid Row 1 so cut that out wrap this
whole thing in fact we only got one row
now so the row definitions can just go
make a border place that in there
against the our scroll bar is now quite
a simple in fact a really simple
template up the map forgot to add the
border to the the padding to the border
so piling we want last amount we don't
want any of top and bottom we want say
five let's see what that's like
now it's not quite the same as there so
let's reduce it to four I don't know why
I put a comma kind of works both ways
what that looks neater right there we go
that's a nice scrollbar you'll notice
also the background I want to be
transparent so we can see this and I
think also I'll start with trying to
make it transparent all let's start with
making it red first so we can figure out
where the background is start the
properties background value is red
so that isn't the background something
else is overriding it further down so
let's change the grid see we've got in
the grid background blue so the grids
got a background of blue now so let's
make the grid transparent and then let's
see them now the red shows through on
the scroll bar now so the scroll bar
background is being completely ignored
so I can go and then it looks like the
scroll bar is pushing our content out
so let's simply put a negative margin on
the scroll bar so this flows into it so
we've got a width of 14 sector property
margene then this is on the right-hand
side so we're presuming the scroll bar
is on the right hand side which as far
as I know it is the map is some
languages weight flip to the opposite
side and you might want to invert this
all now I want to do some more advanced
logic but for now I'm pretty sure the
scroll bars just always on the right
hand side so we should just do minus 14
to the left 0 0 to 0 and then I'm
wondering whether we can just do a minus
14 on the right as well without any
downside so that doesn't work yeah so
now we've got a fade just about see it
because that's not a very strong color
but you can see it's behind the peeling
behind the scroll bar and now we just
want to Pat out our actual control a
little bit more off the edge so the
scroll bar doesn't cut into the text and
then it looks you know nasty just
overlays let's just finish the scroll
buffer so let's style well let's see if
we can add a minus
to the right side as well or that might
do something slightly negative yes
that's going over so it needs to be if
you ever find a system where this is on
the left hand side the scroll bar then
you'd have to tweak the style based on
potentially region or just do something
more but that's okay for now we'll do
the same in this horizontal thing at
least so we know we want 14 and we know
will then want a property margene
whether left:0 top:0 right zero and the
bottom is minus 14 and then that
summarizes it top is minus 14 so I'll
have the same effect down there border
thickness will have high mm Whitman all
right okay so jumping ahead slightly
because we've now got a good hold of
what's going on here it's fairly simple
so a quick look at the horizontal so now
this is actually redefining the whole
template for horizontal which is kind of
nasty
we know we deleted all those get rid of
all the triggers again then we got rid
of the rose on this case with columns
there's only going to be one got rid of
the border got rid of the repeat button
we kept just the track so get rid of the
other repeat button and what's different
about all the sudden they just set the
hi it's got to be somewhere where this
flips around the track doesn't mean good
column left and right command okay so
it's just exactly the same it's just
that it changes there the width to auto
in the height to a fixed amount and
maybe this adapts automatically maybe
just simply knows when it's horizontal
so we'll try that out afterwards but all
they've done is stripped out that
appearance so the final thing that we
want to style this thumb and let's go
back to the original style and what did
it do with the film to add a style
called scroll bob ah that's why the
horizontal one worked because it had a
film style so I'm guessing this time so
yes it style the thumb differently that
was the key in the to command so mm yeah
it's not a great way they've done it
that way just on two different styles
but nevermind let's have a look at the
scroll bar vertical then where's that
gone
scroll bought some vegetables so citizen
finer
so there's the style let's just copy the
vertical one for now paste it in above
and we have overrides default style true
tab stop false template and there's a
rectangle with a fill a height and a
width and a trigger on however change
the color
so let's start with that what's
different on the horizontal band Same
Same Same thumb true fill as the film
heights of height width the width
so I mean milks decided to stop working
for a moment then I just have to connect
and reconnect the mouse to the heart the
same the width the same so these styles
unless I'm missing something here
exactly the same there's like no
difference whatsoever so we should be
okay to something colic scroll bottom or
yeah because it's on map you somewhere
else and then we will style the thumb as
style static resource scrub off thumb do
that for both for now I've got a feeling
we won't need I don't think we need this
whole duplicate style for when the
orientations horizontal we can
potentially just you know alter some
settings as opposed completely
redefining the template because right
now that template is exactly the same
there's actually no difference of than
the command so it's only a small style
may also doesn't really matter but I'm
quite surprised that that's how
Microsoft have written this template it
seems a bit overkill doing to duplicate
templates so we've got the style set so
first thing as always let's change the
fill to live so let's see if we can find
out if this is working this has got such
a onmouseover the rectangle fill okay so
on hover go to blue so we should have a
basically than a rectangle that's red to
start with an on hover goes to blue and
on dragging we could have gone to green
on dragging I guess it says red we've
messed up the margin somehow here oh
that's because
why did that yeah
there's a red scroll bar goes blue on
Harper and it's druggable let's change
that drag to green as well let's see we
get a different style whirl with dragon
and then we might as well make use of
that now we've actually got a three
color scroll bar so we just want to
round the edges on this and then I turn
it to our color I think will have faded
on normal on hover go solid blue and I
don't think we need any other we don't
need to drag color to be honest so we'll
just get rid of the dragon as cool as
that else or we don't need that we have
a fill right now of red and we want them
stairs probably hold on to
semi-transparent so we can have a fill
there we could do a color of the same
but we'll just do an opacity of say
point three and then what we're going to
do is on hover we have to change the
property of pace of T to one so it goes
back to solid and in fact we don't need
the color the color is going to stay the
same we're just going to go solid blue
from faded blue and then let's just add
the corner radius which we don't have in
a rectangle we don't need a rectangle we
need a border with a background color a
bus and a corner radius of how wide were
we we were 14 total 8 wide so we want to
pull radius of 4 and actually these
rounded at the corners should be faded
blue and then when you hover eco solid
blue
there we go and I think we could
probably go a little bit lighter as well
and maybe a little bit thinner let's go
to say three let's make it six wide on
the track allows the thing we also have
a width that we added so in this case we
probably want to hide adding this is the
horizontal we've got a check let's try
the six on that and I think to be honest
the place to probably point one we can
change this trigger to do a storyboard
as well to be smoother fading up instead
of solid let's fade it that's I go a
little bit brighter and then I'm half it
will change it to it you know a smooth
fade just to point to
maybe if that's okay now let's just
change this template to storyboard I can
never remember the storyboard let's take
a look at what we do so an event trigger
mouse enter do a storyboard so changes
from a trigger mouse over to an event
trigger so that we can do a storyboard
mail centers fine begin storyboard onto
double animation that goes to solid blue
of one in point three seconds the target
is the rectangle that it's called and
the value is basically I think I should
now have a smooth animation and on out
we need to be versed at operation but as
a nice smooth fade and then copy all
that Mouse leave I think is the other
style and it wants to go now as a stroke
and just do from one and it should
reverse to what it was maybe I keep
forgetting of that works I'm pretty sure
this works
yeah there we go so now we have an
asshole well but slushy again
oh yeah so it's flashing because we're
going from one no matter where we are so
we'll set it to go to zero point it just
means we have to make sure these two
values match up which is not really that
hard and then we won't get a flashy
hopper it'll just fade too and from
whatever it is you're hovering so even
where they open it doesn't flicker when
you hover and it fades in and then you
can now move the scroll bar that's a
much nicer looking scroll bar now feel
we could potentially add adding further
out so that you can hover here and it'll
fade in more we could have it so you
hover over the actual thing but I think
that's fine that's that's good enough
for me for now what as a nice-looking
scroll bar so let's just budge in this
chat list have a bit more padding that
will be in controls chat chat list item
control and then it's going to be
padding here top left right we've got
padding of eight so yeah how do you know
it's right 18 I think I might be too
much but see what that's like
that's okay it's a little bit too much
because when there's no scrollbar like
at the bottom of your loop there so I
don't know if literally okay it's not
too bad so let's go to 15
I think that will do
and then we want to check that the
horizontal scrollbar works so that's
better so those are nice-looking
scrollbar now let's see the scrollbar
works in here as well
there we go so now we got a little
scroll bar in there as well that's the
same style so it seems to work there to
make sure the text doesn't go over the
scrollbar which it does so you've got a
bear in mind now if we're going to style
the scrollbar the way I've done so it
sort of overlays the control example
instead of just sticking out because
that makes this look nicer whether you
know the effect goes straight through
then you have to make sure everything
that uses that scrollbar has the correct
padding unless you know you don't mind
the scrollbar going over there the value
like that's up to you so we could
potentially just remove the extra
padding because otherwise you're gonna
have to think about this everywhere
you're doing it and let's make the
default scrollbar you could have two
styles of scrollbar see or you could
have a an attached property or something
to do that but let's just get rid of
that the margin here let's set it in
let's get rid of that margin there and
then the only thing there with that
margin gone is this effect here that
looks like them you know it's chopped
off so we might want to alter just this
control or you might like that you know
it might not be an issue I personally
like it when the margins over so what
I'm going to do is leave the margin in
and then I'm going to adjust
the actual chat message box there as
well so that is in where did we put that
ages chat page I think directly this
message box so the padding is left
nothing top and bottom with 10 right
we're going to do 10 and bottom will
keep 10 so I'm just going to push out
the right of that text box as well so we
get that nice effect I need to move that
back again I'm going to remember all the
bits I did where was it shucks all this
start and control
I made that padding 15
and now we've got Matt back to looking
nice so how definitely think it looks
nicer just being over the top
unless shouldn't now easy there now we
just added the padding and it starts
before the scrollbar so I'm happy with
that I think that's okay so now we just
need to make sure the horizontal
scrollbar looks okay so we got the
visual effect directly in here anyway so
all's we should have to do is let's just
use this the zoom in let's just make
when are we
border background red 100 500 and then
we'll put at the bottom
so there's a order to block your scroll
viewer once I'd make the whip 5550 and
then you can see the scroll bar there we
don't have a scroll bar and the thing is
because the horizontal scroll bar by
default
okay night so just horizontal scroll bar
visibility or till after there we go
that's a good way of seeing that we've
got something slightly wrong there so it
looks like we've still got the track
aren't an impact if we run this that
should actually appear so we can play
with it I might see if we've got both
tracks which I'm guessing we have so
that's all fine but the horizontal one
we must have left the tracks in let's
take the loop oh yeah we the tracks were
deleted we just made them invisible
without paid city 0 so I'm pasting the
URL tasty zero so it does look like the
track simply adapt to it already knows
when it's horizontal or not so there's
that so I don't think other than we
certainly don't need a template if if we
could bind it to the width of the
control say I'm going to margin
the I'm just thinking instead of having
two templates we simply set you know the
properties up but to be honest how small
that is it's okay duplicating the
template for now brawls you really need
to do is change the height to six and
the width to zero as opposed the width
and height so we could do that with a
bit more work that can be a task for you
to see if you can get rid of this
template for the horizontal one and
change it to just simple property
bindings so that when it's horizontal it
works fine without having two templates
and if you manage to do that solution
drop me a comment in the video and I can
certainly feature it and maybe update it
in the future to use that so that's the
scroll bar on the link so in the next
video we will what was the thing we were
going to do we're going to do this drop
down provided for on this
we're going to like a drop-down menu
here when you click this button and a
touch menu here and you click and it
pops up so we'll do those two menus next
but now at least that scroll bars out
the way that was the last bit of the UI
that was not you know suiting the the
application it just didn't look right so
we'll do pop-up menus next for sure and
then after the pop-up menu again if you
let me know in advance in the comments
what you'd like to see next then we'll
get on to that we could potentially put
pictures inside of the chat messages so
you could send pictures we could do this
emoji pop-up to see all the the faces we
could do the search bar so it slides out
and then do some searching we could do
text highlight in order to do a web page
and email underscore and hyper linking
in here we could do the settings page so
again just let me know what you want to
see and we'll start doing that in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
