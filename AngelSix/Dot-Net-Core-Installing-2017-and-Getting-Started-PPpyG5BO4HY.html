to start including dotnet core we're
going to start making some frameworks
and things that use the most up to date
code which dotnet core is the new
microsoft.net framework that's truly
cross-platform so just go into a Google
Sites dotnet core and go to Microsoft
comm forward slash net for a slash core
unless you can read all the
documentation on here we won't go too
much through it right now this is just
the general installing of dotnet core
and showing you spinning it up so if
you've got visual studio 2015 already
you can go to help about inside virtual
studio and check if you've got update
three if you have you don't need to do
anything if you've got it but without
update three you can download just the
update or have you not installed
anything yet you can install it here
once you've got that installed you then
need to install the.net core preview
tools simply click the button save the
file run and install I've got this tool
so I will need to do that one then go to
downloads dotnet core and you need to
install the SDK here so a bit the 64 bit
for Windows in this case so we click
that and then it's three one five six of
the version save all the SDKs go to C
Drive Program Files folder called left
and then SDK and you can see I've got
them installed here so if I collect and
run this I've already got this installed
but you'll see what I mean you'll just
get this installer you go through click
OK and then you'll get this folder here
this three one five six so if you want
to check what SDKs you've got installed
within this folder so once you've got
those installed you have everything you
need to do net core development you also
want to you can see LTS here long-term
support there's a current tab and what's
very recently just come out is net core
1.1 which is a major improvement over
previous one there's a lot of added
benefits to the framework so you can
always click current as well and install
like this SDK here so let's go ahead and
do that so just click Save and I don't
think I've installed this one yet and
now we're going to click on this agree
and install and then we'll go to this
folder you'll see it or create a new
folder for us that's just appeared there
and then it's installed so now we've got
dotnet called 1.1 what run through using
that in the moment but at the same time
all future videos now we're going to go
to visual studio 2017 it's now in
release candidate so that's good enough
to be working with I've never really had
much issues which once we hit our C it
tends to be stable enough to to use so
just type it into Google and then free
download I'm going to get the enterprise
version here save and it's like a web
installer just running the Installer be
done with that and then 2017 already
comes with I'm pretty sure the tools
installed but we'll download this
afterwards just to be sure and install
that as well and then we've got
everything we need so the installer just
asked you to agree so we'll agree to
that
and then this whole installer has been
remade so compared to 2015 this is a
much cleaner and much faster install
that'll take probably ten minutes tops
to install and download the whole thing
so I'm going to include Universal
Windows platform because again in future
videos I'll cover these this is
basically the WPF framework for the most
part but will work on windows phone
windows surface windows computers Xboxes
anything that runs on the Windows 10
operating system you don't need to
install that if you don't want to you
need the dotnet desktop development this
is your standard stuff that you get em
2015 this is your old web code stuff so
I don't make any old websites but it
might be required for getting CSS
integration for editing some you know
JavaScript and CSS all install that
anyway because I'll be doing some web
tutorial videos as well and then the
other main one is a dotnet call tik to
install that and you can see it the
thyroids installs I'm also going to
include mobile development for Zaman
because again I'll do videos on that
shortly and then I'm going to include
extensions again just because I want to
make some extensions in the future for
creating things like blank templates
based on a few other videos I'm doing
like SolidWorks so that it's telling me
the install size 20 gig it's not going
to be the download size though so I just
click install I just open off
performance and go to Ethernet I should
be able to get 200 megabits a second
here the Internet I've got max it out to
around 200 mega bit so you can see this
thing is absolutely flying through so
it's probably going to be downloaded
within three or four minutes and then
installed in about to eight or nine
minutes so I'll just leave this video
running and then sort of fast-forward
this install through and let you know
how long to can tell
so you can see there's a download to
five minutes five or six minutes and
what's left now is just installing
you'll find that the you have installed
xamarin which is what I included that's
pretty much all that's left for the the
install otherwise it would have been
fully installed by now so the rest of
this installation is is entirely zomling
so this should take another probably
four or five minutes so I'll weave up go
in and then fast-forward when we're done
so you can see that that's done and I
think it's taken seven eight minutes
total so that's it so click Launch let's
see how this thing works
and then the first start that usually
takes longer as well I will sign in
later standard blue appearance and we
are C sharp developers
and here's a nice new visual studio this
looks cool so the news is moved over
here we set about this new entire screen
the start page is no different what is
the new project move tool so the new
project is now you sort of just start
typing what you want so say WPF I and
then it finds things that's quite cool
it's a bit of a different thing from
what you used to physically browsing I'm
guessing more project templates or
simply open the classic view yeah there
we go so that's a nice little change so
before we get too much into this let's
just go to back to the downloads then
we've installed the 1.1 let's just
download the Visual Studio 2017 tools
preview just to be sure in case this
isn't installed make sure you install
the.net core are so yes it's basically
included so there's nothing else to do
now you install 2017 you already have
everything you need for neck so that's
it for the downloads if you want to get
going on dotnet you can go to dotnet
learn and then dotnet core down here and
go to say tutorials I'm getting started
on Windows Mac Linux and then you can
you know browse through these and you
can see that it's really simple so I
don't need this help anyway to just
quickly show you you can do it in Visual
Studio but we're just going to do it in
command line to start with let's open
command prompt
we'll go to documents and then we'll
make a directory called tests we'll go
into the test folder and you'll see that
the dotnet call is just as much in
command line as it is in Visual Studio
because you have to bear in mind this is
completely usable on Linux and Mac and
Visual Studio doesn't exist on Linux and
Mac so there's a whole the new dotnet
core is almost entirely command line and
then Visual Studio simply uses those
command lines
so we can actually create a full-blown
dotnet project from command line so
we're in this test folder just client
net mule and that will go ahead for the
first time it'll do this little setup X
button and install this will only happen
once and then it will create when you do
dotnet new as default so it's created a
CS project and a program and then you
can just do dotnet restore because
everything in dotnet corner works off
NuGet packages so even your own projects
have you create two projects and
reference them together you're
referencing NuGet packages I'll go too
much into depth but just bear that in
mind
dotnet build will then you know do you
what usually f5 does or what usually
sorry control shift and B does to build
the project and you can see it's run the
build and its output then folder debug
dotnet core app and now it's a DLL
because again this can be run on
multiple this could literally run on
Linux s exact DLR then key issue dotnet
run to actually run the program and then
it says hello world so that's an actual
dotnet core project that can be run on
Mac Linux and Windows and the only thing
you've got a CS proj file which is a new
style and a program dot C S so if we
open that with on fact with the bullies
dragged it into here
yeah that's as simple as it gets there's
a static there's a console that
writeline hello world that's all the
ways to the whole program but then again
the benefits of all this will come later
down the line I just wanted to give you
a very quick introduction to dotnet core
and mainly installing Visual Studio 2017
because that's coming up in all the new
videos so we can close down the command
line we can do the exact same thing in
Visual Studio so file new project and
what we created there by default so you
want to see or a.net Colin we're
stopping it near the filter by dotnet
core there or you can click dotnet core
here you see you get a little bit more
when you're tagged dotnet cause you see
what else we get yeah so we've got a few
extra things doing it there so by
default it created this console up you
can also create an ASP web I've done a
lot of this ASP web and in fact my angel
6 websites made on asp net court again
it's a million miles better than the
previous asp.net it's so far advanced
it's really clean you can run it inside
of linux and a castle server you can run
it on iis through a Kestrel bridge it's
just really cool what they're doing with
this doughnut call and then you've also
got a class library which is here which
doesn't show up as dotnet Kalb it's the
class in it as a a darknet standard so
let's just create this console app we'll
leave it where we'll find just leaving
it there call it console up one don't
need another folder click OK and then
we'll just come browse to that folder
see if we can find it and the home
documents 2017 projects that little
console you can see it's created
effectively the same thing it's created
a CS proj and the program which is
exactly the same as what the
command-line dead but it's also created
a solution to show it's open in Visual
Studio
ctrl shift B or compile just the same
and we should see the build output
that's
not open by default interestingly and
then f5 to run the application and I'm
guessing this is open a command line
window for us which it did and then
disappeared so because we're not running
from there it's up to console dot read
or just a hold the program so we can see
it and there's the same thing you can
see it's actually executed with Program
Files net-net exe which I doesn't think
actually exists the thing I'll say link
to just find the latest one I know it
does so this probably finds the latest
dotnet out of here and runs a specific
one so that's how that net core works as
a very you know quick and simple
overview so when we come to do dotnet
core in future videos you can start with
this video just to get yourselves
installed and ready to go with at least
a basic application up and running and
then we'll go through the whole the
process of you know handling all the new
new things like the new book packages
for referencing things but I just get
your Visual Studio installed for now
which was the main point and the next
videos on net you'll be a little bit
more familiar with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
