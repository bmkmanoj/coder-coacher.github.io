making yourself DNA web for setting up
our web environment so if you haven't
already just download the DNA web
installer on DNA web to IO and install
that and then it's nice and simple now
you just make an you fold a few project
if you don't already so responsive we'll
call this one and then in the folder
that you are working in just type DN web
into the address bar and it will spin up
the NA web and now we will make a new
blank template so just take new template
blank and press ENTER and it will create
our blank template just quit out DNA web
and start it back up again just due to a
bug at the minute that's in the DNA web
I'll fix the next two days now when you
restart because there's a blank template
in there it will automatically split up
a website for us now go to the folder we
just made responsive right click and
open with code and then we'll just drag
this to the other side and this will get
us to our blank template that's it
that's all we need now top this website
we go to the index file we can edit
things so we've got the environment set
up and ready so that's how nice and easy
is it we'll use the DNA web engine to do
that what this video is about though is
explaining really demystifying what
responsive designers and the you know
trying to take the scare factor off that
many people feel it's a you know a scary
thing so a responsive design if you look
at say my website and you drag out and
you've got these three blocks here and
you got a menu up here and as we drag
down say we're on a tablet now usually
this jumps to you know all three and a
line you drag more you go to mobile
you'll see the menu changes from being a
top menu to being a side menu and you
know the buttons would go even further
and then these buttons become singles
so this is effectively how my website
will look on a mobile phone which you
know it's nice and clean and then you
drag the same website out and it looks
you know different so all of this again
nothing's nothing's ever that
complicated so I'm going to make this
video just about we're not gonna do
anything clean or organized or you know
commented I want to just keep this video
very specific to what I'm trying to show
you and basically that's just how simple
responsive web design isn't it boils
down to in effect one single thing in
CSS and that's just media queries so
we've got this tiled page here with now
nothing could have removed it from there
and we are going to make kind of a
mock-up of say this header and maybe
three blocks here just to show you the
how to make something responsive and
then once you know this foundation the
rest is all built on that exact same
principle there's nothing different so
we'll go through our in-depth page here
and we'll first create some HTML so a
div is basically an element in the HTML
this is kind of just a generic block
display item it's just if you want to
create an HTML element purely for style
and in CSS there's no real meaning to it
it's purely gonna be used as a style in
element so in again in web design this
whole layout if we drag the write out
you can see these sides go blank you
know there's nothing at either side the
grids contained within this area if you
will the whole website will never give
any bigger so you've never seemed right
out this website's got this thousand
pixel roughly a thousand pixels of area
here but then the background spans were
right the way across so what I usually
do is this this background that's the
full width of the page regardless is
plat I usually call it container and
then the thing that wraps your website
off into you know this grid of this
specific size I'd tend to call the
wrapper because it wraps the grid so in
the
HTML we'll start where the dev and we'll
pull the top one container and we'll do
another div inside that that's then
called the wrapper and also this dis
container because we'll do a container
not just for the whole site we do it in
blocks so that we can have different
color backgrounds and you know we've got
a blue background and a dark than a blue
so in order to separate them you do this
kind of this container here will only be
for this blue area so as well as having
the container class we'll add a class
per header either phosphor header and
then we'll style that to light blue the
wrapper will then limit the width to a
maximum width and then because we will
be moving to a grid system so this is a
grid here with three columns of you will
we'd have inside the wrap of them
finally we double our hair and rip that
then hope sit and this is usually what
every area of your whatever you like
kind of section of your website will
typically look like when you do in a
responsive design you'll have the
container so you can style the
background you'll have a wrapper that
wrapped it to the maximum width then
you'll have the grid which will now host
these responsive columns and all this
will make sense the more we go so you
don't have to you know understand it
fully at this point because you will you
will be using it actively after this
video and you'll get a lot more used to
it
so I'll make one more term we'll call
this coal but you know columns this is
the first column and this here is going
to just be one column cuz it's the full
width of the page so this these two bits
will be in a well this whole blue areas
there's going to be one column in this
case this one's three but this one is
just one so this column will just go on
to also Center and these things don't
exist yet these are just names I'm
making up we've got to apply styles to
these yet and so these are just purely
you know CSS class names that will add
styles to this whole made the HTML
structure first then we'll style based
on
so we have the column and inside that
column then we will put the header so
we'll just say angel sips for this
header here and then we'll just force a
paragraph with some text I develop
software and hardware if we save this
right now you can see it's just a plain
old site with no styling we're just
making the HTML first so we've got the
column there which is the full width one
we've got the content going in and then
below that we have these two buttons of
UL and they're not buttons are just
links that have been styled to look
similar to buttons so again that will be
basically a but here we'll do a div
class because what we want here actually
is these two buttons will be in a grid
and then there's two columns because
when we resize to smaller those two
columns go from you know to one column
and to full width and things so we
typically style this inside a grid again
so you can have an integrate makes no
difference
so you'd help say a grid there and then
you would have a column this one would
want to be half-wit so I'll just make a
class called off and initially at this
size because you'd have half of the grid
if you will of the column as you can see
here is half of the website so this
button is actually right aligned in the
the column and the same for this one
that you've left aligned so it's kind of
forward then we remove those right and
left classes then you'd see the
basically you know go like that and then
you could remove the
we go inside here uh where are we bump
up on home on half this we'd want to
maybe just specially by the whip there's
a hundred percent sort of thing like
that and that's that's what I didn't
look like otherwise and that's what it
looks like when you start you know
gaining response even going down the
size so for hours it all initially start
as a column it'll be half the width then
we'd want to align it to the right for
this one and then here we just have more
we're not even bother making it a link
or anything because again that's not
really the point of what we're trying to
show off here so then we'll copy and
paste the column we'll have another one
that's half aligns to the left and this
one I'll say contact me and that then it
will form this whole blue area so we now
have you know technically the whole blue
area we just haven't styled anything and
then v these three I'm not gonna bother
making all those in any kind of detail
well I'll do is simply copy the whole
container again paste the container with
a visual studio code isn't doing a great
job of doing the tabs I laughter mess
with that another time to these tubs to
improve you can put huge tabs like eight
spaced tabs instead of spaces in so
basically copy and pasted that container
now for these three here it's not gonna
be the header anymore I'll just simply
have a container with no specific style
will have the wrapper to thank constrain
it within the size all of the grid
and then we'll have just quite simply
three columns so just delete all that
and we'll just have three columns in
here
or it's put four and doesn't really
matter put three in your course content
a B and C and there's nothing in there
we simply made D well as put something
in this we can see
so I'll just say content a content to be
on point C and then what we'll do is
style these three columns to be 33% and
then you know with different size is
always before and should make it
slightly different why not
so now we have the exact same HTML of
how I would design this part of the page
and we'll now make it responsive so
first we'll style it in general it's got
no style whatsoever so let's open up the
sass file for the style let's first
change this background to black and
foreground with just color to white
supervised so much and let's just make
the font a little bit nicer not much but
let's make it son so it's a bit rounded
we also have to the body as part of what
we'll do in the fabric template that
will use next is normalization to get
rid of all differences in browsers so
one that's just gonna show up here is
going to be the body having a marking so
just remove that margin for now and also
clear all headers and paragraphs from
having no margins and we'll have a line
high of 1.3 so all this is doing is
normalizing the the elements so by
default the headers will
margins and you know won't look nice
when you align things this is just
normalization on a very basic level but
we'll cover that in the next video so we
just normalized a few things then we
have in the HTML we've got the
containers which I mentioned are simply
the wrappers around this whole area now
when you've got the container and you
shrink down and you start getting where
your container is smaller than the
wrapper so as you scroll down here and
then right about there just when you hit
it and it's changing now technically the
wrapper is but up against the edge of
the screen so if we were to well let's
just keep going so you can visually see
and then I'll add the wrapper the
container you know next so let's just do
the wrapper first and make a class dot
wrapper
so that I'll target anything with a
wrapper class which it's gone we'll just
make margin-left:auto margin-right:auto
and what that does is basically expand
the left and right marginally and
centralize the elements if they have a
width and then we'll specify the max
width as say just eleven thousand pixels
and there should have a luke wrapper yes
we've got the max width are we all ready
yeah so that should actually be
centralized there we go let's give this
a background color just to see just for
now background equals blue you can see
there's our wrapper they were talking
about that now stays central to the
document but it will expand up to a
thousand pixels so that's kind of your
your website's centerpiece that is you
know this this line here that you can't
see there's no hard define line here but
that's the you know the outline of the
side I've compact up and probably cause
this to show up here nice and easily
with
a background to the rapper red so you
can see in the you know my website
here's the the outline of the website
feel there's the wrappers around it so
we've got the wrapper this this is now
your max width of your website and as
always mentioning just which wanted to
show first now have you closed website
you know below that any Content that's
left aligned with the edge is right on
the edge of the design
so what you'd usually do in your main
container class it has also add some
padding so just I would save twenty four
pixels all around and that kinda gives
it a bit of padding away from the edge
so when it's reduced you know you're not
hitting the very edge of the screen so
it looks nicer and we can well just keep
this for remember this background for
the moment just make it a little bit
less in your face close to a border
there's something like that so it's a
bit less you know intrusive so you can
visually see for now the wrapper
now this header we put here the
container header we want to be blue so
it's at least kind of looks like this
blue header so what we'll do in the
style is give me the dudes inside a
container or you can not care whether
it's going to contain or not and simply
style the header it makes no difference
and this one we will have a background
the blue and that now has made the
background of that header blue the next
thing we can do is some simple style so
one of the things we've placed on here
on the call can go anywhere really
anywhere in this entire stack as we were
centralizing you know this information
that's writing so we just had a style
called Center and we just do
text-align:center and save you can see
now this is centralized
next thing on here let's at least now
make a little grid for these tell me
more and contact buttons so for a grid
will do doctorate for the style because
you know these are in a grid these are
going to be in a grid and that's what we
we name them here and again this whole
this whole thing about a grid layout and
columns and responsive design I've made
a you know a nice advanced system
already which is what I use in here that
we'll use in the next video so this one
I'm just proving the key principles of
what happens you don't need to you know
know the whole inner workings you
certainly can there's the source is open
you can take a look whenever but you
just need to understand the basic
principles because like so they
responsive side of it is very very
simple so the grid system are I've made
has a grid which contains the elements
and then each element each column inside
there is going to be you know these
items and the way I do it is a split it
up by with some percentages so if we did
a column inside here the standard column
we'd do a whip there's a hundred percent
so it's the foot width which you it is
by default anyway and then let's have a
look at roads on half here so we've done
half and half of these two buttons so if
we did a column that has flat as well
clear path which instead set the width
to 50% and you can't see here because
it's still not aligned but on fact it
hasn't even put a dot and half and I
think that's it yeah and I put a four
and a half you can see now these
elements of 50% width but they're not
quite not quite in line you want them
you know next to each other for a column
so to fix those few little issues of why
that isn't one we want the columns dips
by default our block so all divs that
you're right
you know div here by default they're
always a block which means they'll
always take up a full line so we type
div or dip in this case we type div a
AAA you'll see they always go on a new
line they always take up the full width
of where they are and because our
columns want to be side by side you know
until they filled up the width we
basically change the display style to
inline block and now these are shifted
but they still haven't gone one on top
of the other and that's because when
something goes to an inline block it
becomes similar to text so you've got
whitespace to consider so in the HTML
because we have this is now classed as
an inline element it's it's no different
than type in this text I develop
software so the gut from here to here
you've got white space so if we were to
remove that white space save you can see
they've now gone side by side they've
now you know gone 50% 50% perfect
they're filling up 100% but as soon as
you add the you know the effectively
this gap between them then what you're
dealing with here the reason it's
overflowing still is because you've got
the white space adding to that value so
to fix that a little white space a nice
little trick I figured out was in the
grid so the container itself change the
font size to zero and that will remove
all whitespace and then inside the
columns in the grid we reset the font
size back to the default which would be
16 pixels in this case and now we've we
fixed that and we have a layout that's
now got two things 50% and if we did
again let's just put a visual
visual board run here in red just so you
can see the outlines that is also going
to screw up the layout now because the
border has got one pixel around it so to
fix that one we would want to well for
one we wouldn't have to do that we'll do
is just apply it to the the next in
erratum but we might be able to fix it
with just as it border-box sizing yeah
box-sizing border-box
might fix this there we go so this box
sizing basically says the width that
we're setting 50% or 100% should include
the border in the padding and because we
added a border and then it also spaced
out so you can see basically the the way
that you get columns in the CSS there's
multiple ways but the way I made up was
basically a a bunch of columns that
become in line blocks so they go like
text they just flow until they fill up
and then I basically set that percentage
to whatever value I want so 50/50 means
that you get two perfectly separated
columns so moving on from that let's set
let's make the button style and so she's
down here we'll just do a button style
to at least style these two I think
that's what we called them call ha right
I didn't get many style in button or
rather wrap these in a div with a class
of 44 now
so now they've got a differ on them with
a classical button for the button style
let's just do got a call ready so for a
border around them warm tips or solid
white border abs five pixels adding 20
pixels nice big padding margin 5 pixels
around it and there we're going up two
big buttons and then all's we did we
mentioned when they go while that one
it's smaller but when it's bigger they
just kind of go aligned left and right
so the trick to that is we'll simply add
this right and left style so that the
left aligned and right aligned so 50
left text-align:left right let's attach
the line right and then we get this
maybe this wants to be
display:inline-block as well and there
we go so there's kind of the you know
mock-up outline that's the same none of
this is responsive yet but we'll get
there soon as we've done this it's now
let's just tweak these contents so we
want all four of these contents to be
25% width so they take up one row in
this example here I know we've got three
in the website but let's just do you
know for for this design so we have a
half let's do now and dot content a and
then BCD so content a a B C and D for
all of them let's just deal with of 25%
and then the all go in line I struck a
center on that
well with all the text-align central I
put a bit of padding in there we go and
then we'll just call it the backgrounds
of each of them definitely
so we'll do content a background red and
then the c d red green blue yellow you
can see now I think we can get rid of
this dotted border now we can quite
clearly see whether columns are for now
same with the blue dotted ones get rid
of that around the grids and there's
there's our our grid if you will now
nothing responds but you can see we have
you know these four boxes are kind of
just simulating these things here so now
it's time to make it responsive and this
is where I'd say it's very surprisingly
incredibly simple Hiskey is one line of
code in this case so we're gonna say
here's the full-size site and when we
get to here which we'll just say is a
little less than 900 pixels or 800
pixels whatever that's the break point
of when we decide to change the style of
the site so we're gonna go to back here
we're gonna make these boxes so these
ones will make ours go 50% so we flipped
to on a line instead of all off them
down so this is the bit now that makes
the site responsive and again might say
it couldn't be any easier
so wherever we've styled it so we've
made the width here this size inside a
column so inside the column style we
want to change this style when the size
of the page is different so in order to
do that you can put it right below if
you like you can put wherever all you
need to type is act media which is
basically means a media query only
screen which you can emit but you don't
want it happening when you're printing
or presumably you might but I only like
the wish
witness happening on a screen you know
you're gonna then print something I
don't want you doing that so I just pop
media only screen and then and and now
we want a specific breakpoint of your
wealth so we open and close brackets and
then in here is where you specify what
should happen when so if we want to
happen we want to make a style that
happens whenever the screw the website
is less than 900 pixels you put max
width pull on 900 pixels what this means
is anything inside of this group here
will only exist or only execute while
like it's poet while the width is less
than 900 or less than and equal to
so the Noles will do now is copy this
into here don't need to bother changing
the padding and when it's less than that
size we're gonna change the width to 50%
and that's it so now when we reduce this
you can see we now have a responsive
website so there's two color pairs for
cons there's two cones for two for two
and this can be your I guess below
desktop responsive style or responsive
styles and this line alone really makes
makes your site responsive and it's as
simple as anything inside of this will
only exist and wrong when the site is
this so what we doing is restyling your
site based on the size of the browser so
we add another one and we'll say below
tablet and for that we'll go below 600
and when it's below 600 we want to go
full width so now we've got full size
page tablet or laptop and then tablet
and mobile and that really has all the
ways to responsive design I mean there's
there's nothing else it's just a
combination of using there
trips so let's do these two buttons
which are a bit more complicated and
what we've done there is we've aligned
the text left and right and made the the
element itself display:inline which was
where did we do that
oh look we added the class here so half
off left right column off we didn't
really add any name to it so we'll say I
don't know
oh well in fact for mmm you just need
give it a name don't we say a header
button just give it any kind of class so
now for the head of Wharton we want to
go into here so below desktop size and
dot header button and then one will be
lower certain size what's wrong with
that does not use empty rules that's I
think I just need to type something so
for that will then set the gone the
columns already correct at this point
yeah so not there don't to apply to that
bit we learnt to apply it to the bottom
oh so we have a button anyway we've got
a class called button so in fact we can
just say not and because it can be
within the column the style button here
we want the style van to go with the
hundred percent and now if we go down or
letting go I work inspect I don't forgot
here with a hundred percent
so let's uncheck that a moment we have
here text aligned we will remove and
display:inline-block this bit
don't burn this is the
display:inline-block so we just have to
read
the display:inline-block and don't
bother with that wit so all's you have
to do there basically then is remove the
inline block and text-align left and
right so we can force the
text-align:center just do
text-align:center
instead does that and
display:inline-block becomes
display:block so there we go so now we
have the the buttons that then do that
which is what they do on you know my
actual site so the brick going to read
different points about there so they go
to that which is still two columns but
we've simply styled the the inner
content a bit differences they don't
float the go full width and then wants
to get right the bottom part and the you
know the smaller design we can copy this
into here and then at that point we
won't in fact not the button at that
point we then want the columns so in
this case we've called it half so when
we just use that name for now one with
it out sighs horribly wants to be a
hundred percent so now we go from there
to there to there and you can see as I
was saying that really is all of us to
responsive design so I don't want to
complicate the issue by you know
separating all this into multiple files
and commenting everything them you know
we'll certainly do that now going
forward because you should keep
everything clean but just to prove the
absolute basics without anything getting
in the way in no complications this
really is all the ways to the responsive
design so everything from this point
onwards whatever you look at that's
responding
whether it's animating or not or whether
it looks more complicated this is all
the website does when it becomes
responsive and it works on mobiles and
browser doesn't looks different it's
purely just media queries the map some
JavaScript involved as well for a fax
but it really is that simple so
hopefully this will have kind of
demystified responsive design and made
you feel a lot more confident that now
you can look at the website
and I say look at mine and effectively
know how it's done and what's happening
to all of a sudden loop now it's on a
mobile and then look completely
different or peers look completely
different on a full screen so again any
comments let me know in the next video
we're gonna now take this real basic
example with you all you have to be
little bothered about is the columns and
the grids how I kind of made this happen
how I made the whit's work and then when
we introduced the fabric template that
now has a full-blown grid and column
system that we can make use of all
that's happening in the batter is this
there's an other than this basically
being it
I just tidy it up make it cleaner and
give you helpful classes to be able to
you know style it easier but behind the
scenes there's nothing else different so
you know you don't need to worry about
not understanding there the template
