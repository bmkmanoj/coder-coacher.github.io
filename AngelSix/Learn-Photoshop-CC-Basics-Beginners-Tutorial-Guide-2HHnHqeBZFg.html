Photoshop and some basics of you know
how to use Photoshop we do it a lot in
the web design stuff and WPF videos
where I make a just like knock up a
sample UI or a sample website before
building anything and I just use
Photoshop for that I've used it for many
many years I don't use it to any kind of
extreme level I just know it's enough to
do what I need to do but to be honest I
do have quite a deep knowledge in in
terms of you know how to use it so quite
a few of you wanted a video on you know
being able to do Photoshop you know make
use of it and effectively
I guess not together some new eyes for
websites and desktop applications that's
not what this video is going to be about
so the first thing is you need to
actually get Photoshop so you can just
type in Photoshop into Google and you
should get to this home page might have
changed when you look at this and then
you can download a free trial or you can
buy on the buy options when you click
buy just like no thanks to the stock
image thing and you'll get to an option
here so the cheapest option is 998 a
month that's in pounds I think in the US
it's actually still $9 98 so they had it
they have the same value even though
it's a different currency this is the
option of go for it we just want
Photoshop but one thing I would
recommend if you want to potentially use
anything else like illustrator or Adobe
or any other products from Adobe rather
there's something called Creative Cloud
which is 20 pounds a month or $19.99 I
believe somewhere around here and that
gives you access to many apps so I'll
get all the apps here is 52 pounds now
there's somewhere where there's a and
maybe there's that much now I think I
had an offer where it was 20 pounds a
month but basically if you use Creative
Cloud if I open Creative Cloud because
that's what I have you'll see that you
get access to
you basically almost everything that
adobe offer which is you know a lot of
products you're getting them for that
amount of money so if you serious about
it you want to you know really have the
option of many more apps and just one
I'd go with the Creative Cloud option
otherwise I'd just stick with you 998 a
month to purchase but obviously you're
free to just trial for now so go ahead
and download Photoshop do what you need
with it install it once its installed it
will open up Photoshop here I'll just
show you Creative Cloud it's just
decided to update as I'm doing this so
when this is updated than many I'll show
you all the apps that you get out with
Creative Cloud so this is what the
Creative Cloud looks like when you
installed it and you can see anything
over apps and this is basically what
your access to with your subscription so
what Photoshop Illustrator InDesign XD
Premiere Pro library um dimensions you
name it you have every single well not
every single Photoshop product there are
a few tiny ones that aren't in there but
you basically access to all of these for
the same single subscription and then on
top of that you've got assets which will
be things like fonts to use inside of
your machine I guess your Photoshop or
any other apps on the desktop so I would
recommend doesn't say if you've got the
money in you're gonna use this heavily
and you potentially want access to other
things like vector art and illustrator
and all the other tools I'd go with
Creative Cloud as opposed by in each one
individually but that's enough of that
so human you have Photoshop now
installed and you open it up this is
what you'll be presented with so in this
introduction video if you will what I'm
going to try and cover is just a whole
bunch of all the basics and one goes
like almost everything well in fact
everything in this tool bar plus
everything hidden in most toolbars and
give a quick overview of each one what
they do how they work there's kind of a
good overall introduction so that you
can then decide what you need to focus
on more or what you'd like to learn more
so we're gonna whiz through every single
warning if you were a good overview so
if I start with will do filing you
and we will create a new image so you
can don't always open that for you can
happily ignore all of this I never use
any of this I never use any of this just
focus on this little area here so what
we want to focus on is the size of the
image which I'm just gonna say make a
2,000 by 2,000 pixel image to work with
so you can do pixels you can do other
dimensions inches centimeters so you use
the other measurements ultimately
everything on computer is a pixel on the
image no matter what you do it's still a
pixel so if you just change two inches
then this value is simply 72 times that
gives you two thousand so that does well
is really doing in the background don't
worry about resolution for now again
it's not really important for for the
intro leave everything else as default
or you'd be a bit white and just click
create so the only thing you really want
to do is set the size of the image the
canvas if you will that you want to work
with and you can also alter that once
you're inside here so the first thing
you'll see now you have this untitled
one here and you can open multiple
things and start multiple files in
Photoshop so if we do file new again and
created another one and do 2000 by 2000
you can see now we've got two documents
everywhere to just say fill this with
black color you can see there's a wide
that is the black to document so all
you're doing is flicking through the
documents so I'll close the other one
with the little cross at the top one
we're working on this single one now so
this is you effectively or image you
this that's white area here all that's
around it is simply the non-existent
area this is nothing to do with your
artwork if you will so this is what
you're looking at you'll also see your
zoomed in right now to 58.3% and so you
might want to zoom to a set level down
here right at the bottom corner you can
type and say hundred percent and zoom to
a specific level you can use the zoom
tool here to click and you can hold alt
to zoom out and click or let go and
simply click to zoom in so there's those
options for
generally zooming in and out what you'll
find with Photoshop though is that try
to stick to keyboard shortcuts as much
as possible so that's what I'll explain
a lot through here so the first most
useful one I guess is you in your you
create a new image and visually say I
want to work over this corner here want
to move it around you can use the hand
tool here and then you can move it
around just visually on your screen
where you want to work from or again
have you on the shortcuts just hold the
spacebar and your cursor turns to a hand
and I can drag so I open the dock on
spacebar drag it to where I want and let
go then I want to zoom in to the level I
want so there's multiple options again
you can click this toolbar here or you
can press ctrl + spacebar hold them both
down and you can zoom in when you click
or you can hold ctrl spacebar alt to
zoom out so all's you do really is you
press and release the old button to go
between zooming in and out you can also
press ctrl Alt + 0 to receptor 100% zoom
and that will get you back to the start
so what I typically do when I've made a
new document I'll go ctrl n because I'll
use that to even start a new document as
opposed file new and do two thousand two
thousand and then I just press ctrl alt
+ 0 to zoom in to 100% and then spacebar
and drag to say the top where I want to
start working and that's how I kinda get
going so you can feel comfortable moving
around zooming in zooming out then
you're kind of ready to go now so we
need to do stuff I guess on this
artboard so we'll just work our way down
these tools by you know clicking on them
and doing some things so we'll start at
the top here this is a selection tool
this popper by the way just broke and it
always seems to just show crop so maybe
the update or gotta fix that so these
are like helpers that typically tell you
what the tools do - you can see is quite
happily just broken in a minute so
ignore the pop-up we have the this is a
if you click and hold you'll see this is
a rectangle marquee so again there's
from the menu but I'd use the letter M
on the keyboard
so first keyboard it'll also present V
which takes me back to the generalized
tool you know the the move your work
around type tool that's your default
tool so that's the light of V on the
keyboard and if you hover over or rather
you click you can see it says be there
and then I go m4 marque you can see it
selects here and then also do for that
is click and drag and you basically you
creating rectangles and this is a
selection so if we selected an area and
then we wanted to do something with it
say fill it in with a color the quickest
way to fill it in with the color is you
have two colors down here
so this is your primary color and this
is your secondary color or your
foreground in your background color so
we click the white you get this pop-up
we select red and click OK we've now
selected the foreground color is red the
background is black so with that and
with this marquee tool selecting we've
drawn an area if we hold alt and press
backspace so that the backspace is above
the enter key you'll fill the selection
with the foreground color if you all
control them press the backspace key
you'll fill it with the background color
so that's a quick way of putting some
color on your artboard I guess making a
selection you'll also notice up here
whenever you select a tool this sort of
helper toolbar here gives you a bunch of
options so by default when you're
clicking and dragging you are making new
selections if you click inside and drag
you're moving that selection around but
if you click outside you start a whole
new selection and by default this means
that every time you do that and new
selection starts you have the option to
do instead addition so if you click the
second one you click and drag no click
and drag another they'll all combined
into one selection and then you can alt
and fill it with the selection
it's likewise you can do subtract from
there and this also doesn't deselect
what you have so you could start with
addition and add some stuff and then you
go to subtraction and decide to remove
now chunks of work if you were chunks of
selection and the selection is indicated
by this and outline here view lists down
in answers they call it or marching ants
and then that's the exclusive selection
so now we have to make it a bit clearer
just delete all this a minute if we have
a selection and we or rather yeah we
have a selection there nice and simple
and we select this I guess it's called
expletive so it intersects the call in
it if now we draw a selection here like
this and let go what it's gonna do is
select the part where the to cross over
so if we do this now when you watch
carefully you'll be left with the the
intercepted area so there's a bunch of
ways to make selections if you have a
selection and you want to deselect you
can do control + D on the keyboard or
you could do select and deselect here
have you wanted to select as I did a
minute ago so I've got some artwork and
I was want to just clear all this off a
press ctrl a to select all or select and
all so everything's selected and then a
original press the Delete key on the
keyboard to delete and bought because
this is a background layer which we'll
get to in the video a bit later that
means that you can't really delete the
background the backgrounds the fix thing
so you can either remove the background
to convert this layer to a non
background so it can be deleted in
there's effectively a transparent area
because there is no background or
instead also chose to do was reset my
course here to the defaults by pressing
X so you can set rather pressing D and
that resets them to default so we select
a few cause and we have those so you
make it really obvious helps from course
here you can see these are not the
standard colors
if I press D on the keyboard it resets
your foreground and background goes to
the defaults so the background by
default now is white and then I press
ctrl + backspace to effectively fill my
entire selection which is everything
with the background color you don't
actually need to select anything so by
default we've filtered :
and then there's nothing selected sub
brush control D so there's no ant trail
around here there are no just
control and backspace by default it will
assume everything and clear that off so
all's I was really doing when it looked
like I cleared the whole artwork was to
simply fill the entire space with
background cover and then also if you
want to quickly flip between your
foreground and background colleague and
press X and that flips these two around
or you can click this button here but
again always try and use keyboard
shortcuts you'll get familiar with them
so I kind of cover selecting stuff
moving around for this we'll just jump
onto layer as quickly as well before we
get going so I mentioned not being able
to delete the background layer and also
when you're doing things you don't
always want to say about drawing a
rectangle here and I've drawn one here
or I've overlaid some red on top of here
for some reason I want to move that red
it's all for one it's fixed because it's
a background layer but even if it wasn't
a background layer we double click the
background ok Photoshop has popped up a
window down here that keeps popping up
on the second screen for some reason so
if we double click a layer the
background layer it pops up to turn into
a standard layer and we click OK and
what you can see now it's called layer 0
and if we undo you can see there's a
lock icon so the background is a special
kind of layer it's a locked single layer
by default that means your image has to
have some kind of cord to eat it can't
be transparent if we double click the
background and convert that to a
standard layer now we can press ctrl a
to select everything and the Delete key
to delete everything so now what you
seen here is nothing basically this is a
transparent image so if we were to save
this as a PNG that can have transparency
it would be a valid image with nothing
you know it's actually see-through so
that allows us to clear off anything
there so back to the point say this was
now a layer we've made the first layer a
layer 0 and we've got this artwork on
here we wants to move this red without a
proper layer now if we're in this
selection this move tool which is the V
which you'll see with the normal cursor
at the move this is how you then move
your work around but now you can see
it's moving everything it's moving the
white
background we had as well as the black
as well as surrett because we did it all
on one layer so layers you can think of
as I guess if you want to try and
visualize it as real paper you can think
of each piece or each layer there's
almost like a transparent sheet of say
projector film that's simply see-through
so you have a layer here if you press
ctrl n so you're not controlling that's
a new document control shift and then it
will ask you to make a new layer click
OK and you can see now we've got two
layers down here so you can think of
these as transparent sheets of film that
goes on a projector and this one's
underneath layer one so at the bottom
here if we were to draw a black box and
then click layer one as you can see the
light highlight shows which layer we now
click layer one this is if firstly we've
drawn a black box on the piece of film
at the bottom in black then we've
layered another piece of transparent
film over the top so it's a physically
separate piece of film and then we get
some red ink say and go to the marquee
tool and fill it in so now when we go
back to the move tool with V and start
to drag around you can see all we're
doing here in essence is it's like we're
dragging this physical piece of
transparent film around this is a new
piece of film on top of the one below or
you can go to the one below and drag
that around now the completely
independent pieces of work it's like
each layer is like its own piece of
paper like say is if you want to class
it as a white piece of paper then
obviously you'd have an entire white
piece of paper on top and you can't see
below but if you move the paper out of
the way you can see what's below so that
might help you kind of visualize what
layers are and how they're working but
in essence they are just pieces of art
pieces of pixels and color that you've
drawn there as each layer acts as a
single as it says layer of information
and the one below is independent so
that's as much as you really need to
know about layers there's a lot you can
do you can like say we again just draw
some foreground you can click this eye
icon here to hide them not delete them
but simply had
you as you like you can lock them so you
can't accidentally drag around so dragon
won't work there you can do all sorts
but like say for now as long as you
create a new layer which control-shift-n
or you can actually click this right at
the bottom right new layer button and
make a bunch of layers that's as much as
you need to know for now and then if you
want to delete them select them and
delete their and then confirm delete so
so long as you have that much
information you okay for this tutorial
you don't need to know much more about
layers so we'll fill that one again that
was ctrl + backspace to fill that layer
with white so let's start working down
this list now we've made a selection
rectangle if you click and hold the
rectangle you know about the option for
an elliptical tool so it's a circle same
thing making a selection if you hold the
shift it will keep it as a perfect
circle it'll keep it as a a one to one
proportion of width and height once you
get your selection you can do the alt
backspace to fill with red save and
there you can see now you've got a a red
circle what I'm gonna do though is clear
that layer to white make one new layer
and then when we draw things I'll draw
it on that layer so we can to see just
that moving again once I've drawn
something up on quickly draw in
something to select the tool or press M
draw something folds back face and then
alt ctrl D to deselect and then V to
jump back to me move tool so you start
getting in your head the quick ways of
doing things so you want to draw a
circle then the first thing you do is
you press either M if it's already
selected as rectangle shape them to
cycle between the two styles so you can
see that changing from a circle to a
wrap panel then you'd hold shift or you
want it perfectly in ratio let go alt
backspace ctrl D to deselect and V to
jump back to move tool and now there's
your circle you want to quickly clear
what you've done
ctrl a to select all delete to delete
ctrl D to deselect and then sometimes V
by nature to make sure you're back at
the move tool so that's kind of my quick
shortcut setup if you are when I'm
waiting through and doing
examples of things and it's good to get
used to those shortcuts because they are
the most used ones so V to get back to
your tool then the specific tool key
like say M do something I use Alt +
backspace quite a lot to simply fail and
I used ctrl t + ctrl way a lot to
deselect and select all and then
absolutely to delete so the circle isn't
every other options are saying you can
do the same thing we have this option
called feather so we set the feather to
say from pixels what that does is if we
know old Phil you can see the edge is
actually feathered out it's blurred
outwards so even though the selection
looks the same with the untradable we
sell it if you actually fill it you'll
see your selection is is not necessarily
a hard line it's actually it goes where
you select but then it feathers 20
pixels in and 20 pixels out so the your
center line is 50% between solid and
completely transparent so what that does
have we change the background so another
useful tip if you want to invert the
color of whatever is either selected or
have nothing selected of the entire
layer you can hold ctrl and press I and
that will invert your color and you can
see the background that was why it's now
black and your red has got this
transparent fade if you will this
feathering from where we selected that's
available all the selections so it's
like the rectangle feather by 20
draw a rectangle and fill you can see
you've got the same feathering going on
so that's what the feather is here by
default 0 then is you know solid so
that's that we then move on to single
row marquee and column marquee all that
is is a rectangle selection just like
this one but the row one is simply a one
pixel selection that goes the full width
you document so you selected there and
then build these it's a one pixel line
if you do the other way and Bill it's a
one pixel line so that's all that
there's nothing special there so that
kind of gets us going now where we're in
comfortable with putting some color down
selecting D selecting layers so you know
you're going to go to feel for
now to a few more advanced selections or
below here so one's a lasso tool and
this is a click and drag type tool so
you click and hold and now drag you can
see is literally drawing as if you
drawing a line on the paper but you're
not you're actually making a selection
when you let go it will join in your
where your mouse currently is to where
you started
and you can see it made that line for us
and this is now a selection as you can
see so again we fill that selection you
can see it's made the selection of where
we were just like the other tools you
can have a single selection that keeps
free changing it can have addition that
keeps our Dean you can have you
subtraction to remove certain areas so
all the selections are the same as the
other ones same as feather everything's
the same the only difference is now that
way of selecting is to simply draw a
shape in it draw what you want
we have polygon lasso that's a click let
go click let go click let go type select
so this is for straight lines so if
you're trying to do something with
straight lines and then double click to
finish your selection that's useful for
when you say you've zoomed in a lot and
you really accurately trying to chop
around something like this so you're
going around a shape in you you're doing
lots of little clicks and you can I
visualize where it's gonna click before
you get there if you're in the middle of
selection just press escape you can get
out to that and then the magnetic lasso
tool in order to show that we need to
draw say and it looks first we won't
have feather get rid of that if we now
go to the magnetic lasso tool just here
what this will now try and do is stick
to a certain edge so it'll look at the
layer and it will try to stick to an
edge and and sort of select an object so
we click and we start dragging you can
see all these dots is trying to follow
so you can see I'm actually slightly off
the circle I go way off they'll just
start trailing off into nowhere because
there's nothing to select Britain as I
go back to close to an edge you can see
tries to follow
and the accuracy of this edge you know
how close you need to be can be changed
with parts of these options and you can
play with them and the frequency of when
it ads we put frequency 1 and start
clicking then you get you know you can
see the the fixed positions here we
change frequency to a thousand if that's
allowed
it's got between 100 frequency of a
hundred you can see we get a dot almost
every single pixel we drag so you can
play with those options but that tool
needs to be fairly accurate when you're
doing stuff it's ER you know it's really
when you're zoom didn't say and you want
to try and select around this and you're
clicking and you're following it pretty
accurately with the mouse you know
you're trying your best to follow it
accurately and this simply snaps as you
go in but you can see it's very easy to
to not be accurate but it's got excuses
it's another another option for you know
doing something so that's the magnetic
selection then we move on to quick
selection and magic wand in order for
these to be shown we really need an
actual image so let me just open up an
image of rusty and now we'll have the
quick selection tool this is a click
select so you simply have a little
dabber and you clicking it it selects
and what it's doing here is trying to
select similar colors so if I click and
then drag it'll start kind of expanding
around the area the more I drag around
in one click the more it presumes you're
trying to select something of similar
color you can see it's basically trying
to make your selection based on when I
clips of are started in the ground and
dragged around
I started getting bigger you can see
it's trying to select the ground and I
get close to rusty and it should avoid
and you can see it's now figured out
that his leg isn't part of it but then
it's inaccurately selected all of it so
you can see what it's trying to do it's
basically sort of a click and drag
selection that trying to estimate based
on similar cause so if you're clicking
around here
you've selected all the green you keep
going it's gotten down and then if we
were to fill like fuller you can see
it's like kind of tried to cut out what
I selected so it's based on really
nothing but trying to select similar
colors so you started and brown and you
drag around and you can go if you click
and let go then you get more accurate
small chunks the longer you go the more
inaccurate it gets if it starts cutting
into the body here as well you can go to
the minus tool and then cut back in and
say I didn't want that bit selected and
then go back to the plus and you start
selecting again and you can kind of work
it back and forward and back and forward
like Lester to try and clean up your
selection and that's just one way of
trying to make like this intelligent
selection if you will so have you worked
on this a while you could try and you
know accurately select around the you
know your subject and then we looked
where we were we filled in the inverse
that's what we've started selecting so
you can see we're starting yet fairly
accurate there and with more time you'd
be able to make some accurate selections
the magic wand is similar to the quick
selection but this simply as a single
click with the tolerance so we start
here you can see tries to select all
colors that are like the brown within 32
values of brown so as in your red green
and blue value 0 to 255 so it's saying
if we've clicked a brown here then it's
saying any Brown from this area where
the color changes less than 25 values in
all directions than it will select so
it's like the similarity so if you
selected a tolerance of 255 it would
select everything things it's like to
the whole image because every color is
between 0 and 255 you're selecting 0 it
would only select the exact color based
on that click so you can see we have one
tiny pixel of selection so all of those
pixels they're in the exact same color
and it's not selecting anything else
other than that exact color you do
tolerance obviously above back then
it'll stop expanding out to colors that
are similar by you know ten ten little
bits of value of the core so this is
where you kind of play with so we wanted
to try and select Rusty we'd would play
with the values you're probably not
going to get it all with just this tool
because there's multiple colors so it's
not the right tool for this book so
you've got a similar color i'll at least
when you're trying to simply select then
you play with this value increase the
tolerance to select more of it and
decrease just like glass continue
continue as' is basically meaning that
you click this green leaf here and it
will expand outwards from your selection
based on the tolerance until it it's no
longer the same color contiguous says
well once you've expanded out stop if
you deselect new in discontinuous mode
it would simply take your original point
of clicking and we'd be select if you
clicked here it would take that as
simply the sample point and it would
span your entire image and select every
region in the whole image where that
color is similar so it's not it's not
local to this area then it's the whole
image so we selected a black it would
select all the similar blacks all around
the image and when you contiguous then
it will only select your local region
and expand outwards from your first
selection it's that's what that kind of
does there so I think that is all the
kind of selection tools out the way now
we're on to crop tools have you will cut
in the image op so we click crop and you
can see now this static and trail that's
not moving with these corner
intersections and when you hover over
them you have this option to resize your
image if you will so this highlighted
area now so this area inside is what
your image would end up being so that
the crop tool is like you're cutting the
paper out you cut in the the image out
so you kind of position your subject
where you want it size this to what you
wanted and then you would ultimately
press ENTER to submit that is your now
final image so now this is your new
image size this is the cutout image
obviously to undo what you're doing as
well I didn't mention it before
is control that or control Z for you
Americans that will you know undo and
redo so it's holding control and that
will go back and forward between first
and last task holding control shift and
Zed though I believe it is yeah control
shift and Zed there will step backwards
and forwards from holding alt controls
that will go back and forward so in
history alt controls that keeps going
backwards further in time so this is
everything I was doing just and then
control shift and said steps the other
way in starts being forward in time so
it's it's one of those that's quite
confusing to understand like the basicly
have to play with it so what I do is
start a new document with control and
make a new document press B for brush
younger odds like yet just dab some
colors so that some colors appearing
that's really obvious you controls the
controls that you go back and forth
between the last thing you did you
control all turns at and you keep
pressing is actually I'm not letting go
of control and alt and just tapping Zaid
you can see I'm stepping back in time
going over and over and over now if I
let go where within your first control
said that whole action that I just did
in one step will be undone because that
was all classed as one action that I was
still in the process of stepping
backwards with so controls that undoes
everything I just did and then controls
had steps back and forward between the
new timeline so we just created in new
history so I do ctrl alt and Zed again
we can see we're stepping back one at a
time if I keep control how old I let go
of alt and press shift and press and
certain now you see when I was stepping
forward
so you toggle between shift and alt
while you pressing ctrl + Z you can step
backwards and forwards but that's that's
one of those things that is really you
just have to play with to feel
comfortable doing it's kind of a quick
way to step backwards and forwards or
you can use your menu up here and
literally click step backwards step
backwards step backwards step forwards
undo state chain you can you can work
with it yourself manually but that one's
a bit confusing sometimes to understand
so the crop tool does as I mentioned
we're basically crop the image you you
drag around your position you image you
can hold shift as normal to keep the
ratio so it will now stay that you know
fixed ratio we make it really long and
then hold shift it will expand at that
same ratio you have an option to
straighten the image as well so if we
were to rotate say well we don't really
need to rotate here see the ground here
we rotate the image way out and then we
click straighten up here you can now
draw a line so we would drew a line
across the ground there and let go it
would straighten the image up with the
line we just drew that's like a nice old
tool we have the rule are the grids here
the way to look at the grid so you can
select a bunch of options of how you
want to visualize the grid
wouldn't you crop so say we changing our
image size to this size all this grayed
out information here would typically be
lost if you click delete cropped pixels
which is the default option so if I now
delete press ENTER to commit that and I
now move around you can see there's no
no image around that area so if I undo
and crop and this time I don't delete
the pixels and I make my image small and
press Enter
you can now see if I drag around the
image is still there
simply we've effectively resized there
the area in our image so this might also
be a confusing concept that even though
this is our actual image if we saved
this is the size of our image Photoshop
can't have content outside here that
simply isn't rendered so we drag graphic
and see the images here we're moving the
image inside of there's a viewport if
you will so you can think of that almost
like your final saved image area and you
can simply have things off to the side
that aren't you know technically deleted
but you don't want them in your image so
that's the crop tool if I undo the crop
tool with another script perspective
crop which is like performing a
perspective so if you've got like a
building scene that you wanted
into perspective when we leisure while
here on this image book you can imagine
say there was a building here that you
wanted to make straight you'd kind of
align these grids up with that and then
press ENTER and it will reap perspective
your image taken obviously we've got a
really big head on what Apogee so the
perspective tool does that it's you know
it forms a perspective crop it
restructures your image to the
perspective you want
so typically good on actually when you
yuri proportion in the perspective of an
image slash to openly bother word that's
a legacy tool for saving out images in
multiple sections on a photo or rather
you typically on our web image with lots
of icons on them not even going to
bother with that eyedropper tool your
foreground color you can click and then
you can you only got the eyedropper tool
then you can see you can select any part
of the image to select the color that's
in the image or the eyedropper tool here
which is the latter i brings it up and
you can you can select it that way when
you click the eyedropper or you first
play you chose the position you're
currently out to the bottom half and
then if you drag away so we started at
white will drag over to here into the
pinky area / play area you can see the
top shown where you now currently are
just kind of a health or i guess but
people that want to start somewhere and
then see the difference visually so you
know you click where you started and
then you drag away so the bottom one
here the see the green or the purple
it's it's this color here so I set this
foreground to red say and then I was
going to click over here you see the
bottoms red trim in my current color and
as you're dragging that just kind of
showing you the difference which is
helpful when you kind of just tweak your
color but in essence the eyedropper tool
just simply selects your foreground
color and I believe you can probably
control click alt click to select your
background color as well it's that's
that tool good for you know selecting a
color based on an image the only other
one on green go through in this tool
list here is really the ruler and the
only reason for that is
if you draw a rule align again based on
a level let's say we wanted to that slum
this image then that wanted to be like
the horizon you click that and then you
click straighten layer and it would
rotate your image to be on that horizon
and now if we wanted to straighten it
back not that you do this you typically
do it wasn't straight we draw that line
across the land there I drill there the
horizon and click straighten layer and
it will straighten and we drop to that
layer that's that's kind of the only
reason I showed the ruler tools got that
little useful feature in there next fun
bit these are now healing tools this is
really a new section of definitely yet
yeah touching up a photo or you're
trying to repair a photo or do things so
this image doesn't really suit you for
that so let's just open up another one
so I've got a picture me in not even
sure where that is to be honest tenerife
maybe and we have the good thing about
this picture it's got quite a few things
that I show off wants to cut a
background out too as you can see this
photo is accidentally not focused on me
I'm blurred it's focused on kind of
these signs and there's trash can over
here but this is going to show a perfect
scenario for a lot of these tools coming
up so one of them is this whole section
here is about tweaking a photo so
removing elements they wanted to remove
the bin over here or we wanted to remove
the sign or we wanted to you know Eddie
the image of you will dock to the image
will most there's a bunch of tools that
do all this so I'll start with the first
one this is the Spot Healing Brush tool
and the simplest thing is to show you in
action so we'll zoom in on the signpost
click and hold and then drag and kind of
paint in if you will the sign and then
let go and you can see magically it's
disappeared and it's not a perfect job
you can if you've got a keen eye you can
kind of clearly see this outline here
and you can also if you've got a really
good eye you'll see that this is one
kind of Bush when the Bush behind
there's not that kind
Dovie zoom out and then we own didn't
read it this is quite hard to spot if
you're not actually looking for that to
be there originally you probably
wouldn't even notice it most people
wouldn't spot this kind of artifact here
so you can do that you can try to like
the the trash come here and fill it out
and let go and then it's gone again you
know so you can use that tool and that's
kind of a click and scribble over and
let go and it's sort of mostly automated
so you get what you get
The Healing Brush tool if you click
first you'll see that it says the the
alt define source has not been specified
so what this means is now say I want to
be more accurate and as we saw when we
first filled in or first remove the sign
if we just jump back to the old one if
we remove the sign as we did before you
can see how this is really the wrong
bush and so is this area so if you want
more control of that you can go to the
Healing Brush tool hold the Alt key and
click here because what we want to do is
we first want to remove this part of the
sign with the Bush here so we're gonna
click the place where we want this bit
to be removed from based on if you will
so it once looks similar to this Bush so
we'll hold alt and click and now we'll
let go volton will simply wipe over
where we want to kind of remove and then
there you go
then you'll all turn click here is your
new source who wanna now fill in this
inner area with the Bush similar to that
one and you can see it started to fill a
sign back in so let go and click again
and then you'll get used to this tool
you can see let's kind of fill the
angled there and then finally this stick
will all click next to it here and then
we'll wipe the stick away and there you
go now you've got this little artifact
he looks a bit mixed between the two so
you can go over it again I'll click in
there go over that but again and I'll
click up here and then redo that a
little but again you can you can play
around what now if we go back usually
that's a lot more of a natural blend you
probably wouldn't notice that 90% of
people probably won't notice that in
your change so we undid all it well to
be honest people would when I've just
noticed where it was we undo you'll see
you've got these dots here that we've
missed as we zoom out you're kind of see
the dots but obviously then you just go
back in click here and you carry on
working on it you know to get rid of of
your dots
but yeah in in general that's a more
controlled way of removing a you know
something from the backgrounds there's
in out and it's pretty pretty accurate
we then also have the option of a patch
tool so these are all basically the same
jobs they're just different different
ways of doing its whatever your flavor
is or whatever you your level of control
needed s so a patch tool works like and
the reason it's called the patches
imagine you have a pair of jeans that
are ripped and you want to patch the
hole up you typically take a patch from
say here I don't les Bosher this isn't
my patch now I want to put the patch
over that's been here and you can to
replace what you do the other way around
so what you first do is you select the
bin and then you drag over to the area
that you want to take a patch from that
looks most similar to the area and
obviously you drag and drop and there's
the bin gone but the problem with the
patch tool as you can see is you get a
fairly harsh line which you can also fix
another way but also the area that
you're dragging and dropping from has to
really match the whole area because
we're not selecting part of this butch
part of this repeating part of that
there we're simply saying take the
entire area and patch it with this area
and use it as a content-aware patch so
it works a lot better when the the area
that you're trying to remove has a lot
of similar things around so for example
this bit of wound here that's a
different call it's awfully real but say
we wanted to remove that we could get
the patch tool dragged around it and
that because it's really warm not all to
be for the most part like this mounting
we can click and drag around and select
an entire mountain and it does a much
better job of removing an area where you
can you know select the entire section
in one go of a similar color so that's
again another tool of just editing
things and removing things and you'll
find that certain ones of these all work
better for different sections so for the
most part the Healing Brush tool will be
acceptable in almost every situation the
patch tool when there's a lot of similar
area around it's a big chunk and the
Spot Healing Brush is I guess the one
you start with like you go oh let's get
rid of this bin just
color it in fill it all in there and let
go and there's your starting point and
then you might go well that's not quite
good enough I'll go to me healing brush
I'll click mostly this bushy I say and
remove that and try and get rid there it
would probably bring them into this book
shop and fill in and a bit of this one
and you can kinda work your magic a bit
more controlled your your in you know
control of of how you blend it so you
can see there that's where it is and
then gone so I think so entirely up to
you how you remove it then we have one
more which is the content aware move so
this is as it suggests I guess if you
want to move something slightly so you
want to move this bin from here to over
here then you could try and cut and
paste it and instead this tool is again
meant to be content to where it tries to
blend the edges in and also fill in the
original place so we select the bin we
want to move that bin from this part to
say over here and we let go and it's
tried to press Enter and then it's tried
to to fill that area in with content
aware and blend it into this area here
and again it's not gone too bad of a job
so you can see it was there no it's
there so it's not done a bad job at all
some things that'll help is one is
obviously a much more accurate selection
so we don't want to use this clicking
drug you know single hold and try and
drag all around you can go to your
normal lasso tools let's say a polygon
tool and make your selection first and
you can make a you know really accurate
selection if you want another little
shoe bracket I won't waste time doing
that book you know you can make a lot
more accurate selection then you can go
back to your tool and now you're already
in a selection so now we can just use
that selection and drag it over here and
press Enter
you can see then absolutely it's doing a
feathering of the background so it's
expecting a bit of background than what
it's done that is blue too much so you
can undo that you could then go say
select modify expand our selection by
say
and 20 pixels maybe that's too much
select modify expand 10 pixels still too
much probably then 5 pixels and then
we'll move it with a 5 pixel but
accurate background to be blended in and
you can see that just started cutting
into the bins we probably on 6 or 7
pixels but that's kind of the move tool
that you can use and that does basically
kofta paste content away merge and then
it also tries to fill this in so then
this is not very accurately filled in so
you could jump back go to your Spot
Healing tool I'll click there start
filling this out you in with a bit more
accurate color or click here get rid of
the blurriness there or click in the
bush next to it and you can deform in
your own your own fill a house I'm not
in a very good job here but you got
appointment you can continue to work and
then make it look like something's
elsewhere so all those tools are really
aimed at you know doctoring images
modifying images and removing things and
that's all that section there so now
we'll go back to simply drawing things
so the next line of tools is your kind
of your artistic area you just you brush
using your pencils so there's many
options here there's many different
brushes you can use and this drop-down
at the top a lot of presets and again
I'm not a not an artist by any means so
I pretty much rarely use these that's
right just click the brush and then away
you go you can now start making some
squiggles right click you can change the
size of your brush you can go smaller
and go much larger you know big brush
the hardness you can increase rather way
up to turn it to almost like a pencil so
that's the amount of anti-aliasing and
anti-aliasing is the blend here so if
using writers on an image that's anti
aliased which basically means smoothed
out instead of having a harsh solid
black line you can see the pixels right
next to it start fading out to
transparent so you've got solid black
here then say 50% 20% temp 75% and it
does that anti-aliasing this the
smoothing of the edge
so that when you look at it it's it
looks clear it looks you know blended if
we were to select the pencil from that
same list and you can zoom in you see
has absolutely no anti-aliasing it's all
solid black exact solid black it's
that's the main difference between the
pencil and the brush the hardness is
then really the amount of anti-aliasing
so the less hard it is the more
anti-aliasing you're getting and that's
what this blurred looking edges that's
still anti-aliasing so it's the exact
same thing but it we put Harless up to
100 this is much less of it so it's only
on 2 pixels or 3 pixels there so you've
got 3 pixels around the aliasing as
opposed you know a lot more when the
hardness is less so hardness of 0 is
really soft so that means that by the
time Europe your point of your cursor
right in the center it instantly starts
fading out over a longer you know period
of time so in that looks like basically
a blurry line the anti-aliasing has
really the hardness in this case and
it's just the amount of breathin with a
hundred percent hardness on a bra she
gets up so that's that's what that is
all the options at the top here flow is
the amount of times the brush hits if
you will that doesn't great there when
it's on you know high hardness but when
you lower the hardness you can kind of
see it blends in better so it's again
this is all artistic features of UL
smoothing is the attempt to if you draw
a curve you can see there's a slight lag
behind where I'm drawing and where the
black actually trails and that's due to
the smoothing so if we increase the
smoothing to 100% you'll really see the
difference a nice dog drew and look at
the the lag behind the mouse and what
it's trying to do is my Sara shaky hand
and I'm using a graphics tablet and I'm
like shaking like this you can see it
tries to remove you know a lot of my
wobbly try to smooth out the wobble if
we do zero smoothing and then I do the
same thing it gets every single movement
of my mouth doesn't smooth anything out
as opposed the full smoothness smoothing
a lot of it out too
a natural you know curve so it's more
again that's something you'll feel as
you play with it it's it's kind of
making your your line smoother as
opposed you having to try and do the
same line yourself and you can kind of
see it there where it's not really
smooth so that's that's the options for
the brush but really the brush and the
pencil are just same thing about the
pencils solid no anti-aliasing even with
the hardness down it's you know it's not
a 90 alias so that the hardness isn't
directly anti-aliasing it's simply
related to it on the brush but like I
say I'm not an artist I don't really use
these areas of Photoshop much other than
simply you know selecting a color
drawing a line type thing and I want a
brochure on to be smooth I got a pencil
ever want to be harsh that's that's
about it it's that you kind of your arty
bits done like as I'm totally I'm not
hot guy in any means color replacement
tool if we go to say rusty and we want
to turn his leg the same color as these
green leaves press I like to select
color dropper click the green and then
we would go to the core placement tool
which is B and then we would click and
drag around and we can turn all of his
body the same color so it's kind of a
color overlay that's again really as
much as I'm bothered about that tool
then really ever use that one mixer
brush you'll simply see that from using
right click that's a biggish brush and
you can see we do this and it's like an
artistic smudging of course so you
wouldn't usually use this on a photo
you'd actually use this if you were
graphically design you know drawing
somewhat and you want smudge from colors
together it's kind of what's going on
there
so that's the color mixer then next up
is clone stamp again rarely ever use
these
we Alton click an area say green and
then we start cloning out over here so
all its really doing is it's giving you
an origin that you'd start ah say you
wanted to know maybe I'll show better on
there so it wants to clone that bin
almost and it again it wouldn't work in
this situation directly or clone the
sign if you Alton click the sign in the
center wherever you start drawing now
you can see this signs about to reappear
and you can sort of click and draw a
sign there so it's similar to the
doctoring tools up here but in a
slightly different fashion
so it's where you click and then start
drawing so now up and carry on I can alt
click there and draw another post over
here sort of thing that's the point of I
guess calling that clone stamp piece you
pick a point and then you you then start
filling in where things were so you
click around the bin go over here and
start filling in a bin and it uses like
content to we're blending and you can
see that's actually worked better than
the original tool so now we have three
signpost and two bins that actually Luke
part of the scenery fairly accurately
other than obviously this color bush
here that's not same color but again
that's the clone stamp pattern stamp you
just select a pattern up here and then
instead of it being part of your image
you're now drawing a pattern whereas the
clone stamp the pattern is your image
itself wherever you alt and click is
then you know there's a tree and then
every time you do you have to alt click
again there's another tree so you know
you get the gist of that that's similar
to your sort of doctrine tools their
history brush simply erases what wasn't
there
so because we drew this if we did a
history brush on it we can get back to
the original thing that was underneath
there before we edited the photo that's
useful for say now we've done that but
we want to reduce we want to remove this
edge back to the original works that
were behind there so it's like say a
smallish brush and we'd actually click
around and remove this bit back to its
original
color the bits that we don't feel blend
in very well you can sort of use that
tool to go back in time just at the set
points where you know you want it to be
so I'd kind of do that that bear a bit
around the edge and then you'd zoom out
and we undead to show before us before
that's after in kind of see
yes useful for doing that to blend that
in even more art history brush that's
again it goes back in time but using
this style and this is again an artistic
style
I'm not specific or familiar with it in
any way but you'll see what happens when
you want to do instead of it on doing by
default it's panel as we had brush undo
and I've actually got way too big of a a
brush on that to show or the effect has
but basically this is a I'm sure related
to some kind of way that people that do
paintings for a living that understand
that do like it a way that they
typically try and go back in history and
arrays what they've done by smudging
more paint over as well I'm guessing
next is now your eraser tools so again
similar to the previous ones the history
tool Boggs done that he raised a tool
you click to erase and all this doing is
filling in with your background color so
you press X to swap back and he raised
it now he raises with that background
color so it's really the eraser tool is
just the most part you brush so press B
and we got a brush off we select the
original brush you got your brush there
if we were to match the size of you will
and invert the thing we're doing the
brush the eraser is almost like you're
brushing me vertices it's the brush but
with the background color not the
foreground
there's obviously not exactly that book
you can got to think of it it's like
just brushing over with the background
color then we have a background eraser
so this is where this fit comes into
play so a background eraser will similar
to like your selection tools that were
trying to select based on similar pixels
the background eraser will automatically
try to find the edge so we clicked here
it would presume this is where we want
to start in the blue and the circle is
everything we want to remove so we
collect you can see it removes but if we
hover over an area where there's a
difference in color and click you can
see it stopped at this line where the
tolerance of 17% in this case the
difference in colors is more than 17%
it's now stopped and not removed you
know anything beyond that so again
you'll get used to this tool but what
you'd either do is usually make fairly
big brush drag along with the edge where
you want to remove click hold and just
drag and kind of remove the start of the
background like that and then you would
press out for the lasso and select the
rest of it go off and kind of delete
like that to remove your background or
what I tend to do is you would have the
background eraser tool where you go
right click and make a whopping big
brush and then just click once and you
can guys see it starts a raising their
you'd say a tolerance obviously cuz
that's not high enough until it raises
the background fully without really
taking out any of your foreground so
that's what you can kinda do for amazing
a background just click and drag around
and so I'll remove that's one way of
removing the background the other way is
with the magic eraser tool which if we
click here you can see does a similar
job but there's no there's no brush this
time there's no circle of where to
remove it simply starts here where we
click and then expands out like a
selection does based on the tolerance of
where to arrays so we change told us to
say 60 up here and click it's going to
start where if we put the cap locks on
you'll see it a pinpoint if you want to
be accurate cut blocks off you get a
funny icon but basically it's the tip of
the eraser it's the if I use this icon
over here and just screenshot tool so I
can point to it for you it's basically
this tip right here so
right there so when were raising were
looking at say I wanted to touch the tip
of this mountain it's this tip here
right at the tip or the very top right
corner there to be that tip and if you
press the or rather it's the bottom tip
there isn't it if you toggle between
caps locks and not you'll see where the
icons touching but in general you don't
need to be that accurate that tool
that's why you see you know the icon so
if I clicked here it simply picked the
blue and expand all around until
tolerance was met so again we'd increase
the tolerance to say 90 which is quite
high and cliff now you can see there's a
blue haze so you could just simply click
again to remove the haze and keep
clicking and hold the click and drag if
you wanted to really try and remove and
that I finds a better tool for
background eraser than the actual
background eraser so it's the same job
it's just that the background eraser
tool has a defined area that it's going
to be raised whereas the magic eraser
simply starts at where you click and
expands outwards indefinitely until the
tolerance has met so now with that
background removed let's see how to put
of a job it's done let's copy and paste
in rusty drag him to the layer below and
we are now have a giant dog in the
background of our scene so you can see
it's done it you know a really decent
job of cutting out the edge of the
mountain
you know it's that's pretty accurate we
even got the little building still in
there so you know that's that's amazing
backgrounds boy or do all the erasers in
general right what else do we have stuff
the arrays has done now under gradient
fills this is nice and easy click and
drag a line and you fill with your
foreground and background color so that
is your foreground and background change
to black on white with X and you're
filling with black and white you start
where you click with your foreground
color you end with your background color
you can change the mode up here to
radial
so you start in the center and radiate
out you can do this kind of radial and
spinning so you click here which is the
center and then when you drag out to
doesn't matter you can drag a tiny line
it expands out indefinitely but what it
does is it starts here and goes
anti-clockwise around and basically it
starts with your
background color or you could say the
opposite weight starts to the 4 gram
call here and goes clockwise and
basically as it's been around 360
degrees it blends between and you get
this kind of radial effect everything
got mirrored gradients so it starts and
you know goes outwards that way and
outwards the other way and then you've
got like a radial pattern but with more
of a a square like a star so that's that
the only option I'd mentioned in these
gradients is by default I'm sure people
have seen banding before in a gradient
so when you fade from a color similar to
another color so we go a black similar
to another black and we drag and expand
you typically see what's called banding
in these colors but Photoshop
automatically removes them but tries to
visually remove the banding and that's
what this option called dither
so if we uncheck dither and did a raw
gradient so a true value from
start-to-finish now can you see all
these bands of color which I'm sure you
can't go in diagonally like this and
this is because naturally the difference
between our color here which is 98 so I
guess we have from here 98 to our ended
color of 0 there's 98 options of color
so there's only 98 bands that could
happen so you'll find that was 98
stripes going from the star point to the
end point that's because there are only
256 colors of black in this documents
because we're in an 8-bit document which
means now by default there's the start
color and then one called pixel off one
pixel off one pixel off and you get this
visual banding that happens and that's
because that's the true color and that's
how it we visually do see it what the
dealer does is he changes that so when
we drag a gradient it's not really the
exact colors let me zoom in now you
can't see any banding and after zoom in
really close and you still struggle to
see anything and that's because it
differs the solid lines and to more of a
blurred natural easy on the eye color so
it looks like it's a smooth gradient but
if you want accuracy and you're actually
after a very specific band to go
from you know your court at the finish
color then you don't want to uncheck
dither it's not the enemy important
option there so now we'll move on to
more of the photo editing I'd say these
are these are not really digital works
these are what you're typically doing
real photos and we've got three here got
blur sharpen and smudge so they sound
fairly obvious again perfect example
would be this photo where I'm actually
blurred so we zoom in blue would first
blur something out so obviously we
picked say and is better doing it from a
distance we picked all this nice sharp
Bush area here clicked and dragged
multiple times and you can see it's
blurring everyone did you'd see original
Valery's original blurry so it literally
does what it says it blurs out you
right-click you can change it your brush
is normal it's always applied to the
brush and you can also change the
strength of the blur how quickly it
blurs so 100% will instantly blur you
know one clicking it's 100% blurred
basically based on the the value so you
typically have a soft blue if you will
there's not many times you want to
actually blur something she often does
the opposite so perfect isn't will be on
my face that's actually blurred quite a
lot if we were to click and simply rub
over a lot I guess you can see it's
actually brought if you go too far
you'll get this sharp area here where
the colors have come out so if we
undoing we do that again and maybe not
go quiet arsh and we do that now a man
or look great at first
but if we were to zoom out and then undo
before we get it you can see it's
definitely improved the sharpness so you
can see it's like tried to bring it into
focus so that's why the sharp tool does
obviously you show up and someone that's
already show up like these bushes and
you right the extreme you'll see what
it's basically doing is almost a
contrast it's it's just bringing up the
contrast so then as you drag it over you
can see that it gets harsher that's last
color separation everybody does that in
order to
obviously give you the sharpness so you
can see so you want to show up in this
mountain you could go over it and then
you wouldn't do can't really there you
go you can tell them that there's a
shock and one unsharpened show up and
the mountain about I guess and then when
it's finished undo redo so you can see
there these areas here the reason they
stand out is because the contrast has
been increased so there's a difference
between these bits and you know the bits
behind but it gives the visual
indication of a sharper mountain now
like it's more in focus so you can use
that sparingly of you will earn them
finally smudge what does it sound like
it smudges which again is scary
sometimes but again you might want to
use that for something so there's my
smudge and that's it for those three
next three are really regarding color of
an image and so we have three tools
again dodge burn and sponge so the Dodge
the way I'd explain it is well the first
thing is you simply click select
something and draw and see what happens
and what would you say is happening now
your first thing would say oh that's got
brighter and some might go well that's
got greener if you look at the greens
they seem to be getting greener so what
I believe happens with the Dodge is it
increases both the brightness and the
saturation and by saturation I mean the
amount of color so we did it on the
whole image press control you to bring
the hue and saturation if we will
increase the whole brown as the image
and the whole saturation you can see if
we balanced it about right and we focus
mainly on this area probably less
brightness but more saturation say about
there and you focused on what that looks
like so before and after and we escape
and then we do the Dodge to me that's
exactly what it looks like it's like
it's increase the brightness in the
saturation so the Dodge say brings up
both the brightness and the color at the
same time to kind of basically bring
your photo up to life
you can tweak that again with the amount
of exposure the amount of strength of ul
of how it does it and you can also
select what tones so say my faces and
darkness here and I want to bring just
the darkness out I can select the
shadows as the range now I want to bring
the shadows out and then I drag around
my face and there my face is now out of
shadow so I undo redo you can see I
brought my face out of the shadow
because I've selected specifically to
bring the shadows out then I could go
back to mid-tone and bring my entire
face even more out of the general shadow
altogether so there's the original
there's the the new of your well officer
really badly done but you get the point
so dodge brings up the brightness in the
saturation burn does the exact opposite
so burn will actually go darker and less
saturated so it loads of saturation and
it lowers the brightness so you get dark
so you typically use this in the
opposite scenario where say something's
burnt out or too bright so you might say
my shirt it's too bright there and you
want to just gently bring it down a bit
and then if you undid there's the first
and there's the brought down and you can
see we gain more detail on the top and
we don't get as much burn out it looks
you know brings the general tone of the
old picture together again you can do
the same thing you could burn the
highlights only so you could just burn
the whites but then you see you kind of
lose the natural blend or you could burn
the shadows to make the shadows even
darker and completely hide me face but
typically you'd work on mid-tones for
the most part for you know both of the
tools and then we have the last one
sponge this is purely gonna work on and
definitely does work on just the color
the saturation so the saturation here is
off to the amount of color no saturation
is gray loads of saturation stick stream
pretty much red greens and blues only
for the most part so that's what
saturation is we didn't now has the
amount of color and a picture well
saturation as a generic word simply
means how much of something I guess but
the sponge has two modes one is saturate
and one's desaturate by default your
desaturate
so it's like to a sponge and brush size
rather and say I wanted to make this
sign lose all its green you'd kinda
click and drag and after you make your
selection perfect but you can see now
there's no color in that sign it's
completely black and white so you can do
that anyway I could say do it on that
tree and you just want to get rid of the
color on the tree people sometimes use
this have you got yellow teeth on a
photo so I think man look fairly white
there but you'd say select a very
accurate small brush or I'd do it a lot
more accurate but then you go over your
teeth first to D saturate any yellow so
there's no yellow at all and then you go
back and you would dodge and go lower
select highlight while mid-tones would
probably hit there fine low exposure so
it's nice and gentle and you'd start to
kind of whiten your teeth gradually and
then you zoom out in your calendar
there's the original and that is your
white teeth sort of thing so I know a
lot of people use kind of a a sponge to
get rid of any color and then use the
other tools to brighten areas back up
accurately you've got the opposite as
well obviously got saturate so you have
to add more color back to something you
can you know specifically sponge an area
and give it color so it's all tool thing
that you know tweaking things these
tools I guess would be used when you're
doing your your normal graphic art as
well you could have you doing real
artwork where you actually you know
you're drawing something with brushes
and you want to tweak areas I guess
you'd use it there as well so that's
that area pens I'm not going to go over
because this brings us into the field of
vector art and I don't want to touch
that in this you know basic video so up
next a really simple tool text tool so
you click the text type some text and
then click when your in text in order to
get out or you can you can drag around
away from the text but I tend to first
get back into the move tool by clicking
softer you press V when you're typing to
actually just gonna tap the letter V so
you have to click to get out to that and
then you press T again
to get back to the text selection tool
and because we already got it selected
down here we can now get back to the
menu to select the color and then we
click up here change the color to
whatever we want
and that's the text tool so again you
just play with that you'll figure it out
so get your move tool you can drag your
text around it's on its own way or a
special layer that's a text type layer
press T to get to your text tool and you
can then alter things change their the
font to whatever font you want you can
click drop down and see a visual of all
the fonts and you can hover over and
change them so you can do what you want
their font size if you want it bigger
than 72 just simply click in and type it
more like 300 point and the way you go
you can do that you want to change the
size of anything pictures things you've
drawn anything ctrl + T will open up a
transform box just like a crop box if
you will and you have the transform all
around it that's now you can drag you
can even invert by going the opposite
way hold shift is normal it'll keep the
proportion so it grows in size and then
if you go near the edges you can rotate
as well if you want to change the point
of rotation so you want to rotate say in
the center of the P you see this little
in fact we go to a standard screen so
you can see easier type some text drag
it to there so we want to rotate this on
the center of this P see there's a lot
of center PC it click and drag it and
put it in the center of the P and now
any will take commands happen around
that point so you can rotate so far and
then say now I want to rotate around
Center the O and then do that so that's
what that bits about you can drag that
way drag from corner and then you can
hold shift to keep the aspect ratio
press ENTER to finish or escape to
cancel and that's kind of that's the
transform tool I don't know it isn't
this menu to be honest I never now I use
the menu provided press ctrl T so it's
probably in something like edit yeah
editing them free transform so that's
the transform tool and the text tool at
same time you hold click and you can
change the vertical type as well
so he goes that way but again really
self-explanatory not much to to say
about laughs you got text aligns where
you want them to a line based on where
you're typing you've got your color your
text obviously and you've got these
styles of being able to do stuff with
your text on aux and things but again
not really much to explain there drop
back to that these are related to vector
stuff again your pen tools so we know
that we have the hand tool which is just
the move which is the spacebar
we got the magnifying glass we've
already done so really the only thing
left is these custom shapes for the the
general software really that you know
the major overview so if you click the
custom tool you've got rectangle tools
you can also see here this is a thing to
be aware of so we now want to draw
pixels on here so even if we had a brush
we have a pencil we have tools nothing
you can see how we got this cross out
that's not allowing us to do anything in
every click I'll say the text all the
well the type of lay needs to be
rasterized rasterize means converted
from it a path a vector line which is
what text is to a pixel layer so without
going into detail about that rather non
rousted content so vector content in
this case can grow indefinitely so as
large as you want it you can zoom as
much as you like and the only reason
this is showing pics like this because
this is the pixels of your image which
is a raster image book say we have this
font type here and we just have the
letter T because it's a vector it's it's
based on mathematical lines not based on
an actual pixel later you can change
this to 3000 and you can still see it's
still perfectly smooth it never goes
blurry so a vector like says a really
quick and short introduction is a shape
based on mathematical curves now I
simply click the pen and show you that
you can like create a curve like this
and join them together and there's your
sort of visual vector outline that now I
can grow indefinitely or say oh I made
it really small
yes a original was that size and then I
transform it doesn't matter how large
grow it ultimately these curves and
mathematical values to the perfectly you
can zoom in and then as far as you can
go and they're still perfectly smooth
the based on mathematical equations and
that's what vector files are that's
where you find images that can you know
definitely low goes from flat icons that
can resize indefinitely but I don't want
to do that in this video so back to the
point of when we were about to draw on a
layer with a rectangular brush you get
this got a block out symbol if you will
saying that you can't do it is because
the current lane were on is a vector
layer so we can either click the way
below that sarasu layer and then be able
to draw shapes or what it's offering if
you're tryna drawn this line you click
and you click OK
it converts the text now to an actual
rusted Laius this is now just you can't
type it it's not text anymore it's
physically brush marked if you will if
you want to think of it though it's
actual solid contents and we know
expanded this up you'd see that the
actual text starts to get blurry so it's
lost its detail as it's growing it's
getting less detail so it's aroused it
that way it's converted it into from a
vector text file down there to a raster
layer so typically if you're going to do
somewhat on a layman you get this check
out what layer on and make sure your
honor you know a fresh layer if you want
to control shift then or you're on an
expected layer so back to the tool the
rectangle tool you can see up here we
have the option pixel shape and path
again pixels are exactly that the draw
and the physical dots of color a path is
vector again what you don't want to go
too much into but then it's indefinitely
scalable without ever losing detail and
a shape is then a special type of layer
which again I don't want to go into in
this tutorial so typically just keep it
2 pixels nothing really else to explain
anti-alias as you know it's the
smoothing of the edges
change that to default we have a black
rectangle fairly self-explanatory
rounded rectangle the only difference is
you specify the radius
how much you wanted to have a rounded
corner 150 gets a big one zero just
means it's a square rectangle like the
other one so that's the rounded
rectangle tool ellipse tool as you
guessed it it's a circle or obviously an
ellipse it can be a circle and ellipse
hold shift and you'll get a perfect
circle let go and you can just go any
lips of any shape mode is that layer
modes went to those in this video either
polygon is any sides of a shape so right
now it's a five-sided shape your 50
sided shape which obviously looks more
like a circle because of our accurate it
is but if you zoomed in you kinda just
about see there's a line there's a line
but you can basically make any side each
shape you want 12 sided shape dough add
a kahin dream is that I think 10 sided
shape so again self-explanatory line
tool just draws a line as it says pretty
easy but useful and custom shapes then
give you this option up here to have
some built in shapes that are built into
Photoshop they can draw a few things you
can click the settings here and click
all and then okay to replace it with all
the built-in symbols which is a few more
not on rely useful to be honest but I
sometimes just use the arrow at least to
you know quickly draw an arrow so I
think that really covers the bulk of the
default tools and the you know the
majority use tools in Photoshop and I
know it's been a lot to cover them in
one video and that's why it's kind of
just a brief overview of each tool but
it gives you a real kind of visual and
good explanation of what's possible in
Photoshop so now you you've seen most of
all the tools you can and know what can
be done with them you know what they're
trying to do and then you can you can
learn more about specific topics or
eventually I'll do videos on specific
tools but I thought this was the best
way to give you a an understanding of
for the most part the whole of the
Photoshop tools
as obviously still things like filters
for filtering your images and doing cool
things with them
so I'll just brush over that super quick
but basically go filter filter gallery
and that's decides to open down here we
zoom out so you can see the picture and
then you got a ton of like styles you
can do a colored pencil style and it'll
visually show you this let me just
shrink this image down it's a bit big
for the doing the filter so in fact let
me show you that if you want to alter
the size of this image so right now we
do ctrl alt and I it will pop up the
image size dialog which I believe is
just image and image size right now it's
5400 pixels by 3600 so we can change it
to 10% of that if we wanted by doing 10
and it'll be 546 click OK
and then ctrl alt + 0 to zoom and that's
now my entire picture so I'll zoom in
you can see it's really blurry now so
just quickly resize the image but that
now allows me to go to filter filter
gallery just for this demo purposes and
show you the filters being applied
really quick so it's a little bit small
maybe let's just do it say 20% filter
filter gallery and then like say there's
all these got their own options you can
play with them I just wanted to give you
a show of what can be done and you can
do a lot of cool things with filters you
can flick through some of them like
plastic wrap make it look like it's
wrapped in plastic and you can change
the smoothness and level of detail to
make it more crispy or whatever you can
literally just play play with these
settings but some of these effects are
really cool
some of them you can make cartoony so I
poster edges you can try and make it
like a cartoon posterize it so there's
not many amounts of color and you know
you can have a play with them but this
is another powerful option in in
Photoshop there the whole filter gallery
where there's just loads and loads of
options to do all kinds of things and
you could learn these for years doing
different kinds of effects and things so
I certainly won't weed in them in this
video but I just wanted to give you a
visual show of what you know
all these filters kind of looked like in
general and can do and then it might
give you some ideas or it might spark an
interest in thinking you can make use of
them for something so there's all the
kind of filters might end up just flick
through them as a cool mosaic one they
can make really small mosaics with thin
edges and then convert the image to like
a mosaic so that's the filters
I take goes on forever there's lots of
options but I thought that was a a good
starter into Photoshop so I figure I
know it's been a long video but let's
put everything we've just done into some
kind of practical use I think and let's
make the whole point of why there this
video is I'm making a email verification
template so I'm making a little web
template that when you get an email it's
actually to verify your accounts and we
want this for the facetted word
application so that's kind of the point
of that's what we're gonna do and then I
thought well instead of just making it
in Photoshop and then showing you how to
make the webpage a lot of you have asked
before how would you actually make them
in Photoshop so you can have a lot break
you if you want of it playback of the
videos and then we'll just get straight
into now making a template like it
mocking up a website templates and it's
not hard it's only going to take us 5-10
minutes anyway but you'll then see how I
actually do it so you'll see how I've
produced it and I'll thought it through
and I'll play over there and it's it
couldn't be any simple it's a really
basic templates but now you should be
able to to follow along and actually do
that so take a breather a second then
we'll get straight into it
so let's start then with file new or if
you remember rightly ctrl + n to pop up
a new dialog I'm just gonna start with
2000 by 2000 just it fits on my screen
fairly nicely control Alton's you o
presume in so I want my email template
to have a color scheme so right now we
do ctrl + L go to get angel 6 for set a
word resources logo we're gonna use this
logo and this logo so ctrl click and
then open them both cuz you've got them
both in a new tab
so we're gonna use this kind of logo I'd
say you would probably want pick either
a blue or a green for a background so
let's just click the foreground color
click a green and I'll go to Canada in
green somewhere around here maybe click
OK and then ultimate of a crowned so
this is like an email it's just come in
it's gonna be all green and then we'll
probably want our logo so go to our logo
control a to select all ctrl C to copy
ctrl V to paste and then go back to the
old logo and close the document so now
you can see we've got our logo on a new
layer here that can hide in shell don't
know where we want it yet but certainly
then once it that big so ctrl + T and
then hold shift and reduce to you know
reasonable size probably about that and
press Enter now I want to centralize
this over the whole document so what you
can do with that you can see a ruler
here have you ever got that ctrl + R
toggles that rule runnin off a bit of a
graphics glitch the aerbook there's
their ruler so with it on you can go to
this side of the ruler anywhere on this
edge clicking it and dragging your link
at this line and as you hover you go
slowly you should see see that snap
there so see how it's on the center of
my cursor and then it gets closed now me
cursors further to the right of that
line and further to the left you can see
it was like it's stuck just lightly and
you can see at the top here it's stuck
it in almost 14 inches and you can see
the documents almost 28 inches so we
know that's the center line so if we
hover close to the center and then it
snaps now you let go now you've got this
blue line that we can now just drag this
logo into and it will automatically snap
on the center line so now we've got this
nice center line to visibly align stuff
ctrl + H will hide the center line and
show the center line you know once you
you don't want it there visibly ctrl H
to hide it and so we'll hide it out the
way for now
so I'm thinking a logo there we also
need some text so press T and then
there's an example we know we're gonna
say verify email you can't see that
right now because
it's in green it's in the same color
foreground so we've typed to click the
move tool to get out to that press T to
get back to text now select the color
change it to white text I always use
quick son with a minute that's my new
favorite font change it to that the size
looks a bit big so I can either click up
there to move ctrl T to scale and drag
it down or I could set an exact size
ctrl H to show the center line again and
kind of drag it to the center this is
where the center of the texts are press
T to get to text if you were left
aligned then when you drag him it's
going to align to the left of the text
specifically right there it's not gonna
try and snap to the center so that you
need your text on central line and then
drag and it snaps there you can sort of
see there the snap and as you're
dragging you'll see the you know the
Lions opinion so you know there's the
center line in fact I probably don't
just want the text on the green I could
do but we'll see let me finish it off so
the first thing I do is we can to chuck
everything in that I know I need so
we'll go to the other image ctrl a ctrl
C to copy
close it down paste it into here with
control V drag it down here somewhere as
well as we do to the size like this
which will scale as you can see
downwards you'll also notice the center
line is almost perfectly Center so
instead of holding shift and dragging I
believe you can hold ctrl or is it all
shift so you hold alt and shift and else
he'll actually scale based on this point
as well this where you put your center
of transform so those properties want to
be small press ENTER ctrl H to hide that
if you want to move something so free
move like this you want to move
something say directly up down left or
right if you hold shift before you start
the move and then you move now this is
fixed moving up or down that's the only
place that will move so I start by
dragging left then it's locked in the
left and right axis so because it's up
here it's on the center line but I want
to move it up or down I just hold shift
and then start dragging down and now
it'll move down out away
the verify email I've already got the
text it's already centered it's already
the right font so to save time what I
typically do is hold alt and press down
arrow and that will let you see down
here duplicate the layer so right on do
you can see it's duplicating me layer
and it's moved it down one pixel so i
zoom in that's on done all turned down
its duplicated my layer and moved it
down one pixel so if I now hold alt
again that's so you shift again and drag
down you can see there's now my second
copy if you will so I'll drag that down
to the center press T select alt text or
control like and then we'll make some
fake text so thanks for creating account
with us to continue please verify your
email with us click out of it up there
press T to get back to text and this
time we'll change the font down so
that's not only too bad actually
72 click in again I've noticed a space
there so that's kind of the info we also
need a bottom but I think this just been
on all green kind of gets lost so what
we'll probably do is I think what we'll
do is make like a piece of paper has a
the emails written on a piece of paper
so we go down here to say the bottom
layer background control shift and n to
make a new layer so we've got the press
M to select the marquee shift and M
because Ron circle so we get back to
rectangle I'm just going to draw a rough
shape like that say and then just
control and Mac space because you want
it filled white which is the background
color I'll fill it white ctrl + D to
deselect V to jump back to the move tool
and now we need to change these two text
to black instead of white so in the text
layer you can change them both at the
same time just either hold ctrl and
click both layers or because they're in
line anyway Shift + select and then
press T to get to the text tool select
the color and select black and there's
the black font
then with both of them selected as well
you can also then move them at the same
time so you can like move them in a
batch of your will I'd say a bit of
spacing off the header probably drag
that up a little bit maybe somewhere
there the I want equal spacing between
top and bottom now that looks a bit
tight so I'll drag that up in fact I'll
probably drag that down instead of
dragging that up I'll drag everything
else down I think so if it starts
getting like a lot of layers and you
getting lost down here you can double
click on the layer name and type in
there so that I'd be the logo what you'd
call it a face that'd be paper
there's your text and that would be word
logo and so they can visibly see what
you're doing because I really want my on
drag everything about the face on drag
the face up to the top I'll click the
word logo shift click down to paper so
we've selected all of it and then I hold
shift and drag down and I'm looking for
an equal space between there in there
which looks good then the word logo I'd
see moved down a bit more to sort of
there so I'd say that looks okay if you
want more space on your screen say you
just feel there isn't enough space here
you can click the crop tool and you can
expand down and say and give us more
space and press ENTER and that will fill
the background layer with the background
color which right now is white so it's
gonna do a weird mix in fact it's filled
for some reason to filled the word logo
with that maybe a little content-aware
fill or something so then this bottom
layer it's because we don't have a
background in fact let me undo that and
see what went on there so we do crop oh
I know why Dilli cropped pixels wasn't
checked by default we scroll down expand
it and press Enter it will simply fill
the background layer just down here with
the background color which is white so
if I wanted to do that more accurately I
would have pressed X to make sure my
background color matches first
then I would have cropped and then by
default well I have to do anymore work
would have kept the background color the
same stuff that I give us a bit more
space I'll move the word logo down so V
and then drag it down we know runs it
they're the colors a bit washy so I'm
just gonna make it all white so to make
it white you can just press controlling
you to bring up your hue/saturation box
or you can go to edit over on the image
adjustments hue/saturation I'm just
gonna lighten each 100% and just make it
all white so just it doesn't distract it
from the email this paper now isn't
quite Center I don't believe so
hold shift in your lap' way and then
that should snap so if we move it right
the way out first and then click and
drag back in it sure didn't actually
snap there we go so that's no center
ctrl H to remove the bar now I'm going
to ctrl T to transform and simply make
this paper bigger and it will be about
their say and now we've got a bit more
space and freedom to do this so I'm
quite happy with that layout I still
think maybe move that paper down a
little bit like there so now we need a
button that says verify email so I'm
going to click the high loop path or I'm
going to click the verify email pull
turn down again to duplicate it hold
shift and drag down to bring it down T
for text change it to maybe 72 I'll make
it bold this time because it's important
oh that's a bit too bold make it medium
and then will now use the custom shape
tool rounded rectangle we need a new
layer for that so ctrl shift then drag
it below the verify email text and just
do a button around it's gone white so
let's change this color let's make the
button the same color as the face so
that color goes probably a bit more
round maybe 40 pixels
and something like that we probably
wanted to also be verify your email just
so it looks different than the title go
back to that layer and something like
that some will do the same drug that's
way out hold ctrl H to bring that back
in shift and drag this layer until it
snaps when there's too much about like
this verify your email move that out of
the way as well and then drag back in
and you'll only have one snap which is
the center line so there's a center line
verify your email wrong one as the
center line there yeah I got center line
or you can leave visibly as well
visually this is only a visual indicator
you know this isn't the final thing so
as long as it looks specially right you
tend to find yourself just nudging
things to suit so I think now I says
that's sort of Center there
change the color of this text with T and
then change it to the color of the eye
so it's a bit more matching with a color
scheme and I'd say that's not far off
probably how we want the email to look
nice and clean and simple there's like
our app is so you can sort of zoom out
you can crop and make this a bit bigger
so you can see in fact we'll all touch
bun both ways yeah so you can do kind of
that to give you a more visual avoid to
look like we can also make this paper
say look a bit more like it's stacked
paper so to do that we could zoom in on
here make a new layer control shift down
the marquee and click and drag like
something about their default to get
your collars back ctrl backspace to fill
in with white and then 100% zoom out a
bit thing has a bit thick so ctrl T and
then where there's been a small shape
it'll want to snap potentially to like a
point every does you can use the thing
up here to say go to 50% exactly
and then I will do all turn off did you
placate that layer and now shift enough
to move it fast and then let go yet
another movie pixel at a time so I get
the space roughly equal between them
ctrl T to transform make the width say
95 96 percent press ENTER twice and now
we have kind of a stacked paper
appearance it would probably want to
bring that a bit closer like that so we
could do that so it looks like a bit of
flat 3d effect if you will like stuff
paper and that's all I'd really do to
whip up a design as this grid obviously
keep making this naming these layers and
everything correctly so paper line one
paper line two and then once you've got
kind of sections like the content of the
email here which would be this this
would be bottom background you've got
your header you bottom the text and
that's it so this these four layers here
is one two three four missing one where
is what are we missing
oh no we're not this is all that's one
and then this is two threes attacks for
the background once I've selected those
four layers I press ctrl + G or I click
this group icon down here and it creates
a group and now I can name this email
content and now the benefit of it being
a group is when I click the group header
I can expand into it but if I click just
the header I can drag all of the content
around there's one group I can hide and
show the content and so on so I do that
I then grab all the paper group that and
call it paper so now my paper has that
so now we papers separate and then I
could select the email content and the
paper and group them and call it the
email itself maybe so I can drag the
whole email section around and a kind of
structure and layer things like that and
make use of these layers so that's
that's one other thing
do in the design bring general I'd say
this is this is now the email template I
want to create into CSS and HTML and add
it to our four set at word verify email
so that's it that's all I do so I'd also
then do file either file save us if you
save the Photoshop file you'll retain
all your information all your layers all
you details everything we've done so you
typically want to save that or if you're
done with it and you want to picture
drop-down save to a PNG give it a name
call it email verification press ENTER
you'll get these options here I just
leave it as a large file for now I'm not
using this for anything on the web
itself so that's fine and then if we now
go to the desktop we'll see we have
email verification and there's our PNG
file that's not what we're gonna work
off and that's typically what I'd show
you when I come to you know do a do a
design I'd usually have done this in the
first place so that's that's the that's
a torreÃ³n basically getting started with
photoshop again with a real example of
something I'm doing so hopefully this is
useful it's I know quite a few of you
been wanting it so hopefully enough of
