text to the right hand side of the
website we're making so if we open the
Photoshop file on me we're gonna add
this text here and then we're gonna have
it kind of slide in I was originally
thinking of doing some kind of Thai
prior to effect but I think that's a bit
overkill
I think it would do some nice CSS
animation at all it just is nice
so the first thing we need to do is
start by actually in making this text if
you will and typing it in so we've got
the original file from the last video in
a folder I've made on my desktop and
we've run DNA web inside the source
folders normal to spin off the you know
this live server so we can actually you
know see where we're doing so this is
using the DNA grid system so we've got a
grid here
a column of 1/2 and a column of 1/2 so
on the left hand half we have this
mascot as we did in last video so this
right hand side if we just did say div
style equals background red a boom will
see a big red block here make some
content than that so you can see there's
a now this is where the grid is where
we're going to be putting the text so
also got to keep in mind is the way
we'll do this because it's multicolored
in different areas as we'll do
paragraphs per line
so we'll do a paragraph for that line a
paragraph for that one so it's you know
each is on its own line and then we will
use spans inside the paragraph which are
inline HTML elements so that we can span
this while on the bracket and then add a
class to it to color it and so
everywhere there's a class everywhere
there's a different call up we'll add a
span around it and and style it with a
class basically so starting here we'll
use the semantic html5 header because
this is really I would say this is a
you know this whole thing's ahead of
here bud so this is the header content
this is a representative image so purely
semantic like say to help search engines
and general code reading nothing special
about it
I'll give it a class so we can style it
will call it mascot code I woke up this
morning there we go and then inside here
now we will do because we want to
animate this in will wrap this in a div
and we will add a class in fact not yet
we won't people just do I should leave
it at that for now it's just this is the
div that we will then use to animate in
each line of text we want to wrap them
all so we can apply this style to you
know an overall chunk we could
technically apply it to the head but I
like to keep the head of clean and then
the content inside the header and I'm
finally inside here now we can start
writing our tap so we could write wild
brainers and because default while R and
D for both like that and then open
brackets I don't know what's get on me
type in this morning my ID in here plus
equals code and you'll see I love the
column in a minute I don't know why this
is trying to end the wrong thing nice
format so I get a minute and then
closing brackets and that's it so if we
then look here we've now got the text in
here we also want spaces here so what
you can do is add spaces like that but
you'll notice that won't do anything
because it's just getting removed so
instead you can do ampersand nbsp
semicolon which stands for no breaking
space put two of those in each and that
will add like force the white space so
that's added to their so that's got as
the text in there we also want it to be
tender as he's filling the screen here
but when it doesn't we want this to be
centered inside its area here you know
physically centered about here so let's
start styling this mascot codes let's
open modern one mascot code because
that's the class we just give it and
let's start with text-align:center that
will align its center but also align
that Tech Center
so it's aligned the whole lot if you
will it's lined you know this div inside
Center so now we want to align the
content horizontal until you centered
and then if the inner div which is where
the actual variety is we want to display
inline block so it isn't 100% width take
up only this place needed and then if we
realign the text to left it means now
the block itself will be centered but
the text will be back to laughter lines
that's not achieved basically a
horizontal centering of this content
which is what we want then we want to
make this font size a lot larger
so we'll do font largest should get some
nice big text there we go and then we
want to reduce this amount of space
between the lines because it's not that
much here so we'll reduce that big font
reduce line spacing so it's line tie and
we'll do 0.2 of the font itself so 1/5
of the height of the font and that
groups it kind of nicely so there we
have the overall style if you will that
we can position this up and down with us
not I'm not worried about that right now
we now want to call of easy
so to do that as you mentioned we'll
make some colors so and we've got here
while this first part what I'm going to
do first is take the I'll go from here
and work my way down cause I I find an
order I'll label just color one color to
show this first color blue color one
then we go to white such color - then we
go to gray that'll be color three color
for for the red we've got that got that
so color five will be orange citral be
purple seven will be yellow you get the
idea basically we work our way through
so I've written those colors down in
advance if you're in Photoshop or
whatever you can just use the dropper to
get the color values here I've gone
ahead and just wrote all those down in
front of me so I can type them in so
we're just gonna give them class names
inside this mascot code from do see one
and then font color and then we'll give
it a color
2e CD e6 and if we save that and then go
to say this wild and we wrap this while
in a span up to there that will do
nothing to the text itself you can see
it's not change the layout to cuz span
simply a wrapper around in line items
but now the other class c-1 we should
get the core so there we go
so now we just want to do this for all
of the code you know so brain will be
the next one and you Pupp wrap that
around class equals c2 remember to save
that it looks white already is so you
kinda don't see that then we'll wrap
this isn't equal to n c3 which we
haven't made yet or c2 so UNC yet so
jump back to here let's just do add all
the colors got eight follows c2 is why
and there we go
gray then the red and purple II know the
Ong I go gets the purpley next and give
you like the the bright magenta I guess
and then the yellow and finally we have
the green says all of our colors now we
refresh you can see that's now the gray
so now it's the red the false word so if
we go back to here and it looks a bit of
work and yes it is but this is this is a
way of doing it in actual code you can
get you could add this to JavaScript
libraries and do markup or things but
this is just a splash banner that's done
once so it's just worth putting the
effort in it's not like you're doing
this for you know a huge amount of
things this is purely like I say to
create this banner if you will this nice
banner so it looks like a lot of code
and a lot of work voice just to get this
nice effect and like I say it's it's a
one-off basically the bracket does then
see one so we write that as well so we
save that we should now get the first
line which is looking right so I'll go
ahead and just fast forward the video
and you can see me doing all these lines
so you can see now that's the class all
styled and colors as we want
so the next thing now is to animate this
in two slides and I'm fades up so let's
go to the animations class and start
with an animation fade in and slide up
from below just start with a keyframes
called slide in
and we'll have 0% we'll put the bottom
to - 100 pixels to shift it out away and
I'll paste it to zero and you could
always put a you know toddler 20 VH for
20% of the new height or something if
you wanted instead but I think this
works ok maybe a pasty one when it's
finished will then make a slide in OP
class that has position relative first
position relative so we can remove this
element because we're using the bottom
position here you want to start off
invisible going to apply the animation
slide in off for one second and make the
animation stick so by default the
animation would revert to default values
once it's finished but the default value
we start invisible when it's finished we
want it to stick to a pasty one so to do
that we can use animation film mode
forwards so now if we applied widen up
to say this class there the first line
we should see that the first one now
fades in a not so if we then applied
this to each line we'd get them all
fading in at the same time which is not
you know exactly what we want we want
them to slide in at different times to
give kind of an effect so instead we'll
add a class to the container and we'll
call this slide in or group instead then
in the animations let's make another
class called slide in a group let's
select all inner items and add back the
slide in oh that should get us back to
the start where we have the same thing
so now it's applied the slide in up
group to each inner element for us so
this group now here has gone to each top
level P and added the group anyway now
we'll do a little trick for you instead
so we'll now say the nth child so the
first element will use an animation
delay and let's say one second just to
show you and now you can see but first
one decide to animate in us a different
time which is what we're after so we'll
copy that say ten times or whatever that
was that was actually ten times as well
so and you can do that as many times as
you want and will delay each one by you
know print one second different and if
we what's wrong with that
we've saved that now we should get kind
of a staggered load which is exactly
what ruff that kind of glued them they
all come in they don't even got to say
here is it's coming in a little bit too
soon so as soon as the page loads this
effect happens and you might miss it so
what you could do a quick way of fixing
that as you could literally no
increasing rows if you just are the
seconds delay to every you know item and
that would then load the page weight and
then hold in but now you've got a fixed
time in CSS which is not good so in
order to make this variable let's go
ahead and make a in fact let's see I
know one thing we do need to do here is
make up a ste one for the group because
what we're gonna do now is we're going
to remove this class from here and add
it a second later so we remove that
class and now they've ad if they'll
start off faded and in JavaScript if we
add that class back a second later we
need to override the faded Oh pasty zero
value so we'll force it to be visible
when this class gets added and now all's
we need to do is add this class a second
later so if you imagine now this page is
loaded it's coming to here this
faded on and then a second later we
added slide in or group that's the
affected then get it actually slide in
later so it's making new file and then
save it
let's go to the assets JavaScript and
let's call this DNA delay so that's what
we want to do is make sure to add it to
our header so we've got a delay and here
let's use our unload helper
once we've loaded we then want to find
all elements with data delay attributes
and that's something we're making up so
voila elements equals document dot query
all selector and we want them all that
have a data - delay attribute don't we
wanna loop each element so for each
elements function element and then all
elements so first thing we're gonna do
is add this date for delay to our plus
here or this dear brother so I'll say
day to delay equals and then what we're
going to use this for is the timer so
let's say one second there's the time we
want to delay so now for each of these
we do is say a set timeout to delay you
know each element that we add it to so
it can be you know but many we're only
adding it to one here but then for each
one we want to then call set timeout to
run this amount of time later so we call
a set timeout that was run a function
that would do whatever and this
oh no that was right just bottom top
then this then would run safe but we've
run this a second later by default
English dead alert hi
just to check as he's running and we
then save the page load and a second
later we should have got high which we
haven't or we haven't saved this
document save that refreshes and then it
says hi so we know this code is now
running if we were to then change well
we aren't using this code yet so we want
to change this delay to be the actual
value of the day to delay so for that
just do element don't get attribute and
we want this day to - delay value but
that's in seconds and this time outs in
milliseconds so it's time to buy a
thousand she'll get the same thing now a
second way to get high but now the key
is we should be able to change this
value in HTML to say two seconds and now
it's two so let's make it really obvious
let's do 10 seconds and it reloads and
then it with ten seconds later it will
run the code which is kind of the point
of why we're making this little mini
class we want simply to have something
happen after the delay so we have an
attribute we can now attack to any
element called data delay we want it one
second in this case and now we want to
say one of the features we want is to
add a class which is basically the only
feature we have right now the only thing
we want to do with this delay so add
specified class so for that we need to
specify a class let's say data delay add
and let's do the slide in for group
that's the class you want to add back so
we've made this optical data delay add
now we want to get that value and add
its value to the elements class ease so
that's really use that's one line that's
element dot plus a list add and then in
here that's the class we want to add so
that will then be the element jet
attribute right we've already done and
this time it's the day to delay add and
that's it so now a second later it
should add the class
I didn't or maybe it didn't we just not
see in it
we haven't saved the HTML document again
save the HTML and a second later out so
now when you load the page nothing and
then it fades and you can see here as
well hit then change X so that's how
much JavaScript running so now we could
say oh I don't want that delay let's
tweak it to two settings page reloads
and then it comes in which is too slow
in my eyes but you've now got the power
to make use of this little JavaScript
code - nice and easily
tweak the timing of when you add you
know a class to here so it's just a
really easy thing you just type dated to
like one second etudes Iliad and this
class will get added so you can use that
for anything you could have I don't know
the exact opposite you could you could
remove the faded class and you could add
faded after a second if you want to fade
out you know do whatever really it's
just where your imagination wants to go
but that's now useful for our slide in
and off so I quite like that
I will tweak this a bit more now
position its dial it for mobile we've
already done the mobile responsiveness
you know positioning like the guy into a
full frame money's smaller things like
that so I won't bore you with making
this respond you know this header
respond because we'll do an off of that
in the next videos anyway so I'll finish
this header up and commit the source
code so you can see the final result
where all this responds as well but the
point of this video was to show you this
effect and style so I'll clean this
banner up get this fully finished make
it respond nice so when we shrink it you
know this guy looked right and you know
things happen a bit nicer and then we'll
move on to the sections here and make
them responsive and then once you've
done all these sections have made a few
more which are as the home
don't might contact me so we can do that
section
I've done blog so you know we can do
I'll do all these sections and make them
responsive but you learn start seeing
how easy it is to build the website
using this DNA web so hopefully that
video was useful we've done a tiny bit
of JavaScript jog like a delay
we've done some CSS animation and I've
shown you how to kind of style some text
nicely any questions thoughts let me
know in the source code as usual as in
the comment
