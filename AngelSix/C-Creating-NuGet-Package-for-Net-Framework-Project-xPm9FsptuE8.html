about making a nougat package for a
dotnet framework project instead of a
dotnet core in case you're not up to
dotnet core yet and you know you want to
stop publish nougat packages so person
is literally going to make a class
framework class I'll have before the
dotnet framework so there's gonna be
nothing in it the point of it isn't the
code so we'll just get this project and
make sure it builds successfully which
it does and now let's say this is your
project that you want to submit to
nougat so you're gonna new the package
first thing you want to do really is
open the assembly info or right-clicking
your properties and assembly in fopen
it's the same kind of details whichever
way you want to do it you want to set up
in here your title description so my
test nougat and then you've got your
class library this this would be my
product name then company so company
we've got one and then the assembly
product so again that's a B in this case
my test product copyrights in there
and then that's about it and then your
version here so that kind of the the key
bits of info to shut up if you then look
in properties assembly and throw your
also seats
it's basically filled out there so
that's all your details setup obviously
when you're publishing to nougat you
want to be in release now when you're
using the old nougat it doesn't pick up
this set in oz it's going to look at is
if you right-click on your projects and
unload right-click again and add it it's
gonna pick up on what is this default
configuration here so that the property
configuration if it's blank meaning
there isn't one which there won't be one
you run new bit it's gonna try and do
debug so we'll change this bit here to
release and then we load the project and
all that means is when we come to run
the nougat executable on it it will pick
release instead of debug which is you
know important you don't want
deepak then in order to now push this
project we can open the folder and
here's the folder that we want to push
this is our you know project so we then
open up the internet go to new gets dog
versus downloads download new GUI XE and
save it then if we paste the download
into here so we've got the executable
here we're good with that now we want to
open up a command line here so type CMD
so you're in the same folder as the CS
proj of your solution and nougats in
here so we can run move it and the one
thing you have to do once or when
there's any I guess major changes to
your CS prod structure you time nougats
back and then the name of the CS proj
and press enter and this will now create
this new spec open this up in I'm gonna
open it up in visuals with your code
and you'll be presented with this
generated file so the ID the version all
these dollars all this is going to pull
in from your actual CS proj the things
that won't is these three here or these
four here the copyright and the tags
aren't being pulled in so the tags are
searchable terms so you're going to push
it to nougat and you want it to be found
by gonna SQL magic or from doing any
foot types
SQL magic and then you put your own
company your name and your project name
as kind of tags so the only thing you
really want to change is the license so
if you have a license if not just remove
it in this case we don't project tail
could be the github repo so like you
know get whole contours not the angel
steps forward slash then out SolidWorks
API or something say with the icon we
don't have one don't have a license to
accept and then a summary of the release
notes for this version so this could be
my first test version and then we save
the file so that's now your new spec
edited and the only time you really need
to edit this
is if you come to do a new release and
you want to change the release notes you
go into here and change the release
notes or you want to add some new tags
or change that but pretty much all the
time the I'm thinking in a change of
release notes so that's a one time thing
when you do new spec and it's all it
does is generate this file so you could
hand type it if you wanted that's not
really an issue so then we have the
project already set as default to
release and that we did a minute ago so
now all that's left is to compile this
project in release so we're now ready
let's compile them good to go
and then in here we just do yoga pack
and this should attempt to package you
can see here based on their packing
files from release which is the
important step there and successfully
generated package so now we have a
package here that's ready to push so
it's as easy as that basically and now
we can push that package off to new org
so in the previous video I showed you
how to create an account on nougat and
then how to sign in and go to your API
keys and generate one which I won't show
obviously on the video so that you you
know you can't see my key you could
manually upload a package or you can
push it from command line so I've got
the published packets here from you know
my according to packages basically so I
could push one of these to like but I
don't really want to to do that so
instead I'll simply show you how to push
II live so you've seen the last video on
nougat packages it will be linked in the
description of not that kind of goes
through in more detail about creating
the new get package getting it API key
and also what happens once you push so I
don't need to read repeat those steps if
you will so then the only thing left now
is to actually push the packet live so
we've got the nougat in this folder and
it's next to the new pack so what we can
tap in here the basically new gift push
then the name of the
nuba package which is this one then your
API key so that would be a bunch of you
know random numbers like this and then -
sauce and then HTTP colon forward slash
API bubut knew we've got org for /p
three four slash index dot jason and we
press enter on this not fail because my
keys wrong but it will attempt to push
it will then get the packet and it's
same forbidden basically the remote
access denied the keys invalid so other
than now specifying your correct key
here and pressing enter this will then
push up live and say successful and if
you want to see that actually happened
you can check out the you know the other
video i did that's the only real
difference between the two so in a
dotnet one Usenet nougat push and if you
using a you know the old-style then you
do the actual nuit exe you download and
instead you do nougat push and then the
syntax is ever so slightly different is
- sauce instead of - s you know there's
very little difference between the two
that would then obviously push off live
- here you'd see in here instantly new
account and then it would say you know
this this package isn't currently
indexed and then after there is your
very first time pushing a new project
then it will take potentially 20 minutes
half an hour if it's a repeat one it
simply updated it typically takes five
to ten minutes to to appear live and be
indexed so that's all there is to
actually generating and pushing a nougat
again say you want then create the next
version then you would go to assembly
info and you would change the version to
say we're at version 1.1 now you change
these two here nothing else really
change it about that we then build the
release and we'd open a command line
again and we just say
nougat pack oops did that one offer
off-camera there so you do nougat pack
and you can see it's generated there the
next package so that's picked up on the
the next package
and then you do the same again you do
new push to push it live so what you can
do is you can all always make a tax file
called say generate package and they say
dot bat and then that could just be open
with vs code and this could let you say
new the pack as simple as that and if we
were to leave those to use double click
generate package and there was bring
this onto screen see that opens and
generates your package and they could
also make one that's called say push
package and what you could do is
generate a package which generates the
packet and then you could drag this onto
the push package and then in here it
would appear as an argument and you
could then type in your new Gert Porsche
the package name could be the variable
which I I can't remember the bat very
ball can do a quick Google bot there's a
variable you can pull in something like
dollar one or percentage one that's the
the arguments when you drag and drop a
file on in fact let's just do a quick
Google on that and find that out
so it's man line but you get argument
o'keefe again I'm doing this off my
second monitor with a minute so let's
just take a quick look as something like
percent each one I was right in the
first place percentage one so I'm pretty
sure if we were to just do percent e1
and then we just started and say echo 71
and save that and we were to that's
probably going to appear and close
straightaway over to drug that on yeah
it's a peer and close straightaway so
it's just open with that and I think we
can do pause I think we'll do it yes
they'll stay open so if I drag and drop
that on now package and bring this up
you can see it has output the
the path so we have the full path there
so what we should be able to do with
that is to then change this to basically
be nougat
Porsche and then that and you might want
to wrap that in quotes in case the
spaces in the name and then you can do
the key and then - source HTTP API
nougat or forward slash what was it now
four or five from v3 four slash index I
think it was not really monitoring for
this but next up Jason I believe I'm you
just double-check a file with that in
where are we drag this off a minute just
get Mary or v3 yeah that was right so we
now have this in so we were to drag and
drop this on one of the keys wrong or
what we should get is there we go and
let's just put a pause back at the end
just so we can see it pause so now if we
drag and drop onto this and I drug it
into view you can see it then starts to
try and push the latest packet that we
drop on so you could have a little
script like this and then all you have
to do is double click generate to
generate the current package and it
would generate the nougat and then you
just drag and drop that on to push which
would be I guess yes called push and you
get the output to be pushed so that's
that's one way you can do kind of a nice
little setup there so that's like so
that's all there is to generating a
packet for a dotnet framework project
instead of a dotnet core very little
difference but at the same time it's
also important to know how to do that
because there are key differences so
hopefully this video was useful if you
want to support what I'm doing I do have
a patreon page patreon.com/lenguin
as always you can leave comments and
I'll get back to you in the video and
also I've just started to
move to a new recording software so you
should now see you've got 60 frames per
second on this video so the mouth should
be smoother than the last videos if
you're using a 60 frame a second video
and I'm gonna try and you know improve
the quality of these videos to get 4k in
60 frames per second so if you enjoy
that you know let me know hopefully it's
appreciated and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
