great 2017 we've had it's been a really
enjoyable journey I started YouTube 12
months ago now with no subscribers and
started producing free videos on seizure
we actually moved into all the other
areas afterwards but in general it's
been you know a really enjoyable ride
you guys have enjoyed the content based
on the feedback I've had all positive
feedback there's probably been two
comments the whole year that haven't
been really 100% positive so I'm very
pleased with that I'm pleased that you
guys enjoy what I do it takes time and
effort and you know it's my personal
time that I devote to giving away this
knowledge but I must say I do enjoy
doing it I love doing the videos I think
they're exciting enjoyable and relaxing
some of them to just simply talk through
a process of you know how I know
something and explain it in a simple way
so I'm glad you guys enjoy it I hope Tov
you know just as much success in 2018
and in less than 12 months we should
have hit almost 10,000 subscribers in
the next few weeks which i think is a
huge achievement from you know going
from nothing with no advertising to just
simply releasing videos and getting your
guys feedback so this is a video really
just to say you know for everybody that
watches my channel thank you you you've
given back as much as I've given in
terms of positive feedback and comments
and that's why I do what I do you know
that I know you guys appreciate it so
fertilizer thank you a second it's you
know so you guys can see me because I'm
sure most of you Wonderwall it like
you've watched my videos for a year but
it's always obviously screenshare so
this is a chance for you guys to
effectively meet me digitally if you
will
and like I say to to just say thank you
for the year I've had that brings me on
to the one subject that has been brought
on multiple times and comments is people
mentioning about patreon page wanting to
give back to me
for what I do so I actually do it for
free I never want to change that I want
to give away my knowledge for free all
the time but a lot of you have mentioned
and it's it's almost every day now you
know or why don't you spare a patreon
page so we can give back we can I want
to give you you know morning to support
what you're doing and right now I'm not
in a need for the money I've run
businesses but it's it's not really that
is the issue it's more than I now feel
it's almost be a disrespect to you guys
to not set up a patreon page because you
feel like you want to give something
back to me and I think that's a very
generous and very humble thing to do so
I've gone ahead and set up a patreon
page and then that got me thinking in
general of you know the year I've had
teaching and I must say I do really
enjoy teaching I think it's it's really
as I mentioned and enjoy your bowl and
rewarding so we can start in this
patreon page and we'll see how many of
you you know actively support me which
is also going to be very interesting so
I've got ten thousand subscribers and
it'll be interesting to see the the
ratio of people that you know start
supporting me on the patreon side of
things and ultimately I think you know I
would like to do teaching full-time it's
certainly something I'm not opposed to
so this is just kind of the start of the
journey we've had a good 2017 like I say
I want to progress this year go further
so I'm kind of in one way saying you
know it's actively start working on this
patreon let's let's go from there
you guys always want more content from
me but as I mentioned I'm always running
business isn't busy so the more support
I get the more time I can put into
videos though and I'll make that time
because it's the rewarding feedback so
we've got that now shut up and like I
say I hope to to see some activity on
there and then also let's look forward
2018 and I hope everybody continues to
enjoy what I do so thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
