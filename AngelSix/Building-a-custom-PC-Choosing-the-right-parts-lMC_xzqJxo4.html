is build your own computer and you sort
of don't know where to start
I locally employed quite a few people
and we always have new machines new
developer starting so we build our own
it's really simple so I was just going
to show you the process from start to
finish from spec'ing out ordering the
parts to physically building it to
install in Windows you know let the
entire job from start to finish as well
as you know how you do things so
computers are always changing so there's
always new things out and there's always
you know new technologies new interfaces
new speeds new processors but since then
over the last 15 years have been
building computers you don't really need
to know anything new it's all the same
thing so if I haven't built a computer
and say a year I know for a fact things
will have changed will be new standards
out new connectors but it's always the
same process so I'm going to show you
that so firstly you can either base your
build off money or you can base it off
speed or maybe you've got a very
specific requirement of you know I want
a certain process rod
I want this graphics card it's it's one
of those things specking out in terms of
what you like as I guess the Hardys part
and it's just deciding what do you like
so this is going to be a machine for
developer so I don't really need a
powerful graphics card so I'm not
bothered about that the key thing I want
is a good processor so I'm going to
start my search with processors and I
want it in a certain range price range
so you'll get a feel for the price
differences I'm going to go with an
Intel CPU if you don't know which one to
go for AMD always used to be on top of
the game for years they were always the
go-to place Intel work was so far behind
it was it was almost a joke whereas for
a good few years now Intel event on top
so I'm going to pick Intel but again you
just do some googling on desired chips
if you like but basically since the
Intel
you know the i-5 the I three the I
sevens come out these things that it's
so good that it doesn't even worth
looking anywhere else so I go to the
Intel processors and you can sort by say
price high to low and I usually go high
to low and then go down until I get to a
point where I'm happy to pay that as
roughly I don't want any Xeon server
processors even if you want it so you
had all the money in the world and you
like I'm going to buy this thing at
three thousand pounds you've got to know
what you're buying here so this is a
server processor so this isn't exactly
fast it's 2.3 gig so for like video
processing like what I do for these
videos this is not going to be good what
it is good after he's got eighteen cause
it's got a hell of a lot of threads it's
it's designed for service that's the
point of the xeon range so things we
have say thousands of clients hitting up
a server and they're all tiny request
but you need a lot of concurrent
parallel threads so Zeon's a voice
they're also super expensive and the i-x
evans are great this thing's awesome but
again i don't want to pay one and a half
thousand pounder for this processor so
i'll keep scrolling down i'll get to
more realistic range so if i want a
really good one i'm going to you know
pay this 800 pounds up here so you can
see from this the i-76 900 k so this is
clearly the current sort of good
processor but what you can sometimes
find is ones that get overly cheap so
certain not always because the cheap
meaning the bad is just because they get
that popular or sometimes as a good
batch you know they release a certain
chip and it's happens to be that fast
like this one for example this is a
perfect one for you know a top spec
machine basically it's very close to top
spec machine but at a realistic price so
3/8 350 there is really good if you
wanted to go with a 6 800 instead of
paying another almost well probably more
than double we go up for this 6 900 and
you can see you've got if you want to
find out the speeds of these you can
literally type in cpu chart into google
and you'll get like comparisons of
speeds and clock speeds and just do a
bit of research on your process
if money is the driving factor anyway
was kind of not much point other than
comparing you know like processors but
basically in as it stands right now and
as it's been for probably a year you
can't really go wrong with with core i5s
and sevens they're all going to be good
so base your decision off price range so
because this is a developer machine for
me and this is not for me for people
that work for me and we want them nice
and powerful I'm going to buy this nice
expensive six nine hundred K here to
give you a feel for if you're trying to
spec it out in saying I've got a
thousand-pound budget then in terms of
percentages of costs there's so many
things you need and I guess well we'll
just add everything to the basket and
then you can see as we go what prices
are but in general motherboards you can
save money on if you're not too fussed
about you know generally I hate to say
but you could buy a 40 pound motherboard
that sometimes is as good as a 500 pound
motherboard so motherboards are
generally you don't want to spend your
money on it's it's a rare case where you
do and some people argue different that
you know the multiple is the most
important it does everything but
honestly I've had I built a three
thousand pound machine with a 40 pound
motherboard and and it performs back
better and faster than the last machine
are built with a 500 pound motherboard
because it was just overly cumbersome
and the boot process was slow and
sluggish it was trying to figure too
many things out you noted over over done
itself with complexity so motherboards
tend to be you probably want to pay
about 100 pounds of you getting good
quality like we're going to go but if
you're going bog-standard and you're not
too fussed you can pick the motherboard
for say 40 50 pounds a processor is
where the ball clear money is going to
go between processor and graphics card
you're going to consider to pay around
the same for each so if I'm going to go
with something as high spec as this 800
pound processor if I was building a
general equal machine I'd probably end
up spending 800 pounds on a graphics
card as well but because I'm not really
doing any graphics this is for a
developer I'm only going to spend 200
pounds on a graphics card
I could even go less but I'm just going
to keep it you know you don't want to go
too low so think of a CPU on a graphics
card about the same price the
motherboard about 50 pounds the case and
the power supply about 50 pounds again
any cubic budget about 112 probably
about 100 pounds I'd say for a good case
and power supplies so again what we'll
do is just add everything to the basket
show you how to choose everything and
then you can look backwards after once
we've got everything in a basket sort of
the percentage of how much things cost
and then for when you build one you
could say well if you've got a thousand
pounds I'd say now if you've got a
thousand pounds your processor wants to
be down in the two hundred pound range
it's my assumption to fit that in and
see go to an i-5 get maybe squeeze in an
i7 like here but if not that I'd drop to
this high five so you're trying to get
something of a thousand pound I'd start
around the 200 pound mark for your
processors so let's just keep going and
you'll see what happens as we go so I'm
going to add this processor so we add
this to the basket and get rid of that
so let's just have a look at that
because now what you need to do if we've
started with the processor we need to
pick a motherboard that has this socket
so you can see it's LC a socket 201 1 v3
so don't worry too much about the v3
it's the socket as the main thing we're
interested in so it's an LG a 2 1 a 2 a
1 1 and that has to be the right socket
on the motherboard and sometimes you can
also find inside here I don't know
whether we will hear you you'll find
sort of existing people have purchased
motherboards or they you're like also
purchased here so you can see it's
called x99 on the socket 102 a11 so you
can get a feel sometimes for what your
motherboard is but we know it states
here sock it to a11 v3 so let's just go
to motherboards first which oh where are
the motherboards
Intel motherboards again you can do
either either motherboard you don't have
to go well you have to obviously keep it
the same as yours your CPU so if you've
gone Intel CPU you need Intel
motherboard so start with that and then
you see the sockets here 201 1v3
is an X 99 and that's the only option so
if we can't go wrong there if you're
struggling to figure out which soft meat
it is because sometimes they've got two
names like this h1 101 1 5 1 and just do
a Google on socket naming you'll find
out so now we've got the list of
motherboards I'm going to do high to low
again and you can see you can pay a
thousand pound for motherboard I'm like
seriously don't do that there's never
there's never a need filler so scroll
down I'm going to go to be honest I'm
going to start at the lowest and the
lowest for this is actually 200 pounds
because this is a top spec CPU so this
sort of got you by the balls right now
they know that this socket is designed
for the high end what's currently
high-end CPUs so the same well if you're
going to go with that CPU you're going
to have to pay 200 pounds for this
motherboard so we just jump back to the
CPUs again if we were going to go with
the cheaper 200 pound high-fives
so I'd say one here it's got a 1-1 5o
sake so we went with a 200 pound CPU and
then you went to you can then see
there's three different types so you
have to make sure you got the right type
look at the description of the processor
and you go into these new candy 40
pounds 50 pounds so the higher cost the
CPU is often a higher cost in
motherboard but if you're going unless
you're going with the top spec like I am
here typically you can get a motherboard
for 4050 pounds so I'm going to go to
basically the cheapest motherboard
almost so I'm going to do
we've got Asus Xtreme
how to stop and you can sometimes we
could reviews I don't always believe
them but sometimes if you have a lot of
reviews I got four there that's quite a
lot of reviews is you could be assured
that's good for I'm literally going to
go with the cheapest one and what you
want to check on your motherboard now
for one it's that socket which it is and
then two you want to make sure you've
got everything you need connected so you
can see here one thing that motherboards
sometimes come with it be trying to save
money if you don't always need a
graphics card so some of them come with
integrated graphics and it should be
fairly easy to see in the specs so you
should go down to your specs and GPU and
internal connectors back panel so I just
do a find for graphics there's nothing
in there so this doesn't have integrated
graphics and again highrock motherboards
you tend to find the won't bother with
the integrated graphics but if we just
jump on to another window and that's
open up there a cheap motherboard and
graphics there you go seems to serve
graphics the very first statement this
board ball or superb integrated graphics
so this is got integrated graphics it
means as a graphics card on here it's
not necessarily a card it's but it's got
a graphics processor so you can build
this machine you don't even need to buy
a graphics card and you can also tell it
by the connector here so you've got a D
DVI and a D sub or a VGA connector so
this is where you connect your monitors
so that's sort of a telltale sign as
while we look at the connector where if
you look at this connector you can see
there's no no way to connect the monitor
so you need a graphics card so again
that's something to consider it to get
really cheap you don't give in need
graphics cards and and to be honest they
aren't bad unless you want to do games
then integrate the graphics cards that
the real case to be honest there's
nothing wrong with them so it's a choice
you can make if you can find a
motherboard with integrated graphics so
if I went potentially up to because my
graphics card is going to cost me I'd
say at least 100 pounds maybe - I could
flick off to say something that's 100
pounds more
and potentially look at see them I can
find anything that says integrated
graphics which it doesn't and I'm
looking out the picture which does USB
see but there's no no graphics again so
you can do that you know way not the
difference between try and find a
motherboard with integrated graphics and
not but one thing I will say is that
once you get high up in terms of the
oops a lead to a wishlist and by mistake
once you get high up CPUs you don't tend
to get integrated graphics and you just
tend to not put them on the motherboards
so I'm going to add that one also let's
finish off what we're looking for so for
one we know we need integrated grant we
need we need a graphics card for this
too then you want to look at the back so
you've got I've never seen ps2 for a
long while so that's funny to see that
on there it's like a really old mouse
and keyboard connector so you've got
your USB
you've got you Ethernet you've got your
audio panel here this is quite basic
motherboard the size is also the other
things so motherboards come in different
sizes
you've got a TX which is your standard
big motherboard then you've got mini ATX
micro ATX Pico ATX all based on sizes so
if you want to fit something in a small
case I tend to go with mini ATX which is
a lower case M and then ATX and then all
the only different ambani different size
motherboard is make sure your case
matches that size so if you've gone ATX
you need to make sure that the case can
fit at least 1080 X n which is usually
the full size cases so we'll come to
that after so we know we've got a
motherboard with the USB es we've got
Ethernet
the other thing most people forget is
not usually Wi-Fi built into
motherboards so you'll either need a USB
Wi-Fi dongle or a PCIe card with Wi-Fi
ads pictures for the USB Wi-Fi dongle
for now and then you want to check that
it also supports the CPU so even though
this says it supports Intel Core i7
processors with the socket that doesn't
always
the time indoors but that does not
always mean it's going to support your
processor just because it's their socket
so if you want to be double sure which I
recommend you are you want to go to the
manufacturer website for your specific
motherboard so we just type this into
Google and you'll always have on decent
motherboards so I have to find them the
actual manufacturer website you should
have something that shows the CPU
support and the memory support so if we
scroll down you'll also find some you
know nice-looking images and specs on on
what you're buying as well have you
really want to you know dig in and do
your research I'm not usually that
bothered about this stuff so I'm
guessing it's going to be in specs I'm
certainly hoping it's it's going to give
us what we're after
so specs we've got all this lot and then
if you can't find it oops if you can't
find it here which isn't like we're
going to find it here there we are
detail now CPU prefer please refer to
CPU support for compatible CPU the above
description for reference only so this
is what we want the CPU reference and
the same memory again very rare will Ram
not work or if you want to be super sure
you just pick the motherboard and then
make sure your Ram works with it so it's
actually saying please revert the CPU
support and your aunt I've seen anywhere
so where's the CPU support
okay the refer meanness to some we're
just going to click all the links here
we go so come to the support for it and
manual no utility quick guide
compatibility there we go so sometimes
it's hard to find you can you can sure
cut this and I'm probably could have
found this page of additive pasted this
in to Google and just added CPU support
I bet this would take me straight to the
page no it wouldn't support for or what
it does the page yes this would have got
me closer we're on top of the page they
just click compatibility book you just
have to do a bit of digging sometimes
all the time it's really easy so we're
on the compatibility page we've got the
processors and now we can just go to our
basket and we have the Intel i7 six 900k
and then we're going to exact model
number there so let's start with that
six nine hundred K so it's here and
there's only one of them so we stop the
actual the cpu model number is in the
support list then that's it we support
it and the other thing to look out for
even though it says it supports the CPU
something that can rarely happen is the
firmware which i think is the result
here which seems all the same an oligo
so you can see the ends changing so it
starts at version ten then one b then
one d and what there's some guessing is
on what usually is is the lowest
firmware version because sometimes the
firmware on the motherboard gets updated
to support newer processors and what you
can sometimes find is if you buy from a
place that doesn't keep fresh stock of
motherboards you can have an old
firmware on the motherboard so even
though it says it's supported here they
support it in firmware 1b and you buy a
motherboard that's got firmware oh six
then it's not going to boot up but in
that instance the place you bought the
motherboard from should honor your
return or request to have new firm you
know a board with the newer firmware so
as long as it's in
your cpu compatibility list then you're
99.9% sure to work I've only ever had it
happen once in my life where I brought a
CPU that was on the support list and I
happened to get one with a lower model
firmware and that usually only happens
if you're working with the very latest
CPUs that have only just come out so you
should be perfectly fine there so we're
going to we know the CPU works with this
motherboard the next question is how
much memory do you want how much RAM and
again there's usually just boils down to
preference of money for the most part
sometimes we'd be doing gaming then you
want you know a specific high-speed one
thing I will say about Ram is never
bother going above 32 ever there's just
no need
and it also massively slow down your
system it won't make it faster because
then you've got all this RAM that has to
be initialized and checked and kept in
tow and indeed really they'll slow your
system down so the perfect amount of RAM
really a 16 gig and just high-quality
fast 16 gig and there's rarely a need
for more than that so we're going to go
with 16 gig for hours so you want to
make sure this can support 16 gig you
can support ddr4 which again is types of
memory so you want to match ddr4 and
this is usually the maximum so this
isn't there you young got DDR 4 3 3 3 3
which is just the speed it means it
supports up to that but I definitely
stick with DDR forward and drop to ddr3
but again now you're on the support page
we're going to go to memory support and
we can see there ddr4 and you'll see the
all ddr4 that's why I say stick to ddr4
not 3 where you can see the speeds here
could be all kinds of speeds they don't
need to be the fast ones so you want to
pick again partly off price and partly
off your requirement so size here and
we're going in terms of filter
now so well maybe there's type 60 in GBM
no that's not sure it's probably per
stick actually I'm not going to show
that anyway so we know I'd say in terms
of make sort of a glance of the mix but
I say Corsair of God make crucial a good
G skill a good HyperX a good I wouldn't
touch the others so I'd stick with those
really they're the main ones I always
pick as HyperX crucial G skill is more
for overclocking gaming type people
seems to be more of a thing there we've
also got a check here for if it supports
two four or eight sticks so let's go
with you also want in terms of the
number I'm going to add this to me
basics I'm quite happy that I'm going to
find some RAM it works from the CPU and
that's all I'm really bothered about so
you can take a look at what else you've
got you know if you want a specific
audio or anything else or yeah but
there's nothing nothing much else I want
to to pick on this motherboard so I'm
going to add that and that's the
motherboard sorted we're going to move
on to the RAM which are in the middle of
Tekken so if we go to ddr4 Ram and then
the speeds again leave I just leave us
in ddr4 let's sort by high to low and
again I don't want a stupid money so
I'll scroll down a bit and then we can
see 32 gig again you don't want to 32
gig you can there's nothing wrong with
it you're serving one go above but I'd
stick with 16 gigs and then you can see
we've got filters here for brands so I'm
going to go Corsair what they've also
tagged us top and that's going to stick
with Corsair keep it simple and then
we'll scroll down and we'll find get
down to maybe few hundred pound around
two hundred pound again and then we've
got these we've got four sticks here so
one thing I'd try and say is try and
stick with as few sticks as possible as
few memory sticks as you can't like just
too
so I'm going to go the page before so it
should be basically two eight gig sticks
and you also want to buy if you want say
if you wanted 32 gig memory
I wouldn't go and buy too lots of these
16 gig and try and buy for lots of v8 so
it comes the 32 gig because when you buy
them in sets like this and the four
times two times these have been
specifically paired up at the factory to
be exactly the same so they all work
together really nicely if you just go
ahead and buy individual sticks and try
to put them together then it's not going
to be as good so pick the amount you
want say 16 gig like here and then you
can either basically entirely on price
and just go right I'm going to spend two
hundred pounds on that set if you've got
a bit more flexibility then what you
want to look for is what's called the
cast timing and basically the higher
number here the worse the memory so you
can see we've got 16 18 18 36 and you
got nineteen twenty three twenty three
four five so this memory it's going to
be slower than this memory even though
it's got a higher clock speed internally
how things function it's going to be
poorer quality so you've got to balance
off between actual memory speed which is
4000 megahertz and the internal timings
because these you can sort of combine
these if you will and do that times that
or rather that divided by that whichever
way around but in essence you want you
want the lower caste numbers more so
than you want the clock speed because
this internally means they work quicker
and more efficiently you can do googling
on the whole cast speed thing but to
keep it really simple
lower lower caste values are better but
then obviously you want to get this off
as well you don't want to drop to 2,400
just to save a coupler you know like two
points on the cast
so find like a balance basically so
these are all - these are three thoughts
and these vengence are usually good so
18 20 20
- four three six so we're going to the
four then you gain 20 again quite high
not massively but it's either we go
right down to a safe three six is
probably a decent middle ground again
this isn't critical you know it's not
going to make a huge amount of different
they're all going to be good it's all
going to perform but you do want to try
and get the lowest numbers as possible
and again sometimes the price dictates
that and gives you a hint and others it
doesn't so see we've got this champion
16 gig that's like more but look how low
the values are and it's 3/4 but it's 18
18 so we go cheaper you've got three
four
in fact that I spent much on par with
that 36 just 40 in fact with cheaper
ones better as well so I don't want to
spend too long messing around I'm just
going to pick because of them vengeance
before I'm probably going to go with a
vengeance I'm actually going to go with
a high flock speed this time and just
the the worst class rating so if I was
going to pick this and click this and we
want to make sure this is supported so
we and again you don't always have to do
this because if it's not in this list it
usually as supported anyway it's not
I rarely check Ram I tend to just buy
Ram it almost always works so you see
that isn't on there it isn't on the
supported list so cmk so cm kazar on 16
GX for one
tewi so it's the tui part that's not
supported in fact the own onyx showing
there is that so we could potentially do
the opposite down and go in fact if we
picked to higher clock speed now haven't
or have we actually what was the max
less supported take a quick look at what
the motherboards maximum supported speed
was so the ddr memory supports three
three three three
i doesn't got explicitly 3200 there so
maybe we just picked a slightly funny
speed so i'm not going to pick that one
then let's go to maybe this one or what
the other thing we can do is we know the
course i was in there it was just that
it was this this is quite slow so we
don't really want slow so let's go the
other way around let's do look on here
for i guess the top one one of the top
ones and what you can find is we tend to
stick to the lower speeds so stick
around 3000 let's go to corsair again
and let's pick a two six six six some
song 16 gig and let's just search for
that part and let's see we can find this
specific supported ram I think that's
500 pounds I am not paying that for ram
us a 64 gig even though that says it's
16 gig let's pick another one and then
like I say you can just pick Ram that
isn't on that list and I can almost
guarantee it work fine
it's just that they heavily test with
you know certain makes slow go this
one's on their list of supported chips
so apparently all these are 30 to 60
it's only a hundred pounds
so you've also got a check that when
you've searched the things you've
searched for is the same value because
this isn't the same value I've searched
for it and it's give me results that
aren't the same chip so yeah this is
just literally returned different
vengeance chips 6,000 so are you I'm not
going to even match up identical I'm
just going to pick a vengeance that I've
used before not on this build obviously
what I've used vengeance run before so
I'm just going to go back and actually
pick that memory that I'd originally
decided on which isn't in the support
list so I'm going to go with good to do
where was it it was around the 200 ish
pound mark did you say 232
sixteen so got some vengeance here
especially hard to find to get these
days at 16 gig they want to push to 32
so I'm just going to go with this one to
be honest so I'm going to pick this we
can double check actually that's in the
list but I don't think is nope so again
this will show you that you can you can
just by Ram you don't always need to to
have it you know matching the list I'm
sure this will work fine so let's go
ahead and buy that all you've got to
make sure is that your clock speed is
within range
so it's ddr4 which is the right type and
this speed to 1 300 is is within you
know it's lower than what the
motherboards rating the speed at so you
know 2 1 3 3 is there so that's what
we're going to go with so that's the RAM
sorted we then have power supply and
sometimes you can get power supply
encase or in fact let's jump onto hard
drive first that's a nice quick decision
in this day and age I'd stick with SSD I
wouldn't go with HDD which is the
old-style mechanical hard drives just
stick with SSD do the same thing pick a
price range pick a size go with what you
want SSDs are expensive so you want one
terabyte of data then that's a lot of
money but what I recommend is that if
you've got the money for it if you want
say 2 terabytes of data what you need
that cheap then just get a hard drive
normal hard drive 1 terabyte for like 40
pounds probably now but then when you
run your operating system and any files
that are accessed all the time just by
the cheapest smallest SSD that can fit
it on so at least your operating systems
running on an SSD because that'll make a
huge difference to the speed of the
whole system so go to like you know go
down to a high bucks 450 pounds and
become and chuck it on there so that's a
real idea that will make a huge
difference to your system so you've got
the money
I'd recommend entire SSD like I'm
messing on a Chokin a complete SSD with
one terabyte
but if Jung got that kind of money then
just trying at least get a small SSD to
put your OS on put Windows on and then
you know a normal hard drive for the
other part that's memory sorted if you
still want to use DVDs and blu-rays go
ahead and buy anything all fine I don't
even fit them out and fit them for years
now and then that brings us on to the
case and the power supply and the what
you can usually find is again if you
want to save money if you go to KC's and
this is where the size is coming full
Tower MIDI Tower so I think MIDI towers
fit ATX in it so a quick look ATX
support the ATX ATX ESO MIDI towers are
you general towers like this normal size
full towers all the massive server
towers your big huge long ones with
extra so you can tell much on the
picture but trust me these things are
massive and then this is where I said of
you brought to smaller if you'd brought
in my micro ATX like a mini ATX board or
micro ATX rather that's even smaller
then you can get a smaller case so it
all depends on the size of the
motherboard you purchased if you're
unsure just stick with a MIDI tower and
it'll fit it'll always fit in a MIDI
Tower so you got no issues there the
other side is if you brought a huge
graphics card then you sometimes you
have issues of graphics cards fitting in
cases so that's something you can't
really judge for or a voyage just after
to go with it
so for cases again what I was saying is
you can sometimes get cases with power
supplies included again if you're on a
budget that's a good way because you can
sometimes pick a case and the power
supply up for 30 40 pounds for me I tend
to buy them separate now so and I also
like really plain simple cases I
couldn't care about spending money on a
case so to me 20 pounds case like this
fine so I just do a quick checkup fix
ATX in which it does and that's it
that's all I'm going to check so
at the basket 20 pounds and then we want
the power supply and this is something
people usually massively over eight so
you know if you've got a big graphics
card then yeah that's going to be power
power-hungry like a few hundred watts
the CPUs tend to be up to a hundred
watts and not always that high spec so I
think you might get the power rating in
here you want to try and calculate
things so 140 watt here so you've got a
CPU of 140 watts
you've got your peripherals USBs bits
there nothing major and your graphics
card so the two main thoughts about what
size power supply do I need you base it
on the fact of CPU and motherboard so me
CPUs 140 watt so not CPU motherboard CPU
and graphics card the CPU is 140 and
your graphics card is 300 then that's
touching on nearly 450 so I'd go with
800 and then other than that yeah I
don't have a big powerful graphics card
you're almost always fine up to 500 so
because I'm going to get a graphics card
in a plate safe and just go with 800
watts but the other thing most people do
is over spec as you seem to think need
an 800 watt power supply just because
they've got an i-5 and a 200 pound
graphics card that'll run on 300 watt no
problem so unless you've you've got a
really high powered CPU and a really
high-powered graphics card you're going
to be good with 500 watt so I'm going to
stick with around 750 watts I'm going to
base it on price low to high and also
again not so much these days but there
was the standards of power supplies in
terms of what connections the were they
were ATX version 1 and ATX version 2 and
now it's become that standard you
shouldn't have to think about that but I
see this gives us the spec so supports
the newest spec of atx12v so that's now
all the stating
there used to be an issue with you know
old specs and and trying to get specific
pins that is 20-point 20+4 pin but this
issues long since been resolved so you
should be good just buying a power
supply without having to think about
anything you just buy the power supply
and it works you can have a quick look
there it's got eight SATA connectors and
four molex connectors but again you'll
rarely find that you don't have enough
connectors for your board so you should
be good to just buy them and if not it's
a case of just a few pounds for adapters
for plugging into existing cables and
converting them to what you need so
pretty much just pick the power supply
rating you want and you can also get
ones that detach and have instead of
them all the cables coming out of you
pay a bit more money you can get ones
that come as like kits where you can
just connect just the amount of cables
you need and I'm trying to think where
they are I've used them often I just
can't think of the make will be more
than that anyway they're like you're
talking about 100 pound plus rating so
that you can see modular huts or the
call in them you see these holes here so
you can literally connect just the
amount of cables you need and keep it
cleaner and you've also got various
different cables to pick different
connectors so again if money's not an
issue then you could always go the
modular looks nice and it keeps the case
clean and then got the semi modular
which I guess so much is connected and
then the rest is as modular plug ins so
I'll get a modular just so you can see
because we're going to do a video of
building this off so I don't need a
modular one but just so you get a feel
for what it looks like I'm going to buy
this one so that's the power supply
we've got the case so I think we need a
graphics card now again graphics cards
you can always Google which is best I'm
just going to stick with NVIDIA GTX and
again base it on price so I don't want
to play anything crazy pay maybe three
or four hundred pounds go down to where
and this is all of them actually odds in
the order of price almost so we probably
want like a see what price um 950 is are
there only 200 will step up a little bit
there's only one in that so they're
fading out what I choice there so still
and you're also notice that a lot
graphics cards GTX 105 Oh 100 pounds
you've sorted the opposite way GTX 105
or 150 so not as much obvious difference
there we step up to the highest so
you've got one starting at four six nine
and it's called GTX 108 oh and the high
priced GTX 108 over 700 so it's way more
and yeah it's the same name so the one
thing you'll get with graphics cards is
same GTX 108 oh isn't as isn't just the
end of that's it that's the graphics
card you've got for so many variations
and so many different manufacturers
because the GTX 108 oh is purely the the
core chip if you will they're not even
the chip but the way the chip should
function and behave and then all these
different manufacturers make their own
specific versions implementations of
that that standard in that that core so
if you really want to get into your
graphics cards and find you know one
that's really good then it's basically a
case of just googling for the current
graphics cards and looking at 3d mark
benchmark test to see the quality of
them and just you doing the general you
know we'll look around and experience
from other people so I don't really care
so much about the graphics that is for a
software developer so I want to you know
a graphics card that's okay so I'm going
to pick it again just based on what I
want to spend once it's been maybe a few
hundred pounds so this thing is going to
do if you wanted a specific connector
like we use mostly display for which is
here it's got one DisplayPort one HDMI
so I potentially want to get actually
one word to exploit or do run multiple
monitors so that's about the only thing
I'm going to look for
and I can always just use one HDMI one
DisplayPort is not the end of the world
I probably would like a a dual display
port if possible
let's keep flicking through so this is
now a to display port three display
ports and one HDMI and one DVI but you
can see the depth of its now big this is
what you call a double slot so I think
it'll only connect to one slot yep there
one slot but it takes up to but we've
got nothing else in those slots so we're
fine so I'm going to go with this one
just like another two slots so we add
that and then let's take a look at what
we've got the other thing you'll
probably need is depending on what CPU
you purchased sometimes become with a
fan all the times I can clearly see in
this box there's no fan so again cheaper
CPUs tend to come with fans built-in
otherwise we need a fan too awfully cool
less CPU so we've got this socket to a
1-1 so we go to fans wherever they are
air cooling fans by size Sun by size and
nothing this is case from there your
coolers CPU coolers and then can we
filter by the only problem with the
sight as the filter is really bad
I hope you've added filter in here now
bad looks so 201 1v3 that's our CPU
socket so we'll filter by that and then
I'll just go and saw price high to low
and then you can get all these CPU funds
again every if it's got a fan for your
CPU and you're not going crazy and
overclocking things then the cheap bombs
will do it's also the size of the fan is
say 120 mil
so obviously you don't want to I don't
want to skimp in terms of go budget on a
fancy the CPU because that's the main
part of your well one of the major parts
of your motherboard if you don't cool it
in you you know destroy your CPU that's
not good but at the same time almost all
these fans are going to do the job a lot
of this is just marketing and wanting
you to spend more money because it's a
brand name and things like that but
they're all going to do the same job so
I'm going to go with pretty much not far
off the cheapest I'm just going to go
with this thirty pound one and just take
another quick look to make sure it
supports it to a 1:1 which it does so
I'm going to add that to the basket and
then let's take a look in what we have
now so start with the motherboards we've
got the motherboard we place the CPU on
we attach the farm and we put the RAM in
and put the graphics card in we need to
power the whole thing we put it all in a
case got a hard drive to boot to so that
should be everything and then if you're
in doubt if you've got everything you
tend to just flick through your sections
so not as much gaming so PC components
we've got a motherboard but a process I
got Ram graphics card got a power supply
got storage we've got a case we've got a
farm water cooling we're not doing we
don't need a monitor in fact I do need
monitors but I won't bore you with
ordering the monitor I'll do that
offline afterwards but again monitors
are simple to pick just pick one that
you want there's nothing really to think
about you can get 4k view on 4k I'd
recommend Game one with 60 frames per
second at least and because that'll make
it really smooth it's amazing how much
difference it makes in terms of smooth
Mouse motion other than that just pick
the money to you like and then we've
also got keyboard and mouse if you know
you want keyboards and mice then
basically don't forget to to order them
same weather mention your Wi-Fi you want
to Wi-Fi dongle
if you want to connect it wirelessly
which I'd recommend just a USB Wi-Fi
these are all going to be hardwired so I
don't need one and then that's really so
you can you can get a hint for flicking
through that you've got everything but
in general this is all you need to build
a computer so you've got your
motherboard CPU Ram fan for the CPU
graphics card and then you've got your
hard drives case and your power supply
and all that's put together then you can
see the price range here in general this
is where you get the feel for things so
as things come down cheaper everything
comes cheaper but in general I mentioned
if you buy CPU you tend to spend the
same on a graphics card in my case I
don't because we're not doing any kind
of game you know anything that lights
just so there's an offset there where we
want mainly a really good CPU so overall
I've spent like a thousand pound on the
two major components then your
motherboard is 200-pound just because
mine's a modern new one if you will this
is usually around 50 pounds almost
always so you can see that's there the
RAM you don't have to spend this much
again you can get that cheaper but in
general just look at the percentages so
storage ram motherboard are usually all
around the same price and they usually
all around 50 pounds and I should you in
SSD so you could you know look at them
as all the same price the two high
priced ones are CPU and graphics and
then the cheap things like fans power
supplies can be cheaper and case so you
can always just bounce back on forward
as well and try and get the prices up
and down but just remember that you need
to pick a starting point so pick what
you want I wouldn't start with a
graphics card because graphics cars just
PCIe we tend to plug into anything and
work so I'd start with either your CPU
or your motherboard and the only reason
you really start with a motherboard is
if you you're looking for cheap and you
want to make sure your motherboard isn't
expensive then you'd pick a motherboard
and then fit that but in general I'd
start with your CPU is your starting
point and then you set your motherboard
to make sure it works with that then you
Mars or jump T around to make sure the
RAM
as compatible and pick how much and then
you got to feel how much money you've
got left for graphics card and storage
and things so hopefully this is a good
explanation of how to spec or from what
to look for when you're buying things
for a computer and I'll just reiterate
it once more but you basically you have
to make sure that the CPU is the right
socket as the motherboard so socket to
a11 and very importantly do check the
CPU support of that motherboard by
googling for it to make sure it
definitely supports the CPU after that
you should be good so I have them pick
some run isn't even technically on the
supported list but I've only again I've
only ever had that I think twice in my
life where the RAM didn't work and you
can always just return the RAM it's not
you know a major issue so I'm pretty
sure that'll all work together and then
graphics card and all the rest there's
nothing to really check compatibility
for the graphics card unless you get a
huge one should fit in your case find
the fan is going to fit because I made
sure the sockets the same again the RAM
I also want to make sure with the same
speed at least that you know didn't go
it wasn't to higher speed for the
motherboard and it was the right brand
ddr4 it was the right type and that's it
really everything else there's no
compatibility issues with so as long as
you keep an eye out on your CPU
motherboard and RAM
really those three key areas everything
else should be fine and then we can go
ahead and order this now so I'm going to
order this and when it arrives I'm going
to do a video of building this up and
then this video should go up all
together I'll probably do them in
sections so this is backing out there
the computer and then another video you
should follow almost instantly on
actually building this up and checking
it works and then how to install windows
on it so yeah any comments or any
questions just post them in a video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
