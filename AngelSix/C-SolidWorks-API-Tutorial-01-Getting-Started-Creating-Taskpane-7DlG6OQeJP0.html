SolidWorks add-in or in general the
SolidWorks API programming we're going
to get straight into it we're going to
create a SolidWorks a dent in c-sharp
from scratch so the very first thing you
need to do is go to C Drive Program
Files your SolidWorks folder and then
SolidWorks folder inside that you then
need to browse that folder and you'll
see SolidWorks Interop DLL files go
ahead and copy all those select them all
copy and if you're following the get
repository that I've published on github
you'll see this structure with the
meridian if not just create a folder
called references anywhere you like call
this 2016 because that's the version of
SolidWorks I'm on at the moment and then
I just pasted the dll's into this folder
so just copy these files any way you
like for your reference in this
structure it's in the references folder
then we're going to go ahead and open
visual studio so I'm using 2015-2017 is
just in release candidate at the moment
you might want to try that but if you
want to play it safe just install visual
studio 2015 create a new project and
then you want a class library so there's
quite a lot of class libraries review
search in the top here and go class
you'll see all these of class libraries
you don't want dotnet cool you don't
want portable you want the plain class
library and then out of those you want
the one that says visual C sharp on the
right then we're going to go in this
structure of made here for the tutorials
I'm just calling it blank add in I'll
call this and you're sick SolidWorks dot
one add in
and click okay this creates the project
in a solution you now want to first
things first right click on the project
here that's the one with the c-sharp
icon properties then you want to set up
your name that you want it to output
which you can leave as default same with
your namespace whatever you typed in the
project name by default will be these
two so if you want to change them just
change them here click assembly info and
click make assembly column visible this
is important so that SolidWorks can
actually use the DLL because if it runs
on comm so it needs to be able to access
everything in this file and that's all
there is to the project properties now
we need to add references so see the
references here right click add
reference and then you browse to the
folder where you place the references
I'm going to add a reference to
SolidWorks SolidWorks commands Constance
document manager and published now you
don't need all these right away I think
in fact you only the SolidWorks one
constant stores all specific in
numerator values and things like that
commands I've got other parts and
document money just for working on files
when they're not open published I can't
quite remember but in general these the
ones I add and then you know you've got
references to everything here you
typically need so you click Add it text
them here click OK and the appear in
this menu here so now we've got
references to the SolidWorks
API the default classics made let's just
go ahead and rename that class I will
call it
tasks pane integration and then you can
see the default namespace that we called
the projectors here created a public
class for us and it's the name as the
one we just rename the file to we need
to give it an interface so it's a colon
and then I SolidWorks
add-in if you press ctrl + . ctrl + . it
will automatically search for where it
is and that your that's actually where
the SolidWorks published is used to get
this add-in so you click this using and
also it does has adds this using
statement up here so now we have an
add-in now you'll see that we've got to
implement two functions which is connect
to SolidWorks and disconnect from
SolidWorks or get to those anyway just
clear off all these and use namespaces
so this is the main item this is where
when you register the add-in it adds the
registry entries to regedit and it also
responds to SolidWorks telling it to
connect and disconnect and it creates
the task pane window
that's essentially what this add in part
does we're going to comment this um so
three slashes at the top can give it a
comment and we'll just call it our
SolidWorks task pane
and I'll do to be honest all the Spain
add in then we're going to make a region
which is just a way to tag your code
intersections or private members if
you're unfamiliar with c-sharp just
check out the YouTube channel I've got
that you run right now and you'll see
some c-sharp tutorials that goes over
everything in here in classes regions
comments and a whole array of other
things so if you're not comfortable with
the c-sharp I don't explain it here
because I've got separate videos
explaining how to do C show up in
general then we're going to create some
variables we'll need so I'll need a
private integer for the SolidWorks
cookie and we'll need a task pane view I
think it's called and again we press
ctrl + dot it will find the name space
that it's contained within which is just
the SolidWorks one and that adds that up
here and we'll call this the task pane
view will also comment these
and then we will need obviously our own
interface our own UI so the thing that
we add to the the task pane on the right
so let's just go over here quickly
right-click on the project
add new item or in fact you can just
click user control here's a shortcut and
let's call it task pane host UI
that just creates a new blank UI new
user control if you right-click on they
use the hosted control file and click
view code you can see it's just a class
that's a user control and does nothing
the initialized components is the
default constructor for the behind code
behind file you can see here they just
create the user control to all basic
stuff so that's the user control we're
going to inject so this actual control
that you'll see when you double click on
the file this is the control we'll see
when we come to load it up sites just
click in toolbar over here and then
button now let's just add a button and
just as simple as that let's just drag
out a little bit I just place a simple
button purely for visual we're not going
to do anything with it we're just going
to show that we know we have a button
and that will do this for now so we need
a variable of this type of this control
because we're going to create an
instance of it so we need a variable of
task pane host UI and this is the actual
task pane itself or well it's the
control that's going to go inside of it
and then want a instance of SolidWorks
itself which is SLD works I just call it
M SolidWorks location and think finally
we will need when we register our add-in
so the thing that's going to appear on
the right hand side the task pane
it needs a unique ID and it's some way
to differentiate between your ID in and
every other add-in so we need a unique
ID for that we're going to do a private
constant string and we're going to call
it solid work task pane frog ID I'm
going to call this one angel sip stock
SolidWorks dot um one add-in and that'll
do for now I mean we can go a bit more
specific and do dot task pane host or
task pane it makes no difference real
it's just a unique name that you can
make up we now need to set this ID to
the user control so if you right-click
on the host you are IM view code then in
the top of this class here on to open a
square bracket type frog ID again
control and period to give you the
suggestion of where that is stored which
is in run time in drop services
open your normal parentheses and then we
want to now you can see it's asking for
a unique ID we want to reference this so
actually we're gonna have to make that
public so that we can access it so let's
just move that outside of private
members a new one
here so to access that we just need to
do tasks pane integration dot SW task
pane prog ID why did you say wash task
pane integration
and then this is just setting the prague
ID to that string and then this user
control gets the prague ID and then when
you'll see when we come to construct the
add-in in a moment that we effectively
inject this user control by simply
passing in this ID you can't just create
an instance of this in c-sharp and then
pass it into SolidWorks because
SolidWorks is working over comm it's not
working directly with us so we have to
do everything through comm and the way
that that will workers will pass this ID
off to comm and then SolidWorks will go
ahead and try and find this class in our
DLL because we made our assembly comm
visible so it can then search this DLL
and find this class because we've tagged
it here and then SolidWorks will then
create this for us so the reason we need
this idea so that SolidWorks can find
this class through comm so that's all
the variables we need next we need to
implement the I SolidWorks interface so
a quick way of doing that again click
over anywhere inside here control + dot
and implement interface let's go ahead
and snug it inside of this so let's just
move it outside
so these are the functions that we need
to be a SolidWorks adding at minimum we
need to respond when we're told to
connect and we need to do something when
we disconnect just wrap this up in a
nice region comment this one and then
this is the current instance and current
soiler words cookie and then for the
disconnect copy and paste the comment
oops
so these two functions get called by
SolidWorks so we don't call these
SolidWorks call these when it opens and
connects and then this is when it's
closing but when you add in as unload in
either way so we now need to do
something inside of these so when we
connect to SolidWorks the first thing we
want to do is store a reference to the
solid work instance so that we can
actually do things with sorry works so
did we not make a reference to the valid
I'm sorry works application so the
SolidWorks application is and it says
SolidWorks is the type of object and
this SolidWorks it's also doing there is
casting this object to what we know is a
SolidWorks instance and storing it so
now this is where we access SolidWorks
from this is sort of the entry point
into doing anything with SolidWorks and
stole the cookie ID as well
and yet an integer there we go
now one other thing we need to do is we
need to set call backs these will come
into play later on but this is just a
standard thing you want to do is to
settle a call back to our application so
we want the SolidWorks application I
think it's set at in callback info I'm
Michael handle add-ins cookies okay
let's use the second one should work
fine module handle for now is nothing
the adding call box is going to be
ourselves we don't have any callbacks
yet but we're just getting it ready to
set up so that in future we can you know
handle callbacks if we like and we know
the cookie is this so right now this one
we like do anything for us in this
add-in but again in future we can then
change this and we've got the location
where we want to then do certain
callbacks you know get certain events
but again that will come into play later
on you could also check a bit succeeded
here which we're not going to for now
and then we want to inject our UI so
this is where we want to create the task
pane and at our UI so I'll make a new
function block called load UI again
hover over the function control dot
enter and that's like a quick way of
just typing the function for us fill in
this function in a minute
and we'll move it into another region
and that's all there really is to this
connected to the SolidWorks we store the
details we register a callback we load
our UI so I want to return true that
everyone's okay so that's the connect on
disconnect in a similar fashion there's
very little to do here we just want to
unload our UI in essence so there's the
blank function that we'll fill out in a
minute and same here return true that
everything went okay just a comment
there so that's the connect and
disconnect on so right now we're
effectively a valid add-in we don't do
anything we'll crush with these throats
in here but we're a valid Adam once
we've done these two functions so well
load and SolidWorks won't complain so
now we just want to inject this UI this
user control we've made task pane host
UI into the actual task pane view for
this add-in so to do that we want to
well there's a single call I think it is
well it will be in SolidWorks
application and it is the create task
pane yeah create task pane view so this
call is what registers a task pane it
creates the task pane on the right hand
side you can see it's after an image and
then a tooltip and that's all it's
asking for so for an image let's go
ahead and add an image to this project
so right click on the project over here
add and then you can go ahead and create
an image your PNG or JPEG a bitmap I
think it accepts all three make sure
it's no wider or no larger than 40 by 40
pixels because that's about the maximum
size you can have and then in your
project right-click add existing item
and browse for that image so I've gone
ahead and created one which you can use
if you're following this get repository
I've placed it into resources images and
they all change this drop-down to all
and you can see I've called it logo
small so just my little angel sects logo
that's a really bad view of it better
baby just hover over so you can see
they're there the logo and that is I
believe I've made it about 30 something
about 37 by 32 pixels so now we need to
pass the path into that on this machine
so firstly we want to copy this image to
the same location as the DLL the actual
atom when it's compiled so with the icon
selected here make sure you copy to
output folder or copy up a directory is
copy of newer or copy always whichever
and that will just make sure that this
image is going to be in the same
location as this add-ins dll file so
that when we want to reference e we can
find out where the DLL is and then
simply pass in this name and it will
give us the the full system path that
you will the path on the computer to
where that images and then we simply
pass that path in here so all this is
asking for is a path on the the physical
computer to an image so like C Drive
users luke pictures and something you
could pass in it you know get hard type
a path into here such as you know like
as we've seen C Drive users Luke
pictures some image JPEG and that worked
perfectly fine if there's an image there
so all we're doing is finding out where
we're now going to get this logo small
from and it's like I say it's going to
copy to effectively this folder but to
the output folder when we compile so we
have a look at the add in here's the
code we're working on right now when we
compile when we build it goes into the
bin folder and then debug in this folder
will have if we just comment that out so
we can build
that will have the dll and look it's
copied the image as well so when we
register this dll we're just going to
leave it in this folder for now then we
know if we find out where we are where
this actual DLL itself is we can then
just give it a name logo small so let's
find that folder called image path and
that's going to be path and then that's
in control dot and you'll see using
system in out we're gonna have to
combine two paths the first part is
going to be the directory name of this
Assembly's codebase so all you need to
do to find where this assembly is where
this dll is is just pass in type off and
then just the name of say this class
it's anything that's inside this whole
project so we'll use this task pane
integration dot assembly code base so
this little part here effectively finds
out where this task pane integration is
which is in this project which compiles
to this dll then is finding the code
base so it's actually going to find this
exact file itself it's also going to
then get the directory name so it's
going to going to remove this and you're
gonna end up with a path to here you can
end up with this path here is what
that's going to get but you're also
going to have a file colon backslash to
the text so we'll simply remove that so
we'll move file colon backslash with
nothing so it's just a normal so you do
get this exact path otherwise you'd end
up with file colon backslash like that
that's just how it references their code
base so this essentially this part here
just gets as the location of this this
project so that's the first part
and there's last part is to simply
include the name of the image which is
here if this were inside another folder
if we created a folder in here add
folder then you'd actually have to
include the folder name as well here so
that we'll get as the path to the image
so we're now going to have an icon in
the task pane as well we call the create
task pane passing the image path and
then a tooltip when you hover over the
task pane so we'll just say all I first
SolidWorks out in so that will create
the task pane but it won't create the
our UI so create a task pane but they'll
be noting anything at all there won't be
any UI so we now want to inject this UI
into the newly created task pane let's
first comment this
so two other UI this is what I mentioned
it's now going to look at this prog ID
to find this user control and then
SolidWorks will create it for as an
injective so we need to pass in this
prog ID so to do that we do am touched
pain host which is the variable that
we're going to save for this UI in so
you can see that's that of this type we
haven't created yet but it is going to
be I'm going to cast it to this type the
task pane view which we've just created
here that's good point we need to
actually save that task pane view into
the variable task pane view so now we
create the task pane view and then using
that task pane view we run out of
control and then you can see is asking
for the class name which is the prog ID
the prog ID is the class name if you
will and there's no license for this so
it's just string or empty but to shoot
it on that there
and that's all there is to it so this
will now tell SolidWorks to go ahead and
find the class that's inside this dll
with that ID and then inject it into the
UI and that literally is all there is to
starting up the add-in and now having
this UI load so that's the job done with
loading the UI now I'm to clean off the
task pane when we disconnect so inside
here and now because the task pane host
is a c-sharp object so it's not got an
issue with comm at least this reference
isn't anyway the solid will create a
comm instance and that'll clean it up
for us
but this instance in our code is not
comm object it's it's actually a
reference to our class here so there's
no issue with disposing of that
information so all's we need to do for
that you don't even really need to do
this this is just over precautious
simply set it to nothing then the task
pane view however is you click on task
pane view and hover over it you can see
it's part of the SolidWorks API which is
calm so we need to be careful we do need
to clean this up properly so to do that
firstly want to do task pane view I want
to delete the view which is going to
clean up the comm reference to this the
instance it created of our UI that's
going to clean up the view in the tasks
pane
and then we want to actually release the
memory so to do that you need a Marcel
marshal we don't control dot and that's
in runtime interrupts Marshall dot I
release comm object I'm going to pass in
the task pane view and that's going to
do the this comm reference and clean up
memory and then finally again just to be
sure there's no references we just clean
up this our own reference and make sure
it's not so that's it that's now cleaned
up so that's the whole adding done there
now in order to get that add-in to load
into SolidWorks we need to register it
via comm so we need the registry windows
regedit to actually recognize this class
and actually make it a comm objector the
way that comm works as it reads the
registry for class IDs and finds out you
know the idea of a certain class and
then loads it in so to do that we need
to create some comm register functions
and unregister functions and then we can
go ahead and register it so we'll call
this a regions with comm registration
and we'll make a doesn't need to be a
public function just needs to be static
call it comm register pass it a tie
and then we need to flag this with an
attribute of comm register function so
that when you call rare jasm it knows
where to find this function on what to
do so when you call reg Azzam and then
pass in this dll it will find this
function and call this function so it'll
register the dll is calm and then this
is the additional step and in this
additional step we want to add this
add-in to the Solid Works registry so
that we found in SolidWorks in the
add-in menu so by default if you
register this has comm that's fine it
will work but we need to do some custom
code because as well as being accessible
and calm we want to appear as an add-in
inside of SolidWorks so we want to find
the path to where we want to add this
key which is
software SolidWorks add-ins and then um
in fact let me do a string format here
instead so I can format this gooood
properly so this is the path to our
add-in so this comrades going to be our
type and this is the GUI devour add-in
so this is effectively the registry
entry in the local machine that we want
to create so it's inside local machine
software SolidWorks add-ins and then
this will be our do it for this
application and now we want to add that
to the registry so just do using a
registry key equals 130 to registry
local machine and I'm going to create
this key that we've just made so that
we'll go ahead and create this folder VL
in the registry and now inside of that
we want to set our add-in values so the
first one the default value so if you
pass null this is a boolean a viewer
like a 0 or a 1 of whether to load on
startup so we pass one here load
I then when sorry works opens so we set
at the zero we won't so we want it to
open our air task pane as soon as we
open SolidWorks then you can set the
title and description so set value title
so not in and description and there's
the description and the tile which
appear in the SolidWorks add-ins menu
when you look at the add-ins these are
the two things that will appear in that
list now we just need to unregister
comments first
again a private static void is fine and
it's a calm and register again we'll get
the tight past in common register
function con and register call to remove
our so now we just need to reverse this
this is like the install and the
uninstall of your will of the ID n so
whatever we did here we just need to
make sure we reverse so we just need to
remove that path so we just want to get
the same path and then we just want to
match up so Lesley dart delete subkey
tree so we delete everything that's
inside of it
I'm not so
and that's it that's the whole add-in so
if we press ctrl shift and B for build
is it built successful and that in a
nutshell is the whole add-in so we can
expand on this but this the set up this
whole sort of setup here which stays the
same for the most part throughout once
you've done this once that's it you've
got your add-in then you can focus on
your actual code you know you can make
this UI then you can do things with the
UI you've got a reference to SolidWorks
that you can do what you like with so
this is sort of the hard work and this
is it's not that hard it's now done and
out the way don't worry too much if you
don't fully understand this it's you can
really just follow along if you like get
it running and then just go ahead and
tweak the UI change the you know the
names of your add-ins and things like
that as perfectly fine that'll that'll
work but like it's not overly
complicated when we run reg azzam this
gets called when we run it to uninstall
this gets called we just add our
instance here to the SolidWorks registry
which is what SolidWorks looks for when
it loads it searches these this add-ins
part of the registry he finds the ID if
it's told to load on startup it will and
then using this ID it will then look at
the comment Rees in the registry and
effectively find our comm entries so we
can find this dll and then it will load
the dll it will then call connect to
SolidWorks from the deal I'll have to
create in an instance of ourselves which
will then run this code which will then
fire their load UI which will then
create the task pane and then we defer
back to SolidWorks to create an instance
of of this UI so the whole thing will
in a nice little loop again you don't
really need to understand it fully
because you can just use this code and
get it working and then go from there so
ctrl shift B builds that's going to
build to your so this is your solution
that you created if you don't know where
it is just right-click on this project
here and open folder in File Explorer
then it goes into the bin and because
we're in debug mode here you go into the
debug folder and there's the dll that is
now the add-in and this is the image
we're going to use now to register that
so to actually get Windows to call this
comm register function you can do it
yourself manually and you can just open
command prompt you'd have to run as
admin and then you could go to Windows
Microsoft net framework 64 because run a
64 bit version the version 4.0 reg azzam
is the thing that's going to run the
register that's then going to call these
functions for us forward slash code base
which means it's a fixed location
there's only a single DLL for our add-in
and then the path to this add-in which
would be here so you can right-click
with shift pressed copy is path paste it
in and you can just press ENTER and run
this exact code and that will register
our DLL now this is caused a lot of
issues in the past so many people have
issues with making sure for one the
running this is admin if I run this now
it won't work so an error occurred when
writing registry information admin
privileges our permissions are needed so
you've got issues for one you have to
then right-click on command prompt
right-click again run as admin confirm
you know there's a lot of things you
have to do and then people sometimes go
into the wrong folder they go into
framework or they go into the wrong
version just in general it's a headache
so you can register it yourself that way
instead what I've done again if you copy
the github folder or if you just look in
the link of this video I'll put a link
there's a tool I've made call that an
installer
and you can go from run this tool add an
installer and use each spins up it
automatically finds SolidWorks it
automatically finds the correct Rajat
reg azzam and all you need to do is
click browse here and go to your dll so
if we go to SolidWorks API tutorials the
add-in we've just created and we go to
this ad in which we said which is um
backwards now to where we were
this is this add-in we just simply click
install now you see the atom was
installed successfully you can look at
the source code to this tool it's all
free it's all on github so you can see
what it's done but effectively just find
SolidWorks to make sure you have
SolidWorks in general it doesn't use it
in any way just make sure you've got it
fans ready awesome for you and then it
just calls Reggie awesome forward slash
code base forward slash than this path
and then it checks what the response is
and gives you a nice message if it was
installed correctly so you can uninstall
as well so just a nice visual easy way
of installing your add-in saves any
confusion you basically open this click
browse select the add-in click install
and that's all there is to it
so that's has add-in now installed so we
go ahead and open SolidWorks we should
see our add in as well as our logo and
our button so let's see what happens
and there you can see our ad in here I
think you see our description first
class pain and you click will my first
ad in and there's the button which
actually does nothing yet but you can
see already we've we've managed to get
the ad in fully working go to tools and
add-ins you can see here my add-in and
you can see the path to the DLL which is
the path to our DLL and there you go
that's the that's the add-in fully
loaded and ready to use so that's it for
this video the next video I think I will
refactor this code so that instead of
having to write this code I'm going to
make it nice and easy so if somebody can
just create a new project reference
what's going to become a new sort of SDK
if you will for the SolidWorks API that
I'm going to create that makes things
easier and you could just create a new
class and just say dot create add-in or
even just flag maybe an attribute on
here that just says SolidWorks add in
something like this and pass a title and
a description and that's it you won't
need to do any of this while this whole
code will go and it'll be nice and
simple once we've done that we'll then
get into actual SolidWorks code we'll
start doing things like you know when
you click this button actually do things
and that's wrong get into the actual
SolidWorks API if you liked this video
please like it it's very important you
get some people that don't like a video
we'll just don't like people being
successful and they'll click dislike
that's a lot less likely that when
people like videos they never bother to
like them so even if people enjoy them
it's the only way I can tell is if
people like the video it also helped
boost views and and then you'll get more
videos as well so like and subscribe
this video if you enjoyed it and
there'll be more to come
Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
