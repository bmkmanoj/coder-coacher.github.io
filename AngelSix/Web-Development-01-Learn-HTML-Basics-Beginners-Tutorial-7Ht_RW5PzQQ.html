development I'm going to go through all
of the web development technologies
starting with HTML which is really the
starting point so we're gonna be doing
HTML CSS JavaScript asp.net that you
know the whole works of technologies but
really before you can do much with any
web technologies you need to know the
underlying structure of a website and
that always starts with really HTML so
we're gonna make HTML page in this video
we're not going to go too much into
depth into anything so we're going to
keep it nice and broad and talking
really about just the structure of a
HTML document a little bit of detail
about why certain things are the way
they are but then we're not going to go
into great depth about each element and
each thing we're showing I'll then break
that up into smaller videos so hopefully
the web series will be a lot more of
shorter videos touching on specific
points initially to get the basics out
of the way
and building up to a complete website
but websites can be made in in you know
bite-sized chunks so hopefully these
videos might be a little bit shorter
than you know the other videos we do
where we simply can't show concepts as
quickly so let's get straight into it
and we will start with creating an HTML
page so in order to display anything on
a browser and again not exactly required
or is typically you need a HTML page so
we'll just right click create new
document and I've just created a text
file I'm just going to call this test
and then it's going to go over and
rename the dot txt to dot HTM and
confirm and now this is a website or
rather a web page so we just double
click on this file it will open up the
browser and a big white screen so that's
ready in the browser and we right-click
or rather not right like you don't have
to put in terms of editing HTML files we
could right-click and open with say
notepad and simply start typing away so
I did say h1
test and this is not technically a
valley page but we'll show a header and
if we go to the web page and refresh
you'll see test let me just quickly turn
on this toggle so it's not black it's
not all white screen so you can see
already a browser so Firefox is quite
happily now displaying a header so we
have a web page here if you will and
we've got the file
so the first thing is what do we then
create this file and do we use no part
and do we use Visual Studio the answer
really is there's the so many editors
you can use to edit HTML some people
like a full-blown are ye like we like
Visual Studio for code development
personally myself for HTML files are
that simple
I would typically just huge notepad but
in order to have a nicer editor we can
use Visual Studio code if you don't have
it already just download it and then
just open up visual studio code and then
you can open a file with ctrl o and then
select the test file that we just made
and this now opens up in Visual Studio
code so now we can just edit in here and
you can see it's got some basic helpers
here for a ballot document so just
delete what we've done there and before
we start working on HTML document view
go to where are we in Visual Studio code
extensions as this button here there's a
few extensions that I'd installed to
make this nicer work so one is called
HTML hint so we type in HTML hint then
in fact if I go to just installed I
should be able to see what I've got
installed and I'm sure it's both hasty
amount into there we go
so HTML hint is one word if you search
and install this it gives you some basic
helpers on what we just saw like you
know some valid HTML to make sure or not
making any obvious mistakes so we
installed HTML hint you'll get these
kind of hints there if you will and then
one more install is called live server I
believe which is here and the icon looks
like there
and also scissors a mini browser so it
pops up a survey it like makes a mini
server for your file so every time you
edit it in Visual Studio code it will
update automatically in the browser so
if we go ahead and install both of those
and restart Visual Studio
you'll have the same extensions and as
I've got and then if we now go to this
file let's first make it valid then
we'll start up there the server to start
viewing it so all hey CH tml documents
this is similar to WPF and structure but
it's an XML style structure all HTML
page you should start with curly
brackets like this let's say angle
brackets just like WPF does and the hair
there's always an exclamation mark and
then capital doctype which is obviously
for document type and then a lowercase
HTML and you can see this extension I'm
thinking this is HTML hint that's doing
this giving you options to do certain
things and you click and it's actually
made the whole document for us there but
we will delete why has it done it here
oh it's not removed for I typed so if
you type just this and you can see it's
gone and dumped all this in for us so
I'm just gonna delete that but you start
with a doctype HTML and that defines
that this document is a HTML file what
you will find in the web though is that
as we saw a minute ago I don't have to
type this I can just type anything I
want in and the browser's are very good
at simply I can all in errors and
showing web pages from it so you can
unlike C show often or you know compiled
languages where you can't make an error
in HTML you can technically type
anything you like and it will always get
displayed in the browser and it will
simply get displayed randomly or not the
way you expect if you've typed something
wrong so you should always type valid
HTML but if you wanted Reno if you just
say oh our minds work without it that
doesn't always mean it's valid or it's
it's good it just means that you now
might have unexpected behavior so bottom
line is all HTML files start with
doctype HTML this is simply a set
definition that's just what your type
then below that you want to again for
really for sticking with valid and
accurate HTML you want to tell it what
language this current webpage is in and
this is for things like so browsers and
search engines and localization to just
give that hint to search engines and
things of what languages within the
document and I'm going to do Eng B for
Great Britain or if you're in the u.s.
at B en-us and then we closed or rather
we don't close we open the tag so in
HTML you'll notice the element here has
simply been opened and closed and it
doesn't have this pair the similar into
WPF when you do things like well any
elements in WPF in zamel you have your
opening tags this is an opening tag
where you basically have a lesser than
arrow then the name of this element
which is HTML this is an attribute so
thick anything that comes inside of to
the first set of angle brackets other
than the first element which is always
the name everything abducts and
attributes this is called an attribute
this is called the element and this is
basically the start tag which is the
lesser that in gray to them so it's
wrapped in a tag and then you finish it
with a closing tag which is exactly the
same thing except you put a forward
slash after the first bracket so if I
were to do say a paragraph it would look
like that so we have you know an opening
tag the name of the element the closing
tags that forms the start tag and then
the end tag is the same you do the
opening angle bracket a forward slash
and then the name and a close and this
is again I say identical to WPF and
generally in XML documents and then the
content sits inside like there so
structure wise when you see writing HTML
some of them you'll notice this is a
special case where you simply have no
ending so it's just one special tag
button in almost all cases you'll see a
start and a closed tag and again there
are elements that don't require that all
do it differently but for the most part
this is what you expect
you know an element named open it and
then close it in the content inside so
now we've got a HTML document and we've
defined that it's an English document
and the type is HTML and now inside the
HTML so will tab in this is now where
you construct the real document the
thing that's gonna get displayed in the
browser and really you've got two parts
to this one's called the head and one's
called the body and the head defines
things like the title of this window or
on web pages it defines the title of the
web page it also defines any styles you
have in for visual style in the class
any JavaScript you have for doing code
any metadata for search engines and
other things so the head is all the non
visual non-direct elements that form the
visual web page that you're looking at
so we put the head in and again you have
to have a head it's always got to be
there for a valid document and then
interesting to see what this is
complaining about right so just a hint
yeah so you've got your head and inside
that the most obvious one first one is
title so this is for my website and now
our web page should have a title of my
website and you'll notice again the
indents and not necessarily inlands they
don't really represent they're the order
they should do but if you keep track of
when you've opened a tag everything
inside this until the closing tag is
inside the HTML element you open the
head so everything then inside of the
head is you know it's inside of had
before the closing tag so right now we
have a tiered document going down so you
got your HTML file that's got a head and
inside the head it's got a title and now
the body is separate to the head so
again that you can see the line here of
think of it as indenting going further
in you know if you have a book that
contains pages and then pages contain
words you'd have you know a book with
pages and potentially page one and then
you'd have some words that type of
structure so you know it's as you're
going in this is you know your pages are
here so everything inside gets paid you
should have
page one and then page two here so these
are children of the pages so this pages
has now got a list of elements and they
are page 1 and page 2 each page has got
words and then the book has pages or you
could simply remove pages and directly
put pages within the book but the point
of this is and what I'm trying to
explain here is there's an order to you
know it's a structured document it's a
tiered document it's not just all
flatware it doesn't matter where you put
things it's all about the structure so
the HTML has to have a head and a body
so that the head goes here the body then
comes below and then you can see that we
haven't put body inside the head for
example you know the body doesn't go
there inside the head that the body is
separate it's in line with the head it's
the both of the body and the head are
contained in HTML and that's simply
defined by you know the order that you
specify and these opening and closing
tags so every time you open a tag you
should technically indent the next item
until you're done and then it comes back
out so you can visibly see in a line
then that's you know head and body or in
you know next to each other the siblings
and the parent as HTML so hopefully that
makes sense if not as you can also watch
our video on WPF basics that I did and
the kind of explains this as well it's
all a very similar structure
it's basically an XML structure so we've
got HTML head title and body so in the
body let me just literally route the
word test for now and save and let's get
this visual going so we can start seeing
what we'll write and visually so one way
you can do that is to simply go to here
open your test file and you can see it
here and you can see that it says my web
site in the header so I make that a lot
bigger you know there's those your text
there's your title but the problem with
that is now if we go back to visual
studio code when we say type test2 and
save and we drag this across and put
this that side
you can see that this hasn't updated
never got to refresh the browser page so
that is giving it quite annoying so the
point of installing the live server
extension that we did a minute ago is
because now if you look at the bottom
here you got a skill live button so we
click the go live button it will spin up
a little server and open it in the
browser for you and you can see it's
basically a the localhost and then a
port five 500 and then the name of the
document but the difference between this
one and this one is now this one is live
so I assume this one in maybe two 200
and I change back in Visual Studio I
change us to test three and save you can
see this automatically updates and the
file we open manually stays the same so
all we've done here now then is spun off
with kick clicked the go live button
that's down here when you're in the
document and then it opens up this page
in the browser and now you can type on
this side and see it happen in this side
so we can already see now we have a
title of a web page so ever I do my web
page too and save you can see the web
page title updates and now we're into
the body which is where though you know
the actual website starts to be
constructed so moving into the body then
we tab in and inside the body we've got
a lot of different elements that we can
add that make up a website and they
range from you know headers photos
paragraphs images lists selections you
name it as there's a huge amount of
elements that form a web page so this
video the introduction is really not to
go into detailed explanations about each
you know how you'd style each one of
them the variations why they used what
they useful in great detail it's more
just about getting you to get the
environment set up getting you familiar
with you know the structure um if you've
placed this here the inside of head it's
not inside of it's inside of HTML it's
not inside of the head and what the
heads used for which is basically all
the stuff that
physically in the body stuff like the
header and the included files and to go
about then adding elements how he'd add
them you know how you'd open it up and
then we'll we'll do future videos on
going into specifics of elements and you
know focus on one element at a time and
break it down so that you get a feel for
how you do it and then once we've got
familiar with all of these elements the
general structure of a HTML and then how
we start styling the documents in CSS
and interacting the JavaScript the
videos will then go to longer videos
where we start creating a real website
and this will be fully functional live
website when we're done and what we'll
start with we were gonna do a video on
making the Fassett Oh word chat
application website which we still do
but I think in order to be able to
create the UI the actual website for
that you need a lot of knowledge behind
first on how to make a general website
before we go into full-blown chat
application website so we're end up
making two websites we're going to make
one that's for just a local company I'm
going to do the work for free and I'm
gonna make them a website and then
you'll see the whole website done you'll
see it live it will be a real website
and real working and you'll see the
entire source code of how to do that and
then once we've done that we'll move on
to making the actual UI for the Fassett
a word application so we're gonna make
two full websites but this first one
will be a more what I'd say static
website it's simply a almost a portfolio
or a website that doesn't have
constantly changing content like blogs
and things like that so we'll get
started with this we've got the body and
as I said there's lots of different
thing you can put inside the body so one
is a header so if you type h1 is your
element and it will open and close
before you I think I've also got an
extension for that actually I think it's
called Auto something Auto close tag I
think so if you install this Auto close
tag as well then when you're typing arc
h1 close it adds automatically adds the
closing tag for you at the end otherwise
you just have to type that yourself
we didn't have that installed they might
had a they'd have to close it like this
so if you install that extension it
should close them for you so this now is
the first element inside of the body of
the webpage so because this is right
here you know it's it's inside the body
this is now a correct valid HTML
document if we save you can see the head
has now appeared and there's nothing to
reference it around to see how big it is
or what it is because it's the only
elements but a header and specifically a
h1 is the largest header by definition
that it's meant to be h1 as the most
important header so we copy and paste
that line a few times two three four
five six six of them and we change this
to had a three at a fall at a five had a
six and also change the closing tags and
then save you can see we have a big list
of headers that by default to simply go
down in size so depending on you
shouldn't really make a header depending
entirely on size because that's the
point of HTML is to define a structure
of a document is not to define the style
so you can it has a little bit of
similarity between what would in in WPF
where we're talking about like view
models and actual views and separating
the concern of a visual view with the
rep you know the structural
representation if you will so truly
speaking a page tml document should have
no no definition of a UI or specific
visual elements that you should simply
define what's expect he doesn't overall
so we expect her to want to be generally
representing at you know a large header
then the most important header and
header to is less important had a three
is even less important and so on so
that's all that this should really
define so if you wanted a head of this
big with a subtitle this big you
shouldn't do head of one and had a six
what you should do is do a head of one
and head of two and then you should
style header two to be the size that you
like
but again that's getting too
that for an initial video but else
that's just a brief description of just
because you'll visually see something
here min all these elements doesn't mean
that that's the way you have to look and
nor should it mean that you structure
your document based on that because as
you'll see as we go forward we'll style
all these elements completely separate
so we have had us here if you want to do
comments in HTML it's basically a
less-than angle bracket exclamation two
minus signs and then a closing tag for
that is two minus signs and a greater
than so it's a bit of a different style
of writing it's similar to this special
tag here where it's kind of the opening
one starts for the next formation as
well as then a name and this is really
the name is simply two dashes in this
case so you'll get used to type in that
anyway and you'll remember and now in
here you can type a comment so I'll say
headings then after headers so you just
want some text so let me just remove a
few of these first so doesn't fill up
the screen after headings let's put some
text so in general when you're writing
on a website or you've got some text to
display you'd write a paragraph as it's
called so a P element is short for
paragraph and then this is a paragraph
of text and save that and you can see
there's a paragraph of text and you can
see in relation to the headers as well a
general size but again don't rely on
this being the final size it simply
gives you an overall this is styled by
the browser's so if we open this an
internet explorer it might look
different because each browser has its
own default style so we will put here
paragraph after a paragraph you've got
say you wanted I have a link to a
website of Google so in here you can say
I sprayed on a paragraph again and this
is a link to Google and then we'll put
inside here an a element
so we're doing a element like this and
say click here and save so all's we've
done is we've now put an a element and
Anchor which is a link inside of P
because you can see we haven't closed
the P tag yet so because we've opened P
then put some content then included a
inside of it effectively a is inside of
P a structure but if we save this you
can see we've made an anchor but there's
no doesn't do anything when you click
because you have to tell the anchor
where to go so in the anchor as an
attribute which if you remember from the
HTML up here anything inside of the
opening tag of an element is an
attribute so in here we do hate ref
which is the name of the attribute and
that simply means the reference where
the link is going to go when we click it
put equals and then put two quotes
because we're going to define a string
and this will be HTTP WL comm save and
now you can see it's turned into a
website link that when we click takes us
to Google so we'll put a comment on here
and this is links anchors that's how you
spell anchors maybe correct me if I'm
wrong and do for now
we have next we have images so for this
we're gonna have to find an image to
link to to show an image so bear with me
a second we'll find an image so I found
a little image here of my dog I've got a
little fog so it's a big huge image but
we're gonna include it anyway to show
you so to include an image I've noticed
off places in the same folder as the HTM
file so we can reference e relative by
just typing image JPEG so that's where
it is now in here to do an image simply
open it tag IMG which is short for image
and then insert I mentioned at the start
certain elements don't always need to
have image open image flows like this
and the reason for that is an image
contact
directly in here you can't define the
image while you can but again in general
you shouldn't you can't define an image
element by simply putting data in here
so therefore you don't have an image
element opening and closing a tag like
this all you do is make a shorthand so
instead of having to type image open and
close the tag then oh you know doing an
open close end tag simply delete that
one and you end it with just forward
slash angle bracket and that's now
defined an image just like you've
defined a piece where you do this and
you've got an opening and closing this
time the closing simply shorthanded and
just you put a forward slash at the end
of the first tag
so that's define an image so we save
can't see anything because we haven't
defined where it is similar to the link
so now I need to say well where's my
image so for this Chatard SRC which is
short the sauce I believe same as the
link point as a string and type an image
JPEG and when we save now it's an
absolutely massive picture that we need
to shrink down a bit so we've got an
attribute of source and here in order to
shrink this down I will just simply type
another attribute for width I'll say
equals 500 there's an integer and now
this is technically not what you want to
do the value of attribute W must be used
in double quotes so even though it's an
integer like in c-sharp you'd expect to
type it in HTML you'd expect it you know
the attributes value to be in quotes and
now you can see there's my image and
look how handsome here's so there's a
500 wide image and then the height is
automatically adjusted so again there's
loads of things you can do with images
but for now that's just a quick way to
show you how to place an image you know
a website as well I will know that this
is a definite no-no to place an 8
megabyte file as an image in our website
but that's for future videos when we
come to handle optimizing websites and
making sure that images are as
compressed as possible and
only as large as the you know they need
to be all things like that but for now
that's all we need to know about an
image so we have images next we'll have
well let me define because of things
that we come to after words are going to
start doing what's called inline versus
block in the layout so when we talk
about block elements we're talking about
things like the headers and the
paragraphs where basically we place a
header than another header and they
appear below each other because each of
them is a block and it takes off the
whole width of the web page so each
header and each paragraph is a full
block so we make the width of this image
50 and after the image we place say ass
farm which we haven't come to but will
and I save you can see even though these
are below each other both of these
elements an image and a span are what's
called inline so they only take up the
desired amount of space they don't go
all the way over and then start a new
line so a block element takes up the
entire width of the document and an
inline element will simply fall in line
as it suggests with the you know each
element next to it so we can just copy
and paste 3 or 4 times and they'll just
keep lining up until they get to the
very end where they'll then rollover and
carry on so there's inline vs. block and
the simplest way to show this in line
versus block a paragraph is your most
classic block element for simply text so
this is a paragraph and we save that
we'll see it's on a new line if we copy
and paste two of them you'll see you
have two lines a span on the other hand
is basically a you know a similar to a
paragraph to simply put text within
doesn't have to be text a span can be
anything oh it's a generalized
element for placing content inside it's
inline so this is block this is gonna
become inline so
this is a spa and if we copy and paste
two of those you'll see that like the
example above that we just did these two
are now in line with each other
they fall one after the other so that's
something to bear in mind as we move
forward with videos if you're wondering
why when we get to styling elements or
placing you know alum and you're
wondering why why is this not gone on a
new line type of thing why is it merged
anything you might want it to do the
opposite well that's where styling comes
in so you don't define the structure of
your website with the intention of it
being visibly a certain way you should
define it you know more semantically of
your well but there is a very very bad
habit in web developments that still
persists to this day and I almost
guarantee that 99% of all web developers
still do this where they will define
something in an element purely for the
sake of it being a visual representation
so if they were expecting a new line
we'll define something with a paragraph
or they might even say oh I wanted these
two spans to be you know below each
other so they'll put a break in to
basically force it onto a new line like
this and these are bad habits these are
not what you should see and all we
should do but I'll guarantee you will
see it happening and just bear in mind
that it's not really the way that it
should be done so if you're doing it a
hundred percent correct and clean and
the the way we want it a lot of this
stuff we will do in these videos you
will find online again 99% of people
doing it different ways and that's
simply because they're outdated in there
they used to doing it one way and web
standards are always changing and always
going you know very modern standards
that people just simply don't learn that
they're in a job thee they're doing the
job day in day out they don't constantly
spend the time staying up-to-date with
technology or today with standards so
just because that's the case and just
because you can do it one way and
another way there's a thousand different
ways to do things and websites the way
I'll show you will be as modern as I
know
so as up-to-date designer the web to be
and I'll also explain along the way why
we do you know things we do
so that's what we're gonna do in terms
of Alan he's a perfect example of where
I'm saying one thing can be done one way
or another and I'll leave this up to you
to Google and you have a feel for what
you believes the correct way and post a
comment but a good example of one thing
being done one way and another all over
the web is the break that we just saw so
I mentioned that almost every element in
their webpage has an opening tag and a
closing tag and if he doesn't then at
least has an opening tag with a closing
shorthand tag but then you get to a
situation like this where you have a
break line so we put Br and we end it
with a tag but what you'll also notice
in C is that if we copy that a few terms
or copy it once more I'll keep them all
on new lines but you'll also see people
that do just that which to me would
instantly say while this break is opened
and never closed so therefore I expect
this span to be contained within this BR
and also not closed so to me visually
that looks wrong that is well how do you
know this is ever closed similar to an
image s an image has no content directly
any - but I still expect to see the tag
closed and that is true you have to do
that and an image but you'll notice in
BO it's not giving me an area either way
so that's a good example right there of
where web standards were messed up and
where people started doing it one way
and then a new standard comes and tells
you do it another but it doesn't look
right so I'll leave this little thing up
to you guys to Google and give your
opinion in the video of what you feel is
the correct way of writing be ours which
are basically forcing a new line in text
it's like adding you know literally
pressing enter but actually in the
document so it forces a new line so I'll
leave that one up to you there but
there's those little things to be aware
of in HTML where there's lots of
different ways of doing everything so
carry on working through a few more
elements so another one that's not used
very often in fact it's rarely used as a
horizontal rule so a line straight
through the width of the container in
this case
just the whole document and here's
another example of where you don't close
the tag funnily enough and you'll see
here now we got this big line just a
horizontal rule never we were to put
something below that which we'll do in a
second you'll see it appear below so
this is a horizontal rule and again bear
in mind when you're picking elements to
use in HTML you're not picking them
because you expect it to be a grey line
like this you're picking them
semantically in fact that the document
should have a horizontal rule and by
definition what is a horizontal rule so
it's like you know what do you expect me
to to define in your document that's
again where we come down to semantics in
websites for example an image is going
to display an image but it doesn't say
you know what this technically wouldn't
be in the HTML this would be in a CSS
file so you wouldn't even usually define
the size of an image that'd be in the
style
they'll come clearer when we do more
elements anyway I'll talk about that in
a moment so another one is called the
block quote and this is a block quote
and if we save again you'll see by
default the website styled this block
quote with an indent because that's how
you typically would see a quote with
maybe quotation marks top and bottom if
not it's like a site where it's gone in
but in terms of HTML you'd use a block
quote when you're expecting this to
actually be a quote from somebody so
you're not picking it because it would
be represented this way because we can
style it another way yeah you're
structuring this document because inside
the document potentially you've got a
quote from somebody so you'd use block
quote but the difference between most of
these elements again is not the style
because we could use a CSS style sheet
and make this paragraph this span this
block quote and the headers all look
exactly the same in style and the point
of when you're defining your HTML
document is to simply define the
document as you're making your website
and define it for the content that it is
so if you're making the main content say
a web page has a main content in a
sidebar say for a menu
and yet have probably like a main
element like this and then you'd have an
aside like this that's defining that
it's technically the main content goes
here and the aside goes here
but this doesn't define in any way where
the main is how it looks how its
structured neither does the aside but in
terms of their search engines and all a
eye that's trying to interpret websites
and potentially style them and do
certain things with them they're looking
for these modern structures so again I
don't expect you to fully understand
each one of these will explain them more
in depth and videos but I'm at least
trying to show you most of the basics so
you can at least get a feel for what
tags are available to you so a
blockquote again you typically do if you
have an actual quote to be shown what
else do we have we have a good one it's
for developers say so some code and code
in Visual Studio and like as we're
typing here you'll notice if I type mmm
which is for big words than III I just
smaller
you'll notice they're exactly the same
size and this is called monotone mono
space rather which means the space in
the signs of each character is the exact
same width and we're used to that I'm
visual studio one my typing so we expect
everything to line up and it helps us
visually with what we're doing then in
code so in order to have text that is
expected to be the same width for every
character we can do what's called the
pre which stands for pre formatted no
Lucy or item one equals as to that mm mm
and if we save this you'll see it's now
got a monotone text and it's got a
certain amount of width so if I copy and
paste that twice I change the ITM for
say some chains up the two just so it's
different values different sizes change
that to eyes and you'll see the exact
the same width now if I did the same
thing in just paragraphs then it won't
use monospaced font they'll end up with
this so when you display in code you'd
typically put it inside of a pre block
you've also got code if you want to do
it in line so P when using the and then
open a code block item one and come out
to the code block very well blah blah
blah and you'll see here then we've got
a paragraph which is a block element
that has the content here this is the
content inside the P and we say when
using there and then we actually tag the
item one we wrap it in a code tag just
like we wrapped the link here in the
paragraph so this is inside the
paragraph and then we define code and
code is in line so it doesn't force a
new line stays in line there um P as a
block now pre this one here is also a
block element you'll notice you put two
in row and they'll go on a new line if
we were to put code here you'll see that
code is an inline almond so it won't
start new lines just like the other
elements wouldn't so I quickly do this
and save you'll see now this is the code
part where they've all got in one line
and this is the pre and then I've also
in similar fashion if we change the code
in here to pre you should notice that it
will start a new line so when using
there and then item one variable so you
wouldn't usually do that ship inside a
paragraph you'd use code so again I
don't want to go too much into the
specific differences of of say like pre
versus code because that will be future
videos but in short both of these are
expecting you know mono spaced font
that's by definition it doesn't know
what font is going to use your style but
simply this is semantically sane
content inside here should be
represented with a monospace font the
same with code but the only difference
really is the pre is block so it will go
in new lines and code is in line so it
won't force new lines and that's just a
brief summary again so they'll be more
detail on those in future videos
we've got code elements let's move on to
lists so sometimes you see lists and
websites there's quite a few types of
Lists but the most common used ones in
HTML are unordered and ordered lists so
an unordered list with the you are has
items inside called list items
that's what Ally stands for item one if
we then copy and paste that a few times
why is it indenting the wrong amount
item one two three and save so an
unordered list each item is effectively
not numbered there's no specific order
to this list so therefore it's
representative by default again visually
just with a bullet and you've got a list
of three items you'll notice also that
list items are block items that's why
they start on new lines each time and
the on word list is keeping that list of
items inside a group if you will a
collection so the UL is the list itself
and that Ally is each item and it stands
for unordered list and list item and
then another example of a list so we
simply copy and paste all of that and
paste in not sure why it keeps thinking
this indentation is wrong
so all you do for change from an
unordered to an ordered just change the
parent and save and you now see this
list has been default represented by
actual numbers because that's what we're
expecting an ordered list we don't have
to say this is you know very item one
you don't have to put you know one thing
I can just say item item item and it
will give you you know the numbers
automatically but again we're defining
this purely because we're expecting it
to be either an unordered list or an
ordered and it's it's almost always an
unordered list you'll see this not very
often a case where you need to have a
list that's ordered it doesn't mean that
the browser would display this where the
item three first for example although
you could do that with JavaScript and
some tweaking but it simply as defining
the say an ordered list is expected to
never change order and an order list
even though in 99% of the time shouldn't
change its order technically there's no
no rule saying it has to be in that
order
so again you'll you'll see mostly ul
listed everywhere in sites for lists but
there's also ordered lists and there's
also a few other lists that they use
that infrequently I won't even bother
showing them we've covered links which
we've done up here for you know visiting
other web pages or parts of the same
website and now we've got say some bold
tips so in a paragraph we will say some
and then we'll put B which stands for
bold bold and then outside of text and
so on and then we'll do strong text so
we've done a paragraph that contains
some strong text so we've got a
paragraph that contains this bit of
information here inside the paragraph
and then we've done a sentence it says
some and then we've put bold inside of
this B element and then the words
strongly inside of the strong element
and if we save that and scroll down
you'll see some bold where bold is bold
text and some strong where strong is
also bold and this again that you might
say well what's the difference between B
and strong this kind of brings us on to
a subject that we're going to find hard
to ignore from I'm really trying to
to not go into depth in the video on on
semantics of things but we can't really
ignore it Foley in short you typically
use B when you are making a website
unless you're talking years ago now
where you know the developers of HTML
and the styles and their standards or in
the early days and you'd write something
and you'd have some tax sake or whatever
it was and you want it to be what you'd
call bold now the problem with bold and
the problem with B is 1 B isn't very
descriptive it's just a letter
so really you'd want to say bold but you
don't and 2 is bold is an explicit
declaration bold is saying that I expect
the text to be fatter text it's
explicitly stating for something to be
visually bold and that's not the job of
HTML that the visual element is not the
job of defining you know HTML element
here and to say I expect it to be
visually fatter visually bold so that's
kind of a that's bad practice in HTML
and again I'll guarantee you'll see this
all over the web you may even find it on
some very high-end top web sites so you
might think that oh no the you know the
big guys wouldn't make these mistakes
but trust me they do these are this is
just how it's always been and that's why
it's still around
and it's simply a very slow pace of
moving with the times and doing things
correctly the same in all languages
people have done something one way all
the lives so they do it that way so in
hey Shamal really if you want make
something bold you're making a statement
you expect it to be just like this
visually faster text that's that's not
what you want to do these days instead
you want to state this strong word which
you'll notice by default again bear in
mind that the website styles it default
a certain way doesn't mean that it has
to stay that way but by default strong
has been styled just like bold it's it's
said okay I'll make this text stronger
I'll make it bolder that's fine but the
key difference here is strong is simply
semantically saying that the content
inside here should be stronger than the
surrounding content in some way it's not
saying that it should be faster text
because you might use strong inside of
some of the content it's simply a
statement that again semantically
speaking this content needs to be
stronger and literally that's as far as
it's saying is the word strong is up to
interpretation then of whoever styling
the website whoever's reading the
website it's it's a definition of what
what should there be
it's not saying bold bold as a
definition of an actual visual style
physically making a bold font is a hard
defined style where strong is you know
upper interpretation you can style it
however you like so the developers of a
website decided all strong text wants to
simply be yellow instead of white
instead of black and that's what they're
defining in their you know visual style
or their visual you know structure the
website their styling basically they're
saying now I want I want all strong
elements to be yellow that's fine but if
the HTML was saying be it's kind of just
arguing against the stylesheet so
instead of it saying allow on tall bold
elements to no longer be actually bold
text I just want them to be yellow then
it's kind of a you know a contradiction
so that's why HTML should not make any
kind of definition of hard UI styles and
it's hard to explain and you know the
very first video but it's one of those
things similar to when I started to see
show up videos I was very adamant on
making comments everywhere I'm using
medians and keeping Co clean and at the
start you might not have seen a use for
it or a benefit but as applications grow
when you've got thousands of lines of
code you start to then appreciate these
things so in a similar fashion with HTML
I would say right now you might say well
what's the difference between bold and
strong and it's quicker to type B and I
see be used everywhere in tutorials all
this law that's fine but trust me if you
can make a start on HTML and you do it
the correct way which is things like
constantly thinking that HTML should not
define visual States
and instead you should be simply
semantically stating something a bit
more vague of you know expecting it to
be a certain way then that's gonna
really benefit you when you come to
learn everything else because you'll be
far ahead of most people and web
development you'll have you know more
up-to-date knowledge and again it will
be nicer to see it or be more
semantically structured so we'll move on
from that conversation hopefully I
shouldn't have to keep repeating myself
or simply you make a brief statement
about that but we'll now move on to just
a few more things and then we'll stop
doing videos on specifics so something
else you can do as well as bold we just
copy and paste that will do italic and
this is another good example of when we
define something a certain way and
there's a again this is something I
think you should google and post
comments back on what you believe
because this is also one that's got a
very complicated answer so italic now
the issue comes here I just finish this
off first and put some italic text and
some emphasized I could spell emphasized
text so if we save this and you look
here again you've got italic which is a
slanted font and some emphasized text
which is a slanted font so again that
this is another arguments and again I
really won't go too much in depth here
but it boils down to a similar question
about bold and strong so bold is without
any shadow of a doubt a hard-coded
visual representation a bold font is
expected to be fatter than non bolded
font that's simply the case italic most
people will say is exactly the same
thing and italic font is always going to
have a forward slant compared to a
standard font so therefore is this a
visual style and shouldn't be in HTML or
is it the fact that italic is sometimes
required non visually to give meaning to
the content so does italic content have
a specific meaning regardless of it
being visually shown honor in terms of
bold now bold font is up for
interpretation it
a bold font might mean pay attention to
it or it might be any other reason
doesn't have to don't have a set reason
but the question is does italic and
that's something like I say I'll let you
google but here you can simply see a
very similar statement as bold and
strong emphasis on the other hand is
100% semantic if you want to emphasize
something visually you have a thousand
options there you can put a black
background on you can put a flashing
light on you can make it bolder you can
make it bigger you can do anything you
like visually so therefore HTML define
this content is simply being emphasized
is good because applying emphasis to
something is not a purely visual thing
when you describe you you're emphasizing
something like if I want to emphasize
the statement I can put emphasis on I
can see keep repeating it I can say it
with a more stern voice it's not a
visual only description and that's what
the semantics says it's that you know
that basically that in itself that you
put in description into a word and so
you're emphasized and you're telling it
that this expects to be emphasized
whereas italic if you say something's
italic you can't make your voice italic
you can't talk in an italic way you
can't you know there's the it becomes
the question of is this purely a visual
definition so again feel free to google
that if not just use it as like this I'd
say then use emphasis instead of italic
but then you you know you'll see why if
you just Google that for more info
you'll get the gist of that so again
this is what I call explicitly visual
style this is what I call em semantics
the same as the emphasis so these I'd
say personally are the correct
replacement for these two with special
attention beam on this you might google
it and tell me I'm completely wrong so
go ahead and do a bit of research on
that if you like but there's some bold
and italic you know HTML now we'll just
move on to one element that you'll see a
lot that again is kind of overused but
you will see it and this is the sniff
and dave is really let's see what the
HTML think gives us so a div as an
element has no sir
meaning it represents as children it can
be used within a class blah blah blah so
what does that mean
this means it's it's kind of almost
completely against HTML again the modern
HTML isn't is meant to define the
structure of the document and what's in
it and what each element is representing
but Dave is clearly stating it has no
meaning basically it's saying here's
some hate email content inside of here
the I have no definition about there's
no reason for it so of anything I'd say
this was a group to do nothing more than
group of elements together in the
document that can't be defined in any
other way so if you have elements in the
document and you've got say a group of
photos that are referring to a holiday
and you wanted to put a bunch of images
in here but you want to group them if
you well into you know a holiday group
you could use a day of them but if you
were doing that you know the sidemen you
say well you've got a perfect tag to use
that and this is this aside put on their
full screen so you've got like you know
an aside that you can make use of so
whenever you can define you know HTML
elements that explains the content
within it you should but before again
modern web you didn't have main you
didn't have 40 didn't have a size you
didn't have all these extra tags in HTML
for groups of content you just had
differing so div become the universal
and probably most use HTML element on
the web I could be wrong but I wouldn't
be surprised if it was so you'll see div
a lot and dev is used to group elements
together or to put content with inside
it but also it's it's massively misused
in terms of making CSS styling work so
again we'll see in future when we come
on to styling and we'll probably end up
using this ourselves in style and
because you'll realize that as much as
you want to follow all these plans of
the HTML should not add any style based
elements that define UI you'll find
unfortunately the way that CSS and HTML
are at the minute they're still
transitioning into a state where see
is actually powerful enough to do that
without needing HTML elements so you
will find in future videos that will
have a certain element that wants to be
visually displayed away that we simply
have to add say extra dip so we have to
wrap an image in a div for no other
reason than to get it visually styling
correctly on the website and that's
really like of an annoyance in HTML but
I do not like is that it it's now got a
definition of how it should be and what
you should do but the technology isn't
advanced enough to allow you to do it
pure so you will get some parts of HTML
where as much as we try to stick to
everywhere we can that HTML defines
there you know the layout and CSS does
the styling the will inevitable be a
crossover between the two that you
simply cannot ignore so there's nothing
really more to say on a div other than
it's a you know a general container and
until we get further when and you see
them used so I'm also gonna say I'm on
the div is that you will see them a lot
you will see them used correctly and
incorrectly mostly incorrectly and that
it's simply really somewhere to place
content inside so we did a div with a
span of tests we did two of them and I
still think that indentations messed up
in this document for some reason it
thinks in fact I probably no white
thinks it probably from that bold that
we showed the breakline we showed
somewhere about this thing keep screwing
up there the indentation of my document
for me let's try and paste another one
nope not that anyway some reason my
document keeps misaligning the elements
wanting to force them out so we have a
div with two buttons and you can see
they've got on new lines and we know
span is in line so what that also tells
you is div by default visually is a
block element so it fills the whole
width and goes to new lines so that's
just another little thing to bear in
mind about divs that they they are also
effectively blocks
we will now do a few things that our
input elements of you will from the user
so once a button that you define by
typing the word button as you and
element name and then inside you put the
contents or the same I bomb and say you
Finnegan Z now we've got a button here
that's clickable and then you can do
things with that again we're not gonna
do anything specific with them buttons
and if you just wondering again I know
if you've seen this well if you want to
do what to do with them or how how do
then do anything when you click the
button or all that kind of info I'm
going to do separate videos on each
element so don't worry about you know
details about them this is this is the
you know real broad overview of
generally getting going with HTML and
getting a structure going so as well as
a button we have labels which typically
accompany you know text boxes or buttons
like you want to user name so the label
for be say user name and you save that
and you'll notice now that the label is
an inline element so let's just do a
wrapper around that of P and put in a
new line I could also just wrap each of
these elements in a P just so they all
appear on their own line so got a button
you've got a user name as a label and
then you could have a text box which is
basically input and a value this time so
inputs don't have the standard open
close the other shorthand so inputs have
a move out to the P so you can see
inputs do the you know the open and the
shorthand close so then how do you
specify three saves you can see one
input is an input as a text box to input
data so that's one input is how do you
define the text inside before it starts
you use an attribute called value then
you say my text
or you should do i pies are not showing
see this style maybe my overridden style
no oh just not refreshed little me hmm
okay so that should work input value
okay it's just some kind of caching
going on with thee
though the website is somehow caching my
responsive things I've got that data so
if I were to close and reopen this I
just close that and go live again it's
there so for some reason because I
started typing in there whenever i
refresh this page it was kind of holding
on to my value it was trying to remember
what I typed so that's an input box
the labels are usually so if you see it
user name and this should be the user
name the user enters typically for
accessibility when you click this user
name you should focus on this text box
so a real quick way of doing that is
make a name for this and in the label
type the word for and give it your name
of the text box so now if we do that
when we click user name it should it's
not going to highlight my text when you
click this so why isn't that not working
quite look name
yeah but name we've got four again does
this just need closing an opening maybe
now without some visual okay well we'll
skip over that for now and when we focus
on a video on these things this should
work though basically should have you
know a name specified and then a label
come before and you give me the name of
the the control and that should
effectively mean that when you click the
label it go to the input in fact let me
just fix this so it will make good use
of a website well tell it to go anyway
so if we go to this is a link I'll put
in the description of the video
it's basically mozo if I just turn off
the black style at the moment it's
basically Mozilla's reference document
to say all HTML elements this is a good
place to see all of the elements that
are in HTML so a lot more than we're
showing here this is a great place to
get your up-to-date standards if you
will and not to date information because
this is kept very up to date so I'll put
a link in the description of the video
for this but will now use this to also
fix this issue so I'm positive this is
right but it's funny how it's not
working so all I need to do is in this
document or scroll down or we can search
and we'll look for a label or a text box
from level ikaw they give you a good
example of you know where you use things
so if we go to say input and let's see
if this gives us an example of a label
it doesn't so go back one let's go for
the actual label web so over control F
not search for label labels and there we
go so label is just below input right
below actually so we click into here
let's have a look how its recommended to
be used and you can see label for user
name and then there you go there's the
key difference it's not named getting
too used to WPF it's ID of course it is
I've been doing there WPF that long I've
forgotten the website uses IDs not names
so change the input to ID equals my
input and now when we click this user
name you can see selected
- reddit the type so that's that's the
point of how you'd usually use a label
you'd usually use a label - as if the
name - just label some kind of content
or import and then you can use this tag
to give you the ID of an element that
we're talking about so that might work
for a button as well let's try button ID
equals my button how much say this label
is for my button now I click this does
it focus it actually clicks the button
for us so you can use a label and this
for attribute to kind of repurpose a
label - to make use of it however you
like
so I'll turn you back to my input for
now and get rid of that so we've got
buttons labels text boxes which are
called inputs we have say 1 - multi-line
text box you want them to type a comment
for the order or something so for that
we'll do it's called text area and that
is an opening closing tag and then you
get less multi-line text area where the
user can type in and you can also
predefined some text in there which
again on this seems to constantly
remember my text but if I close that
restart and there we go we've got the
predefined text so this is a multi-line
text box and we'll do one more and I
think that's enough for this video and
we haven't got any kind of drop-down
list so to make a drop-down you do a
select as the group so this is something
you want to select group of options to
slice then inside there we want the
actual options ourselves so the option
option one copy paste say three times
and save and now we have a drop-down
with options one two and three you can
also do add an attribute I think this
will just selected - an option and then
by default it should select or is it
selected equals true maybe again if
we're in doubt we can go to the Mozilla
link but I think it's I'm pretty sure
you just put selected in and it's
probably less just needs refreshing yet
again there we go so what what we
clearly noticed in this video by the way
is this live server individual code
Visual Studio code is actually not that
great it seems to keep hold of some it's
like is trying to remember what you've
done like if you you type in here and do
option one and do that and then refresh
it's keeping hold of that data so if I
go to the desktop and open up the HTML
directly let's just prove this is not
firefox is the actual it's the live
server thing if i go in here and do the
same thing and i refresh I know so this
is actually fire five doing this so it's
nothing new the live server it's if we
start typing Mozilla is just remembering
what we've typed and kind of ignoring
the predefined options that's that's
just the browsers are doing what it's
doing but for if you're wondering you
know like your type selected any
wondering if it's worked your best to
double-check so your best just closing
down if you're unsure and clicking you
know the go live again and just
rechecking to be sure so that's really
all I'm gonna do on the introduction to
HTML um I've hopefully covered all the
the basics of how you define a structure
what it means to be inside of elements
and you know the the tiered structure of
a document we've really emphasized the
fact that although you will see it
everywhere HTML should not really be
used for defining any hard set visual
things that should be left up to see us
hence the semantic size versus the
defined side which is really obvious in
like a bold and a strong that's the most
easy way to explain that issue and then
we've kind of just dumped in a load of
all the most common web things that
you'll see so you know headers and
paragraph pictures spans lines buttons
or stuff like that then as we move on
we'll either go through just specific
elements and focus on them or what I
think we'll start doing is making an
actual a really simple part of a website
so not a whole website to start with but
we'll pick a path like maybe we'll pick
a menu and we'll start you know focusing
on that and then explaining elements in
context so if we were mountain to make a
top menu like on a website so Vallon go
to Angel sitcom and you wanted this menu
to be made for example then we'd start
with a list because this is a list of
things this you know this is a menu and
each element is a list so then I'd focus
that video on lists but effectively
you'd be making a menu to a website and
things like that so we'll we'll do them
in short chunks but we will do them
within context because that's the best
way to learn so that's it for this video
one thing I keep forgetting to mention
is there's a lot of time that I get
where people ask me questions or there's
topics I need to cover and they're
simply too short for a video the you
know like a five-minute thing if that
and it's not worth the time and effort
to make a video on it so I've set up a
blog which is blog.bufferapp.com --then
or i've done something in the general
course of my workday that we've solved
the problem or we've done something that
I feel just you know should be given out
as knowledge there's a useful tip but he
just doesn't big enough read
so if you're really interested you can
you know keep an eye keep refreshing
blogged I enjoy sex calm and you know
you might see stuff there because of how
infrequent this will be you know maybe
one post a week it might be non for two
weeks it could be five in a week study
you go in here in just refreshing I
decided to clean up and create a Angel
six Twitter account which you can click
on here and then every time I put a post
here I'll try and remember to sign in to
Twitter and say he is a poached type of
thing so you can get notified as a
follower if you want to you know keep
truck when things happen and I've also
added a discord discussion here so you
can sign in and post comments on here as
well so hopefully this will be useful to
some of you when I start posting topics
but again just go to blog dot angel six
calm for the so that's it for this video
I hope it was useful any comments and
anything going forward you like to see
