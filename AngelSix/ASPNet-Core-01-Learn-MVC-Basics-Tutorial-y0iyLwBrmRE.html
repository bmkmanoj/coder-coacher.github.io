into the asp.net core programming series
to finally start making this for Sato
server and now I know we still need to
do basic web design and get you familiar
with HTML CSS JavaScript and everything
else but we might as well start the
backend server which is semi independent
to the front end anyway because I know a
lot of you are really you know dying to
see how this is done so this video will
just do the introduction to MVC asp.net
core how it's constructed how you make
on and just go into depth of the the
general structure of an MVC application
so to get started desktop made a new
folder we'll just call it test and then
here we can just then type CMD open
command line type dotnet new MVC and
this will create a new MVC application
you can do that or you can just open
visual studio and go a new project
asp.net and then select MVC ball it's
just quick from the command line because
there's so many options in the you know
new project when you open it that way
so let me just pin this and make it
bigger and I don't have thing install
the girls assume in for this one in fact
let me just go and install the tools
okay so that's the tools install button
now bump up the UI size there we go so
this is the off-the-shelf asp.net core
application if we just do file new
project so let's just go press f5 and
spin this up first to make sure
everything works and then this is
loading now in this random port number
it generates and you can see we've now
got the website up and running so this
is just a stock you know out to the box
website so if we just stop that
we'll now breakdown first thing we're
gonna do is I guess delete all of the
crap in here because there's still a lot
of stuff that it adds by default so you
can check out all the things to do is
check everything folder so you've got
dependencies which are all the standard
there's nothing in there that's fine
properties you've got launch settings
we'll talk about a guest first the
asp.net or just a run in I is only
that's why I can see I is up here with
dotnet core in order to work on Linux
and Mac they had to use a cross-platform
server technology that technology is
called Kestrel and so this this thing
here is a Kestrel setup and everything
else like this is iis Express so because
you don't really ever well you may
deploy in Windows and use IES but I like
to keep things cross-platform if you
will in terms of making sure when we're
testing on Windows it's running the
exact same technology as if you were
running on Linux so one of the first
things I do in asp.net core project is
open the launch settings and just
literally delete the ILS settings which
is this section up to here should get
rid of those we don't want to use iis
and then when you've done that you can
also delete the profile because we're
not using is or this profiles on use now
as you can delete that profile as well
and all you're left with now this
profile as a Kestrel server so in the
drop down we originally had a is and
then Kestrel which is this testing when
we save this profile this won't
disappear because these are the two ways
you can run the application with is
orchestral so I clean it up like that
leave everything else as normal and you
can change the sport if you like to 5000
is typically their the standard port I
use if you save that file you see it's
instantly updated here and now the only
option is Kestrel so if you press f5 the
difference will be marginal you'll still
see this but you'll your kind of tell
for now we've spun upon localize 5000
right we asked it looks all the same but
you can see this output now is different
to be scroll to the top you can see this
the set up obviously looks different but
this is Castro server so this server
over and exactly this
on Linux and Mac as well so we've got a
cross-platform server now handling all
of these requests and you'll see more
ugly tales as we go so if we now sort
that out we'll go to web root so web
root www root if we open in folder
you'll see it's basically there's our
test folder and WWB root is here this is
the folder that your web server serves
so this is what cash flow will serve to
the user and if the user tried to type
you know localhost 5,000 forward slash
CSS for slash site dot CSS we should
find this file because this is the think
of this as the actual you know your
website's content nothing outside of WW
root is naturally accessible unless you
you make it so encode so this folder is
where everything is when we've made this
website Visual Studio has gone dumped
all of these images CSS Styles
JavaScript libraries all kinds of crap
I'm gonna literally delete everything
don't want any of that just get rid of
all I'll be back to clean we're using
MVC as the architecture of your will of
the style of web website were making and
that stands for Model View controller
you can see their models views
controllers so I'll talk about that in a
minute so let's first just clean up this
app settings again we don't technically
use them right now and this will take us
down a bit more discussion later so
we'll leave that in for the moment but
we can delete that bundle config we're
not using it we just deleted everything
but this basically minify javascript
compiled everything into one file just
sort map for debugging blah blah blah we
don't want that absolute I'll add it
back with DNA web as we go forward but
right now we want to keep this clean and
simple so you can see what's going on
program is the main entry point so here
is where your website starts and then
once it hits that calls this function
which build web host which is just a
function they made it into a lambda
style function which you could break
back out to normal if you like to look
like that and then you could hit here
and see so this is ultimately where your
website starts startup them will run a
bunch of stuff that we'll talk about in
a minute but I think really this is this
is mostly clean now
the difference is we have models which
we don't want just delete that because
again we'll talk about why in a moment
and then finally views so delete be
about delete the contact delete the
validation delete the error view import
start and layout so this is all we
really need for a basic website go to
the home controller will also delete all
the other actions so delete all those
and we're down now to really a common
the shortcut to automatically remove
these now was the remove unused thing I
haven't used it in a few days I think
it's control orgy or something there we
go
so this is this is now a blank control
with a single index with a single view
the index page will quickly open up you
don't need the view data so you can
delete that and delete all of this in
order to put h1 hollow world as those
we've got a header or rather an index
page it should say hello world so let's
quickly talk through these views so the
view start have we open it off you can
see it specifies when you do an act and
curly braces this breaks back into kind
of see Java code almost like a code
behind for this this view and this is
raised where I believe so what we're
doing there is specifying the layout
which is built into the razor page so
that when the view starts it looks here
and it says that the layout file it
expects that's going to construct the
website's pages it's gonna be layout
it's gonna look for that in a shared
folder called layout and then here
you'll basically find what is
effectively the header or the the main
template for your site so again all this
is a lot of crap we don't need so let's
just quickly spin up a another site
go into here type DNA web and I'm just
gonna use I'm not gonna do anything with
it I'm not gonna make anything but I am
going to just find out what the clean
HTML is so I can just type variable or
whether live live valuable HTML and then
there's my clean HTML copy that and now
all this lot we can delete that is all
again what it's installed the only thing
we want to care about is rendering the
body which is like injecting each page
so that's where the index page will get
injected so I'm just gonna select all
that paste over it get nice and clean
again
and then here do at render body and then
save that so now our layouts nice and
clean so this is the the website we'll
start when you request a page you'll
look at view start it'll say the layout
it wants to use as layout and then it
will look in this file so then every
single page that you request will be
rendered or rather every single page
that returns view will then look for
this file it will find this and then it
will inject the specific page that
specific page comes from ultimately this
layout so controllers are called a name
and then controller and the actions have
got name so by default asp.net will look
in a folder called home basically a
folder called the name of your class
with the word controller removed so it's
gonna look in views and then home
because the name of this so it's not
actually going look there and then there
and then for this function index it's
going to look at something called index
it's naturally built into MVC is going
to follow that pattern and try and find
this index page so it's gonna find how a
world so when we request the home
controller index it's going to try and
load the index page and the index page
itself won't just get rendered like this
because it's a view from the MVC it will
first look at view start and then find
that we want to do the layout it will
render all this and then render body
inject the actual pages HTML and that's
kind of how the whole structure
Falls together if we then look at how in
order to see that page loading we should
be able to now different run this now
we've cleaned it all up and see that
Hallett world oh yeah because we broke
this out to a mouse's stop Whitney yeah
because you broke this out to a function
not a lambda we need to actually specify
return well we could just leave it as it
was so we just dropped it back for now
well no leave you that I'm gonna mess
with that after so now we just do we Tim
and then this should all spin up I'll
hit this break point that I put on that
you'll see which I'll then hit this
break point which we'll go through after
social spin up the site and we should
see hello world
or we don't oh so now the one thing I
didn't look back into was the view
imports which we left it spells from
using statements in so this is again
razor that is healthy constructing these
pages and it wants us to it's like using
c-sharp to find things inside the page
so because we deleted the model and
there is no namespace called test model
so just delete that we'll never really
use this view imports thing at all I'll
leave it there for now but we'll never
use that I don't use the razor stuff
I'll simply use DNA web so here's the
page requested we press controlling you
you can see there's our clean body and
there's the HTML from the page this is
just the antivirus being injected so
that's not in the page that's been
injected by the browser so you can see
from that we just cleaned up everything
you can see there's less let's figure
out how this is all working and where
it's coming from
so you first build a web host and then
this is what runs so we're post-op
create default builder I've got open in
the browser let's just close this where
is that folder that folder right so I've
got these two pages open so all this web
host create default builder doors is run
a bunch of common startle code
you usually run yourself before asp.net
to come out so this is the function on
source code on github I'll put the link
in the video and you can see basically
does this so we were to just copy
everything it dead and replace this with
I didn't copy replace it with this and
then just return the new builder dot
blah blah blah got all the namespaces
and we'll talk through what the stuff
does that needs to I'm gonna have to
change this to a function to make it a
bit cleaner so let's just make a public
static wonder we return I web host
builder and you don't need to do this
but for completeness I want you to
understand exactly what happens so that
will also then take in string array vogs
so here's our function called test we
just a copy and paste of the built in
code so there's the code now all dumped
in and then at the bottom we must have
missed the return yeah so return little
bit so that's just a clone of this exact
call here so now instead of doing this
call we can go test and then we could
debug and tweak and do what we like to
step into this code so if we first run
this you'll see everything should be
exactly the same it should still work
just the same and run just the same so
it's all spun off no errors built runs
ok so we're good there so this is what
you have to do before asp.net 2 was out
you had to run these things anyway so
I'll quickly go over what they are the
way asp.net core is now built is nothing
is presumed so you can start a website
that has no is no
Castrol cancer files can't basically do
anything a website can do and then you
construct the website you you configure
the web host
hence the web host builder you kind of
construct this website to use what you
want to to configure the way you want
it's very modular so by default all this
stuff in this crepe web host default
thing cool is all the things that are
most common so the everybody starting
asp.net web site doesn't need to write
all this out every time because this is
the most common setup of a web host
environment so to do that when the app
starts off it first says use Castro
which we mentioned is this web server
this cross-platform web server it sets
all the content route so this is where
your app dot if we open this folder this
is this folder so typically it's where
the app dot JSON file is or whether the
Cs profiler so that's typically where
you'll find this point well you'll
always find this Waypoint - so is
telling that the content is in this path
and now you can access you know your
views and your content basically so this
is this is needed in order to find
things in the website when you're doing
relative paths where that is you know
it's going to start looking and then
it's gonna start looking in this folder
as your relative path then the configure
application configuration is because a
bunch of stuff inside of asp.net core
uses configurations so you can just get
the configuration by a dependency
injection this I configuration builder
and effectively get your configuration
and pull any information you want out so
one example we saw was the launch
settings which was providing not the
launch that ins the app settings that is
providing a JSON file that has a login
section so then the logger that we add
can consume that all basically can say
configuration yet section logging and
then get information about the logger so
uses kind of setup we don't use it right
now but your seat so the default says
okay configure the
environment and add a file called app
settings doc Jason which will now be
found because we've specified the
content route to be this little folder
this app that Jason will not be found
here
doesn't need to be there so if it wasn't
it wouldn't fail and it reloads the
configuration when he changes so by
doing this line here now anywhere in the
application we can pull out the
configuration and the settings that are
in this file then on top of that it also
tries to add the environment name which
would be development or developer yeah I
think it's development or debug or
release which we can now actually
breakpoint and see
I think it's debug which you'll find
that they've got one in here so we were
on this code you can see environment
name development so on top of adding up
that Jason app settings on Jason it will
also add up settings development so now
you can have a configuration set up with
that's for release of UL or for all and
then specific only to development
environment we then specify these things
so that's all that's doing is adding
these two files if the found then it
says are in development so this is a
debug environment if you will then it's
also going to add user secrets I've
quickly popped up this page as well
which I'll link in the video which just
explains user secrets all's it basically
does the stores keys and values in a
JSON file on your machine it's a no way
secret it's in no way secure I think the
name is completely deceiving and I think
the whole point of this is basically
useless as well so all's I'm gonna do is
provide this link in the video and you
can see here it's added by default but
and it's only when it's in development
mode anyway but honestly this will never
get used by me so that's that's all
that's doing is adding this ability to
then use a user secret store which I'll
never use so I won't really discuss that
the next thing it does is adds the
environment variables which the funny
thing you'll find is this is already
added anyway so they've got this in
source code and then
see but it's already in there so I'll
quickly show you why I know that so just
run it and found out so when you first
configure the application it's going to
run all this in the configure you hover
over you'll see or other hosting context
you should see configuration and you've
got one provider right now which is the
environment variables configuration
provider and if you go into that you've
got all your environment variables
already so you have all that data then
if we were on add environment variables
it won't hit until we hit the next
function so I'll have to skip to here
but now we should see the provider which
is there has all these extra things so
even though the providers in there the
add environment variables basically adds
all of the current environment variables
on this machine to the environment
variables provider so now in there we
can access all the stuff about my
computer where things are installed you
know all yeah your path or your your
environment battles basically so that's
what that called us so now anywhere on
the application we can access like the
user profile and is Drive anything
that's on the computer so that's what
that bits doing and then finally we add
the command-line arguments as well it's
the same thing these all these
configuration things they don't
necessarily do anything it's when you
make use of them so it's up to you to
make use of these configurations they've
just been added so that in the next
phase like here for example when we want
to add a logger this logger then goes
okay I want to make use of a
configuration and we use the context of
the web get the configuration and do get
section logging so that's going to
search all the providers that we've
added in the configuration and search
for a section called logging so
ultimately that would end up finding
this section so this whole configuration
stuff here basically right now just adds
the environment variables user secrets
that we won't use the command line
arguments passed in and the settings in
this app settings file then it's going
to configure a logger for us which again
we'll make our own I may use this one if
I can
make it work inside Nets console
applications otherwise this is specific
to asp.net and then it's not really
cross-platform in a sense so we may or
may not use this but by default it gets
added as a login provider to the
dependency injection and we are there
console and a debug logger and it passes
in the settings that are in the app
settings and this logger will obey them
then it adds IAS integration because
that gives the option to run iis as well
they set up by default so you can run
between you the kestrel or IAS so in
this this I'll never get used bios
because we deleted it and then finally
it just adds validation scopes which i
wouldn't really talk about right now
that's you don't need to know that yet
until you've done a lot more work and
then if the orgs aren't null then it
adds the augs that were passed in as a
string to this method which is basically
the command-line arguments and so in a
nutshell all that setup really does is
sort of chop these this file into
configuration passes in your
command-line arguments and your
environment settings and adds a logger
so this is what you would have had to
have done every time you're making an
asp.net website you'd have to set up the
same boilerplate code and yes this
thing's in there now that I won't use
like we don't necessarily make use of
app settings we can hang we might doing
a few bits but you don't need it to get
going so therefore you could delete it
we don't need environment variables
roundups we're not using them we don't
need the logger we're not using it so
the point of all this is you can just
type in we get rid of that all right
I'll keep that there a minute but you
could type in you know web host dot
create default builder pass in there and
then just set up and build and you don't
have to do all this code here so that's
the option one and that's the one I
recommend to use but just to show the
point that we don't need that and that
we don't need all this stuff going in
for it to work you just really want to
see it clean and simple and you don't
want to know where to start we can just
directly type new web host builder we
want to use kestrel which is what we use
in we need to use the content route in
order to find you know the actual views
and content
and things so we'll do directory yeah
current directory and then we we don't
need that we're not gonna add those
files we don't need to login we don't
need I astronaut don't in that so you
could get rid of all that code oh well I
say all that code you have to type
create default builder but you could
just do this as a direct asp.net
Castille site to see it just working an
absolute bare minimum so you're gonna
build the web post builder you're gonna
tell it you want to use kestrel you want
the content to be that folder and then
you spend at least our top class so
that's that's now running as bare
minimum and we'll keep that there for
now or you can just change those three
lines back to web host dot create
default building whichever you want to
do so for now I'll keep it super clean
like that so it's there's nothing else
going into this this will build like I
say the whole structure of the web
server how it's going to operate so
we're going to work through kestrel this
is the folder we want to work in and
then it says right you start up so
wouldn't you've built and you return he
tries to then start the application up
if we don't specify a start up then it's
gonna complain that there's no
application basically the website
doesn't know what to do because there
isn't one so a valid non-empty
application name of Parvati basically
that's meaning it's just tried to start
the web server but you haven't told it
anything about that what do I do when I
start up so you do this you start up and
this start of value here is this class
start up so now we're all happy with
this so we have basically the main entry
point just like a console application it
always starts here
it runs this which is just this
basically so we turns the web host
builder and then runs the web host dot
run so you know this that we're
returning will end up getting run so
then it knows it wants to run a casual
server and it then has a startup file so
all that's fine we should understand
that now and we're doing nothing really
at all there we then get this startup
file so if we just simply page
breakpoints on
every point or every call as those three
run the application you'll see the order
on which it happens which is also
important to know so the application
starts gets into the constructor of the
start of class like you'd expect and you
can see this configuration is injected
through the dependency injection built
into asp.net and that's that provider
that we saw that we've now configured
with nothing so it's just simply come
with a memory configuration which has
the basic settings the URLs the web host
the environment content route that we
added and the application name is come
from the namespace so this is injected
for us and this is where I say we could
then make use of this throughout
wherever you want to dependency
injection so anything we would have
configured in there so we could then add
back this to web host dot my post dot
creative or builder augs if we do that
one you should see that all of those
functions we saw running like the JSON
files and the logger will now come
through in the configuration so you can
now if you've got five providers you got
the environment valuable so that's
basically where those environment
details again passed through and what
that setup is doing so I'll resort that
back again so we hit the start of the
startup gets dependency injected with
the configuration which we then set to
this variable here so that's that after
it's done the the constructor it then
calls configure services configure
services is basically dependency
injection so this services thing here is
dot nets but I'm not necessarily done
because this is asp.net dependency
injection it's built into dotnet core I
want to make use of this in the WCF
application so a WPF application I just
haven't got around to looking at moving
this directly into you know baked into
WPF yet but
so think of this as like an inject this
is the kernel that you combine doing
things so the website starts and now it
wants to inject all its dependencies so
the first thing and the only thing we do
is add MVC and this is an extension
method that goes into units built-in so
you can see dependency injection and
this add MVC basically sets up the the
style of this asp.net website - MVC
because you don't have to use an MVC
kind of structure but we want to so we
inject the MVC whole set up if you will
to the server and then the next step is
the configure which is then you've
injected all your dependencies and now
it's time to set them up if you will do
what you want with them so in here you
get the app builder which is just
another built-in you know thing to
construct in your application and you
get the hosted environment which
provides details you know about where
you currently are the environment you're
in the web root folder just basic info
so by default we say if we're in a
development environment if we're
debugging then we add it so we set up
the use developer exception page so what
this does is this adds a middleware to
the pipeline whenever you're processing
a website request and if that request
fails
so you haven't tried an error then this
will cause it to automatically generate
HTML page to show the developer the
exception if we're in production though
instead we simply redirect them to a
page that's expected to be in home and
then error inside of you know home and
then an error page so I'll show you that
working in a moment so you can
understand exactly well that really does
use static files again you have to bear
in mind this website has been set up
with no presumption so it does nothing
by default so we removed static files
you wouldn't be able to even get HTML
files unless you serve them through the
controller you wouldn't be able to get
CSS files on request by just asking for
the CSS file so use static files allows
the user to request you know an L so you
know localhost forward slash CSS forward
slash style us that would be found
through this so again we'll remove the
to show you what that does and then
finally we configure MBC here and what
this does MBC worked by using routes so
you're Earl is obviously that the
website itself so that will be localhost
colon 5,000 and then everything after
that forward slash then goes through the
routing system so by default if there is
no root of it's just localhost colon
5,000 this default route basically says
that by default we want the controller
to be home and we want the action to be
indexed and then this /id will come to
next but basically that's what allows
the initial page to be found as home
indexed it doesn't have to be that so
let's start with now showing you what
each of those things does so let's go
back to this first that we mentioned so
this use developer exception page if we
go into the home controller and instead
of returning the page we throw argument
no exception with a message test if we
run this now we're in development so it
will add the developer exception page
setup to MVC and you should find now
when debugging so it's gonna tell us
it's crashed what the difference should
be this page has now been generated for
us so a non-animal exception occurred
the argument was null it's like a nice
stack trace dump with all the options in
here to look at so it's it's good for
you know when you're developing a
website and out what's happened it gives
you info so that's what this use
developer page does so if we got rid of
that and run it then the server will
simply crash in its its usual way which
will be I'm guessing a a 5,000 error or
something not 5500 so Aswan we Hertz
making sure it's the right page and then
if we press f12 I'm in Firefox so this
will work in Firefox 3 we load that page
like the exception hit
and you say yes 500 ever so by default a
500 means the server basically didn't
respond it crashed and had an invalid
response and that's the you know the way
that's been handled so this use
developer exception allows you to do
that if instead we give humor in
production what this will do instead is
try to find a page called home error and
right now we don't have the page so
let's just see what happens again then
if you you try to redirect your page
that doesn't exist so that up trash and
that'll go here and again you're just
gonna get I presume a 500 error might
get a different error stating at pages
and found so basically a 404 error
because now it's crashed but then this
is caught the exception and it's tried
to direct you to home error which isn't
found so we just quickly add copy and
paste this index page crawler error and
we can say this is a bad man like the
production one so oops our side crash
and this is what say thee oh and then
the other thing is you've got to link
this page in this won't work yet so
again we haven't spoken much by MBC
after such book the NBC pages are served
so these the views of the MVC is the
controller don't worry about the model
right now it's basically everything else
so whenever a page gets looped for if
you haven't set up a route so if you
haven't done a specific routier which
we'll talk about in a moment naturally
just doing /name for a /name MVC will
say well the first one is the control of
the second one is the action because we
set up here the template so we expect
the first forward slash pretend this is
local host from one 5,000 forward slash
that's in by default cuz it's your
website so then this template looks like
your website's name forward slash and
then something here like a variable so
this is home this is the the variable
control which is a specific you know
keyword for meaning the controllers and
the you know there are controllers and
this is like passing a default value
strobe non as specified of this forward
slash doesn't exist it's going to
presume to be home if you do specify
like we've done here it will set it to
home and then the next forward slash
will be index or rather will be the
action which is default to index so
because we've provided two forward
slashes here home in an error it's gonna
go
the controller is home and the action is
Error because this is like a default
value so it's been over it so what that
will do is because of this route when we
type go to force home for slasher error
it's gonna look for action in the home
controller called error so we then go to
the home controller public I option
result error and we return view the
return view basically says go and find
me a file in the folders view inside the
folder called home inside a file called
air SES HTML so all this is what MVC
does by returning view it's gonna
literally take the name the physical
name of this class without the web
controller and presume you have a folder
in views called that name and that
there's then a file called error in
there with the value in there so that's
what MVC is doing for us so by just
simply making an action and returning
that view if you will that's how we're
gonna get this home error to then go
there so every run this again will crash
it'll hit the error exception handler
which should then or not one that's
getting anything no I know what I've
done I've left the root in there that I
was explaining to you so that's why it
didn't work so let's remove the route
back to what it was
we have profit and here close that
down right so we can throw again we know
that I'll now throw this time so we run
this we'll look for the default home
index which is found it's firmly
exception the exceptions been caught by
the exception handler and redirected to
home error the home
as then gone might find me a view in the
views folder called that and we then
serve that page or so that's what's
happening there that's how you'd handle
the you know that's what the basically
this little section he is doing for
configuring you know what what's
expected when so basically of your page
crashes in it and handled it then that's
what these two things do so that's those
two bits production or release of other
development or release the use static
files next so we don't have any static
files I didn't make any I deleted them
all so let's just make a new item and
let's just call this style dot style dot
CSS and of course it makes a saml file
okay let's open the folder delete the
samel create an actual CSS file drop it
in here and then make a style doesn't
need to do anything this just call it
HTML or follow that we're not even using
this file it's just there to show you
that it's a file in WWE root so we run
this first we should be able to get this
file and this is what your website would
normally do now what right so this is
what your website do you'd include you
know a link to a style dot CSS and then
the browser would request that file so
let's first stop crushing the page so we
can actually do something
so this now runs but let's say we did
forward slash style dot CSS you can see
then we've been served this file thought
that isn't a natural behavior of the
website that's being injected of you
will or allowed to work by the huge
static files so if we remove use static
files things like that images JavaScript
files CSS files none of those will be
server ball so now they should load fine
if we then refresh this page you can see
if we open up we get a 404 it's
basically saying there's nothing there
we're not serving that folks it's not
expected so that's what the the you
static files does and it handles things
like you know make sure you don't serve
any sensitive configuration file so
there's some logic built in there for
protection but in general this allows
your website to literally just serve
files in WP to be route based on where
they are that's what that little bit
does then we move on to the use MVC so
we mentioned this briefly but we'll talk
about it more now and show your messing
around so you feel comfortable and
exactly what happens so a bulk of what
MVC does is you work with these
controllers and this is where all of
your all of your incoming requests come
in so whatever website or other web bill
on your site is requested they all
funnel through controllers and you can
break them up however you like
so usually have a home controller for
the home page and about for the about
page you know all controllers based on
pages typically as how I split them up
and you think of them as logical calls
to you know whenever your front-end
website or the user browses to a certain
location and wants to do a certain thing
so if we wanted to add a new one let's
copy and paste this and call it about
controller so by calling this and about
controller and actually fallen in about
control here and having an index in
there then if we loop for forward slash
about then it's going to look at
this route again as you mentioned so the
first forward slash is going to be the
controller so instead of being home it's
going to look for about which would then
be about controller and by default it's
going for something called index anyway
in the controller so it's going to look
for this view so if we just started that
we have made of you yet you know we
haven't actually made a CSS HTML file
yet but if we then open this up and now
we type forward slash about and it isn't
case sensitive
usually it's committing to this about
controller automatically we haven't made
any special routes for we haven't done
anything when we serve the file it's not
found because you can then see also it
tells you it's looked into views about
indexes tried to find it there then it's
look for a shared name of that view
specifically so you can see where it's
actually tried to look for the view as
well so that's MVC that's what this this
root is doing it's allowing that kind of
action so then you could create a new
folder in views called about and we'll
copy and paste this index plunk it in
and call this index and then we'll say
my about page and if we run this now we
haven't have to do anything else other
than making about controller and a view
in this right location and now we can go
on our website and just type in forward
slash about and we have an about page so
it gets there where we know it does and
it returns and serves the about page so
have let's start clicking in now what's
happening so following that logic of I
mean in this to about to this should
basically now break because there is no
about to folder to serve a view and I
say it'll break it or basically we put a
breakpoint on here and then we do
forward slash about you'll find that no
longer exists it to 404 we do about to
though it's automatically just gonna
find this controller for us and then now
it will break finding the view because
it's expecting the view to be in a
folder call about to so you can see this
kind of hardly in how
things boil down to to these things so
when we start making the website and I
start making controllers and then we
just give them a name and then all of a
sudden you can type a specific help like
forward slash about and you're wondering
well where did that how does it ended up
getting into here it's all based on
literally the name of the class and the
name of the action by default and the
reason it works is specifically forward
slash something for us or something
that's because of this template so let's
modify these routes or let's just play
with this route you can add multiple
brothers mess with this for now so let's
swap around these two options there are
the action and control one so it spot
them the other way around let's have
action and then control just to show
that how it's made up so now when we've
gone we'll still hit the home page
because by default we specify nothing so
the variables are injected you know
either way it doesn't matter that that
way around but now what we put for is
life about what that's now doing
it's trying to find its same for as much
about so action is now about but the
controller is home so what it's going to
look for is now in the home controller a
function or an action called about so if
we were then to do index it would then
find the home page there is your index
for it's like about it's gonna find the
about index page because it's it's
linked with this kind of special set up
so that's how you can tweak your layout
of your will you can then do routes dot
map route and we can add another one so
let's say this is named about page and
we want to have a specific or say we
have not necessarily yeah let's say
there's multiple functions in here so
you got about page and then maybe on the
about page you've got tell me more and
it's specific to you know exactly a
totally separate
or plan me more or for whatever reason
it doesn't really matter however you
structure website tell me more so we've
made something called tell me more we've
got to tell me more here so that's all
naturally find the viewless law work we
simply need to point to it and we can
point to it by you know doing forward
slash about forward slash tell me more
but whatever you don't want you want to
be much cleaner so let's just comment
out that a minute and show you that that
actually works still based on this route
the default one by type in /cam anymore
so this is much about four slash tell me
more you can see it found that page but
this then starts to become in
long-winded what have you just want to
say more and that's the page you want to
download you know specifically you want
to load that action you don't want to
have to have a controller default to
home and have to put a function in there
called more because it belongs in this
page say so you can simply add another
routes like we've done here and you can
do a template of more so that means the
user typed forward slash more because
again just presume it's your website
name here like that and then it's the
bit after that's already injected so
it's basically saying more and then you
want to go to a specific page from that
so we can then do I haven't actually
done this in a while the defaults so I
think it is default object I think you
just make a new JSON file I remember
rightly controller and then a string
value I think of about and action would
be tell me more I think that's right
or if I specified absolutely can
remember how to create them oh I know
why stare me in the face we've specified
the names already so we have to
specifically tell it which thing we are
controlling and then that's applause now
as a Jason so now what this will do the
template is more there's no variables
built into it but then we're setting the
defaults here instead of inside the oil
itself because they're not even provided
there and we tell it to point to about
and tell me more so now if we run this I
think I hit f5 there we are
this should now if we type for it's like
more I should point to the about tell me
more page so there's the normal home
page which is fine come on now stop
dying and none of we do now for it's
like more it is it now points to the
tell me more so now this is how you
would set up your roots of your you know
your specific I want this my forward
slash whatever to put into something and
then say now you have you control it in
your action so you can type forward
slash about forward slash whatever and
you can go to the you know specific
function what of this now once a
variable you know inside your area you
want to pass information and the query
string core and the actual you know the
Earle itself you can literally specify a
variable here called say more info if
you don't specify a default value than
it it won't ever hit this and unless you
specify a value if you do specify a
value like a blank one and it doesn't
matter whether it's provided or not so
now we've done more info this call
expects more info so if we were to
follow this logic and we have ID here
question mark that means a variable
called ID or a parameter to your your
method inside your controller your
action
so this is the keyword ID so we call
this ID then we would get anything after
the second /on the Earl would come in as
an ID so let's give that a go
so start top fine spins up we now have
to specify say about tell me more
forward slash and then something else
and of course it helps me put a
breakpoint on so we can see you hit here
now hopefully ID there you always got
the value something else so then you can
return and pages serve but you've got
the information to do whatever you want
with there so that's how you pass in
information in an you know a query
string you can change that then to you
know more info and now it's expecting
this you know name to match more info
and that's still work and then like so
this is how you kind of construct your
your layout to point to where you want
to go so I think really the MVC the core
of MVC is kind of shown here that the
program starts up here we tell it to run
a kestrel server look in this route for
content for static files and everything
else run the startup file the startup
file comes in pause and configuration
that we set up in there turns it into an
MVC style website so this whole
controller and View mapping naturally
work that's where all that magic comes
in output any crashes from actions that
aren't caught in a nice HTML page of R
in debug so static files and then set up
the basic root of /a /b becomes
naturally finding a home controller than
an action without your having to make
all routes and then if you want to make
specific routes that are shorter you can
do it this way so that'll get you going
with being able to mess around with MVC
being able to make some controller's do
some things create some views of you
will now even though this is MVC you
don't necessarily have to use the views
directly you know I know it's called MVC
boy
doesn't mean you have to return a view
here you could return you know content
directly so you can just type return
contents and then more info or you could
even do you asked me about more info and
then you can return say the content this
way
and even they haven't returned the view
it's still going to server you know that
content to the user so we then do about
tell me more something else you can see
now is outputted you ask me something
else but if you look at the source this
is literally raw text it doesn't provide
you the HTML file or a JSON file or
anything else is literally sent us a
response with nothing no headers no
nothing it's just a raw text response
and then obviously we can change things
like we turn in so you wanted to return
JSON which we'll get into quite often so
this will be new JSON result and then
you can say new and name equals tell me
more content equals more info and you
could return you know a JSON response
for when we start making API calls to
the actual facet Oh chat app this is
what we'll mostly do is you know it's
Jason replies so if we replace this page
now is is return JSON objective the you
know the content we specified and then
if you look at the actual raw response
you can see in there now the response
has the time jason you should find the
headers of the response here now specify
therefore one were a casual server and
then it accepts this type log but we
should have jason in here as a content
type o though we have content type is
Jason so that's how the browser's then
interpreted it naturally and didn't
realize you to look at it there as well
so that's jason that's hopefully a start
and introduction to MVC it's kind of a
lot to cover and a lot of going back and
forward there to explain every
in because there's quite a lot to eat
but you have to go and adjust work
through it and then you know figure out
where things are being plumbed together
to ultimately boil down to I guess if
you ask what is MVC I mean we're using
asp.net call here MVC isn't necessarily
asp.net codes the it's the simple set up
it's it's one little module now in
asp.net and really also we're using it
for is so we can make controllers which
is just classes that override controller
and have functions and they will
naturally map to the the routes that we
set up so we can have kind of /this for
slash that that's all we're really using
MVC for the rest of you just may have
speed on that core website but hopefully
this will get you going like I say I
know we're gonna build the fucecchio
server and this is the back end if you
will now the front-end that we're making
in DNA web will ultimately be these
files will generate HTML content that we
then serve back up so that we can make
you know the the front-end the HTML the
CSS and all that in DNA web but the
backend will serve those things it will
actually you know read the content store
things and databases that's where all
this will happen so this is hopefully a
starter but we do really need to be you
know building the front-end so I'll try
and do these series in parallel if you
will will start making the front-end
which right now we're just making a
basic website to get used to it and then
we'll start progressing this back-end
I'll start making an actual affa seto
server back-end we'll spin this all back
up again or maybe make a login page or a
sign-up page and then add the database
so you can start actually signing off on
line to Fassett o dot word and then we
can link the WPF up into actually
logging in so that doesn't need much UI
I mean even if we made the UI just
really basic and crappy for now just so
we could do the backend will potentially
start doing that so hopefully this is
what you guys have been after as the you
know starting to the real server code so
I'll do more on this but we'll be
bouncing now between WPF the front-end
and the backend server but hopefully
this has been useful you'll learn a lot
more about asp.net MVC this is literally
just the introduction to
overall what's happening where it's
happening and how you run it but we'll
go into a lot more depth about
everything we do as we go forward
I just wanted to kinda give you a big
enough introduction that you can now
take this upon yourselves and at least
start messing with asp.net while I'm
doing the other videos so as usual any
comments questions just leave them below
and I'll get back to you and yeah
hopefully this was useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
