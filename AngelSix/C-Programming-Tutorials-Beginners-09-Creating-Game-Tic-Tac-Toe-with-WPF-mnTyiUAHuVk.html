called tic-tac-toe it gives us a bit
more about exciting thing to do and
believe it or not you already have all
the knowledge you need to do this game
if we don't know what it is I simply go
to Google type in tic-tac-toe and you'll
see it's effectively noughts and crosses
a player starts and selects an empty
space and it gets built with a cross
then it's the next players turn which
you can select another part of the grid
and then it gets filled with a nought
and the winner is anyone that gets their
symbol either horizontally in any three
rows vertically in any three rows or in
the two diagonals and in fact if we just
go to google and type tic-tac-toe you
can play the game live here so this is
an example there's a grid a 3x3 grid we
click here we get an X and then the
computer in this case puts a zero here
so we'll try and go across here put one
over here and then it's blocked as so
put one down here as blocked is there
then we'll put one here to win
diagonally you can see we move one
diagonally there so that's a principle
of the game we need any more info just
Google what the game is now to make this
instead of using windows forms like we
did previously we're gonna use WPF it's
something we'll get into shortly in new
videos and it's really the I mentioned
it before it's the the modern UI if you
will you shouldn't really be using
Windows forms anymore they're the
massively outdated so start a new
project there's a WPF application with
visual see show up at the end let's call
this tic-tac-toe
now you'll still get this visual
designer and now instead of code behind
that was in the windows forms projects
way had a CS file in the code behind you
still got a code behind here which looks
similar but this time the samel file
itself is effectively this code file
this visible part is simply Windows
Visual Studio rendering this window
Forest interpreting this file so if you
open this sample file in notepad it's
this content here that's all it contains
this is the interpretation press f5 and
let's see the window spin up so you can
see sir a basic windows form for the
most part it looks exactly the same but
now we've got things like grids and much
more easy to use UI you've got your
toolbox just as you did with the windows
forms as well and you can drag and drop
things like a button and there's a
button press f5 and run and you can see
the buttons there but we don't want to
do this whole drag and dropping anymore
because the way modern applications work
is no longer based on you can see in
this code here it's set at a hard-coded
position by putting a margin from the
top and the left and things tend to be
now similar to websites much more fluid
so instead of being fixed values and
fixed sizes and fixed positions they
tend to be overall percentages or you
know a third of the available window
space things like that so even though
you kind of use this tool box at the
side and drag and drop things on we're
gonna do it entirely in code here and
we'll do video shortly on how to do WPF
but for now just follow along I'll give
you a brief overview of things so the
applications now got an app sam'l which
has your startup URI in this case which
is the startup page that means when the
application starts it looks for main
windows AMA which is here and it runs
this window similar to the programs ES
file did and you can see the application
sulfur's blank for the code-behind
because the the zamel file is specifying
what to run in this case they obviously
run this window when this window closes
the application finishes so similar to
windows forms in that respect in this
window we have the width and height here
so let's change these to a more square
value tic-tac-toe is a three by three
grid that should be equal size
let's press f5 and just make sure that's
it go it's like a square grid we also
don't want the user to be resizing this
grid so it doesn't go all distorted so
if you start to look at the end of this
line and press ENTER to start a new line
and you just type resize mode and you
can see selects it for you just press
ENTER and it will pop up instantly and
we selected to know besides press ENTER
again press f5 to check that change out
and you can see now we can't resize this
window let's change the tile it says
main window which is here title and call
it tic-tac-toe
that's the window sized on the title
done and now this grid a grid is if you
think of it as a Excel spreadsheet
you've got columns and rows so for
tic-tac-toe we need three columns three
rows so let's go inside this grid you
can see everything is done with these
lesser than and greater than symbols
similar to HTML if you've ever done
websites so inside the grid guitar grid
dart column definitions and you close
with a write greater than bracket and it
will automatically add this closing
bracket so the way that these tags work
if you've never done HTML or Tamil or
XML you put a less than sign then the
name then a greater than sign and then
anything inside of that to the point
where then which is the exact same thing
but with a forward slash here is then
content of this item so everything
inside this part is inside the grid
similarly here grid column definitions
everything inside this area is part of
the column definitions
so again don't worry too much we'll go
more into depth about WPF in later
tutorials but for now I'll just give you
a really quick overviews of of what
we're doing so now we're inside the grid
column definitions so we're going to
define each column so going across we
need three so the first one column
definition we simply specify width so
you type with press ENTER and it puts an
equals and the quotation marks for you
put an Asterix so that's the star above
the eight and then you could close with
a right angle bracket like that or if
there's no content in this case this is
this is called an attribute on the the
element there's nothing going inside of
this you don't have them retype all this
you can do a shortcut and simply put a
forward slash so this is now a
self-contained item it's exactly the
same as doing that it's just that
because there's nothing here there's no
need for all of this we can simply
remove that and close it like that copy
and paste that's line three times and
you can see instantly we've got three
columns this star simply means a
percentage value so it's a percentage of
the overall width and because there's
three of them equally then takes up a
third of the space if we remove one
you'll see that then it's taking up just
half so the star is simply a a universal
value that means you know a count up the
total number of stars in the whole
definitions and then it's a percentage
of those stars the columns done copy and
paste that whole column definitions
simply change the word column for row
and got road definitions same inside
change these for Road definitions and
change the word width for height
so now you can see here we've got a grid
now of three columns three rows which is
what we want now we need content inside
these rows so we're going to use buttons
so they can be clickable the actors
they're the notes and the crosses so
inside the grid itself so these are
inside the grid and now after them is
still inside the grid before we get here
so inside the grid we simply type what
content we want inside the grid so we
open our a new element again tap the
word button and we need to specify well
first let's just close off the bottom
and you can see there of buttons
appeared and by default it's gone to
column zero row zero so you can change
where this isn't the grid by typing grid
dot column equals say one it's jump to
grid one at column one it's at grid row
I'm gonna say column one it's gone to
the center so this is 0 this is 1 this
is 2 3 well 0 1 and 2 columns then this
is Row 1 column 0 so you get the idea
columns across rows down starts at 0 so
this is column this entire column here
is column 0 this is column 1 this is
column 2 rows across this is column 0 at
0 0 this is Row 1 that is wrote 2 so
play around with these numbers of year
you're not sure what the values are and
you can see it moving around based on
the values that you put in so the first
one wants to be at 0 0 wants to be at
the top we also needed a name for these
buttons so that we can access them in
code so to do that you type X colon name
and then we'll call this button and then
we're going to use the column and then
an underscore and on the row a sort of
the naming convention so button 0
underscore 0 is button and column 0
row zero we then want to let's just give
this from content so we can see a value
let's put a annex in and you can see
there in the center got a letter X let's
copy and paste that let's put a letter O
and you'll see that we're in we've got
the same name we need to change this
we're going to move this to column 1 so
we're gonna go to here so we need to
change this to column 1 and now you can
see we've got two buttons we've got a
button there and they're copy again you
want the third one over there yeah we
don't need the content here we just want
a few to show what the visibly look like
when we style it to look nicer so
there's the first three copy and paste
them now change the row here so we're
going to go to Row one same here and you
can soon see the benefit of making UI
with code because now instead of being
forced on dragging and dropping elements
and cutting and pasting things inside
the UI you can do it nice and easily in
code and you can really quickly name
things and if you remember the
calculator up in the windows form we
have to click every single button then
go to this little panel down here then
type a new name whereas in this code
file we can actually change the entire
rows in one so if you hold the Alt key
on your keyboard and then click and drag
you can see we actually select all of
them in a row and change the rows in one
go so can really easily change all three
similar here we got the Row one so let's
copy and paste this now and do the final
one and you'll see what I mean
hold the old cluckin drag between you
two to hold the alt click and drag
change it to two and now we've instantly
copy and pasted and moves to the third
grid so repress f5 to run this
let's see we know about a grid with
clickable buttons which is cool we want
to make this look a bit nicer the whole
point of WPF well not the whole point
but one major benefit WPF as it's really
really easy to style things so let's
change the style of these buttons to be
a lot more like a tic-tac-toe game and
appearance so we want to inside the
window because you'll see the window is
here and it opens and it doesn't end
till here so the grid is inside the
window so if we go above the grid so
we're inside the window we open and we
type window dot resources and then
inside the resources we make a new style
and the target type we want to be button
so we want to style any buttons that are
in this window so now to style the
buttons we want to change the background
color to say white we type the word
setter because we want to set something
the property that we want to set is the
background and the value we want to set
is white
you can see there all the buttons have
instantly updated to a white background
and again you'll see very similar
layouts we've got their opening brackets
the closing bracket with the short
aliens because there's nothing inside
and then we've got these two attributes
so the property is background the value
is white copy and paste this we want to
change we want to get rid of this border
oh well we don't wanna get rid of the
border we want to make it thinner so it
looks like a nice thin grid type border
and then your thickness and let's make
it half of a value so again this is this
is more of an absolute value it's not an
absolute value sorry it's more of a
relative value it's not a pixel on the
screen anymore because WPF responds to
the DPI of the screen so it's sort of a
unitless value you can drain your try
point one and you won't see it point two
point three you're just about to see it
so do point five and I just press f5
again tip two visibly see this you can
see there we've got a nice of probably
two pixel border but that's a nice a
nice looking border there these letters
are a little bit smaller so let's make
these letters a lot larger so copy and
paste this again font size now let's go
to some like say 70 yeah that's nice now
we've got big press f5 again got a nice
big letter so this is starting to to
come together nicely
Oh what else do we want to do so to be
honest I think that's all we need to do
in this UI I think that is all we need
we can access these buttons based on
their the names we've give them the grid
in fact we'll need to access the grid
when we're trying to find out where the
buttons are positioned so we need to
give this grid a name similar to the
buttons x : name we'll just call this
container
and now we can access this in the code
so let's jump straight to the code and
let's make this game so the code for
this form when the form spins up is in
this expanded drop down of the the main
window and it's the sam'l dot CS just
get rid of all these grayed out usings
because we're not using any of them
cleans up the class a little bit this
main window is the construct original C
it's a public with no return type and
it's the name of the class so therefore
it's a constructor so that's a tiger
that's often put inside a region
constructor give it a comment and then
when the window appears we want to start
a new game so let's make a new function
called new game move this outside of the
region of the constructor just move it
out for now absolves will need to do
when we start up so we can minimize this
region now for a new game will need to
make some variables first so let's make
a region for those private numbers we
want a well firstly we need to have a
value that stores what the button is so
that can be an autocross or it can be
unused so right click over here now we
want to do add class school as Mark type
as in the type of mark that's in that
in that cell so it's not going to be a
class it's going to be an enum which
we've used before called mark time the
values are going to be free naught and
cross comment Ness
so there we go we've got a public enum
of marked out that now can store free
nor talk across simple enough now let's
make what we need to do now is store a
list of values that holds a value for
every button so that's nine there's nine
of them there now you could do a
multi-dimensional array where you've got
a you know an array that's the first
part of the array house then three
inside then three inside then three
inside but let's keep it nice and simple
let's just use a normal list a normal
array and it's gonna be nine long so
let's just make an array for now called
private it's gonna be the type mark
types that were created and it's an
array so just open and close the array
let's call it results let's give a
comment
then we'll also need to know whether its
player 1 or player two's turn so you
want a private billion of player 1 turn
and then finally we'll need to know if
the game is ended so if there's a winner
or not or there wasn't a winner but
basically we just want to know when the
game ended so and that's all the
variables we should need
so let's collapse that region now back
to the new game so many new game starts
we first want to create this results
array so it's making you array and as we
mentioned it's it's gonna be nine long
so it's gonna be containing enough to
hold all the results for every button so
we'll create a new blank array of three
cells so that's created the array we now
need to set the values for each one of
these items so we need to make sure it's
the value of 3 and it doesn't just
associate a different value to it now by
default because the mark type is free at
the start here the first item this will
be assigned zero and by default an enum
will be 0 so just doing this what
actually sets the results to each result
would be mark type free but if we ever
then move to this free down to here or
explicitly give it a value such as this
then this code would stop working so
that's explicitly set each item so just
use a for which we've used in one of the
very early videos so far i 0 i is less
than the result
like I plus plus so basically go through
every result and then for that result
sati to free so again this you've done
this in I think it's the first or second
video so if you can't remember what for
loops do take a quick look at that video
one of them make sure the player one is
the current player now we need to also
because as we're going as we're playing
through the game these actual buttons
are going to get changed so you're gonna
have text you can have content to put in
like this and you're gonna change things
like the color of these text will make
like blue and red so it looks nice so
it's a new game we need to also make
sure that we clear off all of the
contents of its blank so to do that we
need to access the grid firstly which is
we call container so we type container
dot children and you'll see that that
says a list of all elements in the
windows control panel so that basically
means all these lists of all elements
that are inside the grid so all nine so
we just do container dot children now we
know the wall buttons in this case we
know everything inside this grid as a
button
so let's cast all those children so tag
cast and if it's not there hold ctrl and
press dot and it will say using link
it'll automatically add the namespace
for link because that's where this cast
is from it's there the link helper
method and that just basically converts
this array of children which is
currently a UI element so he sees a UI
element collection we want to cast each
element from a UI element directly to a
button again hold ctrl and dot and it
will say using Windows controls system
windows controls and open and close the
parentheses because that's a function so
we've got the container we've got every
child on that
red we've cast all of them to what we
know they are witches buttons so now
we've got a list of buttons well we
haven't got a list of buttons we've
actually got a enumerable so we need a
list so that we can do it well you don't
need a list but a list means that we can
use a nice link expression for each so
do two lists and then dot for each and
again we briefly use these in early
videos we won't go too much into depth
about link we'll do that in more
advanced videos but for now I'm
explaining what it's doing so this makes
it from an enumerable which is a
basically like a list of an unknown size
it's a list that gets calculated each
time you you enumerate over this fetch
is every button instantly so we know
this is now a solid concrete list and
then we do this for each and inside here
we type 'button that's just a name you
make off equals greater than curly
brackets closed curly brackets and this
little thing here is like a lambda
expression again don't worry too much
about what it is just look at how it's
done and generally understand what we're
doing here so it's put a comment enter
eight every button on the grid so now
inside this nice off one-line function
we got the container we got the children
we converted them to buttons we've made
that into a solid list so then we can go
for each to have a lot of function here
now that runs for every button in that
list so it'll keep running this function
over and over for the first button then
the second and third then the fourth all
the way up to the ninth button so now in
this little loop that we've made we can
reset every button so we can tie it
button and you can see it'll be the type
button because we've cast it here you
can do button dot content which as
you'll see on the zamel here is this
content so that's how you set the text
and the bottom is with content so we
want the content to be an empty string
we want to clear off the content you can
actually press f5 at this point and make
sure it clears off because now what it
should do is clear off these two pieces
of content we type
because at the start when he gets
created it runs new game then new game
runs here and then this effectively
should go over every button and clear
the content so press f5 oops
type something want to press that 5 then
5 yep so you can see it's clear the text
which is what we wanted so now at the
start of every game it will clear all
the text when somebody wins we're going
to highlight the backgrounds of the
buttons to a color so it's nice and
obvious who's won so we also need to
clear the background color for that we
use brushes I think it's called brushes
so press ctrl + dot and there we go it's
found system windows media which is
correct so press enter brushes not white
so we set a white background which i
think is bad well it is by default
because we made the style here so we're
effectively changing it back to default
and then also the foreground color which
is the the text color what we'll do is
default the color to blue which we're
going to use for the crosses and then
only at the point of one's already
clicks a cell and it changes to a naught
will change that color to green a bit so
naught so by default everything will go
blue
but obviously you won't see anything
because they're not selected and then
when a an or gets clicked will change
that to green so by default let's make
the foreground of all of these into a
blue brush so change background
foreground and content the default
values so that will now create a new
game oh one more thing we need to reset
the variable the game and either thing
we call that game and in the false is no
longer finished
make sure the game hasn't finished so
that will now reset the whole game ready
so all your variables are now
initialized player 1 starts every cells
free the buttons are all clear
and the game as intended so now we need
to do something when these buttons are
clicked that's the next part of the game
so I believe you can still double click
these just like Windows forms and there
we go it's created a function for us we
go back and Luke all's it did was added
this click function here so again you
would intend to use this so much anymore
you'd start typing directly so you can
see it's added a click attribute here by
the name of button 0 0 click now because
we don't really care we don't need a
different click event for every button
we can handle this in code and figure
out what button was clicked so let's get
rid of the underscore 0 0 so it's just
button underscore click let's change
that name in the code to match go back
and then let's just copy and paste this
click event to every button and again if
you want to paste fast you can hold alt
click and drag down three lines and
paste and you can paste them in that way
as well
so now every button is gonna run this
button click just going to run this
function so its first name so comment
this new game we forgot about that
there's a new game done let's comment
this handles
nu-uh handles a black event so now
inside this button click we need to
firstly find out well I'll tell you
what's gonna happen what we'll do
if we run this you're gonna click away
and you're gonna say put an X here then
a naughtier than across here than an or
here and basically when the grits fall
that's the game ended we'll say the
games ended or say there's three axes
across here three crosses that's a
winning games then we'll also flag atop
a saying the games ended so then the
game will look and and be in its finish
position so that the players can see who
won now what we'll do to start in your
game is simply click again anywhere that
would be like a nice way to reset the
game so what we'll do is when we're
clicking these buttons
we'll check of the games ended and if
the games ended we'll start a new game
so if the games ended just do new game
and then we turn from this function so
there's other the new game logic so when
we set this to true and we click any
button it'll just restart the game it's
that checks for that next we need to
actually get the button so you can see
here our commented if you're not used
event handlers much before the sender is
the thing that was clicked
so it's an object because it could be
anything and event handler needs to
handle you know any type of object we
know the sender of this click is always
a button because here it's on a button
and we've specified click so we know
this the sender of object is important
so let's first cast it to a type of
button and we've used these a few times
before and basically put in parenthesis
and then the tab that you want it to be
and then the value after it this is
called an explicit cast and this
converts this object to a button and
this would crash if it wasn't possible
if we tried to change this to a label
and press f5 you'll see this will crash
the program an invalid cast exception
you can't cast it and if you hover over
sender you can see it's a button like we
say we know it's important so you've
obviously got a cast to the correct type
but we know it's always going to be a
button because they can only have to be
clipped by a button so we get the button
so now we know the button but we don't
know where this button is we don't know
whether it's on column 0 column 1 column
2 we don't know what row it's on so to
get that information so let's make a
variable called column to get that it's
simply a case if you use grid dot get
column and this expects a UI element the
element of that is contained within a
grid so we pass in the born and this
will now return the column that this
button is on
similarly for a row as you guessed it
get rel that gives us a column and a row
so let's just open paint a moment and
let's show you what this looks like so I
haven't used this in a while so we've
got a got a gret he is all great not
very well drawn but you get the point
there's our grid now column wise this is
as we mentioned before column 1 column 2
column 3 or sorry let's undo that what
can column 0 technically because it
works in starting with zero and then one
so it's column 0 1 &amp;amp; 2
this is rail zero row one row two
so say this part here is column 1 Row 1
so this is a nice visual for you to see
similarly when we've got the so we've
got the column and the row but when we
made this piece of information here the
results it's just a plain array and it's
it's nine long so it starts at zero one
two three four five six seven eight
now how do we assign that to a column or
a realm simple way draw another grid
so what we'll do is our results so um
results capsule and results this is
gonna be the zero index the first one
the seconds gonna be there the thirds
there the fourth it's hanging confused
saying the fourth and fifth one it's the
number behind cuz it's a zero index and
the ninth is there so it's a zero based
index it starts at zero so the first
item is going to be here then here then
here then here then here in the year so
you can see column zero zero is zero
column two Row one and B here which is
five so you can visibly use this if you
want to to try and understand but just
think of it as it goes across then goes
down and like it a zigzag part so it
sort of goes across down across down
across like that that's the way that
they're you know the indexes work in the
array so we've got the column we've got
the rail we also now need the index as
we mentioned so we can access the value
in the array which stores the results so
how do we convert a zero of a column and
a row number or the value of a column
and a row number to this number
well the column is always 0 1 or 2 every
time you go down a row you effectively
just need to add the previous three
columns so you need to add 3 so if
you've got column 0 row 1 you need the
number 3 so to do that it's zero so it's
column plus the row times 3 so the rows
1 times 3 is 3 so that becomes 3 column
1 Row 1 would be 1 for the column plus 1
times 3 is 3 so before which equals 4
column 2 Row 2 so to be column which is
2 and Row 2 times 3 so that be 6 there
plus 2 is OB 8 so you can see that works
out so the index are simply column
bro times three and the times three is
because that's the number of columns
we've got so it to be Rho times you know
the number of columns that's how you get
the index again don't worry too much
fellas more math than programming but
it's good to know that now we can now
get the result so to get the result or
in this case you know the current state
of the button that were under the button
that we've clicked we can do result
index because this is going to hold the
results so this now gets the current
state of that button whether it's free
whether there's a cross on it or whether
there's a note on it so if the user goes
and clicks firstly let's comment this
code past the sender to a button finds
the buttons in the array so now where
were we
yeah so if the user clicks on say you
you click and you put an X you put a
cross and then the next player clicks on
that same cell you don't want that to be
overridden by then a note if it's
already got something in then a clip
should do nothing it's it's not a valid
response so to do that we just check if
the end results index which is you'll
see this is where all the results are
going to be stored if that equals well
in this case you want to check it isn't
free so if that isn't equal to free
which means it's got to be an auto
across because they're the only other
two options then we simply return this
function week that's it we stop doing
anything because there's nothing more to
do so don't do anything if the
already has a value in it that handles
the clicking of you know a note or a
cross we just ignore it
it's that brings us now if we get here
then we know the result is free so now
if the users clicked there based on
who's player it is so by default it's
player ones turn if it's player ones
turn the result should be across every
to play a tutor and it should be a
nought so set the cell value based on
which player players turn at s so that's
going to be and results indexed so get
the value of this cell and we set it and
we're gonna do I think it's called a
tertiary operation which is basically
like an inline if statement so you could
do if M player one is turn then this
equals marked R cross else player ones
turn equals nought instead what we can
do to make this statement a lot more
compact you can do this way if you like
if you prefer to see it this way but the
other way is to do and you can think of
the if statement being on the right side
here so you can start the up statement
by putting player ones turn question
mark so you sort of saying as it player
ones turn question if it is the value is
across and then the else serve there it
doesn't you simply put a cold one so
this is like a really compact eval
statement so it's if this is true
question this is what you do if it's
true else this is the false so the
result equals this of it's true
this of its false serve its player one
it's a cross if it's player two it's a
note
so that sets the result value up and
that's why I check in this result P as
you know correct because basically every
time look like a button we will
the result in this aerator to match so
that's the array updated with the value
the result now we visibly need to update
the button itself so do as we saw before
button dot content is the text itself so
the content equals and then do the same
statement maybe to player one it's an X
if it's player - it's a nought certain
button text give a result
that gives us the text so you'll see the
actual the zero so if we run that now
you can actually see this working easily
now when we click you gain the axis so
we need to change the players turn so
again you can do if and player one to
turn then and player one turn is false
else and player ones turn equals true
again there's a much easier way to do
this so if you want to toggle a boolean
this is very specific for you know a
true or false value if you simply want
to flip that value around so if it's
true you want it to be false of its full
she wants it to be too true you can use
this little what I like to call doc
symbol so because that looks like a
doctor me there's his eye as his beak
and that's how I remember this so this
is actually a a bitwise operator I won't
go into detail on that I'll do that in
the next video I believe we'll go into
like bitwise operators but this
basically doing this statement
duckface true it's I like to think of it
inverts that value so if it's true it
becomes false if it's false it becomes
true I'll explain why in the next video
but that's that's what that little line
does there so toggle the players tunes
plus f5 and let's check out what this
does again now he should go there we go
X naught X naught X naught or cross not
now we mentioned we want the noughts to
be green so as well as setting the
buttons text will say change naught to
green so if player 1 turn on this get of
it isn't because player 2 is the north
so if it's not player ones turn then the
button dot background equals oh not so
background foreground you want the text
color equals broscius green anime press
f5 let's take a look at that oh nice I
know we don't want green do we want red
that's the classical color so it's
usually when you see tic-tac-toe you'll
see blue and red so you'll go a nice
little and you can see I'm nice that's
Luke's it does look like a game whereas
if we did this in Windows forms it would
look nothing like this you'd look like
grey buttons and to change the style
would be much harder the WPF is really
easy to style and look really clean and
you know flat so now that's it we've we
can click away and that's all good it's
working and it's it's changing between
players that's perfectly fine the only
thing we've got to do now is actually
check for a winner so that we can then
for one highlight the winner or just
highlight the whole thing goes there is
no winner and until be able to actually
reset the game by clicking again this
game ended so now all that's left is
check for a winner
create that function so controlled often
enter creates the function and checks if
there is a winner of a three line
straight so as we mentioned before a
winner go back to the paint a winner can
be here here here yeah here here here or
here
so basically any combination of three
values we could do this in math with
like a you know a single function but
that's gonna get really complicated for
such a small grid and for such a small
game we'll just do this manually will
literally check for this then we'll
check for this then we'll check for this
this this so we'll have ten checks I
think three so it will have eight checks
there's eight possible ways to win so
we'll just type this this time directly
so check for horizontal wins so to do
that we would we know the results array
contains the values and here's the array
so we want to check if the results zero
one and two are the same value so if
there an auto across if they are that's
a winning role so to do that you do if
the results and firstly you also need to
check that the value isn't free if you
don't want it's not winning if there's
three blank rows in a row so it's got to
be an or two across so similarly start
with the first one if the result isn't
equal to free so that's your first check
and and then we want to put this in
brackets because we want this to be well
you'll see why it needs to be in
brackets so so long as the first one
isn't free and the first one and then
this is now a bit bitwise logical so
I'll type it out and then I'll explain
so we check the first the second the
third and we check of equals the first
one so this logic here so let's move it
out of this and so it's a little bit
clearer so that's a lot of logic here
what it's doing it's checking the 0 1 &amp;amp;
2 so this this and this so this line and
you see this single and this isn't
checking of this and this on this is
something a double and is the the
comparator that checks if something's
true single and as a bitwise operator so
you can think of this as not necessarily
like adding and subtracting this is it's
called bitwise so it means that let's
say this result was true good as 0 or a
1 so let's say this was a true and you
say true and and this was false the
result of these two together true and
false means false because this and will
only keep the values of these two
together if both are the same so what
this is actually doing is saying if
result 0 and we don't want oh if they're
the same and result 2 so this now means
is 3 together all these three ended
together if they're all the same or
still equal there's the first value of
they're equal the same thing they don't
actually add together and become more
they simply stay the same or get removed
so this little logic here which again
I'll go over in the next video I'll do
this whole logic this does a check that
have all three of these are the same so
if the first the second and the third
one equal the first one this is
basically a check
that says all these three are the same
value so when you see this check you
won't understand it now you will
understand it in the next video but this
check is basically saying if this this
and this match so that's what that check
does so what we'll say is they have the
results for zero one and two are the
same and they're not free because we've
checked here so it's it's an auto across
you've now got a winner so the game ends
and you also want to we're gonna
highlight the winning blocks and green
so highlight winning cells and green
this is going to be button zero zero
background equals and then instead of
doing the background zero equals green
and then on another line the next
background is green and another line the
next backgrounds green you can just keep
concatenating these together with an
equal sign so you can actually say
button and then this will be column one
row zero dot background equals and then
two background equals green so this is
done this background equals this
background equals this background which
equals green so effectively this sets
all three backgrounds to green and it's
the column it's a row zero to the top
row and it's one two and three so like
zero one and two
so it's column zero one and two row zero
so it's these three so if we run this
code and we make a winner in this top
you can see there now this this logic
for the horizontal winners has found
this winner let's also set the game
ended so that means now when we click a
cell this should find out that the games
ended and start in new game so we click
anywhere now it should basically clear
everything off but she does which is
good then and carry on and play another
game so we're nearly done now this is a
working game now you'll see the other
issue is what happens if you get to the
end so we also need to you know we'll
finish all these checks off at every
possible win out to there 8 but after
that check now we also need to make sure
that if we check for the complete the
ending of you know there's no more cells
left we've got a check for that so we
need to do a check that if there isn't
any results so again this is a link
expression where this is the name we
make so the result equals and if there
aren't any that are free so the results
dot an e this is a link expression again
we'll go through more in future videos
on link but this basically checks every
single results so we've we've tied this
name we can this can be anything this
could be a letter f if you want makes no
difference
so if then the logic here is if F is
free so this results dot any well check
if there's any free if there's any
values and the results that equal free
and then we're saying if there isn't
there's this not here so basically if no
results are free so they're all taken up
we then know that they're all taken off
that so the games ended for one because
now we'll there's no more moves and
we'll turn
turn all cells orange to sort of
indicate like everyone's lost type of
situation so to go through every cell
scroll back up to where we did that
which was here copy and paste that and
because we're only using one line while
let's leave it there let's just do this
we've already commented above that we're
turning the cells Orange so we just
changed the backgrounds to Orange it's
like check this little logic check for
no winner and full board so that's
basically fill every cell and there we
go it's now figured out that there's no
more moves left and nobody's worn and
the clicking you restarts that's good to
know we basically got the finished game
we just need to detect the remaining
winners so this checks for the
horizontal wins this is Row 1 yeah well
yeah row 1 or row 0 in this case
just make a nice bit of space info copy
and paste the whole thing we want Row 1
Row 2 so Row 1 we jump down where now
you're doing 3 4 &amp;amp; 5 so where there's a
0 you put a 3 so there's 3 times for
that and then this is 4 and then 5 and
then the same here you've jumped down a
row so this second value the name is in
our naming convention it's the row so
we're now on Row 1 Row 2 you look here
as 6 7 &amp;amp; 8 so I become 6 6 6 7 8 game
ends this is Row 2 and now we want to do
a check for the vertical wins
so copy and paste that this now becomes
column zero so now vertical wins 0 3 &amp;amp; 6
so 0 3 6 0 0 1 0 2
that's column 0 copy and paste that
column 1 so column 1 is 1 4 &amp;amp; 7 the
columns moved over so that's 1 1 1
column 2 is 2 5 &amp;amp; 8
this is now column 2 then finally check
the diagonals so copy and paste the
description and to be honest I see
starting to look a bit messy for a
function let's just chop these inside
regions horizontal windless we'll call
this one one two three and then again it
keeps it nice and organized vertical
wins no winners
and then finally diagonal wins paste
this in top left bottom right so for
this it's 0 4 &amp;amp; 8 so 0 0 4 8 0 0 is the
top 1 1 is the center and two twos the
bottom and then its top right to bottom
left which is 2 4 &amp;amp; 6
and that is then to zero I have 1 1
again and 0 2 press f5 to run that lets
check we should be able now to win well
effectively that's the complete game so
let's do a diagonal win and there you go
highlighted the win click to reset
let's get hope and something's gone
wrong that so this seems to think that
we've got a win here for some reason so
let's just check that top right bottom
left I have I see here I didn't change
the two at the end of the zero
I missed this 2 here so I change that
too let's try a diagonal win oops
whoops okay let's just kill the game try
that again and there we go a diagonal
wins try this way so wins try this way
when I select noughts win on the off win
so it looks like it's working and and
that's really the completed game that's
how simple it is now there's a lot of
little bits in here that will go over
more like say this this logic here this
bitwise will go over in the next video
which is like I say effectively this
just checks these three values are the
same and that they aren't free that's
all you really need to know about this
statement is that that's what it's doing
and that's enough to by the time you've
read the next video I'll watch the next
video you'll understand any issues any
comments you know feel free to leave
comments I'll haffley we apply to all of
them and explain more or you know do a
follow-up video of anything is unclear
but in this nice short video I'll
shortage you've managed to completely
make a nice-looking tic-tac-toe game
from scratch
and learned a little bit at WPF along
the way and this is you know I think
it's a really nice game you could you
could carry on and add a few extra
things like maybe some extra text that
says you know start again click anywhere
to start or things like that or you know
whatever you like but that's that's up
to you to try and take further so I hope
