about two things one is to explain
extension methods and what they are and
to start making more use of them and the
second is to at the same time as doing a
improve and start cleaning up this DNA
framework and making this startup call
use a lot more extension method style
startup so this will be the real world
example and the DNA framework and also
just explained at the start the basics
of what an extension method is so we'll
just make a class repair for now and
we'll just call it a public bus or
public static class test all extension
methods have to be in a static class
that's where I made it static the
extension methods themself need to be
static so I'll have public static and
we'll come up with and let's say
simplest thing I can think of is so you
want to check of a number is even even
or odd and you could make we start with
a standard function clearly static for
now but let's say a standard function
would be is even and you need to pass in
the Sailor integer number and then
you've returned if number oh my gosh
two equals zero so it's remainder of two
is nothing meaning it it's even so
there's your function if we dared say
just any other function to invoke it and
we had a number say three and then you
do if you wanted to fire over the number
was even you do test dot is even and
then pass in a and that's just how we
don't okay
a function that you standard nothing
special here way of just calling a
function now
I always think of it more of when you're
reading code hence all the comments as
well you can't want to read your code
like it's you meeting a book you want to
read through the code and it makes as
much sense as possible and in English
I know another language you should do
technically do it this kind of way
bow in English you'd certainly wouldn't
say if you wanted to ask somebody of the
variable a was even or if the number
three was an even number you'd ask the
question is 3 an even number
you wouldn't say is even the number 3
that's not the way we speak so this is
kind of what we're doing in code 1 we're
trying to read through we're getting a
test that is even okay something as is
even a okay so is a even and in your
head that kind of mental processing
takes up time and also throws away the
clear or the clarity of what you're
thinking this isn't more of a
complicated set up or part of some code
that's say dunno a complicated loop and
in your head you're trying to keep your
thought pattern as clear as possible and
this way of thinking about it is is not
ideal it's kind of back to front the
same of like long we have a string we
wanted to say compare two strings you'd
usually say well is s equal to SS but
instead we do a string dot equals s SS
it's kind of again back to front what
you'd prefer to say is is s dot equals
and then SS and this is an example of
next entry method here to repress our 12
well actually it doesn't it's built into
the object in this case to give you the
same thing so they've actually put in
the string class but the point is an
extension method will loop this way this
is what we're going to achieve this kind
of disappearance of s equals SS it reads
more clearly so in order to turn this
into what we'd prefer to say which is a
dot is even then all's we have to do is
the first parameter of a function that
has to be static and inside
30 class that's how they work we would
have the list keyword and they can see
now it magically starts working and the
only it finds this function because for
one are in the same namespace so if we
were to move this outside of a different
namespace so if we were to I mean this
is just up the standard code this is
nothing special with this specific setup
but say we chocolate into a namespace
called test and then in this DNA
namespace we tried to consume it you'll
see we've got a problem
and that's simply because it can't find
you know this because we're not in using
the test so extension methods also need
to have in the class using them the
using statement - the namespace there
within and then you can find them and
actually we don't care about that
because that's not the way we're using
it now so that's kind of how to create
an extension method and really they're
that simple so I just took this back in
here for now so all's we've done is when
you know tie a dot as well as all the
built-in things to the class of a which
is an integer so all these are built
into you know the integer this is you
can see this little down arrow I presume
represents an extension method that is
then being found from here so that's
that's an extension method and that
means we can have you know a dot is even
and it reads more clearly to me that's
more logical way of instead of saying
test that is even a you're literally
asking the question directly so that's
kind of what we want to start using and
really that's all extension methods are
that's it that's the whole the whole
lesson if you will hence why I want to
start to actively use this in this
framework to to give you a real-world
feel of making heavy use of these and
one of the things you can do is chain
them together so you could say if a dot
is even daft and then you could carry on
something else and this kind of chaining
is very common in dotnet core
applications and if we open the let's go
to
um set a word saw server program easily
when you make a new asp.net website
that's what they're doing here so the
app web host create default builder and
then a dot at the end so this returns a
value and we're then just doing dot on
the return value and then dot on that
return value so we're kind of chaining
them and this was inspired by a Java
Script I'm pretty sure because you know
they use this quite a lot and there's
not often and you can see again here
build web host run there's not often the
major use for extensions like this is
probably the most common use is that set
up in initialization of a a program if
you will after that they're not heavily
used but they're certainly beneficial is
worth knowing so what I want to do is
turn now this framework that we've got
that we've just started making so if you
watch the last video you'll you'll find
out what it is I want to clean up the
start code where we're trying to pass in
parameters into here to do configuration
and injection and instead have more of a
natural flow that's just going similar
to like say a new framework construction
dots configure dot use default services
dot builds type of thing same thing is
like an ASP website does and it's these
exact same chunks of code but we're just
going to clean it up so instead of
somebody just calling like as we do
right now if I go to the for set a word
application right now we just call
framework dot start off but if we wanted
to configure this specifically then we'd
have to pass in a configure like this
and do something with it
we'd after then pass in an injection
method and do something with that and
and then it doesn't look as clean as
saying framework dot build dot configure
dot add services as you go sort of thing
in a change manner instead it's all
chopped into these anonymous
well not anonymous are the per you know
the actions so we want to change that
way of working so it's more natural
similar to again everything kernel dot
bind to constant is this kind of
chaining that makes it easier to read so
we're going to make use of extension
methods and do that
so in order to do that we'll first start
with get rid of that temporary code
we'll start by renaming this to build
because this is now gonna be the first
step well rather the last step they'll
return something we want so we'll see
this in action then again in order to do
this kind of chaining we need to make an
extension method that returns a value
and that value is what you keep doing
the dot on so in order to construct all
this you can see these functions rely on
like the service the environment the
configuration because then further down
this makes use of the configuration make
sure to the service so in order to chain
this into a dot dot dot kind of
environment will need a basically class
to store the information and that's what
will new up initially so we'll make a
class and we'll just call it framework
construction I guess so let's just make
a folder in here and call it framework
and then we'll chalk the framework and
framework extensions in there I don't
get why to his tell them it's gonna take
a while to move to files and then in
here framework we will add another class
and we'll call this framework of
construction I'll call it framework
construction delete the framework RG
control RG to remove them public class
the construction information when
starting off and figuring DNA up
framework and that class is not going to
be static that's going to be we're going
to create a new class of that each time
and then to do that as we mentioned we
need some public properties and we will
have
we want the services which was I service
provider I think it was well I service
collection and that would be the
services so these are the services to be
injected before it gets compiled the
services that well to get used and
compiled against the framework is built
and that's because obviously we have it
here next thing we'll need is an
environment because we use it there so
probably very movie environment and up
the same thing the environment used for
the framework is that's not once it's
built this is use straight away and then
we have I believe it's an i
configuration by the time we finish our
configuration we build a configuration
dot build yeah so we'll do a probably I
figuration the configuration to use or
used for the DNA chroma keep the
comments the same so we have those three
pieces of information so now we can
return from our extension methods this
class each time and we can have access
to all three things we need to so we can
start chaining them together so the way
I'd expect it to work if we were to make
say a new function just to show you what
I'm thinking the way I'd usually do it
is say a new framework instruction and
then I do dot and that I'd make some
extension methods now that can chain off
this and say doc and bigger dot use
default services dot build and that's
how we would start our application and
then you could also add like you know
dot use file lager
dot use whatever you know you can chain
things together and then you did visibly
break them off apply this and you
commented flying so you have a nice
clear chain so that's what we're aiming
for so the first step to doing this is
once we make a new framework
construction we might as well initialize
these things so let's put this line out
let's make a constructor and shop well
in there and instead of services like
that will be the actual services then
the environments same thing and then
also will inject the environment because
that is a hard-coded something we don't
change or about no plan to change right
now the environments one instance it's
not a changeable thing and then we have
the singleton of that environment so we
haven't actually changed anything here
all we've done is new dot the three
things we need all the two things we
need the configuration we'll call mine
we do configure and then configuration
can set that you know value because if
we don't want to make that we will not
be part of the setup so that really is
the framework construction done so we
want to now have a configure method so
this will be our extension method so in
the framework extensions we will add and
you can see these are already this is
really an extension method here so it's
in a static class are typically then in
the class name with extensions and
putting nothing but extension methods in
there you can break that rule it's just
in general I tend to do that to keep
them clean so if you're looking for a
specific extension is easy to find and
then you have a default logger which was
originally using the service collection
to add their the logger when you wanted
to do a logger log without passing in a
specific name so we did that in the last
video but there's one over at the end so
what
so that'll be a public study and this
time as you mentioned all these gonna
change so we're going to return this
down a framework construction and we'll
call this configure and then in that
configure to make it an extension method
we do this and it's expecting a
construction in the first place
construction and we will want to take
the configuration specific part there up
to the original build and chuck it into
here so it's a single parameter and then
we always return the original past in
construction chain the construction
configures a frame or construction the
construction to configure the
configuration the custom configuration
action control dot to get your
namespaces that we need and then we
chain the construction so in here also
need to do again is basically rip out
what we're already doing so cut all that
plunk it all and there we have a new
configuration builder we do everything
we did in the namespace for directory
environment now is in the construction
we passed in that environment so now we
can access that and the reason we can
access that is because as you mentioned
when they make a new framework
construction it gets nude up here so
within this chaining of construction dot
configure we can now access the
configuration same for services so this
would be construction dot services so
that's nothing's changed we've simply
making this cleaner looking and the one
thing to not forget is set the
construction configuration because this
is the part that is responsible for
setting up part of the construction so
configuration equals the configuration
and that's it so now we've moved the
exact same code from
start of class that's now core build out
of there and we have now a framework
Construction dot configure which is you
know part of the step so we've chained
that out you can see now we have login
and custom injection and then the build
stage so the next step I'd say we want
is a kind of use default services step
and this will add the login and we'll
also add say an exception handler
they're all just output to a log
whenever there's an unhandled exception
which will make you soft after but I
just want to at least add this class in
to make it useful so let's just start by
making the exception handling thing for
now is it's just a few classes to put
together so I'll put this in exception
handling folder we'll make another one
for interface because this can be
changed so we'll just make a default one
for now and then again the users free to
add a different one of they like so this
will be called a exception handler
arrrg remove the extra public interface
the interface for or other handles
unexpected or rather handle exceptions
when they are caught and passed to the
exception handler and we'll probably end
up expanding on this a lot more and
having like multiple exception handlers
but for now we'll keep it nice and
simple always start with the simple and
then expand as you need don't make it
over complicated and then you know
there's no point to keep it simple at
the start until you have the requirement
to make it more complicated so it'll
just be a single function which will
need handles the given exception
exception to handle so I can say super
simple single method and then we'll add
another class to the exception handling
and we'll make a base exception
so this is just a really simple
implementation the easiest we can get
I'll be a public class exception handler
control dot and enter to implement it
handles all exceptions simply logging
them to the logger logs the given
exception and then in here all we will
do is log it
so we'll then use the framework which is
just the namespace and aft and then
we'll have access to now the logger and
that will come from this static
framework class where we then call the
provider top get service you know we've
done this in the last video so this is
now accessing the dependency injection
built into the dotnet core to access the
logger that we added which we will add
again which we added here by doing nil
add file a debugger console which
internally we can't see there because
broke with a minute but covered that in
the last video so framework got logger
will access the loggers that have all
been bound or it'll access the logger
factory and then we're gonna log I'll do
log critical source which is the
extension method we added before so
again I'm saying extension method
because we're building them is not an
extension method oh yes yes it's an
extension method of the logger and then
in here we'll just do for now
unhandled exception occurred and we
should really localize that book now we
don't care
exception pass any exception and that
will get locked will make it to do note
here to do
localization off string so we'll
probably add this fairly soon as well
also we're getting a warning about a
spelling so I'm gonna add to the project
right-click add spelling file ignored
words on handles because that's a word
in programming
and then I think if you close that
reopen it's still gonna moan sometimes
just have to think that's a spamming
warning
yeah it's just I think the it hasn't
picked up on this you know we didn't
even add it there we go
helps if it gets added close the file we
open and it should go away there we go
so localization of strings this will get
dependency injected and localized
afterwards so for now any exception we
passed this exception handler would
simply log to the output console for now
we could change that to anything else
but I think that's fine for a base one
so we have the actual logger implemented
now so we want to be able to add that as
part of the setup so we do let's take
one step back where have we gone there
yourself
the next one is we want a an extension
method called use default services so
we'll play something the framework
extensions that's the main one so we got
configure and then we want the actual
use default services to add the most
default services of this framework that
we expect it you know not ever used to
have to manually type in so make a
framework construction returnable
extension method use default services
this framework construction to chain it
in and we don't need anything for that
because we are specifically just simply
injecting all of the inject all of the
default services used by
framework or a quicker and cleaner set
up so this is what people will expect
people to use when they simply want to
make use of DNA framework they're not
customizing anything they're just
getting going just want to get started
so that's the construction as usual we
chained the construction so can keep
going dot dot dot and then here now we
want to
at the exception handling that we just
made so that we'd want to go again
keeping it to what we'd like we'd like
to just do construction Docs add default
exception handling say or exception
Handler and for that obviously we just
need another extension method and this
because it's a default like these are
well the configure figuration just do a
better tidy up here then move that down
so the default logger will change to us
actually now we're starting to use like
default exception handler default log is
the wrong name default logger will be
for doing this and then this default
Walker will be technically something
different this is to add the default
logger in terms of being able to do
Locker dot log without passing the name
and so we'll come to that in a minute
anyway
so this is now here use default services
will took another one here now
because this isn't going in the
exception handler class or an exception
handler extension method because this
isn't specific saying default doesn't
necessarily mean base it's it's the
choice of this framework extension class
that we want to make this the default so
I'll put the default one here so public
static framework construction use it
quick copy in there use default
extension this framework construction so
I'm sure you you've seen the way to make
these extension methods now and how
useful they can be in chaining so
injects the default exception handler
into the framework construction
construction and then we would do
construction doc get services and well I
have a singleton again I don't see any
reason not to have a singleton right now
and type would be base exception handler
and I think that was all we need to do
so combined a static instance of the
base exception handler in fact that's
wrong
once I exception handlers that's how
we'll be getting the exception handler
and we will need then to pass in a new
base otherwise we would have found to
this tie not the interface of that type
so we're now bind to it singleton there
we could update the framework and go to
the top here now we've got environment
we can now have public static I
exception handler and then we can do the
same thing here I exception unless so
now we can get the frameworks exception
handler I don't know I put get to bring
with the environment of this class no
it's not all this class that's the run
comment for the logger that you've got
for the framework I think we just
putting too much info there there we are
so now we've got an exception handler we
can make use of anywhere use default
services and they'll find in this and
running this so we've added the
exception handler so we go back to this
class we also want to add this log in so
we cut all of this logging out and we
then go to paste in there oh yeah so in
there so we've got exception handling no
it's only one line but it work region in
the log in we might as well I'm region
each what section so exception handling
logging services is just construction
dot services and the configuration is
construction up configuration we add
those I'm not going to add the file
logger is default for every single
person that uses this framework because
this is now out in the wild people can
polish nougat package I don't think
adding a text logger is it's really
standard I don't want to start writing
people's hard drives unexpectedly so I'm
gonna remove that file from there but
then we're gonna add it back as part of
the default services no we wanted to add
it to a part of our for set a word
application only and then that will show
you how to also customize the framework
from being able to just build it
normally to being customizable so remove
that bit so we're just growing member to
add the file thing back in and then
change that all so now this is what we
also need to be named at the default
logger I don't think we need an
extension method there in fact I'm doing
this wrong as well this should be in the
extension method so we will have and
then we won't need regions because this
will be a one-liner so we have that and
what again I forget a default logging
would be construction dot add default
logging is what I'd expect it to say or
a default logger
so because we actually have one here it
likes it's technically wrong we'll paste
that in change this to framework
construction change the distaff rainwork
construction and then add the default
logger and then that is now the comment
of this part here because that's the
little bit that we're keeping and kind
of refactoring this and there we go
construction do all our construction dot
services now this is where the add
default logger is now directly there and
structuring dot services to add that so
nothing's changed there and then we're
returning the construction and we said
the comment was this and then injects
the can let's keep the comment same the
default blah blah into the framework
construction
and you actually default bloggers on
default lager into the framework
construction the construction so we call
a default lager we add console and debug
lager with pulling the log in as normal
we add this specific non-generic I lager
so we can just invoke it so there's our
helper method there our extension method
rather use default services I'll
probably put the top in terms of
ordering so that it's better for the
order that you start there you have the
exception handling at the lager so we've
got the logger exception handler so I
think that is now all the default
services we have so we've got the
default services so the final one there
add file logger will do in the actual
for set a word application but we still
want the file logger to have that
extension method to be you know so we
can actually say don't use file logger
so for that we want to actually add a
file logger extension method so let's go
over to the file logger extensions and
in here we've already got one so onto
another one again specifically for the
framework construction we'll say add
file logger and again the framework
construction or the boilerplate
extension and we'll also pass in a
variable of say log path and we'll
default it to log txt and then we will
go to the framework extensions copy the
same comments so stays in the same kind
of format inject the default file or now
in this case not default so injects a
file logger
into the framework construction the
construction the path
of the file a lot too and then obviously
we chain the chain of construction so
you can keep going and then in that will
now do the normal so this is how now if
you want to make an extension or you
want to add a service that you can add
just the same way to the framework like
you make a custom thing now and say this
file Locker was yours this is all you do
you make an extension method exactly
like this now you can do construction
doc services and now you're at the
dependency injection level and they can
call you know adds add singleton add
transient all that lot and instead we
will call the add logging which control
dot sort of got dependency injection so
you can see now we've got the namespace
this is where I can call you add
singleton are transient to do it but
instead we'll call this our login which
is an extension method in itself built
into the dotnet core framework so we've
done that already in the add default
logger here so we'll just copy and paste
this because we've moved out the the
file login part
copy and paste that in and we'll say add
logging or make use of add blogging
extension and you can you can call this
out log in multiple times to get back to
your options we don't need to read the
configuration that sort of been added
previously the same as those two and now
we're just out back in the add file
which calls this extension right here
and then we know what the option to pass
in a path so will now pass in the log
path that's coming in as a variable and
this would be add file logger as that
has now changed nothing at all in terms
of what our code does but again we've
now made it an extension method so now
this should be use
Oh add file log we won't call it huge
use file logger because it's that's
Howard you know we're naming these huge
default services use file logger and
then obviously this will be in the
facetted word application we could pass
in log txt to customize it but that's
the default one so if you just do that
so we've now got down to this exactly
what we wanted and the last step is to
build which is the last step of the
build setup here so that's the only
thing left to really gel together
so the invoke now is no longer needed
where we had this injection to add
services now like I say you can simply
chain onto this construction and do
technically you could stop the chain and
do dot services to add transient add
scoped whatever and add your own
services so there's no need for this
injection method anymore because we
control the flow here so you don't need
to pass in a method specifically to get
access to these two values because we've
got access to the construction now so
that whole thing can simply go that's
not needed the one thing we will do
though is turn this into an extension
method so we can call that build that'll
be this framework construction
construction this comment let's just
restart this should be called once a
framework construction is finished
and we want to build it and start our
application the configuration and
injections gone the construction is the
construction and then obviously on our
help page to the DNA framework will now
put a comment if this is how you use it
at the start of your application at the
early stage you do this will make this
easier again we'll expand even more on
this to make it even cleaner but we can
start with that so as mentioned
injection isn't needed now we don't need
a wraparound latch it's so simple the
build will still log so we'll log the
completion environment now is just
environment because it's in the
framework and it's been built here will
be in a minute
so this environment then will be pulled
from that
the injection so we can just change that
to the actual thing so the service
provider now uses the construction
doctor services build and that's it so
that's now the final step of the the
chain thing so really all of these are
just replacing this one function so even
though this seems more complicated in
code now so yes we had originally one
simple class that said startup and he
did all of that in there did everything
it didn't configure he did the default
services I did the logger and built so
you got the benefit of a single class
there but what you've lost is one the
cleanliness to the end-user to be able
to do this kind of step-by-step setup
and also everything we wanted to do with
that you know customizing this whole
environment and configuration would have
had to have been done with parameters
passed into this method so you would
have had multiple parameters we already
had configuration then we had injection
then if we wanted to customize something
else you keep adding and adding and
adding to these parameters whereas this
kind of segregate sit and splits up the
also splits up the code into multiple
areas in one way in a good way one way
in a bad way that you might go where is
everything but now you can clearly see
where little chunks of the setup are and
you can invoke them as you wish in how
you wish to build the service or so
you'll find that this kind of extension
methodology and chaining is used a lot
in dotnet core you know the Microsoft
team made heavy use of this not I do
like you in certain situations like this
so that's why I've kind of structured
this framework in the same way so we've
got this now and we just want to clean
this up a little bit more so to do that
what we'll do is we have the as folder
eyes this again folder eyes is that word
probably not we have really the core
stuff of the framework so let's just say
well no doesn't let's leave them as in
the root let's make one called default
and then here I'll add another class
that's called default framework
subscription in fact we can make
construction a folder
and then that can just go in should've
just rename the folder wheel and soaping
the framework construction this really
is the framework itself that stays out
so we have a default framework
construction what we're gonna do is
clean up that make public class deform
construction and it's going to override
the on the overrides and implement the
framework construction as a base class
I'm going to make a new constructor
default constructor so in this we
already have the framework construction
Rock constructor run into this long run
first so we've got those three what we
want to do is take these so that's the
snoot that's kind of you don't need to
do that we want to do these two things
because these are always going to be a
default if you will configure and use
default services so we'll cut them out
and we'll paste them in can we'll do
this because we are the object itself so
we now make a new default framework
construction instead of a framework
construction we don't even have to do
the configure or default services so we
just say configure and add people
services or there we go so we have those
two methods what's this complaining
about no comment good creates a default
framework construction containing all
the default and decoration and services
so there's our default frame with
construction so now this can be one step
easier and it can be now default
construction and then our custom line
the single line its custom is now used
file logger and dot build so if
somebody's not adding a file log when
they using just completely off-the-shelf
DNA framework they can now just do that
new default framework construction bills
that's all
we need to put the starter there that
code and also we now need to put the
start of our pasetta word code is this
instead so this is what we want to do
here if we remove that to the clipboard
for now and I think unless I've missed
anything this should now build so that's
built so in order to test this we will
need a compulsion ooga package probably
we need to want to test it here so if
you want to do this live when say the
nougat package isn't live because if the
videos gone up that quick or you just
want to edit the source code yourself to
T in here framework just right-click on
for set a word or whatever project
you're in go to installed and that's
just uninstall the new package for DNA
framework and then instead we will add
the existing project which will be angel
60 in a framework source about the
project buck this is how it was before
we made the nougat package and then in
here we'll add a reference to the
framework so now we're using the code we
literally just wrote so this should now
fail because it's not called startup
anymore so we change that now to this so
a new framework construction don't use
file logger build if we open the folder
this is in and go to bin-debug so we
don't have a log yet so there's no log
file so we run up to this point
presuming all this builds and runs now
we should get the default constructor
and we're good of the what we used to
have in the output so we should have the
log output saying it started and we
should also have a log file
so we've hit there you can see we've got
the stuff we normally have which is the
console and the debug logger so I think
the first ones the console the seconds
the debug hence the create initial start
of the string there for a critical
message and more importantly now we
should have the log file which we do so
this log file has now got the log
message in so to prove that's definitely
working let's remove the use file logger
delete the log and run and you can see
that's how easy it now is to configure
this framework if you don't want file
log you you don't do
a lot so you've got no file logging so
that's that we can also say change the
name a new log
txt and run and we should end up with a
file called a new log txt in a moment
and there you go so this is now nice and
easy and configurable in kind of a
chaining method so say you didn't want
to do the default construction while you
can see from source code all you have to
do is create a new framework
construction called configure dot
whatever so if you wanted to replace
this with a completely custom one then
you just do new film with construction
dot configure and you could pass in then
your default configuration and do what
you want the configuration so you can
add your sources you can do whatever so
that's you know your option to do cost
them on there and then at this point
you'd get out of what you want so you do
the use will be the extension methods
they use file logger use default
services or you can do whatever you want
but the point there is obviously now you
in complete control of this loop so you
could do dot configure don't use var
logger that will no longer use the
console logger because we haven't had
any services whatsoever so if we run
that now presuming we got no missing
dependencies which we do so you can see
this logger we have no logger because
the use file logger is presuming you are
using the default login so if we went to
where we go to logger extensions maybe
nope
where was it framework so the a default
logger adds in fact that as a point wise
the logger not added oh because we
haven't added this transient thing here
so this transient might want to be
placed in well no really this is this is
the point as the default logger so if we
were to say chocolate in the file logger
extension for use file logger and just
don't be there then the code should work
just to prove a point about
and that's that's kind of built-in so
there we go so we have no console
logging but we should have file login
which is there so that's just a little
setup up showing you how you can now you
know configure this easier than we did
before we're not it's really easier but
nicer looking and easier to customize
and this is going to now be the new
facetted word construction so that's
that let's just make sure I remove the
thing from file logger extensions there
so hopefully that was a good explanation
of extension methods as well as showing
you how to heavily use them at the same
time as hopefully making you solve them
in a real application so it wasn't just
wasted on a demo if you will the one
thing I do want to mention with the nuga
package I'll now pushing you on life for
the DNA framework so this framework what
somebody ment noticed when I push this
live was the nougat package had no once
you reference a nougat package so I can
actually show you this is easier just to
show you probably move that from for
such a word and I managed nougat
packages browse for DNA that framework
and it should show up okay it's taken
forever what's going on about broke my
internet there we go hunt took forever
so click that install and okay accept
and then we go to the things where it's
in a start up this will not fail doesn't
exist but the point though the point of
that is now if we did framework which is
the DNA framework dot say start at the
original call you can see we've got no
comments so all of our XML comments that
are on our classes so obviously all of
these comments here this comment this
comment everything everywhere
whole point of these as we should get
int a license showing the the comments
and they're not there so the reason
they're missing is because when you go
to your project properties of the thing
you're making the Nuba package you for
go to build and make sure to check xml
documentation file to generate the xml
so even though this generates in a
different folder so if we were to go to
bin-debug and here you can see there's
the comment file it will just delete
this or in fact delete the whole bin and
the object change us to release one
check or other check that make sure it's
in the release mode so debug mode we
actually don't want them in go to
release mode and build the project is
normal you'll see we have been release
and you got the comment file so we
right-click and do pack we should get
the nougat package and see it's 11
kilobytes and this is how we know it's
got comments interview uncheck the XML
right-click and pack you should see this
will drop in file size so now 8
kilobytes so you know it's now included
more data so the thing I missed in the
creating a new that package video is to
make sure you check xml documentation
file in specifically the release build
because that's what you'll publish in so
that's that don't know no matter off
quickly show you how to now publish your
next version so this is now ready we
want the next version so one thing i
would do is go to where are we as it
baked into baked into the package or
believe now anyway so in here it's all
in this package section so you can focus
on this area well change it to one point
two point one will change in a way I
want the author has me I know it shows
off as me there when I search but no I
believe it is that I was going to change
that to angels export can stay as me so
we of that will also bump up the
assembly version the assembly file
version as the physical you know the
physical files version that can be
different
I tend to just keep everything matched
so just change all three so the the
matching and then you don't get any
confusion so once you got all three
that's it bill just to be sure
right-click pack and go to your file and
we should get 11 we haven't got 11 so
that hasn't built I don't believe that's
why you want to make sure probably best
deleting and building and I've noticed
as a few times here it's not building
now it has everything's it's built
because maybe we just need to do a clean
solution and then right-click and pack
and it'll build and then clean so I'd
always wipe your folder and then make
sure you know what you've been an object
folder do a build clean and then publish
so now this is ready to push and all you
have to do is do the CMD and then in
here we do the dotnet nougat posh key s
and we'll do all that so I'll do that
off offline you've seen it during the
last video I'll push this live that will
be done that is all done so we're we're
okay there and this will then work once
I once this is pushed and it's live and
nougat I can just right click for seta
would manage nougat packages go to
updates and DNA dot framework should
show here and now update and then I'll
push all this source code live at the
end of the video so all this is already
done for you but now you should be able
to follow so hopefully that was a good
explanation of extension methods as well
as like as they're natural use and again
like at the end of each video for a
while now I'll just mention I do now
have a patreon page if you guys want to
support me in what I do you know from
the videos that are free so if you go to
patreon.com/scishow 6 then you'll see my
patreon page here where you can support
what I'm doing I've got goals and
pledges and all sorts you can have a
good read on there find out and we
decide you want to support what I'm
doing that's entirely up to you but
be you know really beneficial and as
always any comments or questions on the
video any help you need just mention
them and you know I'll get back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
