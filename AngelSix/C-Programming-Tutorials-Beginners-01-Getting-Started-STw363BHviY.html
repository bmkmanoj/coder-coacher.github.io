teaching you to program in c-sharp over
the course of these videos you'll learn
all aspects of the sheesh art
programming language all videos will be
kept short and to the point to help you
to learn step by step this course is
aimed at beginners who have little or no
knowledge in programming in future
courses I'll cover more advanced topics
and specific areas such as websites some
winforms WPF and so on and this tutorial
we'll be going over installing Visual
Studio creating a console application
looking at the program structure having
a quick look at variable types and
reading in some console text and
outputting some to the window so let's
get started if you haven't got Visual
Studio installed already open Google
type Visual Studio go to Visual Studio
calm /downloads and you can install
Visual Studio Community Edition which is
free for individuals and non business
simply save the file double-click and go
through the install it's really simple
once Visual Studio is installed you can
run and then this is the main window you
should have a star page if you don't
don't worry you can just do file new
project or if the start page is open you
can use the shortcut here start project
a new project you've got a lot of
different templates I wouldn't worry
about them all for now I just simply
click this search on the top right type
the word console and you're looking for
the one that ends in visual C sharp and
it says simply console application the
locations where it's going to store the
files and the name is the name of the
application so the default console
application one is fine for now click OK
this will create your solution file in
your project right-click on the console
application one over in the right-hand
side and click open folder in File
Explorer and you can see here is the
files that have been created the bin and
the object folder are temporary compile
folders so the bin is where your program
gets compiled to in terms of that's your
actual program so when you want to
distribute or install this is the the
files of your application and the object
file is more temporary files that have
been made during the compilation so it's
safe to delete these two folders at any
time it's just that when you do build
your solution they will recreate these
folders so don't think of these as you
know your source code or your anything
you write these are automatically
created then you've got you can see over
here the properties which if you expand
as assembly info which you can see in
here is assembly info you've got the app
config which is there you've got the
program which is that and then you've
got the SLN which is a solution file
which means a it's the top-level
solution that can hold multiple projects
when your program gets larger and you
split off into multiple projects that's
what the bead have a single solution
with multiple projects and the CS proj
tons for c-sharp project so when you
want to open your program so you close
this down in you finish working you can
simply double click the SLM file and
this reopens your solution you can also
click the CS proj file but that will
open just that project so is your
project gets bigger so if your program
gets bigger then you want to make sure
you're opening the solution file not the
project otherwise it will be opening
just a single part of your application
so there's the physical files that you
can see that much this solution Explorer
on the right hand side this references
folder isn't a real file
you can see is not in this folder
anywhere it's actually a list of
external references to other programs
and other libraries like this Microsoft
got c-sharp so that we can actually use
functions in our code that we can do
certain things with that opening files
opening websites sending data to the
console all that kind of stuff so
references are third-party links to
other programs so let's start with this
assembly info file you can see here it's
got a bunch of information the parts
you're concerned about are in red and
primarily this group here and these two
here so this is the version number of
your product and this is general
information if you go to build and build
solution you can see down here it says
build successful one succeeded if you
then right click over here and open
folder and file explorer go to bin debug
and you can see he is the output program
this is your actual program if you right
click properties details you'll see this
information matches here so you've got
your name your description your names
your title your description version
number all that informations here so you
basically want to populate this with
your company or personal information you
don't have to do but it's a nice thing
to do
then you have your app config we're not
gonna worry about that right now that
basically tells the console application
to use a specific version of the.net
framework and then you've got your
program CS now with this being a console
application and that being effectively a
program that runs in the command prompt
so it runs in this window you only have
a single entry point into the
application and it's called static void
main
so anything in here the program will run
it will start here and it will run to
here in between these brackets once it's
finished here the program will close so
we click start right now you'll just
briefly see the black screen appear and
disappear and that's because it's ran
here there's nothing to do and then it's
closed the program so let's quickly stop
that let's type console with a capital C
dot read line which will wait until we
press the Enter key so now if the
program will start the black screen will
open here then I'll hit this line and
then it will be stuck on this line until
we press Enter because we've said read a
line so it's going to read everything we
type until we press the word enter and
then once it hits here or closed so we
click start or press f5 you can see is
now opened and it's stayed open so we
type something and then we press Enter
it's then closed so your console
application will always come in at this
main function it will run the code
that's in here and then it will close so
that's what's happening so let's go over
this file these using statements they
are shortcuts if we want to use certain
things that are in the references to
like Microsoft c-sharp system system
core all parts of the dotnet framework
so one of them that we've just used as
the console as you can see system
console which means it's in the system
file which is in Program Files reference
assemblies dotnet framework so the thing
that's writing out to the console we
haven't written that code that actually
does the reading in the writing these
are functions that Microsoft have
written that allow us to do it nice and
easy so in order to write to the screen
we can simply say write line
hello world and if we press f5 to run
hope we'll also need to do a console
that read line just to allow that window
to stay open you can see we've now
written to the screen so this has helped
us to write to the screen by simply
calling an existing function in this
system reference so the point of this
using as you can see has now gone black
because we are actually making use of it
here is so we don't have to tab the full
name of the function which is system
console so because we're done using and
then the word system anything inside
this system namespace can be typed
directly in this class without having to
type the word system so system dot and
you can see console so we were to delete
all these usings the program is still
capable of running but now you can see
it can't find console we have to type
system dot console because that's the
fully qualified name so the point of the
using statements is so that your code is
cleaner shorter and you don't get naming
conflicts if we create something called
console in this class as well we can
happily use it because our namespace is
different so just think of right now as
the using statements as a shortcut if
you will things that you can then write
cleaner and shorter because they're the
same using a namespace is part of what
we've tacked here so you can see
namespace system this names basis our
namespace so this is our program so this
name this class program is inside the
console application one namespace which
means for other parts of the program to
use it if they aren't in this namespace
they have to do using and then console
application one in order to type the
word program otherwise they'd have to
type console application one dot program
so these two are in somewhat related
again not critical right now just a
quick overview
then you come to this a class now a
class is just a collection of objects a
collection of functions variables a lot
of stuff you haven't gone over yet so
just think of this class as a group if
you will a collection and that's all
we'll say on this in this tutorial this
here is a function so you can tell it's
a function because it has what's called
a return type here which is void which
means it's returning nothing so the
thing that calls this function won't get
anything back it's it's not returning
anything then you have the function name
then you have brackets and inside the
brackets we have parameters which are
things that get passed into the function
so you see this console dot write line
this is a function just like our main
it's inside the system console class
then the parameters if you open a
bracket you can see the parameter if we
flick through because you can see
there's 19 different parameters you'll
see there a string value so how we've
got a string and then this angle square
brackets means array means multiple
strings this has just one string so this
console dot write line is expecting a
single string which is text it's a you
know human readable text if you will for
the most part so it's expecting us to
pass in a string and then inside that
write line function the console code
goes and outputs this string to the
screen for us you can see there's as
void console.writeline so it's also
returning nothing so we're expecting
nothing back it will simply do its job
and return and then this word static
means that this function is a single
function static is only one of it so
there is no more than one of this if you
were to create multiple classes of this
program then this main function would
not be inside there this is a single
function there is no multiple versions
let's give you a quick example of that
so if I make another class plus B I
don't expect you to understand this code
it's just to show you the point and then
if we did a program a as a new program
and you can see it's prefixed our
console application 1 dot program
namespace by default you can actually
remove that because we are in the same
namespace and then if we do another one
and call it B we've now created two
versions of this class if we access the
functions inside of this plus the
information contained in that program
group with a dot you can see the
function isn't there because it's static
so it won't exist inside instances of
the program whereas if we create a new
function which isn't static and we put
the keyword public in front so that it's
visible you can do a dot and you can see
we've got a main two we can actually see
that so this gets created because it's
not static it gets created with every
program so a contains a main two and B
contains a main two the two different
instances of that function so the static
means that it's a single function in
order to access that function you need
to simply tab the name of the program
and in this case it would have to be
probably in order to see it from
anywhere outside of itself
you could then see main so you can then
access this function so the difference
here is we've created what's called a
variable of type program called a and
it's a new instance so it's a copy of
this entire class and inside the copy
static functions and static variables
won't exist statics are a single
instance
I think that's enough on static for now
because that will make a lot more sense
once you understand classes and
variables and things of that nature but
it's always nice together a quick
overview for those that are interested
so back to where we were so we've got a
namespace and are using which you know
now a class you're thinking of right now
is just a collection containing more
information and we have a function here
and this main function is for the
console application the entry point when
you double-click your exe your program
so we double click this it runs and it
instantly jumps to this star line this
is where the program begins and then it
runs the right line and the red line so
before we can do much else we need to
know what variables are variables are
pieces of information so they contain
bits bytes strings numbers all the
pieces of information your program needs
a program is primarily a bunch of data
so a bunch of valuables and a lot of
code on how to act and manipulate that
data so things like your functions and
your logic so we need to know all the
types of variables so to make a variable
you start by typing the specific type of
variable so in this case let's create a
byte just wrap the word byte then the
name of the variable so calling my byte
and you can end there that can create a
variable now in order to instance eight
that you can do equals and then give it
a value so let's give this a number 12
so firstly what is a byte so a byte as
it says here is a representation of
8-bit unsigned integer now that won't
mean much to you right now but what that
means you open the calculator and you go
to programmer and go to binary now it
says it's 8 bits so click the number one
eight times
because a1 and a0 are a single bit so
now you've got 8 bits you can see here
the decimal which is a normal number as
255 so that means a byte can be a number
from 0 all the way up to 255 which is
256 different numbers because 0 is also
a number if you try and create one let's
say 256 it's going to complain because
you can't have a number greater than
that because a byte can't contain that
much information so a byte there's an 8
bit number
8-bit variable the next thing you've got
is a character now a character is twice
the size it's 16 bits so let's call it
my car and you can define a character
with single quotes and then you can type
on your keyboard a single letter
anything on your keyboard that you can
type any character any symbol if you
want to do specific symbols like single
quotes you do a forward slash and then
the symbol so thinking in a type of
single one if you type two then it's
going to complain the character is a
single there's too many characters so
you have to have one so a character
contains usually a single letter like
this string here hello world would be
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven characters plus a null
terminator so it'd be 12 characters long
don't worry again too much about what
you do with these right now just think
about the types and in general what they
are so a byte is a number between 0 and
255 a character is still a number it's a
16 bit so everything in a variable is a
number
everything is zeros and ones so a
character is 16 bits so
16-bits is effectively a number between
0 and 65,535 so when you're tapping the
number 2 that's a specific number so I
think off the top of my head say the
number a I think may be capitalized as
like the number 65 you can find that out
by typing ASC III table into Google and
then you'll realize that every letter on
your keyboard is effectively just a
specific number so the number 65 I
believe is a and then 66 is be things
like that so again 16 bits you can
define them with single quotes and you
can physically write the letter A but
you could also just write a number as
well and in this case we just have to
cast to tell Visual Studio that we're
expecting a character then you have a
short now a short is 16 bits again but
this time it's just a it's expecting a
number by default so you see in the
character even though we can type a
number it goes red we have to explicitly
cast using this brackets and then the
the type car to tell visual studio that
we are actually expecting a character
we're just defining it with a number
whereas a short is already expecting to
be a number so we can just type 65 so
even though these two variables can
store the exact same piece of
information they are defined differently
and if that's all to help you when
you're programming to understand by
looking at what you're typing and by
looking at what type of variable
something is - what piece of information
you're expecting so if it's a character
you're expecting it to be typically
letters if it's a short you expecting it
to be a number the next stop is int
which stands for integer which is whole
number that's because that's a better
name
I'm sure you'll also notice on the right
side where I'm putting two forward
slashes and everything goes green this
is a comment in code so this is a
human-readable comment just for your own
reading this won't go into codes this
won't be compiled it's it's purely
something you type in order to help
understand the code you've written so
let's do int my end I'm an integer is a
32-bit number a whole number so this
could be two million four hundred
thousand it can be a really large number
and again if you want to know how large
open your calculator you've got 16 bits
you see here the integer can be a very
large number if you hover over the
integer there's two types of integer
there's what's called a signed and an
unsigned now assigned is something that
can go in negative to a positive
so this integer can't actually go to
this number so if we try and place this
number in you can see it complains
because it's too large
by default the integer can handle a
negative number under positive so it's
half of this number so view divided by 2
this is actually the maximum number you
can have you go one more over and you
can't go because as well as having all
these positive numbers it has the same
amount in reverse it has the negatives
if you want to define the large number
with you're storing some really large
information you can do it you int which
stands for unsigned as in there's no
minus sign so you have to store whole
numbers positive whole numbers only
so my you int can be this really large
number so the same size but this can
store higher numbers but no negatives
and this can store for example a
negative number the reason for that of
you interested is as the name suggests
unsigned
one of the pieces of information has to
be this sign so part of these 32 bits
has to be used to store whether it's
negative or positive so you lose a bit
of information which means you've half
the amount of information you can store
then you have partial numbers so you
have a float and a float can be one
point two three four five and we end it
with a lowercase F because by default
when you explicitly type a number Visual
Studio wants to create what's called a
double which is twice the position which
is 64 bits so a lowercase F we define a
float and a float is 32 bits just like
an integer same same size of information
however it stores floating-point numbers
so you can't store you know a huge
number you can just store a very precise
number they've all got the different
uses that you'll come to see the more
you learn a double is again the same
it's a floating point number two decimal
place with precision after but this time
it's 64 bits so it's got a lot of
information and then finally on the
number side there's a decimal and this
is a really large number this is a very
high precision floating point number so
in you can have a lot of digits after
the number and this has 128 bits of
information per variable and again here
it's trying to cast it to a double so we
have to explicitly state that we are
creating a decimal
and then we have a few more as you see
here we've got hollow world
this hollow world is actually a valuable
in terms of its a string so a string is
again you can think of it for the most
part as texts that you write so hello
world strictly a string is actually a
class it's not a variable so it's a
collection of characters but it usually
is referred to as a variable because
it's so widely used and then lastly we
have a boolean which is a true or false
so it can literally be true or it can be
false and that's the only things it can
be now all these will come into play in
the next video we'll get to use these as
we go and you'll see how all this comes
together the reasons for you know why
you need all these types of variables
but this is just a general overview of
the variables so we'll leave that there
just so you can see them and I think
that's where we'll end this tutorial in
the next video
we'll go straight into a console
application they read some information
from the user create some variables does
some calculations and output some
information so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
