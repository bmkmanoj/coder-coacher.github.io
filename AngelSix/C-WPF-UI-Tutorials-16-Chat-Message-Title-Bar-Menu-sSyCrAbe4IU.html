going to do this top header bar inside
the chat with the name of the people in
the chat the search and the drop down
I'm just going to make that general head
we're not going to the full drop-down
menu and search functions just gain the
main UI Dom for now so we're going to do
that and along the way I think we're
just going to fix again a few little
things that need fixing so we just press
f5 to run the application and one of
them is I keep noticing well two on this
page you've started the application you
start typing nothing happens so we want
to focus this email box when it first
opens so that you by default ready to
sign in without having to click so we'll
start with that if we go to the login
page
we've got a text box here now the few
things with focus there's a focus
manager inside WPF which you could put
on say this top grids can do like focus
manager Docs focused elements and then
you can do find into an element name and
you can bind say like password text but
all that does is this is a visual
I think it's called visual focus or
virtual focus if I remember which and
you can see it's like it's it's made it
the focus or the logical focus I believe
is what they call it so this is
logically focused but it's not got
keyboard focus and that's why it's not
flashing and every time that still
doesn't work so what it's done is made a
visual element as if you've got it
selected so the WPF style for when this
is selected is to flash this correct but
it's not actually caught the keyboard
focus so the focus manager only really
does half the job that we need so
instead of using focus manager we'll
just make a simple attach property on
this textbox so we go to the touch
properties let's just copy and paste the
button attach properties rename this
file to test detached properties
and then we'll make a new attack
property that focuses this element on
load and we'll Paul it is focused copy
and paste that into there
override beyond value changed and then
inside of here which is first check that
we have a control as we need a list of
control to set focus
so if sender is control we'll call it
control so then we're saying if it's not
a control simply return so we don't have
a control to turn
and then if we do have a control we can
now do control that load is unless an
outfit loading and then when it does
that we want to simply do control that
focus focus this control and slowly and
what that will do the focus of what
windows will give you a description so
they have no documentation on that focus
which is a little bit poor but anyway
that focus set keyboard focus and their
virtual focus or logical focus whatever
they call it and because this is going
to happen on load and because these are
loaded in order sequential order if we
place this focused on this element and
on this element as the loading this will
become focused and if that loads this
had taken to roll and be focused so
typically will only use this once per
page or once per control to you know set
which how about acting you want to be
the first keyboard focused item so just
do it as focused property dot value
equals true and then compile nut should
find and work oh yes it's got to be in
the local namespace
and that that's where we run this
together again
and there you can see emails focus by
default emoji start typing so that's
that point on the other issue is you've
type email you've typed password you
press Enter and nothing happens that's a
really quick fix so there's something
called is default that you can set on
controls that means it's the default to
enter that basically the item that's
going to get clicked when it enters
pressed and it goes rather way back to
Windows forms days when they used to
call it is default and is canceled for
dialog boxes and the default button was
the okay and the council was the council
so it takes his name from many years ago
so is default basically means that the
button that will be clicked when the
user presses enter on the keyboard so we
set that to the login button that's
called Next button in the comments at
the minute we type something passed
after and we press enter now you can see
then add the same effect of pressing the
button for us so that's another little
thing fixed let's just fix this comment
to say the login button
load their and then the other thing I
noticed when we change the blue for this
bubble to look more like the image this
become darker image you can see also
fades strings who want to actually add
back this there's blue value the
original lighter blue that we had here
and set this is the lighter blue and
keep that as darker so we need to first
give it two colors draw in styles colors
will go to the blue I think it's called
light blue very light blue so that blue
light blue very light blue and now we're
in a very very light blue so got
multiple gradients of blue at the moment
which is fine and what we're going to do
with this one is put this back to the
original value before it was we darken
this and that's going to be e to the f6f
peak and now we want to go back to the
shuttle list item control go to the
samel for that and then it's the style
for the background of this control where
we set the color so you see very light
blue here so change that's a very very
light blue and the same above here for
both animations and then let's see if
that fits that issue
there we go now we've got the nice
lighter blue that goes more accurate
here and then we've got a slightly
darker blue which you wouldn't notice
you wouldn't realize they're two
different blues but they are so that
solves that issue then I'd say another
issue I noticed was see how we've right
aligned the x here or left aligned
rather but then on the messages we
receive the still left aligned I think
that's them right there being under this
our row so we're going to write a line
that time it's just a stackpanel so
that'll be in the chat message list item
control again in the saml and it's these
two boxes here which we just set the
background of blood for now so we can
see other invisible but the time is
after these these here which is this
stat panel here at the time container
let's just get rid of that background
and then the stack panel is not even
aligned we've aligned the time to the
right
I don't know how will the alignment
right in the heaven
those are doing nothing anyway so we
want to so the horizontal alignment here
buying into the sent by me the converter
is going to be the SEM by meter
alignment converter but by default you
can see that's the wrong way around so
we're just going to pass in a converter
parameter of anything we'll just a crew
and then we go to that sent by me
alignment converter and we can simply
invert this logic so we'll just say EV
parameter isn't lethal to non so the
default behavior right now is it's no or
in rather the Elat keep that that way so
this is a default behavior otherwise
we'll just do the opposite or align the
opposite way around so that we can pass
in a parameter to the converter to flip
basically like flip the boolean around
so we compile this now you can see now
that fixes that and we have a right
aligned bubble so there's the overall we
just put a quick background on here so
you can see the bubble has been aligned
to or this section here the bubbles been
around to the right with the margin it's
got and then a stack panel inside has
been aligned to the left so we were to
just change the converter parameters to
be not just get rid of it it's here to
go the opposite way so we've basically
made a flutter ball alignment based on a
boolean so you see they're going to be
left or right let's remove that red
and let's run this
and there we go that's better so now the
time goes on there you know the end of
each message and that aligns it
correctly
so what's next see I think now we want
to that that's all the issues oh I know
actually the register page also needs
the default button and the same with
email I want to make sure we do it for
both so is default for true there and
the email once to have what was it gold
as focused property was it true let's
just check that works
and they're real I work for the sign off
the enter either doesn't work or we
haven't got the register hooked up so
we've got the register
looks like the animations potentially
not working on that bond OOP then mean
to flip that around again
okay so that works there
what do you actually have going on with
the register button
so we do nothing but wait there's an
interesting thing
because it looks like this as default is
not really working because it's almost
like it's it's taking focus away from
the box and then we've logged in it's
like it's calling the the login pages
button still so we just remove the login
page as default on that button let's see
if that means the register page things
because that shouldn't be yeah so when
we have to is default even though we've
removed the login screen it's still
remembering that button in memory
so let's take a quick look at what we do
when we swap these pages or in fact the
easier thing to confirm that is to go to
the vlog interview model let's put a
breakpoint on the actual login button so
we know that it's going to get hit and
if we go here type and press enter now
we're not hitting the login button we
press enter again it seems good like
when it's twice so pressing enter twice
is causing it to hit the login button
which is kind of bizarre because we
don't have that login button on the
screen and when we do a go to page
what we are doing to set in the current
page and
kourin page and then the page host
we are changing the frame should animate
out Arman room weather because we have
it inside of a frame and we want to make
it out that's the issue what we need to
do is once as old pages animated out we
need to remove assault from the old
frame so what we need to do here is a
tell old page to animate out once it is
done remove it so we need to task dot
delay by old page dot and then do we
have the slide seconds is that what we
use time a slide animation should
complete just double check what we used
if you dynamic out animate out slide
second Jess so we want to delay by
whatever the time it's going to take to
animate out times of thousand because
about seconds and delay as milliseconds
so
time slide seconds float doesn't like
the fact that it's a float so as we
delay by that much
and then once it's done continue with we
don't want to say all page frame content
equals not I'm hoping that's enough to
fix that issue and then the register
button should as soon as it's led out
become the default button so yeah we're
going to jump back on the UI thread here
application dot current dot dispatcher
dot again invoke or without invoke here
so you can't do anything on the UI when
you're not on the UI thread and because
we jumped off the UI thread here to
delay we didn't start back on the UI
thread so this just jumps us back to the
single UI thread so that we can perform
you know this action which is to alter
the UI but at least that shows that was
working it was trying to remove the
login page so as we've slide we should
see it fully slide out we shouldn't see
get removed halfway so we want to pay
attention for when this slides to make
sure it is sliding out and then removing
a little bit glitchy let's do that again
there we go see is still sliding out
perfectly fine and now within the signup
page we press enter that's it now it's
using the register buttons enter which
just spins and press again inspire slide
out press enter and now it's using the
correct page so there was a little bug
that we've only caught because we happen
to to add to is defaults so that's
another problem fixed just close all
these open pages
let's start the application up once more
that's the sign in the register page all
done I'm happy with that we've fixed
that side menu that was a bit annoying
we fix the alignment here now let's get
on to I guess making what we planted it
was making this top bar so that is in
the chat page I think now the one other
thing we want to see it really visually
in the main window this is another
little annoying so this main window you
can see it's animated I hope if you will
of it it's ready to animate in or it
won't in fact now it's animated out
because this page we have specified that
the side menu visible if we look at the
default value it's false oh sorry so
it's the other way around it's actually
animated out because we've set side menu
visible to false by default and whereas
once we load the page the page changes
the side menu visible and logs in so
actually if we just change then the
current page
to chat and mr. true I don't think we
ever see the page because the BPF just
isn't smart enough to show what we can
see the sidemen year so that's actually
okay there and I'd just like to ideally
see the chat menu here
but the issue WPF has is it cannot
dynamically load in pages without the
page being a complete route in fact
there we go there's the solution so it's
kind of a little hack for now but so we
can visually see while we're designing
we could potentially think it through
and do more but at least see if I can
just put in a chat page directly in a
grid column one
and you see just doesn't like to load so
even though we have this the chat page
in or is the page host simply over the
top of it nope or maybe do we have
nothing on that page let's try a login
page now they just does not like to show
the page at all
yes no matter what we do we just does
not like to to show it page inside you
know when you end better control
directly inside so then you're down to
using a frame with source I think it is
and Obi is like just pages login pages
Amal nothing is just a string let's just
try to keep outside of this controlled
for now and just completely comment out
the whole code
so this just doesn't seem to like no
matter what you do it does not like to
put a page in there I'm just wondering
whether we even use a page to be honest
because we are going to do our own
navigation and comment screw things up
here let's just undo that so the point
of a page is to kind of get all the
benefits of you know page navigation and
the thing we removed anyway and then
we've done a custom control to uneme
tout pages I'm in two minds to convert
the pages so even though it's a page I
think we might just convert this to
let's give it a little a quick go we
won't go too far in we'll just do a
quick content other than we even want to
content control because we are the page
itself and we just want the user control
so just start with this let's see what
breaks and let's try and move these to
just simple contents so we don't have a
title so we can add that afterwards
because we don't see the title anyway so
we're quite up to remove title remove
that from all three
and that builds I don't think I was
going to work somehow there's no way
that's going to work by just removing
page notes there we guess where
everything goes all messed up there so
now if we're not a page or did I just
screw this up on I added a login page
there which now shows and I also change
the default current page then let's just
change that back to login and that
hidden let's just see if anything's
working so we've lost slide animation
well we've actually only lost the slide
in animation we've got the slide out I
think that slid in it's just purely the
slide in animation of the page we've
lost so let's go look at the base page
and let's have a look why this may have
broke so I'm guessing it's boiling down
to the the width getting the page width
I'd slide from right so element actual
which I'm guessing is now broken so
that's coming from you know our elements
which is obviously now a user control
and it's unloaded which is fine so
what's happened as we've lost the
elements actual width so you wouldn't
get any other width
as probably just because we haven't
loaded it in yet whereas a page would
have parents width so width is not a
number now I do remember we did this for
in fact I think I know what it is with
now when I'll call in a different
function because it's now not a page I
think that's what we do an extension
property here so we go to animations web
page animation here or rather the page
animations which was when it was a page
and then we would get the window width
so because we're now not a page our
extension method is instead boiled down
to framework element extension to the
exact same name so we want to give the
ability here to override the width I
guess and we'll do the width of 0 and
then we'll say of the width equals 0
I'll do the element width otherwise
we'll pass in the width and we'll fix
that for here and here in fact all four
of those but once we've proven this 1
gets fixed so then we look at where this
is now used you can see it's in the page
so the animate in we now want to specify
the width to be and this would have been
the window width so we're going to now
have to do application dots and this is
presuming we're always going to load
anything that's a base page into the
window even though we could load it
anywhere just for animations to work so
application current dot main window dot
with I think maybe will work it doesn't
lie double to int fine in
now let's see if that's fix the animate
in and there we go that was really
painless I thought that was going to be
a lot harder than it was so now we've
got and it looks like so far
everything's working okay we've
completely removed a page so it's now
just a user control let's go ahead and
fix the other four animations in case we
use the others and add a comment so and
the animation whip to animate out or
animate - if not specifies the elements
which is used so just copy that comments
firstly into all of them so we want to
copy a complete line like I'm doing here
simply select but don't have anything
I'll add you just click somewhere and
press control C and that will copy your
entire line plus the new line so when
you come to paste it will just paste you
know nicely on a new line then we want
to pass in this width property at the
end of each function
there we go and now we want to pass in
this logic here
that's a plus f5 make sure nothing's
broke
so that all works now the reason I
wanted to get rid of the page as I
started to just sort of talk to myself
originally was because we can't see in
the main window and I'm thinking this
issue here with the main window now is
more of we just need to clean delete
everything restart visual studio to get
it to appear because there's no details
page animation based page move next
loaded in case it's the base page on the
scroll loaded so apparently it's maybe
listen out for loaded and do things
let's completely comment that out and
see if that fixes the issue and then
let's put it back in and make sure that
is the issue okay so it's seeing
something in here and I know what that's
going to be so the issue now is I'm
guessing it's the way this animate in so
if we just comment that out and it's
going to be with that window width we
just specified yep so we then boil down
into this and I'm guessing if we didn't
specify this
yeah so the issue is probably with this
statement here to get the width and this
is to animate in well a quick fix that
there's probably a way of getting the
window width at design time here I'm not
going to bother trying to think of that
for now all's I'm going to do is on the
base page loaded or in fact yeah for the
animation let's just say don't bother
animating in design time we're not going
to lose much there you're just not going
to see slide in in design time so I
think it's called designer properties I
think yep designer properties dot get it
in design mode and the sender is this
page that's fine I think not converting
dependency yes you can well what a page
anyway let's just pass in this that's
fine
so this will say if we're in design time
then just return so now if we build and
the animation still in in this animate M
value still M so now we we don't get an
issue here we're also still not getting
the page but let's just check the
application still works at this stage
yep so we're getting closer now so the
final thing we need to try and do is get
the page to load in here to visually see
the page so let's first check we can
actually load the page again which I'm
sure we can now so let's do say log in
page it still doesn't want to show okay
let's move out again I think we might
need to clean Visual Studio
restart and reopen because we did see it
earlier when we were doing this for
perhaps I think what it might be
actually is does the base page hide
itself by default did we add that to
base page so user control oh here we go
so it isn't if it isn't equal to none we
actually hide the page so let's move
this check don't bother animating in
away from the load iation can put it
into the constructor of the page here so
don't bother animated InDesign time
means it won't do any kind of logic in
the constructor so now if we go back
there we go now we can see the page so
we can delete this login page we know
now works or in fact we could leave with
that and place it in grid column one to
see so you can see that we can now see
the page which we couldn't before
to try and get some nice visual so the
final step to this is to get this page
host to load the current page so let's
take a look now at the page host
and I think it's all mostly code-behind
but let's say we've got a frame here and
that's probably why the frame is
generally designed to show I confer a
page so we probably want to change this
to add another content control at work
or in fact let's add one in addition for
the moment to test this and I can't even
think how we would add is it going to be
maybe X that the login page nope add
presentation and that's it
binding I think we need to in order to
do this I'll actually it Bay's
constructors anyway so let's just change
this to content control we don't need
the no frame history anymore because
we're not going to use a frame because
we're not going to load a page let's
first see about we'll build which it
will
we also know that we've lost the
animation again there and we didn't so
it's an amides in that still works and
we've got rid of the frame but we're
still not seeing a page there we're
still not seeing a page there
so let's see the code behind the
constructor does this the current page
property change so maybe just the the
current page property isn't firing so
let's just share throw new argument null
exception test let's see if the designer
will crush so the designer is not
running that code because we were to
move this into say here and build we
should find that the UI designer
complains like that so we know for a
fact it's not running the current page
property changed in design time which is
kind of an issue
well it isn't it isn't so what we can do
is we know that a design time we just
want to get the current page so they all
page the new page what's over and should
animate out and then basically the whole
point is it does new frame content is
the content passed in
oh and then we use current page as we
actually set the page so where do we set
this and we're doing it in bind anomaly
where did we set this page I can't even
remember let's just run this and see
where it is I know it's a mining
somewhere we did this apparently we're
not getting any hits
so we start up the main window it
initializes and then the current page
property it's bound in the window
obviously as a net where we bind the
page host here so that's that's where we
get set so we've got the current page
and then we use a converter to convert
it to the application page so the
application page volume converter we
want this logic for ourselves in the
design time we want to run this exact
code to you know get a page to set at
design time so enjoy creating new
instance of this if it's in design mode
so let's go to back to the page host
another seems like a lot of work but the
benefit here then as we can get a nice
visual you know complete visual of what
the applications like is we're
developing it which is really what we
want so the same again here if designer
properties dot get is in design mode
with this page so we're in design time
or over are in design mode show the
current age as the dependency dependency
property does not fire so when design
mode then we want to get this page dot
new page content so in fact we want to
probably do this on potentially when
it's loaded but let's try here and for
now let's just do as new login page just
to check us is working and build we
don't need this
and that we go through the login page
now we'd say steadily been the login
page we want it to be the application
page value converter on this case a new
instance of one and convert and we're
going to get back at base page so cast
up the base page and it's going to
expect that we've pop into that a value
of application page so we know that is
going to be the IOC dot yeah application
view model dot current page and then it
wants a tie which we ignore anyway
parameter we ignore and culture we
ignore so one we're going to pass in
defaults here
without breaking the override looks like
we can so now that we'll take the
current page that we've specified in the
view model convert it to a base page and
set it to a new page content just for
the designer I think so how's that
worked
maybe so now we need to check by
changing the current page from login in
fact that's kind of broken just notice
that's still visible
yeah that's decided to show all of a
sudden when it wasn't before a lot to
fix that so we change this to change
this to say the shaft compiled we should
see the chat page now which we still
don't I think this I think this is
actually just stock and isn't updating
at the moment because there's no reason
why that would show the login page so
I'm just going to clean everything and
build and if that doesn't work we're
going to do a complete oh there we go
that was a slow update and then it
flickered and worked an agency it's
hidden the side menu which is what we
set and it's updated the chat page you
know to page to chat so we can change
that back to true and then rebuild and
you'll find that with WPF sometimes I
mention it a lot but sometimes the the
UI is really slow to update you have to
forcefully clean your solution and
rebuild and even that sometimes doesn't
work then you have to open your actual
solution folder I've just changed back
to the light theme for the moment that
will go back in the other video and
you'd have to go to say your source
folder and you delete the bin an object
close visual studio delete the bin an
object folders reopen visual studio
clean your solution and then rebuild
again and then this update so you do get
this in WPF sometimes they just don't
always believe it's not showing here
that the codes wrong so now we have a
complete updated UI where we can see
everything we're doing in the whole
window nice and visually and then we
started the application we should start
at that point as well now yes it matches
exactly what we should be seen so we'll
finally now get down to the point of
what we wanted to do in this video which
was this head of all and that is going
to be in the shaft page which is not
actually a page anymore but it's fine
because it's a page to us so
you have a page in our application of
URL and here is the current chat page
right now we've just got a border and we
want to add a stackpanel so the board is
there for no real reason so let's just
change that to a stackpanel
now we want to have or do we want to
stack but no one to grid sorry because
we want this to expand the remainder of
the size so it will do grid line grid
row definitions row definition the first
one height is going to be Auto which is
going to be that bowl we're going to
create the title bar and the other rail
height is going to fill the remainder
and then we're actually going to have
one below that for the this right
message thing when we get around to
doing that so that's ready for that this
control moves to the second row which is
number one name these got list and title
bar
shut then textbox something like that
we've got a chat list now we want to add
the actual header here so that's just
going to be a grid with two columns
we'll have this one spanning both so
it's central still have another grid
that grid is in row 0 by default so
that's fine then we want the text box
text equals and we'll just fill it in
with general information for now font or
foreground will change to the white font
size will change to trial extra-large
the lips more bums oom doubt at the
minute and horizontal alignment we want
central this grid as we mentioned once
two columns width of the first is just
whatever need 12 the maximum amount and
the other column is going to be just
what it needs so this is going to be do
auto that's in column one which is fine
as soon as we have another column which
we will make with a stack panel for
stuck in the the bottom is the same as a
side menu control so we pinch this
design for the moment which is here for
main buttons paste that in here
move it to a grid column one delete a
few of those a minute and see if this
builds looks like we've got some kind of
issue with I'm guessing it must be the
button style because that's all we've
done so far as the button style it looks
like the designer broke I think we have
an issue with the icon button style let
me just remove that and try again and
then we can look into that
reload yeah so there's something up with
the icon button style let's not put that
back in for the moment I've got a
feeling it's something to do with height
because that's not square now so let's
go and in fact I know what that will be
actually if we look at the style to the
buttons and the icon button we do a
width of actual high and we are in a
grid with let me get this right this
grid is inside this grid so this grid is
in row 0 and Rho zeroes height is
whatever it wants to be and then this is
within that so effectively what we have
right now is there is no set height and
we've got a style that tries to bind to
the actual height which there is none at
the moment so I think it's causing a
kind of issue with an infinite height
item so let's at least start with let's
just make this grid
a fixed height of say 54 now and we can
zoom that in so we can get more of a
perspective and let's put the style back
on and that hasn't crashed this time so
that's okay for the moment so let's get
back to where we were firstly I stopped
commenting this before it gets too messy
to this first one here is title bar
this is title text inside of that and
this is main buttons is fine not the
chat list we want Matt to be vertically
aligned as well
central there we go
let's just get a general feel for this
let's just run the application what we
could have just looked at the main
window designer actually but there's
that Alex okay we have a text sticker I
think let's also check out the close a
load of these
we should now be able to look at the
design in here so there you go that's
the benefit now we don't have to run the
application we can just change the text
here you'll have to just build but you
don't have to run
and this should update so you're getting
the benefit now of all that work we did
to be able to visually see the whole
application so back to this part
change that back to add a few more
buttons and you can see this is actually
this writing now is no longer central to
the whole page you can see is like
offset over here to want to span this
oops mean to restart when to stop let's
span this title bar across all the
columns so columns bottom two then work
we just need compiling okay why is that
not working we specified the wrong
product our bar is plus the entire thing
as one it's the title text we wanted to
spam there we go
the other thing I've noticed these
buttons are actually got a blue
background so what I was going to do is
use each chopping off part of the
background here where we would have you
know the items underneath things it
really obvious there let's change this
to transparent go to the go to open go
to the bottom style icon button
background right now is that we want to
change it to transparent
it's not an empty string or a nice
complaining
and that worked until we hovered and
we've got a kind of white yeah works
until we hovered and the first one
seemed a bit white let's change the
animation so it's animating to light
blue change that to transparent and I
think we're going to have to make a
transparent blue so there you can see is
transparent we hover I feel kind of
messed up with yeah it does not like
that door but you can see this why what
it's doing is its fading transparent is
actually you can have a transparent
color you know you have so much
transparency in a color and it's called
a RGB so transparent color is actually a
white transparent we want to make I
guess this we were failing to light blue
and we were originally blue so we want
to change we want a transparent blue
brush so let's call it transparent blue
let's go to the brushes adjusting colors
and then it's word background yeah blue
brushwood blue brush so this copy and
paste this one call it word transparent
blue
and then at the start is the
transparency let's make it think it's
zero zero for their invisible and then
let's specify well that's now already
specified transparent blue then we have
when you leave it fades to transparent
blue and it wasn't the brought it's just
a transparent blue let's try that
so it's transparent and there we go I
was actually working nice now so what
we've got now is it's transparent by
default and let's check these to work
yep
transparent by default and now it's it
works when we've got a background when
you hover it'll then get filled with
color I think we'll also let's try
making this background transparent here
so this background follows through a
mild look nice like this top menu we've
just seen this you know solid color but
then a background here we can always
change it but let's give that a quick
though that will be the side menu
control zamel this thing we want to
change to inside the style background is
blue let's just change that to what we
just delete it'll be transparent or not
the above is why so move the background
from the main board away and style the
content presenter so I'll have to wrap
the content presenter and a border to
give it a background and then we'll have
to move the grid row specifying to the
border itself so we can basically make
this white but the the side menu title
bar transparent so we should now see the
background through no yes that looks
quite cool Accor I like that you can
change that if you don't write that and
just add a background color or maybe
even a partial background color but I
quite like that so we'll leave it as
that for now and then you get the whole
background flowing right away through
we're going to make this text bold worm
let's do that
chat page text block font family
I think regulars like you know bold
enough there we go and then these menus
well we have on ours a search icon and
an ellipsis icon so if we remember what
we did with these you look at the
content we specified font doors and chat
icon strings so we need two more we want
a search icon and a ellipsis icon
ellipses and be felt that just vertical
actually helps is vertical icon then if
you go to I think it's fun to awesome
cheat sheet it's called font awesome
cheat sheet so font awesome to io4 it's
like cheat sheet you'll see all of the
icons we want to search icon which is
here so you can see there's the icon we
want we zoom in nice and big search in Z
here search icon and it's fl2 so we go
to here and change the search icon go to
and then we want my cat and vertical
ellipses which is should spot one of not
all this to a search
gasps no call it ellipses or dot Hoyle
yes or ellipses we can want let's dot so
it's 1 for 2
so change that to 1 for 2 now we want to
use these icons the first one there is
search and then the other one is
ellipses and we press f5 and let's see
what this looks like now and there we go
that looks looks pretty much exactly the
same as the original Photoshop so I'm
pretty pleased with that I'd say that's
pretty accurate
that got is the title bar some buttons
ready to do stuff with we also get a lot
of clean up there so we just go back to
the current page change that back to
login change us back to false one of the
major benefits we got was now if we
compile the actual main window zamel
will completely update and show us the
real page whereas before we couldn't see
the page so we turned everything into
just a user control instead of a page we
added that on startup we focus the tax
box we added a default button when you
press ENTER to log in we fixed an issue
with the page host not removing this
control you simply slid out and then
when we're at this page and press ENTER
it was calling the previous pages button
so that sort of fits that issue as well
then we made this transparent because
that looks cool we did this tile bar
here we fix the alignment of the text
here we fix the light blue color here so
just a lot of cleanup things things that
you know a lot of people would just
ignore and keep going but as you'll see
as we go I like to make sure everything
stays really clean so as much as you
want to rush forward and do you know
other things you really want to stay on
top of anything that starts looking not
quite right and make the time to fix it
so this is now back to you know exactly
as we want it to be the next video I was
going to do the scroll bar but this
video is taken along with unexpected so
the next video will be short I think
probably half an hour and will style
scroll bars and make them look really
nice and again blue and say didn't blend
in with the application and then this
will this will look really clean them so
hopefully this video was enjoyable again
any comments let me know and I'll see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
