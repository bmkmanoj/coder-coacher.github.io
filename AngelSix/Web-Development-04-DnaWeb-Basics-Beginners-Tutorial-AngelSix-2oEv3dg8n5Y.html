building up the foundations for web
technology so we've done the basics of
HTML and CSS then we also introduced
sass which is basically native CSS just
with additions of things like variables
include files ways to organize the CSS
and make it a lot more friendly and
drive UL so you're not just repeating
values all the time you've got variables
built in and stuff like that
the last piece before we then start
really making an actual website is to
fix the the same issue that on HTML so
CSS we've now got sass but on HTML
there's nothing out there I don't feel
that's the same as the equivalent of
sass for CSS in terms of you've got a
HTML file that you want to say the most
basic thing is include a header and a
footer you know the the navigation
headed to a website like this would be
the header on this website say that
stays the same for every page and then
you go to another page and this header
stays you know always there and that in
natural native HTML was not possible so
to give you a quick example I just
downloaded a random free template online
so I didn't have to make one because he
got an index.html file that shows say
this page with this landed home layouts
then you go to the say left sidebar and
it has the same again landed home
layouts and but that if you look at the
source code to the HTML files so we open
with code and you can see there is the
index page if we open say the left
sidebar one means these all repeated
again so there's the two files you can
see basically the whole all this hat is
repeated they simply change the class
they're on the body then all the
navigations repeated it's it's a hell of
a lot of repeat code so now say you're
working with these files and you change
your your mind or your design and you
want to re-encode say a different file
here or the head
that this option is going to change from
from one you've now got to go through
every single HTML file and your whole
static page so like all of these and
potentially way more and addict those
values multiple times and keep them in
sync so a solution to that might be to
try and find a technology similar to I
could say what's Astor's for CSS and
there are many out there but personally
I've never used many because as soon as
I look at them instead of being like
what's a sister CSS where you still
write CSS you simply add the additions
to it anything that seems to work with
HTML completely readers the language so
you're not really writing HTML and then
adding the benefits to it you're
practically writing in a different
language or different syntax and you
don't get a feel for HTML you also lose
the native ability so I'm sure there'll
be a lot of people debate that there are
technology out there that do what this
software I've now written doors but
honestly I don't think the rezident get
anything does it simple and clean and
keeps the ability a variety in HTML and
it looking like a HTML file so in short
what I've done as I've made software
completely open-source as usual so you
can go to github angel 6 and go to DNA
web if you want the source code to this
entire software and I've documented it
well and then a link to the website has
obviously this website that documents
everything so you can read all this so
what we're gonna do is simply work
through this this websites guide that
I've written visually so it's nice and
easy I mean you get a feel for how it
works and what I'm talking about so to
get started you simply click one of
these to download buttons so go for the
64 bit if you have a 64 bit machine
download and install DNA web that will
just go ahead and install a file or a
folder in here DNA web program folders
DNA web and the version and then this is
the dotnet core application installed
and here is the exe that gets run
and then it adds the install adds a path
to here so that we can invoke DNA web
from anywhere it's that's what the
install is so you click you install and
then the website will start with
explaining you know why and the issue
with static HTML which is what we just
spoke about basically that you change
your header on one page you need to
change it all the other pages and blah
blah blah and then it says like enter
DNA web so we'll just jump right into
actually using this so you can see what
I'm talking about so if we go to just
the examples folder that's on the github
source so if you originally clicked on
the view on github say here and you
looked at the examples folder we're
gonna work through these folders that's
where we're going to be so we're going
to includes an output this is the first
part of the tutorial so it gives you the
most basic example as what I described
first the first thing you want to do is
you have a website and it's got at least
a header and a footer so if we open this
index header and footer files and you'll
see I've called them dot d HTML instead
of just dot HTML and I'm just opening up
with Visual Studio code you can open
them up with any editor you like unless
you can see a standard HTML so the
header is basically the head with my
website nice and simple HTML head title
body and the footer is then the closing
tag to the body and the HTML and that's
then shareable now between any any other
pages and in this index page we've set
at two outputs so we can delete those
and all we have to do here is include
the header and include the footer and
also we do for that is we put this
comment in so this is a HTML comment so
as I mentioned the point of the DNA web
is to keep the HTML valid or as close to
valid HTML as possible so it simply
looks normal and you can still double
click on view you know the files it is
it's native to the language it doesn't
go and create a whole new language it
keeps it very similar so I decided to
use HTML tag
take some off comment tags that simply
start and end internally with the @
symbol and that then jumps into these
special values that the DNA web engine
then processes so we have an index that
basically has include a file called
header dhtml
and then we'll write header and then
we'll include the footer and now that is
the most basic example and you can see
the three files here so in order to
generate the HTML from this you can go
to a folder where your files are so
typically it'd be the root of your main
project folder that you're working in
you wouldn't be directly here it could
be say the examples folder or you know
an actual folder that you're working in
and then the address bar of the title
bar here of Explorer just type DNA web
like that and then press ENTER and
that'll actually then open up a a DNA
web window and you can see the output
it's saying that it's found the current
folder which rent it's found the
configuration here the default
configuration from the installed folder
and with these values and then the final
configurations worked out that we want
to monitor this folder that we're in we
want to generate all the files when we
start and we want to process and close
false which means stay open once it's
there and it's told us basically the
version of DNA web has told us that it
spun up three engines which we'll get
into later and then you can see here
green it's generated the file footer
index extra and header and that's
because I didn't save this here to
remove that so if I then delete the HTML
it generated for a minute and I go back
to edit this and save you'll see that
when I save this file this will generate
I'm gonna I've clicked in here that's
right if you click in the window if
you're doing this and you got something
selected this window won't update this
will kind of pause so provided that and
then edit something and save nothing
happens because he thinks you're trying
to do something so you just have to get
rid of the selection and so it's do that
once more so and here you can see it's
generated both deleted
it edit the file and save and you see
then you animates the HTML and if we
open up the HTML you can see it's got
the header file if you will then it's
got the index files content then it's
got the footer so from these three it's
you know combined them and and generated
a HTML file for us so as you saw then
the next part of this documentation so
we talk about we add a header or add a
footer and then we include the two and
it generates we then talk about if you
want to generate multiple outputs or
simply change the name so we've got an
index file but here we might want to
change it to say home and give it a new
name and we do that by doing again a DNA
tag which is just a comment with an @
and ending with the app and we say
output and then we give it a name and we
save that roughly that generates a home
HTML file and in similar fashion you
couldn't do multiple you can do two
outputs and save nobody the same file
because we haven't changed anything well
now you've got two outputs so then you
can output them to two different
locations if you wanted the you know
this file to generate to certain outputs
then when we run to partial so you'll
have noticed that if we have we stopped
the engine I'll just press ENTER twice
and we've run the engine again the DNA
web on start generates everything and
you can see it's actually generating a
header and a footer HTML
well that isn't actually what we expect
because the header and the footer really
a partial files that includes we don't
want to generate HTML from them so
there's two ways we can do that and if
we just step up and into the partials
demo folder and then we'll open these
three
you can see the index is just the same
we've got an output of index we include
the header include the footer nothing's
changed from the last example but in the
foot so we've added this special tag
that just has got the word partial and
the same for the header so now when we
start with DNA we're in this folder you
can see it's only generated the index
file so you can define a partial via
that way you could also remove the
partial from say the header and if we
run it now obviously it will generate
the header HTML but if we rename the
header to start with an underscore just
like sass then it won't generate any
output for it so now we can edit the
header and it won't generate output for
the header because it's you know it
knows it's a partial class so it won't
screw up and generate you know the
output for the header whoops what we got
here include file not found
oh the header isn't underscore at the
minute so there we go it's generated the
index but then the header of you edit it
will still generate so it's smart enough
that it finds that have you edit the
header file it finds out that index uses
it and generates that as well so I've
just added this underscore feature this
morning to match how SAS predefined them
it's an underscore it's classed as a
partial or you can simply add this
partial tag inside the file so you don't
have to name it with an underscore so
you got two options
I'll likely end up fixing so again to
match somewhat to SAS I'll remove the
requirement to have an underscore in the
name and I'll also remove the
requirement to do the extension so
probably in another few days you won't
have to do you know you don't have to
include the dot the HTML or the
underscore if the files got an
underscore and or you know if it hasn't
anyway and you've got a normal one you
won't have to have the extension but for
now obviously you do so when they update
that you'll see in the documentation on
DNA web that I oh I'll update that way
you know that valid information so just
clean these back up get them back the
way they were and that is the the
partials now it gets more fun so now we
want to do say some variables so these
are good for things like the links to
websites that again you can you don't
have to repeat or have randomly in the
middle of your HTML you can now make use
of a variable and simply inject it in it
wherever you want so the variables come
from a single class here but again you
could quite happily and you really
should have you know another class that
stores your variables are variables dot
d HTML file where this can go and then
you can make use of them throughout your
HTML any way you like
so all we've done here in this single
file as we've told it to output I am an
index file index dot HTM we've then done
these two which are profiles so we
remove these for the minutes just so you
doesn't complicate things and we've then
done a a special data tag so we've done
this time a comment but with a dollar
which instead of it being a single line
command and this dollar now means we can
break out and do some data and then
again we've kept the format the same as
HTML so we using like an XML style
structure so you do this kind of layout
you do data has the main one and then
you define a variable with a name title
and you give it a value my title if we
remove all the other bits and you can
see that's all we've got
I can even remove the output so the name
just stays default and you can get down
to you know this simple and now if we
save well if we run yeah save that file
and then run DNA web in this folder you
can see it's generated HTML and if we
take a look at that you can see it's
injected my title so if we split that
over so you can see two files and we now
change the variable name or not the name
of available value to my title
is he or something and save you can see
it generates this HTML output here so
it's alive
you know little Dayton a value that you
can now use anywhere inside your HTML so
all's we're doing in order to make use
of the variables is anywhere inside of
your HTML if you just put two dollar
signs than the name and two dollar signs
that's how you make use of a variable
and you declare one by simply anywhere
again anywhere at all in your code you
open and close this data tag and then
you you put your variables inside so
that's the variable section and again
you can read more about it on the
website here but it's pretty much that
simple there are I think we get further
down profiles yes so this DNA variables
are something new I've added recently
and in short you can simply do you could
say copy this and instead of having my
title or you could keep my title and
let's just do dollar dollar and then DNA
dot date and then that format of how we
want the date to come out and if we save
that and take a look at the output you
can see it's now outputted to date so
this would be good for things like you
know a copyright notice why we do
copyright angel six and they just want
the Year quoting so you do that and then
you get copyright angel section it's
always the right date so it's like it
you know an auto-generated value so
these are the DNA variable have added so
far if you want anything else
adding you just simply ask or add it
yourself to the source code so you can
make use of them inside of HTML so one
useful thing might be the current
project path or the current file path
for whatever reason and then we'll move
on to output profiles so in this file at
the start abided go backwards you can
see you know how to use output where you
generate an output name you simply give
a name now we've got variables I've
decided that well it's for a reason and
you'll see why when you get to asp.net
as we've now added
the ability to have profiles which is
simply a different version of an output
so we generate output for asp.net core
as well as static HTML Thor you know
building up there the UI flat in the
first place so this can also generate
HTML output that's like asp.net CS HTML
files and for that we make use of these
profiles so if you have a file name and
then you simply end it with a colon and
a name this name is then what's called
the profile name so now we will generate
a file called index - server dot HTM but
anywhere there's a variable made use of
inside of your HTML like here title for
the outputs with a profile name it would
like to look for a different variable it
will look for a variable that's in the
profile server so you can see here
there's two ways to define variables
inside of a profile one is you can
define the variable the normal way and
simply add an attribute that says
profile equals and give a name all the
other ways you can make an entire group
called profile with a name and then put
the variables inside so you've got lots
of variables and you're doing say you've
got one of 10 variables and they're not
all called tile it could be tile 1 to 10
or something and then you have form for
the server and you wanted to you know do
another 10 you'd probably use this group
like this so that you simply define the
profile name wants and then you wait you
know add them all inside there and if
you were to do it this way you'd end up
with as you can see a load of you know
valuables with this repeating itself so
it's completely up to you how you want
to to make those variables and how you
want to define the profile but you'll
see more on example of what happens here
so again this this is exactly the same
as the first example but we added these
two outputs with a colon and then server
and server 2 which is simply define two
different output profiles and what
should happen is that the server file
should pick up on the variables in the
server profile which would be this one
so we should see my server tile
the server too should pick up on the
profile name server - they should say my
other server tile so if we look at the
output here and we could just dump that
over there and see that and we save you
can see it'll generate the three files
and then if we looked at the three files
you can see there's the index dot HTM
with my title the index server has got
the server title in the index server -
it's got the other one
so by just having one single D HTML file
and and generating here and having a
single variable you can generate three
different outputs with three different
values so again you can make use of this
however you like in HTML and all this
will become very useful as we make the
websites but that is output profiles and
so that's all the output profiles being
generated in that way and again like I
say they'll be more useful if you see
see them used as we build a website that
says output profiles again the website
will give you a read up in a similar
fashion as well as output profiles you
have input profiles and again I mention
here the perfect use case for this as
asp.net CS HTML files and if you've done
asp.net development before you'll know
that CS HTML files have a layout tag
that simply states for the header
instead of having the header directly in
the file it simply has and include you
know and layout equals and you specify a
head or a different way so in order to
do that you'd need to have a different
basically you wouldn't want to include a
header in there asp.net output because
it won't have the head of it it uses a
layout option instead so you basically
want to include a file but only in a
certain profile so similar to output
where you're outputting you know
variables if you will the profile still
the same you still define it just the
same
you know you still have : after the name
and you
profile and that will still work for
valuables but the differences as well as
variables you this can work for includes
so you know only include a header in
certain cases so if we look at the input
profiles and we open all three of these
in Visual Studio code again the head
room for two were just the same as
normal and the index is just the same as
the first example the only difference
now is we have if we removed those two
to see we have an include header and
include footer but we've tagged the
include header and footer with a wrapped
profile name so now by default if we
were to spin up DNA web in this folder
and then we open up the HTML you can see
that there's no header and footer
there's just the index file because by
default the profile is you know nothing
so this should only be included if the
profiles wrapped so basically head room
for to never get included so then we
instead define two outputs specifically
and we have an index full which is
basically then tagged with the profile
wrapped so that both the head when the
photo get included and then will be a
standard output which basically is a
normal output we simply give it a name
and we don't specify a wrapped profile
and then when we save this well now get
index content and index full and they
should expect the content is just the
content so this would typically be your
asp.net page that doesn't want the
header and footer and the index fall now
includes the header and the footer and
again this is all being generated from
one file so that's the input profiles
and again like I said will make use of
all of this when we're making the
website but we just want to cover you
know all the features in one inline data
next which is where you simply want to
include small it's well the reason I
made it was sometimes you just want to
include small bits of HTML and not have
to create a separate file you know just
to do that and again this was aimed at
the
the asp.net situations where you know
you might want to include a layout so if
we go to input data and we open this up
and you'll see here you've got again a
simple part of normal HTML here you've
got two outputs that we generated local
and server and the server will only have
any specifics that are in the server
profile so there's no variables we don't
use anything there but we do this
include so include and then once you do
this this way of including everything
between you know the after the inline
part is simply included it's just output
again so it's it's basically the same as
doing this you don't really need to do
that include around you know it's the
inline around it it's just to show you
that you can't do that so this will just
always be included in all outputs then
this inline will only be included in the
server code so this is like doing an
include like we've done in the last one
you know an input profile so it's very
similar to doing you know this include
only in this wrapped profile but instead
of including a file as we mentioned here
you're simply including the actual text
right here so you want this this HTML
without this having to be a file because
it's just a small snippet of HTML so the
output server should end up with this in
all because there's no profile for that
so it goes in all of them this for the
server and then the special bank symbol
here the exclamation is for basically
only default so basically ones that
don't have a profile name so if these
have any kind of profile name don't
include them as opposed to this one
which will always be included no matter
what so again to see the results of that
we just type DNA web and it will
generate the output you can see we've
got the wrong folder one second
we've navigated in and out of that
folder let's go to the right folder 5 so
if we then go to DNA web you can see
it's generated the local and server
files and you now have the local which
is got header which was here it's got
the this is and all outputs because it
will be which is simply an inline with
no specifics this is really you never
really use this I'd say it's just there
for showing you that that exists and
then you've got this is in default
outputs only which is this one with you
know the bank and then the server one
I've got the header this is in all
outputs as we expect and then this is in
server only because we specified the
profile so that again the reason for
that is if you've got an include that
you want to include only in certain
profiles but you don't want to have to
make a file just for a really quick and
small include you know doing an inline
you don't want to always to have you
know HTML it's similar in c-sharp way
it's a sort of if profile equals equals
server
you know output voila var Alf's blah
blah and you wouldn't want to have to
then pop this little bit of code inside
a file you know you just have you would
just simply do no you know an output of
a few lines you don't expect that to be
a new file so you can think of it as
almost like an if statement that if the
profile for the output is server then
you know include this bit at this
location so that's kind of the point of
the inline data next up is well in fact
really let me just double check on the
site as we go through all inline data
yes oh really that is for the most part
all of what we need right now in DNA web
so that does everything I need to make
dynamic HTML files
nice and easily and be able to share
headers and footers and have variables
so I'm sure to make their websites with
this we can add more features as we need
but the beauty of it is now because I've
made it in it's open source and we're
going to be making real websites with it
anything that we don't like or anything
that we need
to add we can add and we've got a nice
easy way of you know of running the
system if you will of generating this
content so typically if this is your
actual website folder if you're making
it at the start of your day you'd simply
come to the folder tap DNA web press
enter and you'd leave it running while
you're working in it'll auto generate
everything so again one thing I did pass
this was then to go to c-sharp so I make
use of bridge net in some projects which
we haven't got to yet but it said a java
script while it's basically you write
c-sharp code that generates JavaScript
so you can use the full net framework
for the most part to write JavaScript
and again it allows it to make
JavaScript maintainable similar to sass
and DNA web that's the point of a tester
to be able to make these web languages
but make them a lot large when I'm a lot
more manageable than using you know
native JavaScript HTML and CSS so one of
the things I wanted to do and one of the
things you might want to do is we have
these variables such as say a classic
one would be say a website link or an
ill to the API on your website and you
would embed that ill in the header of
your you know your site so you'd have a
header here and you might have in the
body you'd have like a navigation with a
home page and index and about page and
you put that in the HTML but then you'd
also want to make use of that on your
asp.net core website in the background
so again what you tend to do is have
separate c-sharp code files that then
store the variables again so in order to
now share the variables that we define
in DNA web between not only the CSS the
JavaScript and the HTML files we can now
make use of those variables inside of
our c-sharp code in asp.net and to do
that I simply made a c-sharp engine
built into DNA web so now it can you can
define your variables just the same they
can be used in the DNA web files
again just the same and so there's
nothing special about this we simply we
made a group so that it would add a
region around it and we add comments
like this so that they get commented in
the c-sharp code but in essence this is
still just the data tag with a variable
in there and we can make use of this
some ID valuable inside of anywhere we
like and then we can now output a code
file so if we open go to c-sharp and
open this DNA CS file and we just run
DNA web here it's generated index dot CS
so what we have here is we have because
the extension is DNA CS and not dhtml
the engine knows that there's DNA web
knows it's a c-sharp file because you've
got a HTML engine which is what we've
just been using we've got the c-sharp
engine here and it's listening out for
dot DNA cs5 changes so we've made a
bunch of variables here and then you can
see below now we're writing native
c-sharp
so this is just normal c-sharp and again
to keep it just like a normal code file
we then use this comment here but this
time with a hash because c-sharp
so I kind of made a hash there and still
haven't been on that and this time it's
a special value called properties which
is basically a group of variables and we
expect it to be the group of Dom IDs so
what this all do now where it finds this
it will remove this and it will replace
it with all the variables it finds them
inside a group called Dom IDs so we have
a group here that we've named Dom IDs
and then inside of here we've now got
variables we've got comment for data one
here above the variable called
my string one will give it a type so
we've got a c-sharp type of string and
we want it to have a value of value
there's another example of a multi-line
comment and then there's a final one
below and you can see then if we just
look at the output you can see it's
generated the c-sharp file for us so if
we look at the native file here if you
will you got the namespace you've got a
comment and then you simply got inside
the class nothing you've got a special
tag so you've ended up with all the code
here and here and then the special tag
has been replaced with a region that's
been given the name tomm IDs which is
the name of the group and then for each
variable it found in that group it's
created a correct public property of the
correct type with the value and it's
also added the comment that was in and
then we've got all the you know the
comment in here so and then you can see
here if we were to do a multi-line
comment it's it's maintaining the
spacing so what we're trying to show
here is even though we've got all the
space in here it knows because the way
that the comment loops it's correctly
analyzed it and removes this a bunch of
you know free amount of space here but
while still maintaining any sort of
inner space if you will so this will
touch on later but I just wanted to
brief over the fact that you can also
generate c-sharp files and really the
only use of that right now is to share
variables so it's simply to generate the
c-sharp file that would potentially
contain a class with all of your
variables in so that you can make use of
that inside your asp.net code so again
that'll probably go a lot further and
then finally I also embedded sass so as
you saw in the last video in order to
generate sass files you have to run sass
from the command line or you have to
install a tool that are most likely paid
for tools half the time so if we had a
sass file here we've got a bunch of sass
files so if we just open them here you
can see
a test the import a the imports be the
inputs see so we generate basically a
just a normal sass file now what you'd
have to do is go to this folder type CMD
they'd have two types us whereas it's us
- that watch dot I think and there we go
and generates your cash folder and it
also generates the CSS and the CSS map
but the problem here is and this is what
you find with these web technologies is
that then you just working with your
code you start having to think well now
I've got our own DNA web and I've also
got on this sass and you know I've got
to find software that can handle sass
processing and then what about when we
use JavaScript or something else in and
you end up finding that in the morning
when you start work you need to then
open up three or four different
applications so basically just process
these files and that's kind of what I
also don't like and then some of those
programs are only work on Windows what
does learning with a Mac some of them
and most of them I paid for all those
kind of issues so in DNA web again
recently a few days ago I added support
for sass built-in so now if you've got
sass files and DNA HTML files and
c-sharp files all you have to do is run
DNA web and this thing will monitor and
generate you know everything for you and
so you don't have to merely don't have
to run your sass engine as well so if we
looked at this DNA config file you'll
see here that I've specified a path as
well called CSS so that you can change
the output of the seat you know the CSS
generated file so that's that's another
thing that has and you can see when I
added the file has generated this test
CS because we told it to generate it in
a folder called CSS and then you can
open that and it's valid CSS
so it's really that simple as you simply
run DNA web and it will you know
generate the SAS files for you as well
so now when we're working on our website
we can just run DNA web and not have to
worry about running anything else we can
then go and write our SAS we can write
our D HTML files and it'll all get
generated automatically and we don't
have to go and set up and add folders or
anything like that we just simply browse
to the folder we want like say this
examples folder if we want to generate
everything here in the morning we just
type DNA web here it will open up and
generate everything and you can see all
through you got an error because we were
messing around with renaming things it
will highlight it really obviously so
it's saying that it's failed to process
indexed dhtml yeah the HTML because it
can't find header under underscore
header and that's because we've renamed
it back so if we then rename it
backwards and we save this file you can
see it then generates so it's just a
really useful way of generating you know
of writing your HTML files but then
instead of it becoming I'll write the
HTML files for making the initial you
know dummy website if you will and then
when we move on to asp.net you end up
writing CSS HTML and you're cutting and
pasting the header from this file on the
photo from this file and then moving it
over and then you start tweaking the
live website you end up with a disc and
join between your original created
static HTML and what ends up being your
live site you've kind of it's what
always happens you lose that link
between the original files that you were
met playing with to make the site in the
first place
so this always maintains a link so these
files that you write for initially your
your static website if you will will be
the exact same files that will generate
your asp.net or other language violence
without losing that link and again you
gain all those benefits of being able to
use variables like you do in SAS being
able to do anything we really want
because I can update this coders as
needed
but this is DNA web there's the website
DNA web to i/o and the
whole riot above all options that you
can do how it works
but I thought just a video gets people
into it first gets them seen exactly
what it is how it's done and then we'll
now go ahead and actually make a website
using this so you'll get a lot more feel
for it but I'll be really interested to
see and you know and hear the feedback
you have on this because right now we
only use it internal to you know the
people that work for me so it been asked
to get some feedback from other users
that start using this and if it's
benefited you and if you've got you know
any kind of feedback so hopefully this
has explained what DNA web is and will
now start using it you know in the very
next video so you just let me know what
you feel if you get confused by it or
ever you think it's cool or you know
just anything really so I'm eager to see
any feedback on this so you know let me
know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
