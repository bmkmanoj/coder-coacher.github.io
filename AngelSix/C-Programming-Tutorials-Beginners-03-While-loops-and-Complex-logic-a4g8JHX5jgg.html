variables even Al statements and some
parsing of integers from strings this
tutorial we're going to go through while
loops adding some detail comments and
some complex logic so it seems like a
short list but this video will probably
be around an hour long so what we're
gonna do is create a program that is
going to have the user gasps a number
between 0 and 100 and in the shortest
possible amount of guesses our program
is going to determine the exact number
that that user
guessed so we need to start with console
dot write line which you should be
familiar with now we're going to just
ask the user to think of a number
between 0 and 100
and then we're gonna wait for them to
press ENTER and one thing we're gonna
start doing is adding comments to almost
every line of code so it's a good
practice to get into at the start before
you start going further into programming
and it doesn't become a habit so you
want my habit to be comment almost every
single line of code that you do even if
it's really obvious because glancing
through code with written human readable
comments there's a lot quicker than
trying to decipher code even if the
codes obvious so from years of
experience trust me you want to see a
comment in almost every line and I'll
really help you go in forward in the
future as well as when you come back to
look at your own code so we're gonna add
a comment to this which is just ask user
or rather not ask we haven't well yeah
that'll do ask user too so after the
user presses enter and before we get
going in terms of the the logic which
will be a while loop which will
effectively loop through and try to
guess the number we need to create a few
variables so we've asked the user here
to think of a number between 1 and 100
so we need to define that number in code
so define maximum number the user can
guess
and then we want to keep track of the
number of gases because part of the way
that we're gonna calculate this number
is through effectively having all
possibilities divided by two so the
maximum number of gases we should need
to guess any number of any size is eight
so if we have this number in half again
and half again in half again we'll guess
between 0 and 100 within eight gases at
the most so we just want to keep track
of that as a general interest so
contacted a number of gases and then we
need a range because we're gonna say if
we want to guess a number between 0 and
100 the first question we're going to
ask is it between 0 and half of 100 so
is it between 0 and 50 if the answer yes
we know it's between 0 and 50 so we're
going to repeat that loop and we're
gonna have 50 to 25 so we're gonna ask
is it between 0 and 25 if the answer no
to any question so say the answer no -
between 0 and 100 then we want to gas
sorry the answer no between 0 and 50 we
know it's not 0 up to 50 so it's got to
be 50 1 to 100 so we go the opposite way
so we're gonna have two variables which
is effectively the start of the range
and the end of the range that we're
trying to guess so we need two more
integers for that so we'll call them
guests - and that will start at the
lowest number of zero
and then we want the guests don't run
way around just from now we want the
guests to which will start off at half
of the max as we discussed we're gonna
initially start by guessing between zero
and fifty so that's just max divided by
two
so you should be following along so far
this is all stuff you've done before
console reading right defining some
integers and now we're gonna do what's
called a while loop because this is a
recursive behavior you there's no set
pattern of if this else that if this
else that and you know infinitely going
down and having a huge group of ifs that
say if it's between 0 and 15 hours of
it's between 51 and 100 and no EV is
between 51 and 75 and you imagine how
long that would go on you'd have a huge
list of ebbs so what we're gonna do is a
while statement so a while statement
works similar to an F it's a while and
then it's an open and close parenthesis
similar to an F so if you think of if
it's like that you've got Evan and some
logic of true or false here so a while
is the same it's wild and then it's a
true or false here and what it means is
wild statement inside here is true it
will run the code from here all the way
down to here then it will recheck this
logic so it will do another check on the
variables or whatever you've put in here
if it's still true
it will run again and again and again
and it'll go round in this constant loop
until this logic is false or inside this
loop we tell it to break which means
escape this loop and carry on to here
outside of the loop so we need to
continue in this while loop until we've
found the number and because we're gonna
start by having the number but we're
gonna go the lower side of the range
every time until the lower half between
0 and 50 of they say yes between 0 and
25 we're always gonna be the lower side
we're gonna say while the guests from
which is the lowest part the lowest
possible number while the guests from
and this means isn't equal to so double
equals means say while gas from isn't
while guests from equals fifty this
would run so it double equals is a
boolean logic so a single equals sets
the thing on the left to the value on
the right a double equals is a check so
it's actually saying is gas from equal
to fifty so the double is a logical
check so equals would mean it is equals
the exclamation equals means it's not
equals so it's anything except this
value so if we said guess from isn't
equal to fifty this loop would run if
gas from was one to a hundred 7-5 but
once it hits 50 then the logic would
return false because it is equal to 50
so we're saying when it isn't so what we
want to do is continue to loop while the
guests from the lowest value isn't equal
to the maximum now the maximum right now
is a hundred because we're unaware of
any truth so far the user hasn't
answered any question so the value could
be between zero and a hundred as soon as
the user answers the first question say
is it between zero and fifty and they
answer say yes we now know the maximum
number possible is fifty because they've
told us it's between zero and fifty so
we'll then set this maximum to keep
track of the known maximum and
effectively if you keep having that so
the user answers yes to every question
as between zero and fifty yes maximum is
now fifty is it between 0 and 25 yes
maximum is 25
you'll get to the point where the max is
between the gas from and still be zero
the max would end up being 1 and then
you know the fact that you want off
inside this loop we will then ask the
question is it the group from or is it
the max because there's only two
possible values left
so you'll see how this works out as we
go but for now think of it as while this
value which is currently zero isn't
equal to the max which is currently 100
and this will continue to loop so it'll
make more sense as we go so we want to
put a note here a comment so while the
gas isn't the same as the known maximum
value are now inside this loop we're
gonna ask a question so we're gonna
guess a number so to start with we need
to keep track of the gas ease
so we're gonna say increase gas amount
and you can do gas ease and then again
if you remember the shorthand when you
were doing things like say gas YZ equals
gas ease plus 1 now the shorthand to
that would be because the left and right
are the same you just get rid of the
right-hand side get rid of the operator
and put that before the equals so he
reads gas YZ plus equals 1 which means
add this number to that number
so add 1 to gas ease so gas YZ plus
equals 1 now you can shorten this even
further when the value is a single
increase or a single decrease you can
remove the equals 1 and simply put 2
plus YZ you typically write that by then
putting the plus next to the variable
name so gas YZ plus plus simply means
I'd want to guess it so just increase it
by 1 similarly guess YZ minus minus
decreases it by 1 so this is a shortened
version of increased gas amount and then
we'll just put in brackets in the
comment by one until you're familiar
with this statement so the program's
gonna start it's gonna ask the user to
think for a number between 0 100 we've
set up all the variables ready to go
we've got this infinite loop until gases
from sorry wild guesses from isn't equal
to the maximum
and then each time we run this loop
we're gonna increase the number of times
we've had a guess so now it's time to
actually have a guess so we want to
consult up right line and remember the
dollar sign before the double quotes
means that inside of a string that we're
typing we can use curly brackets and
then we can place variable names
directly inside the string so it reads
easier so we're gonna say is your number
between something and something now as
we mentioned these are the two variables
between from and two and right now it's
between zero and fifty so this will read
out is your number between gasps braum
and guess two and let's just go ahead
and run this to see you get a feel it'll
never end but you'll get a feel for
what's gonna be output so if you press
Start or you click start or press f5 and
you see I want you to think of a number
between zero and a hundred okay so you
press ENTER I see this infinite loop
that's scrolling really fast so let's
just pause that
and yes it's gonna ask every number
between 0 and 50 0 and 50 now that just
ran infinitely because there was no
console dot readline to wait we haven't
finish the logic but you get the idea
this is now starting to form this loop
this while loop just ran continually
over and over because this condition was
never met so it continues to run and
continues to repeat so we need a comment
on what we've done here cell ask the
user
everything number is between the gas
range and now we need to read the
response we need to know what the user
is thinking we did this in the last
tutorial so you can do string response
equals console.readline so now the
response will be whatever the users
typed and then press the enter now we
need to check to see effectively of the
users typed yes or pressed yes or
anything else we're gonna presume if
they don't type yes or why that they
mean no
so that will account for you know any of
the statement we're simply gonna presume
if the string leave type starts with the
letter Y then they want to say yes so
for this program that's fine it's it's a
simple enough presumption so we need an
if statement open and closed parenthesis
and then curly brackets now a statement
is you want to take the response which
is a string and we just want the first
character now because the user could
type Capital y you can type a capital
while you can tap a low Y they could
type yes exactly yes with a capital y
all these things are different in terms
of valuables they're all different
strings what is similar is the start
character for the word yes is either a
lower case or an upper case so we could
check we could say if response and then
you can use angle brackets to access a
specific point in that string so 0 would
be the first letter 1 would be the
second to be the third this is an array
accessor so as we mentioned before a
string is actually a class and it's an
array as in multiple items it's it's a
list of single characters so this is an
array access so by doing it square
brackets we're saying we want the first
character in you can see is returning a
carrot
to here so if we did respond to zero and
there are double equals because we want
to check we're not trying to set this
value were we're actually asking what
the value is single quotes because
that's for a single character whereas
double quotes are for a string a single
quote is for a single character so we
could say every sponsz
the first character in what the user
typed if it's a lowercase Y and then you
can do your double PI which is for all
so if the response is a lowercase Y
starts with the lowercase Y or the
response starts with an uppercase Y and
this would check of the user so we want
to say in advance if the user confirmed
their number as within the range so you
can do this this is fine this has got a
few problems though and I'll show you
what those are so firstly we're under
the presumption that this string
actually contains information so what I
mean by that is it's probably a point
here and that's run is your number
between 0 and 50 now I'm just gonna
press Enter
I'm not even gonna type anything and now
you can see this response it's just two
double quotes and the string inside and
there is nothing inside the string so a
factor of this is an empty string so
we're now gonna try and access the first
character in that string well that
doesn't exist so as we step over you can
see now we've crashed the application
index out of range exception so what
that means is your application is now
just going to crash so that's not good
that's something you want to avoid all
the time so firstly we should check
whether the response is no longer before
we even check if it's Y so you could do
that by doing this get slightly more
complicated so now we're gonna say well
let's keep it a bit simpler and let's
just do an F inside of
just so you can see it nicer so first
you could say every sponsz isn't equal
to north so this means we've actually
got a response which should always be
false in this case because
console.readline will never return until
the user presses enter so you're always
gonna get a string or it's gonna be an
empty string but it will still be a
string you won't be null and by a null
it means completely unassigned so this
is a check you tend to do before you try
to access an object it's it's good
practice again because the string could
be null in this case I know it never
will be buddy you have to be under the
presumption that you don't know whether
that string has been set or not so the
first check is if the response doesn't
equal to null and then you want to do
double hand which means and as well as
that we want to make sure the response
has some characters so on a string you
can do dot length and that gives you the
size you know the number of characters
inside of the string so you can say and
the response length and then the greater
symbol is greater than zero so what this
check does is say before we check and
try to read the first character of the
response we want to make sure we do have
a response and that we have at least one
character in because it's greater than
zero and then you wrap this inside the
curly brackets of that if so first you
check this then you're safe to presume
this now what you'll start noticing here
is it's okay if we want to check if it
is within the range of its yes but now
what we have whatever it isn't so we've
now got an else here for if it isn't a
yes but now we also have to deal with
this else which would be over here and
yet both of these Elsie's should result
in the same response if it's not we
wanted to the same piece of code so
we've instantly got two places that we
now will have repeating code so you can
get around that in one way by combining
these two if statements
and to do that you simply take the if
statement let's get rid of that tab that
back in and you can say if and then
inside of the brackets this is where it
gets a little awkward to see you have to
keep track of how many parentheses you
have so see this self-contained you
click on this it highlights in grey the
start and finish so if you go to this
part you can see there's the finish so
it's going to evaluate this statement
first so it's gonna say if response
doesn't equal to null and response
length is greater than 0 if that's false
it's not going to carry on it's gonna
jump to this house and it won't even
attempt to do this part so the way of
statements work you can presume if this
part which is checking if we can do the
second part returns false it won't go
ahead and try this so your safety to do
things like if the response isn't didn't
all and then inside the same if
statement try to do something else so
we're gonna say if the response doesn't
nolan's greater than zero and that's got
to be within this parentheses because
this is an and statement you want it to
be not not null but also have at least
one character so that's that's a check
in itself as we saw so that's one part
of the check so there's part of the F
and then you want to say if it's not
equal to null and the length is greater
than zero and now and the response is
why all those sponsors capital y so
because this is now an or you don't want
the statement to read if the response
isn't Norlin it's greater than zero and
the response is y as one statement all
and then it's just going to run this
independently if that fails it's gonna
then try and access response so because
you've gotten all you need to
put parentheses around the two logical
statements and as you can see this is
starting to look fairly complicated and
awkward to understand so when you come
back to this you're going to look at
this and it's going to take you a good
few minutes to try and figure out what's
going on so you can simplify this by
removing this logic so this is this is
effectively checking that we have a
response so what you can do is you can
cut that information so control X or
right-click and cut and you could make a
variable you could call it boolean has a
response and then you can set it to that
logic so now it's it's broken down we've
got a check that's clearly says has
response and it's saying the response
isn't null and we've got some
information so then you could put in if
has response and the response first
character is a lowercase Y or an
uppercase Y and that becomes a lot more
readable and understandable and then you
could do your logic so that's a that's a
perfectly valid way of doing this loop
we could say get the response from the
user if we have a response and the first
letter was Y or copper case Y then do
this else do that so let's leave that in
for now let's just copy and paste
let's read line
and let's just say you answered yes and
here if they didn't you answer them now
let's run that and see what we get so f5
or click the start press Enter
so is your number between 0 and 50 so
let's answer yeah and it correctly says
you answered yes and then it's just
gonna loop again did you drug their
husband no you answered no capital why
is a yes now you can do a space and a Y
and that will say no because the first
character was a space not a Y you could
also say go you could type something
completely irrelevant and it will also
say no because we are only checking if
the first thing we type is lowercase or
uppercase Y so for the most part that
will work with yes yeah yes which is the
expected response from the user so this
is all Gordon like as a usable but
there's a lot nicer way of doing this
statement see shops got a lot of
powerful features especially co-op 6 so
what we're gonna do is we're gonna tally
up this response but this is good to
know because this is how you would do it
in other languages that don't have the
ability of c-sharp so if you drop down
to lower languages or in general you
just want to know you know you need to
know this type of way of doing logic and
check in for nulls and checking lengths
and things like that before you do the
advanced way because you need to have
the foundations so this is good to know
unless you should take a screenshot of
and would be aware of of what the logics
doing so all the checks that were going
through so I'm just going to comment
these two lines out so you can see and
I'm gonna tell you what part of each of
these lines the new way replaces so
instead of doing this
has response which means we've got to
check whether this is null so instead of
having to check whether it's null before
you access and do anything such as dot
length or try to get a character you can
simply type the name and you put a
question mark and now this is a safe
thing in c-sharp that means the question
mark right after a variable name before
you access it with a dot to do anything
with it so this is like same response
dot length so we could do with response
question mark dot length say is greater
than zero so now this check by just
putting a question mark between the
response and the access of the
information inside of it completely gets
rid of this statement so there's no need
for now response isn't equal to null and
response is greater than that so this
would then become a response question
mark length is greater than zero and
that sure has a response now there's
also no need to check the length is
greater than zero because instead of
using this array accessor we're going to
use something that's called the link
Ally and queue and we won't go too much
in detail right now but we'll just show
you a really basic usage of that and
what we can do with link is query mainly
query arrays but you can do a lot more
than just a race and remember a string
is an array of characters so it's good
for doing things like for each ism
getting the first element the last
element ordering by sorting by a lot of
things that again we'll get into in
later tutorials but right now we're
interested in the first character of
this string which is an array of
characters so we're going to use link so
we keep the question mark in to make
sure it's not not but we don't need the
length check now and we can just say
response dot
first and this is link and if you're
wondering where it comes from we just
typed this first if you click on the
name first and you press f12 on your
keyboard or if you don't use keyboard
you can right click and go to definition
and this will then search and find and
open this file and you can see the
system core up here and if you scroll up
you can see it's inside the system that
link namespace so this is the link I'm
talking about so again we weren't going
to detail about that right now but just
bear in mind this is a link statement
then the reason we can use it is because
up here in the using statements Visual
Studio already added the using statement
for us so by doing response question
mark dot first this will this first
we'll do this part in terms of response
zero now the problem is we haven't done
this check yet the length is greater
than zero but I mentioned that's not
required and the reason for that is as
well as first you haven't overridden
function you well more of a different
function it's called first or default
and this has returns the first element
of a sequence or a default element if
the sequence contains no elements so
what this means in terms of our string
is it will return the first element
while our element is a character as it
says here so return the first character
of a string or a default value which in
this case would be a null character but
at least he wouldn't crash would
actually get a null response back so or
a default character if the sequence
contains no elements so effectively of
the string contains no characters so
that's great so that means we can just
call first or default and now response
question mark which replaces response
isn't equal to null and then first or
default as a combination of checking if
the length is greater than zero return
the first element so in this one nice
simple statement we've effectively got
either the first character or a null
value so now we can do us a check on
if that equals y and that would equal
the lowercase and then to check the
uppercase we could do or it equals that
say the lower case and the upper case
now we can take this one step further
because you'll soon find out the more
videos you watch I'm a real fan of
one-liners and getting everything in a
single piece of logic as clean as
possible so that we've got two two
checks right now and it's an application
a lowercase check so instead of checking
whether they typed a lowercase or an
uppercase we'll go one step further I'll
get rid of this uppercase so in order to
get the check to be on a single
lowercase what we want to do is convert
this whole string into the lowercase
first so you simply do a response
question mark dot to lower and this
returns a copy of this string converts
it to lowercase so if we do that before
we then get the first character
we now have make sure we get a response
if we have a response we cast every
character through its a lowercase
version so a capital A will be a
lowercase a a capital y a lowercase Y
and then we get the first character or
if there isn't one we just return
nothing and then we simply check now if
that's a lowercase Y which is the only
response we could have from type in any
an uppercase or lowercase because this
converts it down to lowercase so this
whole logic has gone from all this messy
you know really hard to see data into
this statement that's almost human
readable so the response to lowercase
the first letter is equal to Y so it's
much nicer to read so this accomplishes
the same thing as as all of this and if
you get used to writing things like this
these making use of the extension
methods and the link queries it becomes
a lot nicer to use a lot ease
to read so let's delete that if the user
confirmed that number was within the
current range
so now let's double check that this new
code works firstly which is always good
to prove that your code works so f5 to
run plus enter as your number between 0
and 50 why you answered yes Capital y
you answered yes good press just enter
you answered no so it's good where we've
got a good test there that were happy
that if we type Y or yes or any
combination like that that we're going
to get the correct logic so now we can
happily move on
so we've now asked the user whether
their number is between 0 and 50 so what
happens if they've answered yes so as
mentioned before if the users answered
yes we know the number is between yes
from and guess to and that now means
that our maximum number which is the
thing we're trying to get to equal the
real number the one they've guessed
originally it was a hundred while the
users just confirmed that the maximum
their number is between 0 and 50 so it's
between gas from and guest to so we now
know the maximum number as at most the
gas to value because the users confirm
that so we say so set the new maximum
number and that maximum number is the
max variable and that once now equal the
gas from so now the maximum is going to
be 50 in this instance and then once
they've answered yes we need to now ask
the next question because this is going
to go around in our loop so it would be
no good now if we just answered yes set
the new maximum to that and then in the
next cycle it comes in and it asks is it
from 0 to 50 we need to change this
guessed too because we now know that
it's between 0 and 50 and what we're
going to do is effectively
go back to the start and do what we did
at at the beginning which was to ask for
half of the maximum value so the max has
changed so we just need to redo the
maximum and now what you've got to
remember is say the answer ya know to
the first question it's not between zero
and fifty and we change it to say okay
is it between 51 and 100 and they answer
no sorry they answer yes you're gonna
then come into this loop and your guest
2 is going to be a hundred but your
guess from isn't going to be zero it's
gonna be 51 so if you want to then ask
for a number halfway between the 51 and
the hundred it's not gonna be the
maximum number divided by two because
that would be 50 you've got to get the
difference between your current range so
let me explain so the first value have
asked for us between zero and fifty and
that was because it was between zero and
a hundred and we did max divided by two
which was just 100 divided by two which
give us 50 so we've now got a max of 50
if we then go well let's make it easier
say we have a guest from of 51 and a
guest to of a hundred and that's where
we were starting so we want to ask
what's the difference between these two
numbers firstly and then we want to take
half of that
so around 75 and we want to ask is it
between 51 and 75 so that's what we're
after you want the the new value to be
halfway between the known range between
the min and the max all the time so
you're gonna have the number and ask for
the lower half all the time so what that
results in is your guest from
and you want to take away because right
now they've confirmed that it's between
the gas to and from so now the guests
from has become the new maximum and you
want to now guess halfway between the
max and the min so you're gonna - so
it's just right it long confer so it's
easy to understand the guests from
equals the guests from - so Ryan now
this would be say 50 and you want to get
the difference between the from and the
two so guess from - gasp - so if guests
to a zero then it's 50 - zero it's still
50 and you divide that by two and that
would be so this statement here would be
25 which is correct
now say we were at 51 to 100 you'd do
100 minus 51 would be 49 divided by 2
you'd be about halfway between the
guests - and the guests from so so this
parts key you're effectively getting the
difference as opposed presuming that
your start point is always zero so you
guess - and you get from so you guessing
from and fact us the wrong way around
sorry that's guests too - guests from so
you guess - Jahi number you're going
from your higher from your lower to your
higher so the the higher number - the
lower number gives us the difference and
then we get half of that and then that's
what we take away from the maximum so if
that's 0 that's 50 you / - its 25 you
take it away from the 50 you down to 25
so you've what you've done is you've
guessed from
zero to fifty first that's failed you
got zero to 25 that fails your comment
again and then you'll have zero here
still 25 here 25 divided by 2 is going
to round I believe it or round up
because it's point 5 so you'll end up
with 0 to 13 and then you doubt 13
divided by 2 which is go to 7 and so on
so this loop alone should do this
response which we can test so we run
this code right now here's your number
between 0 and 50 now remember we've only
got the logic for the yes right now and
we're just testing that we're going to
correctly harv the value every time
because that's the point of this program
is to have the maximum possible range
and ask for the lower half each time so
is your number tween 0 and 51 answer yes
and you see something's gone wrong here
so it's saying is your number between
minus 25 and 50 so I can spot what I've
done already the - the guests from and
it's the guest - because it's the high
number we're trying to change we've also
done that there so this is right it's
good to check every step of the way and
to talk through so the maximum is now
the guest to the higher and it might be
a good thing to be named the guest - to
guess max and the guess from to get min
because I believe that will be easier to
spot things like this the mistake to and
from is easy to overlook
so to rename we have this variable here
guest - now instead of having to go
let's say you're gonna change that name
instead of having to say oh let's get
rid of that type guest max and then oh
that's gone wrong we're gonna have to
find that instance type guess max now
you imagine if this variable was in a
thousand places you'd be going forever
so in order to rename this variable and
effectively we name every instance of
that variable you can simply click
somewhere inside of the variable hold
ctrl and press R twice
and you see this brings up this dialogue
over here rename guest to and everything
goes green and it highlights green and
this parts selected so you now simply
start typing on the keyboard your new
name so I'm gonna type guess madness and
then I'm gonna press ENTER before I do
that you can see over here rename will
update six references in one file so the
program is the one file and you can see
the six instances in green so that's
renamed for us we're gonna do the same
for guests from control our guess min
and there's all our code renamed
and now if we reread what we've written
is your number between Gasman and guess
max that's that's easier to read here
also we would have spotted this mistake
really easily max equals guess max now
if we rename this to min this would have
quite simply said guess min and it would
have been really obvious we've done
something wrong so the maximum number is
equal to now the known maximum and now
the new maximum is the current maximum
minus the difference half of the
difference between the current range so
let's run that code again is it between
0 and 50 yes and there we go
so now is it between 0 and 25 which is
good because that's what we want
yes zero and 13 yes zero seven yes so
let's see what happens that will keep
going because E is half in every time
there between zero and two yes
now is it between zero and one now when
you get to this point there's no point
asking is it between zero and one
because you know it will be because of
it's between zero and two the only
possible numbers are 0 1 &amp;amp; 2 so this
should really change at this point to
say simply is your number 0 let's take a
guess because then of the answer yes you
know the number 0 what the answer no you
know the numbers 1 so let's go ahead and
add that part in code so when our
satisfied this part's good and this
basically says
change the next guess range to be half
of the new maximum range which is what
we're doing so that's all we should have
to do for the yes we'll come to the know
afterwards let's just get this loop
sorted so here's the while loop so for
every every loop of this which is there
to there you're going to increment the
number of guesses
you're gonna ask of it's a certain
number and get the response if it's yes
you're gonna do this if it's false we're
gonna do something else and then here
would be either way whether the one said
yes or no because they could go high all
over but in each instance regardless of
whether the answered yes or no we now
want to check if there's only two
numbers left so that we can just ask the
question so we want to say if we only
have two numbers left guess one of them
so it's an F statement so let's make the
little statement ready so now this needs
to say if there's two numbers left well
how do we know there's two numbers left
well we know we're guessing from the
guess min every time so we know that
this is a guess minimum and we're
guessing from gasps min - guess max so
we saw in our application it said is it
between zero and one so that's a clear
indication that effectively if gasps min
is one number less than gasps max that
we know there's effectively only one
number difference between them that
there's only two numbers left so you can
do that in many ways but the simplest
way to do is to say if gasps min plus 1
so add the difference then equals for
the double equals
gasps max so now what we're saying is if
gasps min which is zero plus one so if
one is equal to gasps max which is 1
then with we know there's only two
numbers left so this is a match check
that basically says if guess min is one
number less than yes max you can also do
if gasps min equals gasps max minus one
it's whichever you prefer it's what
whatever reads nicer for you I'd tend to
do this way so if the student was left
we're now gonna do another gasp because
we know now this is gonna be the end we
know we've we've got the number whatever
we do here so we need to first increment
this gasp because we're not going to end
up going back to this while and taking
another guess here we're gonna do it
directly here and then we're just gonna
break out of this while because we'll
know the answer so first thing is
increase the gas amount again and then
we want to ask the user as ask them if
it's the minimum so let's take a bit of
code and we're gonna say ask the user if
their number that's the lower number so
here's your number gasp min and you can
see here what you've got it's saying a
local or parameter named response cannot
be declared in the scope because the
name is used in the enclosing local
scope well this means is you've got this
name this variable defined twice and
that's because up here inside of the
scope which is while so inside of this
while scope we have a string response so
we've already declared the variable so
it exists so you can tree declare this
variable as a string because it already
exists it's like here we've we've done
into Max and then we've simply used the
word Max and set it we don't need to
read Eclair it so you simply remove the
string because it already exists
so now you've got is your number that
min and you get the response and now you
want to do the same check again so you
want to check of the response is yes so
let's take that bit of code if the user
confirm then number is and then a new
comment will be the although a number so
if the response to lower first or
default is yes and in this case what's
gonna happen is the guess min is the
right answer
so in fact we've done one of the mistake
here sorry if there is only to move his
left guess one no guess max is half of
the available numbers so guess max is
actually going to be the wrong thing to
check here you want to check the actual
max because the max is the maximum
number that it could be it's not the
guessed maximum we want to know they're
the actual maximum that the highest
possible number it could be compared to
the current guess so there's a little
correction there so now what we're
saying is it guess min plus 1 is equal
to the max and then they tell us that
the guess minimum is the answer we can
simply end here because what we're gonna
do once we're outside of this while
because usually this this loop will
continue until guess min is equal to the
max when we get out of this while loop
just down here we're gonna simply state
the fact that their number is guess min
because that's that's where we're trying
to store the value and here they've
confirmed that their number is guess min
so there's effectively nothing left to
do they've confirmed that's the number
we want to escape this loop and just
output the fact that the number is gasps
min so in order to escape
while loop so you could do one of two
ways you could actually set the variable
max to equal gasps min so that this
statement becomes false because then it
is equal or you can simply type the word
break and a semicolon and if you double
click break you'll see it likes we
highlight the while as well to indicate
that you're breaking out of the while so
we do break we're going to come out of
this infinite loop so what we say is if
the the current guess plus one is
actually only one below the maximum
possible number so effect where there's
only two numbers left to guess and they
confirm that the number is the minimum
number then we break so that's you know
bracket there we go
so let's come outside of the while so
you can see here you scroll up this is
the curly bracket for coming outside of
this while so after the while loop is
finished so effectively just before we
close the program this is now escaped
our while loop we want to output the
fact that we now know the number and in
that case we can say your number is and
then guess min because that's what we've
ascertained that is the point of our
while loop that we will never get past
this until we are assured that the
guessed minimum is there guess max is
the maximum number or we broke because
we knew the gasps min was the right
number so we're going to come out and
we're gonna say your number is guess min
so tell the user
their number and then just as a little
piece of information we can say let the
user know how many guesses that took and
remember we're keeping track of the
number of gases we had here gases plus
here and gases plus here every time we
took a guess every time we ask this
question we increase this guess so we
can say console.writeline the guest in
the number of gases and let's just put a
couple of stars in front of your number
and behind just as a a nice way to
indicate it so this will an out both
your number is gas men and we guessed it
in this many gases and then so it
doesn't just close remember to put the
console.readline
so let's go ahead and run it again and
let's check out the progress and you can
see already if we weren't doing all
these comments on every line look at how
complicated this is already starting to
Luke as you scroll through there's it's
got a lot of logic it's it even though
it's a simple program this is quite
complex logic in terms of if you wrote
this today and then you come back to it
tomorrow or in a week I can guarantee
you you won't remember the thought
process that went into creating this
code because as you can see how I've
made it is on the fly right now for this
video I'm thinking through as I'm going
and you've seen me make mistakes and
you've seen me correct things and the
thought process is happening as you're
writing the code and then you
continually testing the code to prove
what you're thinking and what the theory
is so this is only simple or this is
only constructed because you're making
it step by step in small chunks and
you're on
standing as you're going you go away
have a drink have a meal come back a day
later this is then going to be just
foreign to you again
so these comments really come in handy
to help you read and understand what you
were thinking at the time of writing
this code so you be as detailed as
possible in these comments because it is
only ever a good thing so let's get back
to this and let's prove we're now trying
to prove we know this this half in part
here that half the gas we know that the
yes response always halves the gas we're
happy with that we proved it last time
now we're trying to prove that after
each gas so while in the wallet after
which yes or no response we're gonna
check if the value is effectively only
two numbers so in our case it's when we
get to 0 &amp;amp; 1
where previously it asked is this number
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 this time it should say
instead of doing that it should actually
say is your number 0 and if it is we
should break which means we should then
hit here your number is and then min gas
so let's test just that part so Israel
number between 0 and 50 and we simply
answer yes yes yes yes and now here is
the last time it said is your number
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 on the next check so now
our code should hit here and say if your
number 0 so see we've still got an issue
here
so Israel number between 0 &amp;amp; 1
oh no sorry that's correct because right
now we don't know we didn't confirm
whether the number bush between 0 1 &amp;amp; 2
because the last known thing was between
0 &amp;amp; 4 so right now at this question
before it could have been 0 1 2 or 3 so
now at this point we're asking if it's
between 0 &amp;amp; 1 and right now before we
confirm that it could be 0 1 2 yeah 0 1
or 2 so there's still 3 possible numbers
but now we've eliminated that this is
going to confirm
if there's two numbers so we answer yes
to this we now know as your number zero
so we know for a fact because with the
previous question we asked was is it
between zero and one meaning it's not
two so now we're down to two here and
then this is correctly identified were
down to two and it's now asking is your
number zero and because we haven't
written the else part to this statement
yet what happens if it isn't zero we
know it's the other number we haven't
done that code yet so we simply answer
yes to this and we should then hit this
break come out of this loop and then
output that our number is zero and that
we got it right and there we go so your
number is zero and it was guessed in
eight gases so I'm falling off that is
the maximum number of guesses so you'll
find that if you're trying to guess a
number between 0 and 100 the longest
possible responses will be the two
extremes like 0 1 100 because you'll
continually half and half and half and
half and get down to either up or down
to the extremes or if you actually go to
an upper limit of a mid half such as 76
or 77 so there's plenty of math behind
why that is but just out of interest you
should never hit more than 8 gases so
we're happy that when we hit the fact
that we know there's only two numbers
left we explicitly asked whether it's
one number so let's just finish this
logic off so if the user confirmed the
number is the lower number which is
guess min then we simply broke well if
they answered no and we know that the
maximum is only 1 more than the minimum
we effectively know that the answer is
the maximum number so what we can do
here because we're outputting Gassman is
the answer we set gasps min to equal the
max because we know so
that means the number must be the higher
of the two and then we could break here
as well if you didn't break here it
wouldn't make a difference because what
you've done here is set the gas men to
equal the max and then there he'll then
come out of here come out of here hit
here it'll go back up to the while loop
and then it's gonna do a check is why
all the Gasman isn't equal to max well
we just set the guess min to the max
that means it's gonna come out of this
while loop anyway
so we could just leave this statement
like that but say you were to do
something else after this if statement
say you were to then do some logic here
so just guess min equals max times two
I mean this is not what you would do but
you could have logic here which would
then mean your presumption that just
because gas min is max right now you
haven't actually got to the next check
of the while loop the still code that
could be written here so it's a good
idea to break out of this loop because
you know you've got the answer so even
though the while loop would evaluate to
false here and then break there's no
presumption that we might in future
decide to add some code here which then
effectively breaks this so we're gonna
escape here because we know the answer
at this point so now we should have the
no version so let's go and check that
press f5 press ENTER once a yes we're
now going to the zero one we on see yes
it's zero war one is your number zero
we're gonna say no this time which means
the answer should be one and now we've
correctly figured out the numbers one so
so far our code now is quite happy while
the users answering yes we're having the
numbers all the time when we get to the
final two
we also then correctly answer yes or no
so walls it's left to complete this
program is to figure out when the user
answers no so let's do that
so here's where the answer yes to the
main question of the range and here's
where the answer now so let's put a
comment on here and we will do the
number is rate upon guess max and less
than or equal to max so now we need to
readjust our range for the next time we
come into this guest statement so we
need to readjust gasps min and Max so we
want our guess min sorry our guess yeah
I want how I guess min to now be one
above the last guess max because they
confirm that their maximum gas which
let's say from the start was zero and
fifty they're saying that their number
is not between zero and fifty which
means now the new minimum must be fifty
one so the gas minimum equals the gas
maximum was one
and now we need to deal with the new
maximum so we want to get again the
difference between the two numbers so
let's just keep this in a variable to
make it read easier so now we want to
guess the bottom half of the new range
which is what we do on both cases and we
want the quality remaining difference
it's going to be again this is this is
all we did here it's just slightly
different because though we're now
dealing with the maximum as opposed the
gas max because when I they've said no
to the gas max and now we've got a
resort to the the known maximum which is
the max value so that is the the true
maximum value minus the the guessed
maximum value so in the first gas we
said zero to 50 in the gas max and the
known possible maximum was 100 so it's a
hundred - gasps max so the difference
would be 50 in this case and we're
starting at 51 and now we want to know
half of that difference because we're
always getting halfway down so we want
to do the guess max is the remaining
difference divided by two
now we've got to think about something
here because we're stepping upwards and
because we've done this plus one we're
gonna end up with an issue here and you
may not realize it right now
but let's see if we can get this to
happen so let's at first see how this
goes we need to comment on here which is
really set the guess max to halfway
between the and the variable name right
so let's run this code and let's see
what happens when we start answering now
so as it between 0 and 50 we're gonna
let them know it's gonna come into here
the gas max was 50 it's as you know add
1 to it which means the gas means 51 so
the next question II should say over
your number between 51 and then we're
gonna take the max of 100 minus 50 which
is 50 we're gonna now set the gas max to
the remaining difference which is 50
divided by 2 is 25 so that's wrong
already
let's just stop that we need to add this
difference to the max because the max is
50 the remaining difference divided by 2
is 25 we want to add that because the
gas min is now starting at 51 so we just
want to put a plus here we're gonna do
the gas Max is Plus this much difference
so it's uncertain no to that so we
should get between 51 and that'll be 50
plus 25 so should be between 51 and 75
which is correct so instead of asking
between 0 and 25 which is halfway
between the lower half
we know 0 and 50 is not right we want to
ask between 0 and 100 and 1 the lower
half of those two which is between 51
and 75 which we've successfully got ok
that's good so the whole answer no again
it should come back into the same loop
the guess max right now is 75 so plus 1
is 76 so we don't want above because we
know it's not there
the remaining difference the maps are
still a hundred minus the gasp max which
was 75 is 25 divided by 2 is 13 because
it's gonna round up so you're gonna get
13 plus 75 so let's add some now and now
we do we get 1275 plus 12 so it's
actually rounded down so let's just keep
on reading now and let's see if I can
get the issue that I'm expecting to see
sure and we're nicely hitting that issue
so the issue I'm trying to find is if
this number if the difference is three
then you do three divided by two because
these are whole numbers as integers
what's gonna happen is three divided by
two is I believe gonna give you one so
let's just do a quick test let's just
simply do console dot write line and
then let's do three divided by two
let's just see what that gives so you
see one so the issue you've got there
here so you've got a minimum number I'm
trying to think how we can get this I
know it will happen you've got a maximum
in fact let's try and get to let's just
try a few numbers and so you wouldn't
get to happen and now yes no no ah there
we go perfect
so you see here we've got an issue is
your number between 73 and 73 so
something's gone wrong here so we've
answered ezreal number between 70 and 72
we've answered no no better man you've
answered yes here so with the numbers
between 51 and 75 then we just answered
no no no so the maximum is 75 the number
could be 75 as we've come down the
minimums increased so at this point
we've confirmed our number is not less
than 72 so our numbers either 73 74 or
75 but then we've gone ahead and asked
is the number 73 or 73 but the number
could be 73 for
five and what happened was in fact we
can stop and step through this so we
know if we answer no yes
and then consecutive knows and then
we'll put a breakpoint in and let's see
what happens no yes no no right and this
is where the issue happened so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna click in
this gray area to put a breakpoint so we
can actually step through the code and
see what happens and see what's gone
wrong
so let's present no and this should then
ask is is it between 73 and 74 because
it's either 73 4 or 5 so let's see
what's going on
you got guess max which is currently 72
which every step backwards you can see
there's the current guess max so we were
going to add 1 to that to set the min
which is correct which should be 73 so
press f10 to jump to the next line gasp
min is 73 good so all's going what all's
correct so far the remaining difference
is the max which we know is 75 which you
could be - the gas gives us 3 which is
correct so we know the difference is 3
so all's good so far we've got the men
73 we've got the max difference of 3 so
it's 70 3 4 or 5
now the gas max is 72 we want to add to
here because the difference is 3 divided
by 2 we know from before this is gonna
give us 1 which means the gas max is
effectively gonna be the same as the gas
min which is wrong so the only
circumstance this would happen in is if
the remaining differences exactly 3
because we're always dividing by 2 so
every time we do this loop we are always
dividing by 2 so regardless of the
number if it was 5 and you're gonna
divide by 2 let's do that so let's just
do console.writeline
five do I buy to AC you've got to so
it's not a problem here
because you've not hit a single you know
down to a one you've still got a
difference and effectively if the
answered no to that difference you're
gonna add one to that you're always
gonna cover your bases you're always
gonna gas above or below so it doesn't
become an issue until you get down to a
number with three and then you're gonna
get the issue that you've effectively
lost a number in this calculation you've
done whole numbers divided by two which
is trying to give you a fractal number
it's trying to give you one point five
and in this case we want to always
what's called ceiling that number we
don't want to floor the number but we
don't want it to be the lower of the
possibilities so if you've got one point
five you've got two possibilities it can
be one or it can be two now by default a
whole number is going to round down so
it's gonna go down to one instead of up
to two so what we want to do is force
this to the maximum of if the numbers
one point one we want it to be to
basically anything above point zero we
want to go upwards so it's even a
fraction over of a certain number we
want it to jump to the the higher of the
two and that will fix this issue so to
do that we can use the math library and
that is capital M it's math and dot
ceiling and also it returns the smallest
integral value that is greater than or
equal to the specified decimal number so
it's basically what I was explaining and
what that means is the smallest whole
number that's greater than or equal to
the specified decimal number so as I was
saying if you did point 0 0 0 0 1 this
would return to if we do 0 is going to
return 1 then basically anything above
that whole number is going to jump to
the next whole number so point wanna
jump to 1.5 or jump to 1.7 I jump to
want 1.01 I jumped to
on the opposite side of that you've got
math.floor and this returns the largest
integral integer sorry less than or
equal to the specified decimal number so
it's the effectively the lower number so
we did math dot floor one point nine
nine we get one so as we said we want to
return the ceiling the maximum number
out of the two so one point five will
get rounded up to two so it's expecting
the number that you want to round off so
we just pass in the calculation and
there's one more step here which of
you're dividing an integer which this is
by two which is another integer you
dividing a whole number by whole number
so this is already gonna pre calculate
down to one and then end up passing
exactly one into this function so it
still wouldn't work the trick to get
this to actually calculate as a floating
point number is that as long as one of
these two numbers as a floating point
number the calculation would work so
simply put a lowercase F after the two
and this will turn the app the two into
a floating point number
and now this is now going to return
number two but the issue here is now
cannot implicitly convert type double to
int so this guess max we defined as an
integer this math thought ceiling is
actually trying to return a double so
it's trying to return a floating point
number so what we need to do is change
that double that this is now returning
so this double is trying to set this
guess maps to a double and you can't do
that because this is a whole number so
you need to cast this value and all it
means is convert this value of a
floating point number back into a whole
number which were fine because this is
going to return a whole number anyway
this is going to return to so it's gonna
be to a 2.0 which is a floating point
but two is fine when we cast to an
integer it's gonna effectively cast the
number two so to do a cast you just put
parentheses before the thing that you
want to cast in this case the return
value from this function and put the
type that you want to cast to so you
type int so there this beam before this
has effectively changed the return type
of this function from double casting to
an integer so all this function is done
which we should make a comment about and
you can put capital Naoko on math dot
ceiling well round off the main
difference to 2fv is three and this is a
fixed for effectively those numbers
where the difference is exactly three so
that should be it i believe this whole
program should now work so let's first
do this check again which if I remember
rightly was now yes and then just know
yeah there we go so if we answer no to
this our number should be between
seventy three four or five and before it
was asking as it between 73 and seventy
three now you should ask if it's between
73 and the rounded up version which
should be 74 so let's see if that works
and there we go so now we have a show
number between 73 and four because right
now it could be seventy three four or
five so if we answer no to this we know
the only possible number is 75 so if we
try and follow what our code will do we
answer no here we'll get into this part
so in fact let's debug and step through
so that's plucker debug there and that's
answer note to this because we will we
now expect our program to realize that
the number can only be 75 so we come
into here the current gas max was 74
which it was the new gas min is going to
be one upon that so the gas min now
next minimum is 75 because we've said it
can't be below that so it's got to be 75
minimum we got the remaining difference
which is 75 minus 74 at one and the
guess max 74 plus and then effectively
1/2 and then it's gonna round it up so
it's gonna be hot founded up to 1 so the
guessed max is going to become 75 so the
min and the max are the same now so
there's an indication that we're on the
right truck but do we detect that so now
we say if the guess min 75 plus 1 equals
75 so now we don't detect that so this
check here was if we only have two
numbers left so actually that was fine
but now we'll get into the while loop
we're saying gasp min while the min
isn't equal to the max while it is right
now we've we've ascertained that the
minimum is now the exact maximum so this
while loop is now gonna break there you
go it's no longer true so this whole
loop is now effectively ended which is
exactly what we expected because we've
we've guessed the number right so now
we've come out and we're gonna output
the fact that we've we know the number
75 and the guess ease is 6 and there we
have it so on a quick check this looks
like it's all working and I know this is
a lot of logic to understand and I don't
expect you to understand so much about
the actual logic behind this equation
this is was simply a perfect test to go
through a lot of ifs al C's calculations
putting brackets and I'll touch a little
bit on these brackets that I've been
putting in and not explaining too much
so if we do use our console dot write
line to just see there the output
you can do math equations so you can do
as we've been doing things like Max / -
gasps Max's guess much - guess much -
min / - there's a lot going on here and
you in maths you need a an order of how
you do things what you do first so for
example if I did two plus two times
three that's du times 4 so there's
multiple ways you could interpret this
you could say well 2 plus 2 is 4 times 4
16 okay you could also do 2 plus 2 times
4 well 2 times 4 is 8 plus 2 is 10 so
we've got two possible outcomes here
we've got 10 or 16 so let's run and see
what happens so it's 10 so what that
means is and what you'll find out is
there's an order of priority to these
operands so the plus and the minus are
the low priority the times and the
divide are the high priority so by
default when c-sharp tries to calculate
this expression what it will do first is
calculate the time Z's and the divisions
so it will do two times four first is
eight and then that will convert it down
to two plus eight and then I'll do two
plus eight which is ten so say we
actually meant to do two plus two is
four then times four 16 the way you do
that is you put parentheses around the
section you want to calculate first
so now c-sharp will as it's going
through this equation and working it out
if it hits parentheses it will first
step inside of them similar to if you
think of it like a functions curly
brackets it's gonna go inside and do
something then come out so it's going to
go inside this function it's going to do
two plus two which equals four is going
to come out of that and replace it with
the result which is then going to be
four times four so if we run this now
with parentheses between the two and the
two we're now gonna get 16
so what we're doing when we put brackets
here it's because if we didn't have the
brackets here Gassman and guess max now
you can see what's gonna happen this
division is gonna take power and it's
gonna do
yes min / - it's gonna replace that with
the value and then it's gonna do gasps
max - gasps max - half of gasps min
which is not what we expected we were
trying to say half of the guess max -
the gasps min so we put in parenthesis
the thing to equate first so it will
first find the difference here then it
will divide by two so then our equations
order is correct now you can see down
here this part is actually the exact
same logic as this part just using
different variables and you see I've
done the calculation here max - gasps
max it replaces this part here but
because I have done it first as a
variable then I've put this variable
into a calculation directly / - like
here there's no need for the parenthesis
because I've already done the equation
first and then adding it later so when
you see when you're doing any kind of
calculation and you want to keep them in
a single line such as this you need to
be aware of what your thinking is going
to happen in terms of what gets minus 2
and plus 2 first and what gets times is
if there's a minus or a plus it will
always get done after the division or
the times so you look for the times and
the divisions and you take the first
thing to the left the first thing to the
right and that will be calculated first
and reduced so there's your your
parenthesis use
so back to this program as we say this
is this is a lot in one program this is
a fairly long tutorial and we've gone
straight into some complicated things
and hopefully to get you up to speed
quick and for you to see something
actually work in a real program that
does some you know actual calculation
instead of just outputting Hallett world
so you can go over this tutorial you can
just pause the video and go through this
code as I've scrolled through and you
can you know read it you can mess with
it you can try and break it and
hopefully understand it so let's just
run it once more and do a few quick
checks so we press enter
I'm gonna think of saying the number 77
so a jinan between 0 and 50 no 75 and
now now yes my number 77 so it's in
between those two so yes yes yes
getting closer yes yes is your number 70
second now your MSM feminine there we go
it's guessed it in the maximum possible
guesses which is 8 but that's still
guessed a number between 0 and 100
within any guesses so that's quite cool
let's do that once more I'll go with ICC
well so Asian um between 0 and 50 yes
yes yes yes yes yes and then yes so 8
guesses again let's pick the number 24
yes yes
no no now yes no 24 good so this is
looking like it's working well so I'm
not sure whether this has got any bugs
or issues like I say I've just made this
on the spot for this tutorial feel free
to see if you can find any issues with
it or improvement suggestions leave them
in the comments I'll be happy to improve
this and I think I think the next
tutorial
we will reuse this exact program and
what we're going to do is we're going to
improve on it even further so right now
you can see this is not that large it's
only something ninety three lines of
code but already when you open it open
you generally glance through it's just
all code it's just all writing and even
though we've got comments it's it's one
big lump it's a single function it's
just got everything in so we're going to
take the program further and we're going
to go into creating functions and doing
some regions to tiny code up and we're
just going to really get this to a level
I'd be happy where there's a
professional software developer we're
gonna go that next step and tidy this
program up so that's what we'll do next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
