basic environment ready for web
development in terms of the tools you
need the setup you need to you know get
going with developing a web application
so in the last video I showed you DNA
web since then I've made quite a few
improvements to DNA web so there's been
five more releases with lots of features
added so you can either watch the
previous video or you can simply watch
this one for you know the setup it
doesn't really matter but the simple
thing is you go to a DNA web I oh
download the Installer so 64 bit have
you got 64 bit go for that one once
you've installed this download is just a
MSI installer so just install on your
machine and then you can now create your
project if you haven't already so in
this one we're gonna start doing
responsive in the next video responsive
web design so we'll create a folder
called responsive and then here and now
it's typically where you start setting
up your you know your web application
you start making HTML files you CSS
files for sass files everything we did
in the last video kind of getting going
well now you don't have to because I've
built it into DNA web so instead of
doing that to get started on a fresh
project you simply click in the address
bar inside your project folder which is
currently empty tab DNA web and press
enter and that will spin up the DNA web
so this is now the your system you
should be the only system you now need
to work with web development and to get
going straight away just type in new
templates blank so you can see only a
new space template space blank press
enter it'll ask you where to extract it
or leave it as the current folder and
you see then it created these files it's
created the blank template so there's
one or bug in this that I'll fix today
where it should automatically spin up a
live server so for now once you've
generated your template simply quit
press Q and enter
you know quite a DNA web and just
started back up again just type in DNA
web and I'll fix there so by the time
you're probably watching this video
it'll get fixed and what you can see
this is done when it started up DNA web
at spawn opal that's called a live
server so we've now got the blank
template and we effectively got a
website ready with header so I'll show
you what's gone into this it's basically
similar to the last video when we made
the new template this creates a source
folder which is got the DNA config
violin which sets off the output path to
all the generated stuff to a web root
and then this thing live servers as
what's then spun up this automatic page
here of your website and that's why it's
spun off from we start the DNA work
because of this line and then as well as
your config we have the HTML where then
automatically made as a header a Fortran
index like we did in the last video so
they've got the header header and footer
and then the index are we just the
header and what this live server is now
done is first off if we go to the
responsive folder so go to the actual
folder we made right click and open with
the code if you've got Visual Studio
code installed which is what I'd
recommend to do and when you install
Visual Studio code make sure you tick
all the boxes that say you know add open
with options to right-click menu and now
you'll get this little option here so
you can see all your files as you're
working in Visual Studio code and I'll
typically then drag this to one side and
then click your website for the other or
you can just have two monitors and you
can see it's made the HTML folder for us
and sauce where the basic set up it's
also made a SAS file that allows put to
the web brute a set CSS folder and just
a basic SAS file so now if we add it to
file you'll see we add it in here and
click Save you see it automatically
updates on this side so you got live
feed buttons you're working so we go to
the sass file boom background black
color wise and save it just instantly
updates
so you've got your environment set up
and ready and you can also see in the
web root folder the generated CSS and
the generated HTML you could also edit
these directly it doesn't really matter
you shouldn't blue but it'll still work
the same so stick with your source
folder for editing your DNA web files
and then this is basically the setup
you'll need now so I spent a lot of work
a lot of time this week improving this
DNA web to do all these things so
everything you see here the way it's
just created the template automatically
and the way it's now spinning up the
server for us and and doing all that has
all been part of what I've added this
last week and there's a lot one into
this but for now this is just the
showing you how to get ready for an
environment for developing the web and
this is awfully brand-new I've just made
this so you won't find any info on it
other than you know what I write at the
minute so this this kind of setup of one
compiling sass files automatically you
typically need software like I think
ones called code kit on the Mac maybe
and you got like pre pros PR e POS and
they are basically SAS compilers with
typically something similar to this
built in like it spinning up a website
from your HTML files and then
automatically refreshing but I'm pretty
sure those are paid applications so this
is all free and open source so you can
now use the DNA web there's a lot more
powerful things in the DNA web as well
so I've added things where this
templates come from is a live data
source so if we went to the github repo
and we went to DNA web and then go to
source DNA web core
just live data and then source you'll
see I've got a whole write-up on the
source of how you make your own and how
you make use of this
so the templates the only thing you've
seen which simply created this blank
template but it's a lot more powerful
than that you can you can have it create
anything you like and so we're gonna get
it creating a a whole responsive web
design template for us in the next few
videos but this shows you all the info
you need again I'll do this in a video
though of how we make use of all these
extra features but the point of what I'm
trying to do with this DNA web the
single tool is to combine everything
that you typically need in a web
development environment which is usually
a SAS compiler a live server some stuff
to handle HTML which we've now done
anyway with this DNA web the end up
usually with three or four different
tools or command you're constantly have
to run and it's really annoying
so my plan is whenever you start in a
web design and whenever you're working
in the web all she should have to do is
spin up DNA weapon ill you know handle
everything for you so that's the plan
going forward so you can see here is
rather the list of commands of things we
can do so this is let's go through the
folder structure so we go to desktop
responsive you'll see the template did
it for us bothers to explain this as
again my preference of how we set up a
web folder so we're brute is what's
expected to be the static HTML files a
static output which is what's them being
served here so excluding asp.net because
that'll lie somewhere else
so web routes kind of your static
website as you're building before you
then move into you know the server side
it's not all auto-generated so the
indexes and the assets the CSS the style
is but you can add assets into here you
can add fonts you can add images and you
typically just place them in here so
it's not necessarily an entirely
auto-generated folder but you will have
you know your HTML and CSS being put in
from effect the DNA web conflict telling
it to go there and inside your source is
what you'd expect to add
source files one for HTML which has got
the DNA HTML files M and another for
your sass so again at structure your
sass and here your HTML on here
and that's all you really need so far
we'll have JavaScript coming up shortly
but I keep everything in this folder and
source and then the source files all
compiled and I'm going into web root so
that's kind of the layout that we've got
and then as I mentioned we'll quickly
run through a few of these commands of
the DNA web so we've just spun this off
inside of the responsive folder so we
kind of spin DNA web up in the folder
that you're working in your template or
your your actual you know your project
folder and then all this will happen as
you're serving files if we refresh this
you won't see it there but if you edit
files you'll get kind of logs going on
edit this file oh and I've got that that
curse there on with press ENTER there we
go so if you edit files
you know this list fills up and then you
might forget with this running if you're
running multiple ones you know where you
are so you can just type the command
where and it will tell you the folder
that you're come in listening it in also
types question mark or any other
keyboard command that isn't a command
and it'll list out all there the
commands for you and describe what they
are so the way we just created this
template if you will is through this new
template and I'll show you what happens
to do that so if we went to the
installed folder of Program Files DNA
web on point one point six and we have
the DNA config file you can see in here
this is the config file that happens for
all DNA webs and we've got live data
sources and we've got two and this is
pointing to a DNA live config file which
you can make yourself but this is
basically there the one I've made that
the route 1 if you will and if you look
at that contents it basically gives you
information
out there at the live source and it then
points to a zip file that zipped file
which again is all open source you can
take a look for yourself
is there we go to DNA web source core
live data source this is what zipped up
and you'll have this folders this folder
is a live data source and then here
we've got a template and then here we
got blank and then there's blank as
you'll see there's got all those files
that were just extracted into our
responsive folder so what we did when we
typed into he and new template and then
specified a name
it was looking for because we taught a
new template blank it found in the live
data source that we've already provided
a template called blank and then it
basically just downloaded that zip file
for isn't extracting it to the folder
but the power of this is you can make
these templates you can push them online
you can host them locally so all these
templates are getting in increased if
you will they'll be more added and it
will automatically update so you have to
do anything you just start a DNA web and
it will automatically run this live
update command and that live update
command then searches the web file see
of the versions change now it does it
downloads all the new stuff so you can
imagine now any any kind of web template
anything you make but say we make a
whole website that's a really good
starting point with menus and animations
and everything we can just simply zip
that up add it to our live data source
and then in any new project anywhere you
could just simply then type new template
the name of the template and be able to
you know create that stuff for point to
the templates and then we've also got
variables so these are really powerful
and these are really for again rapid
prototyping if you are trying to do
things fast when you're making your web
so let's give you an example first we
can have a look at what variables are
currently available so we just try a
couple live variables you'll see it's
found a couple of fabrics which will
come into the next video and then you've
got DNA dot CSS link and DNA dot HTML
so these are little helper variables
I've added straightaway but to show you
what they do if we were just to make a
new file and let's save this in the
responsive source folder HTML I will
just make a new file to play around with
we'll just call this test dot d HTML and
then here now we could well we don't
need to see it like that you know what's
going to happen but we caught you can
just type in here forward slash test and
there's nothing there yet but if we then
do in this test here if you noticed we
have this variable here called DNA HTML
well the way you access a live variable
is dollar dollar exclamation mark and
then the name which typically be DNA
HTML and dollar dollar and now all I'm
going to do here is press save so ctrl s
and as I save the file there we go
I keep click if you click in the this by
the way have you clicking in this window
and you've got a white dot it stops it
the app running so you have to press
ENTER to keep it running so if I undo
that and I now click save on this file
and you watch here alls I'm doing is
pressing control s and it instantly
injects the value that's inside the DNA
HTML live variable and that live
variable is simply in the sources
variables it's just a file that you can
see contains that information and then
we've got one called CSS link which just
contains the link if you want to add a
CSS file
so as you're typing away and you're
doing this and now you go out and you
try to CSS link and even I forget this
now is like right I want to add a CSS
file is it linked as it saw says it
style you always kind of forget what the
the syntax are so now instead I can just
do dollars our extra measure more CSS
link double exclamation mark and save
and then I'll just inject that for us
and now we can just simply say oh yes
style dot CSS now we know where it is
so counterpoint of these live valuables
and live templates is that as you're
typing away you can do you know making
any templates you like or or any
valuables you like and have them rapidly
injected just by typing dollar dollar
exclamation mark dollar dollar and I
just you know typing the name of the
variable and it will literally get
replaced live in the file as you're
typing so what we'll come on to next is
responsive grids and responsive web
design and that then becomes more useful
because we have these things like fabric
carbon fabric container grid and the
chunks of HTML but it takes a long while
to write and it's much quicker to say we
want a responsive grid in this fabric
template that will come to instead of
typing all of that we can simply type
this variable so we can do with the
dollar dollar exclamation mark rabbit
dot contain that grid
dollar dollar and save and you'll see
that it injects all the HTML for us the
container the grid the classes it's just
quicker you know for chunks of data and
with it being like live you can edit
this in anything you don't have to have
it open and visual studio code you can
have it open in notepad but the
difference is I don't believe and I
haven't checked this I don't really know
part has you know live update and when
files a D to start Co me you know you
want to at least use something that's
got like you know live feedback so we
open in notepad it'll still work and
technically change so we did and you'll
see it probably change original code
here let's do the CSS link one again and
save see it's updated there but it
hasn't here because notepad doesn't have
like a live feedback but if you're
closed and reopened II would so when
you're using this feature you best using
some of our business to do code or you
know no pub plus plus but we has it so
whatever your flavor is and it's just a
really quick way of injecting you know
chunks of HTML or chunks of whatever you
like it's a you know a quick command
so that's really
the things that have been added to DNA
web since the last video as this live
server that allows this kind of you know
feedback of we don't got anything in
here that way so we now type in test and
say if you can see we update so this
this live server is one of the features
and then this whole live template and
live valuable stuff with sources which
again if you want to make your own all
the documentation is on the website so
you simply scroll down and you'll come
to live data sources and describes here
how you use them about what you do how
you make a new template and then making
your own live data source point you to
the documentation so I did just to read
that but you don't really need to to get
going so it's a fairly simple setup to
get going so we'll run through it once
more basically quit out - this was all
of these quit that close that close that
delete the folder and then we'd start a
new project we go folder responsive we
type DNA web that's been on it's our new
template blank enter again and then it
creates all the files
she's been DNA web back off which you
won't have to in the next version
because I'll look refresh won't be
required and then they have now your
live server running and you just go to
the response folder open with code and
you're ready to go you can now just go
to your source files and start working
away on your website and have it Auto
refresh for you so that's the the
initial you know set up that you'll
follow for any kind of web that we're
going to be making in these videos so
next up which I'll do next so it you
know you won't have to wait days for the
next video we're gonna start doing
responsive web design so I'm going to
show you how to spin off a little web
site are there
which will take seconds and then go
through making the website respond so if
you drag it down to a mobile phone size
it goes to a mobile layout if you're on
a tablet it go to a tablet layout
you know the whole responsive web design
so we'll do that next and again thanks
to you know the benefit of this whole
set up it'll be nice and easy to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
