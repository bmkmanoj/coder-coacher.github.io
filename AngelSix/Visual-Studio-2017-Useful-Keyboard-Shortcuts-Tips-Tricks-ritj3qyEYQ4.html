of the mainly Visual Studio shortcuts
that I use in Visual Studio
I'll get asked it quite a lot now as as
I'm doing the videos you don't have them
doing certain things or you know the
shortcuts I use we're also gonna cover
some of them a generic window shortcuts
of you will that some of you might not
know so we're gonna start with them and
there's quite a few but we're gonna go
through all of them I've made a markdown
document as well that'll be included in
this description as well as a link to
the source code so you can print off the
document if you want to keep her a
reference of all the shortcuts but we're
gonna work through them one by one and
discuss how I use them it's fairly quick
and simple I'm just gonna you know use
them and tell you what they are but
there's a lot to go through so the first
one is general copy and pasting so as
obvious as it is to some others might
not even do that we might find ourselves
you know doing this right-clicking
copying right-clicking pasting things
like that so to go through the the real
basics have you've got something
selected ctrl + C to copy ctrl + V which
is next to the C to paste and ctrl + X
which is also next to C to cut so you've
got an order of you know the bottom of
the keyboard
you've got cut which is ax copy what you
see and V which is paste so you hold
ctrl down and you press you know X C or
V for cut copy and paste and you've also
got you type something here accidentally
wanted to want to do it you can press
ctrl + Z to undo and again they're all
in a row so the bottom four keys on the
keyboard ZX CV or undo cut copy and
paste if you've done something so typed
all this and go I'll undo that controls
that then if I want to redo you simply
hold ctrl and shift and then press said
it should have worked
so I looked edit oh so it's usually ctrl
shift and said in this it just ctrl + y
so in some applications like say Adobe
Photoshop
control shift and Zed readers in visual
studio it's control and why to then go
forwards so controls are backwards
control Y forwards or Z have your
American Z or Zed whichever so that's
the cut copy and paste and undo and redo
commands they're all just generic you
know usable outside of visual studio but
some commands that people don't use next
in terms of visual studio at one of my
favorite ones is if we are say I'm
replacing something I'm changing
something like I know we with the sender
which wonderfully named to say send a to
this way but there's other instances way
simply you're changing something out so
if you wanted to change sender to say
what is this and it's gonna be a scroll
viewer so if we wanted to call this
scroll viewer like this and for whatever
reason we weren't doing the rename and
we wanted to paste it in all three of
these if you hold ctrl and click it'll
select the full word automatically so
whatever we click it'll select a full
word this is really useful so in
combination with what we've just learnt
with copy and paste we hold ctrl so I
hold ctrl and I keep control how this
whole process at a click press C to copy
click if V collect V click free click we
kind of paste through in that way so
ctrl + click selects the current word
then we have another useful thing which
is say we want to edit say this whole
thing we wanted to change so we've got a
list of similar events which typically
you'd have you know multiple things of
whatever you're doing you know in batch
which happens in code you've got you
know all these and say you wanted to
change data context changed - let's have
a look what other events have we got say
you wanted to change it to focus have
all changed and you're going to make use
of the fact that it's already there so
you could you could just change this to
focusable like this and then click copy
paste paste like this the other option
is if you hold all
and now you click and drag you can drag
basically any shape so you drag around
here to highlight data contacts and you
start typing focusable and you'll see
now it'll change every line that's
currently selected in a row which is
again really useful in situations where
you have that type of in line
something's you know the same and you
want to scroll down and select like that
and then start typing and it'll type on
all the lines so that one is I guess a
select area for the text had other
weight class asked but you hold that the
alt button and yeah you then click and
drag then there's the other one if
you're on the keyboard again it's it's
all aimed at not having to take your
hands off the keyboard and mess with the
mouse too much for most situations so
say you wanted to move this line above
to up here so you swap the order you can
either you can hold shift and go up to
select from where you are which is fine
that's the way you'd select the text on
the keyboard but then if you want to
move it above you can either ctrl + X
and delete that and go off ctrl + V and
a new line so it's you know cutting and
pasting basically but save you having to
do that you simply select the lines now
hold the alt on the keyboard and just
press up and down on on the keyboard you
can move it any way you like and it you
know it shifts text around for you so
that's the the alternate way of doing
that and now I only recently discovered
that funnily enough and I keep trying to
remember to use that instead of the
habit of you know coughed move paste
type of thing when you can just hold alt
and scroll up so that's kind of moving
lines with the the opened arrow up and
down arrow next section is kind of all
aimed at like searching and navigating
so if we wanted to find out where
something used like say where this
property is being consumed you can
either click up here references but
again you're trying to avoid having to
get the mouse out all the time so if
you're selected on something like this
and you press f12 it should then find or
rather
if 12 finds all of the you know we're
huge the references so that's that's how
you find where this is used the f12 is
to take you to where the instance of
something is so let's say the scroll
viewer even though we're not using it
here so here this is the actual instance
of this class so f12 simply takes you to
get the actual class but if you say you
click on scroll viewer and you wanted to
go to the instance of scroll view you
press f12 and it will take you to the
actual scroll of your class so f12
texture to the the instance itself of
whatever you're hovering over shift f12
on something will then find everywhere
that that classes you so if I want to
see everywhere I've used scroll viewer I
click scroll view a hold shift press f12
and then it shows me here everywhere of
a view scroll viewer in the code so
that's f12 and shift f12 for basically
finding references the next we have a
it's a Visual Studio 2017 I think it's
been around before but it's been a
really enhanced in 2017 they hold
control and press T for tango and you'll
get this go to all pop-up over here and
now you can type almost anything that's
in all of your code to find so write out
the word scroll you'll see it finds the
scroll to bottom
unload which is this thing found scroll
viewer found scroll viewer attached
properties auto scroll to bottom it's
basically found all instances of where
I've got the word scroll so it's really
useful for kind of going to a specific
thing in your code say you know you know
you've got a class with a certain thing
or you've got a property say we know
we've got a view model so let's go to
one of these view models down here and
we know we've got this attachment button
command but let's say we weren't in
there and we know it's an attachment
button command you press ctrl T start
typing attachment and then you can see
attachment button commanders there it'll
take you straight to that me a part of
coaches like it I guess a more
intelligent way of kind of finding
everything
it's an you know an intellisense version
so as your type you can see so you can
see here whether it's a class or a code
file or a method based on you know these
symbols so it's better than just typing
and searching for the text itself starts
ctrl + T and that's basically called go
to all then you've got the solution
Explorer as well over here so you want
to you might not even know that you can
search this whole solution Explorer so
say we click here and type chat you'll
see that at all and kind of filter
everywhere where chat used in the
application a shortcut to be able to do
that again see them to get the mouse out
and you encode its control and then
semicolon and then you're instantly
they're ready to type away and then
escape to cancel out that's a quick way
to get to the solution Explorer it also
hints in here the shortcut to for you as
well it actually tells you the shortcut
there then we've got cycling through
open documents so if I open a few more
and I'm looking through I know I'm
usually working with however many files
enough typically got the ones that I'm
editing open and to quickly flick
between files you hold ctrl and tap tab
then you'll see this box pop up waking
them you know flick through so hold ctrl
tab however many times and then let go
of control and I'll open that file and
that's kind of a quick way where I just
flick through these you know the last
couple of files already open without
having to then get the mouse and start
clicking around also if you've got so
you're working in this code and we've
gone all Scrolls changed I've just added
that now I've got this function here
press f12 to jump to the function and I
start typing something here but say this
function was a long way away it was you
know 100 lines of code down and then
I've gone there I've got a scroll back
up and now I'll just add it up here and
you basically you've got a history of
where you've been everywhere you click
and everywhere you go is in the history
of the navigation so if you want to now
quickly go back to wherever you just
were it could have been a you know a
thousand line long code file or it could
have just simply
in a different file all together so we
can now jump over to this file and then
start editing this one but the the thing
I'm trying to get to now is say you
wanted to go back where you've recently
just been and it could be anywhere
having all of the codes you have so it's
not like it's a just simply going to a
specific file you just want to see where
you've been you hold ctrl and press the
minus button you'll see it steps back
effectively to all the last places you
visited in order so it's it's stepping
back everywhere I've clicked and then if
you press + ctrl + + instead of control
- it goes the opposite way and it jumps
forward or it should do it's not doing
it here or is it ctrl shift oh no wrong
way ctrl shift and - is the you know the
reverse so controller - goes backwards
ctrl shift and - goes in the opposite
direction so I started off here for real
obvious examples where I click here and
here then here and just literally go
down one at a time through the lines to
create some history now if I press ctrl
- oh it hasn't done that's not a big
enough change okay let's go edit edit
edit let's just create some history on
each line I believe you have to actually
type it to matter now if I press ctrl -
still not doing it I think it's too
smart for from doing it just like that
so I clicked here and went down to here
and down to here
now it's gonna jump you know to the text
so it's smart enough that if you in I
guess we're in the same region kinda
doesn't create history you have to be so
many lines apart so if I go there that
yeah
so if you if it hasn't I guess if it
hasn't changed scroll it doesn't
register another location or this as
some kind of smart detection there but
in general you know you find it useful
that give it a certain place and then
you'll go to another file and you'll go
somewhere else and you'll find yourself
going where was I just I was just in
that other you know file a minute ago I
can't remember because you're bouncing
back and forth between code you just
press ctrl - and you'll end up you know
back where you were
so that's kind of the point of that that
feature and I do use that quite a lot
too
you know some flying through code and
trying to fire me way back so that's
that then we've got we spoke about ctrl
T to kind of go to all if that's not
working for you how you trying to search
for say a comment or just in general you
just want to do a regular search and
find all results ctrl shift and F will
pop up a find dialog type the word shaft
and press ENTER and then we gain all
these you know just the the old-style
dump of text there's no intelligent find
here this is just a simple text search
of all the files and you just see the
the raw dump you can still double click
to jump to the locations so you got that
benefit but in general it's not as nice
as using the control go to all the ctrl
T up there but this is the you know the
old way of finding things so ctrl shift
and F but you'll notice you have some
extra options here so you've got where
you want to search maybe anyone I search
specific locations or within certain
text or you just want to replace it and
things and text you can match words you
can use regular expressions so this is
still but it's place where I'd use that
maybe is say I'm copying and pasting a
chunk of code which is generally you
don't want to do you know you're trying
to avoid copying and pasting because I
can introduce errors but say I was
copying and pasting some code and I
wanted to change again let's just say
this as an example and I'll copy and
pasted and I just want to change
everywhere so this was a lot more lines
than this so it could be like that many
lines and maybe they're not in line so I
can do the alt drag so in this instance
the are but let's presume they're all a
bunch of things in different order this
could be control - this could be 22 this
could be - to do whatever it is they're
all out to line but I want to change
everywhere that this data context
changed - focusable changed you could do
select all or you could double click and
copy this first or ctrl click and copy
then you can select all the text control
an F replace all and then in the find
what you paste what you had and then the
replace all you do focus and all change
and then you just simply say look in and
change this to selection now you're
watching a press replace all it's now
replaced all those instances so that's
kind of a a use of the find find all and
find any place or there's many more uses
like say there's regex searching and
things like that but it's similar to the
go tool but you've got more features in
the find for you know directly
manipulating plain text not specifically
coded objects and then another one to be
honest I don't really use but it's a
good thing I should get into and it's
it's easy enough so we mentioned like
control - control shift - to go back and
forward in imposition way were but so
there's always a position where you want
to go to a lot in code so let's say I
don't know in here maybe we have maybe
of IOC in here because we do the IOC and
where we set it up so say this bind to
view model is somewhere where we
typically want to go to and you
sometimes forget the name of this or
it's just you can't quite remember what
this function is but this is a very
important function of the application
that you want to come to fairly often so
you can click any line you want so let's
click the top maybe press control and
then press K twice hold ctrl K twice
you'll see them disappears on the left
hand side and this is now a bookmark so
that's one boot mark you can then go to
bookmarks and but we'll make another one
so let's go to another file first let's
go to say the app sam'l as well and
we'll go to the code behind and we'll go
to the similar on startup or let's go to
this bit here where we bind after the
setup and we'll press ctrl K K and now
we have the bookmark here so then
anywhere you are in code or even if
everything's closed it doesn't matter
you can now instantly jump to bookmarks
and to do that you just press ctrl and
then K once
and for next or p4 previous and then you
have to press that each time ctrl K and
then P KP and it will jump you can see
it's going between all the bookmarks we
have so no matter where you're in code
you'd only setup boot marks typically
like I don't really use them so I guess
you use them how you like but it's
alright where I had set them up is just
on on key parts of the application so
you're not cycling through a load of you
know going or whereas it flicking
through tons of different places but
after having as useful for kind of a
semi-permanent tag of jumping to
specific parts of code that you might
want to always just quickly jump to with
a keyboard shortcut then it's that's
ctrl K mp4 previous control KN for next
and you also have the buttons up here
you've got your toolbar set up the same
so this makes or removes the bookmark
just the same as control KK DOS and this
is the previous and next and you can see
the shortcuts written on there for you
as well and then clear all bookmarks in
the file which just removes them all
stars boot marks and again use them how
you like but I'd typically say I would
make use of those on just key parts of
the code I wouldn't use them too much
because then you've got a kind of
defeats the point of cycling through all
of those you know all of those bookmarks
and then I've left this toolbar I
usually hide this toolbar on videos so
it's clearer and so I've left it open
for this video because I've got a new
feature that definitely I'm gonna start
using which shows the benefit of then
you know if you typically have this
toolbar in show and that's to go
fullscreen which is actually a really
nice feature which I never really
thought of they're usually not very
beneficial but in visual studio the new
full screen is actually really useful
and what it does is simply removes this
title bar at the top then this stuff at
the top bar jumps down to here so just
in the line so all these these two lines
effectively become one it removes all
the toolbar here which you pretty much
never use
so that goes and then it expands down to
the bottom so you actually gain a decent
amount you gain four or five lines of
code depending on your resolution so
this is actually really big resolution
for recording the videos but if we
scrolled off you can see we've got 30
lines of code now if we press ctrl and
his ctrl shift and enter nope shift alt
and enter and there we go so we do shift
alt and enter it goes full screen and
you can see now we've got 35 lines of
code when outside we've got 31 this is
like I say really big tax this is huge
on my screen so you'd probably gain
anywhere from five to ten lines of code
extra when you're in full screen which
is you know nice and useful you've got
all the space dedicated to just what you
want without any waste and that's just
called full screen and then you can get
out to full screen either again with the
shift Dalton enter or you can click the
full screen there so I'm going to carry
on doing the video with this full screen
from here because you know this is how I
want to start doing the videos anyways
in the full screen because it's really
useful you know I don't see any reason
not to run in full screen basically
because it's it just gives you all the
added space and I don't really lose
anything that I care about here you also
then don't get the destruction of the
toolbar which will be showing you know
your emails popping in your messages
popping in it can distract you from what
you do in so this is kind of a a good
way to focus as well and then in terms
of now I say building the project so
instead of going you know debug in fact
I never even use this menu so be lucky
find it build and then build solution I
just press ctrl shift and B whenever I'm
building a solution and that just fires
off the build for me so don't think I've
ever used
you know I build build solution for four
years I just use the shortcut and you
can see it's built successful so that's
how I always build a solution we then
have let's say I do this quite a lot in
new projects but let's go
to somewhere where we probably don't
have a namespace for what I want so
let's say here and say I'm in anywhere
so go in this constructor and I wanted
to makes a new task and I'll type the
word task and you'll see there's nothing
there but then what I'll do is a hold
ctrl and press dot and it will show up
this menu of basically it's suggestions
is like autocomplete suggestions way to
solve a problem so it's found that I'm
trying to use the word task which is in
the name space system threading tasks so
I just press ctrl + dots to show this
menu and then enter and then that adds
the using namespace up here for me so
that's what you'll see me doing a lot in
code and I start typing no tasks and
I'll just do it like that you don't even
see it happen I'll just press alt
attacked Arsenal's press control dot
enter and the menu rarely even shows and
then I've got the name space appearing
for me so if you type your code
following my video and then you realize
there's no you know you get this error
you probably hover over and then it says
this and then maybe you click this and
then click this but that's a lot more
time than staying on the keyboard and
simply pressing control dot enter and
then carrying on with what you're doing
and that works in a lot of different
situations is basically a any kind of
pop-up window for suggestions on
anything so you press dot there there's
there's no real suggestion but say I
have a private member and I don't name
it with an under case M which is part of
my naming conventions and I do control
dot it all then suggests to me with a
huge pop-up window to rename you know
fixed name violation and rename it back
for me so this it's basically it's not
just for you know adding using
namespaces it's for kind of auto
completing any any issues in code
another one is say I want to rename a
property correctly so instead of going I
want to meet in this two width to tie it
with to my control shift and build and
find out that got infused here and it's
now not got the right name so I'll
rename it to two here as well and you go
through
you code like that instead of doing that
you can click on the valuable and then
press ctrl and then press R twice for
rename and then it will pop up with this
highlighted text and it'll show here
rename blah blah blah you can include
the renaming comments to search for
comments you can preview train you so
I'll click that and then here if I
change it to me name will update three
references and three files so you know
that it's gonna change three different
things and then you apply and with the
preview selected you can see everywhere
it's gonna change it for you you know in
all the code so that's how you do we
name values you wouldn't you wouldn't
typically differently name them you
press ctrl R R and it will do a smart
rename of the variable and then if you
want to cancel out or you press escape
if you want to actually do the rename
and you just press ENTER and it will
rename all the variables for you that's
that's kind of that's how should we name
anything again doesn't have to just be
variables it can be class named it can
be anything that you've given a name to
you can rename in the same way another
one is for commenting code so let's say
we've written all this code maybe would
debugging and we just want to quickly
remove all this code and check whether
you know this code is affecting in a
certain way you just basically want to
get rid of this code temporarily you can
comment this whole block so there's two
ways one is you click up here forward
slash star go to the bottom star forward
slash to do like a block commenting out
and then afterwards you you get rid of
these two things the other option which
is what I tend to do because there's a
it just seems a little quicker
it's just select all the text control KC
for surrounding everything you've got
selected in single line comment and then
when you're done you select it all ctrl
K and you which is kind of undo I think
of it as you know see for commenting new
for on do you know like uncomment so
select the text control K C ctrl K you
- you know comment a block of text and
comment to block so again I find that
quite useful if you're in large files or
in files in general and maybe you've got
a lot of stuff open and you're like
you're just doing a check or you just
want to find a function now or for
whatever reason you just want to
collapse everything that's right we've
got these regions to collapse them and
you've got functions that you can you
know collapse down to just their
definitions if you want to do that for
the whole class or for a certain amount
of text you can either select all the
text
or select what text you want it to work
on or doesn't have no text selected then
it'll work on the whole file if you then
press ctrl M + M so M for mother twice
you can see I've got that bit selected
there so in order to do it on the whole
file select all which is ctrl a then
ctrl M and M and it will collapse
everything right down and then you undo
and everything's collapsed you know it's
most collapsed state so it kind of
cleans up the class and you can start
react spanning to just see what you want
but say you want you don't want to
collapse it quite that far you can do
control i'm m to completely collapse if
it's already completely collapsed
control mmm or completely on collapse so
it does both ways either fully closes
everything off foliage buttons
everything but so you just want to
collapse down to kind of definition
level so like you know that's closed and
all the functions are minimized like
this then you can do control select all
control way and control m and oh and
that will collapse everything to this
level which is probably the more
youthful level where you just seen then
all their all the properties and methods
but without any comments and without any
actual method bodies and such a
collapsing code and clucked into kind of
definition level of code so another
feature we have as well is the quick
launch menu up here well which is
another useful feature in 2017 this will
search almost everywhere so it will
search all of like tools and options or
search all in here they'll search for
everything in there and a search
a few of the locations so you can press
ctrl + Q to get into the search dialog
and type anything you like and then get
your pop-up menu for you know finding
specific so I use it mostly for
searching out of here
so that this settings menu is a bit
ridiculous for you know finding what you
want and where so if you want to find
say you know there's an option for let's
have a look
say debugging and you know there's
warning no user code so you tapped in
quick launch warned if no user code it
would actually give you an option to
open tools debugging in that specific
location so this is a very useful search
of the minute my menu is broken at the
minute I think it's maybe the recording
software doing the menu up but you would
see it's right and actually types a code
snippet and I think even though the menu
isn't showing off
no well without the menu strap tools and
press enter.now so my menus kind of
broke in a minute but I just have to
restart visual studio but with me doing
a video I'm not gonna bother restarting
just to show you that menu but basically
type type in here and you'll see what I
mean it's very useful for searching lots
of different things and that's ctrl + Q
to shortcut basically put the keyboard
focus up here for you then we have just
a few more now really one is when you're
debugging let's say we want to debug
this application and we'll go to let's
go to the app go to the main window say
let's go to any initializes we'll put a
breakpoint here by clicking in this grey
line then you press f5 to start the
debugging let's go back to full screen
again so we press f5 to start debugging
and you'll see now we've hit this break
point it's going yellow this is where we
are if I then want to step through the
code I'll press f10 and that'll step to
the next line of code and f10 again it
step to the next line if I just want to
then continue running the code up until
the next breakpoint so let's get to
another scooters from I like chat
message view model chart message list
view model say and anytime we open the
attachment menu for a breakpoint here
but right now we're still in debug so
the applications waiting for us here so
in order to carry on you know let the
application cavion press f5 and that
will continue running the code then when
we click something we'll click the
attachment menu you can see we've hit
the debugger here so again you can step
through with f10 and simply step over
lines of code then we need to get to
somewhere we want to step into a
function so let's see we need to find a
place where we can do that to show the
next thing so here that's probably good
enough who's got a relay command
so press f5 to carry on running if we
click again you'll see here now instead
of pressing f10 this time to go to this
line here go to the next line maybe I
want to step into this relay command
that's then being created so if you
press f11 instead of f10 your step was
filled step into so I'll always go as
far into the code as he can so instead
of going to this line it knows first
it's gonna run this relay command so I
press f11 steps into the relay command
here and this has been run on the
constructor to create it and then I
press f10 or ref we left them again
you'll see I'm stepping through the code
and then it comes back up so you press
f11 now it's the next line because
there's no nowhere further we can go so
depending on if you want to you know you
just want to jump down lines that you've
seen to get to a certain point you can
press f10 if you want to always go into
the code as much as possible or you want
to go into a specific line like here you
press a field lab
and they'll then jump into the
constructor you know and then step
through basically so it's a combination
of f10 and f11 for a stepping through
code and then f5 when you don't
debugging in you want e to run and then
you know the software that runs if you
then want to stop debugging you press
shift in f5 and that will stop the code
debugging and close the application and
so that's all of us for the visual
studio shortcuts that I use and I've got
a few more things now it's kind of in
addition to this one is from when I used
to use Mac's all the terms used to use
the Apple Macs and use parallels to run
Windows in a virtual machine but we've
had years and years of using Macs and
they've got slow and outdated in there
and not just because we've got you know
machines old we've got the full tops
back Mac Pros and you know all the the
top end laptops the brand-new ones they
just simply got slow they're not as good
as they used to be in comparison to
modern computers now the far behind
Apple oh really you know losing what
they had so we moved two windows surface
books and and basically normal built
windows towers now and the just
massively outperform the Macs and so as
much as I liked the Mac laptops and
computers originally for the you know
the clean style the windows surface
books now are easily as good as the mac
books were if not better so on that note
when I used to use Mac for a while one
of the things I really missed was the
keyboard shortcuts for closing closing
this current window and closing hall
applications so to close a chrome window
on Mac was the the command button which
was like the windows key if you will and
the W for closing a window so I wanted
that on Windows and then at the same
time closing the whole application was
the command and Q so Windows key and Q
which kind of stands for quit I guess
and that's much easier on the keyboard
than the window shortcuts so I think the
window shocker for closing this chrome
window is ctrl f4
which it is which isn't to me that's
more awkward and a lot further away I
can't do that without deforming me left
hand whereas if I wanted to press
Windows key and W you'll see on my
machine it now does the same thing so
Windows key W closes the current window
windows key + Q serve I often say
notepad if I press windows + Q it closes
whole application which is the same as
alt f4 but again you try it on your
keyboard windows key q it's a lot easier
to do then alt f4 so to get those two
shortcuts the the close Chrome window so
effectively control f4 + alt f4 to
replace those with Windows key W windows
key q we install Auto hotkeys so we go
back to the toolbar and we go here I've
got it open for you so if you go to Auto
hotkeys calm down low or throw hotkeys
and install that will simply install and
you'll think nothing's happened there's
nothing really showing and your toolbar
you'll have this H which you won't have
this program running yet but you'll
other sort of hotkeys in order for it to
actually work you can read all the
documentation of how to do it but I
basically provided what we need already
and there'll be a link in this video so
all you do is once you've installed this
so just simply download it run it
install it then press Windows key + R to
open this run dialog type shell colon
startup to open your startup folder
which you'll see here is just you know
this path here and then create right
click new text document the rich text
there by mistake but doesn't know select
everything including the extension here
and then just type as you can see
shortcuts shortcuts dot 8hk which stands
for audio hotkeys I'll just call this
too so you can show you press Enter
it'll warn you are you sure you want to
rename the extension just click yes this
will create this Auto hotkeys file then
right-click on the file and edit with
code or no part
and with no PUD do whatever you like
I'll just open it with code and then in
here basically type exactly what you see
here and again this will be in the
description of the video so this hash q
: : is basically saying hash is the
Windows key and Q is the key that same
window Skiing Q should basically send
the key command alt which is what this
is exclamation F for so all we're doing
is mapping Windows key Q to alt f4 and
then below here we're doing another one
which is windows TW maps to control f4
so it's creating those two shortcuts so
if you make this exact file place it in
the startup here it means that every
time your computer starts it will run
this file for you which means your
shortcuts are available for the first
time if you just installed it and
creates the file simply double-click
this file and then it will sit won't say
this because I'm running the script
it'll simply run but say you run it
again it you can say it's an old version
of the script is running do you want to
replace it with this instance so all
you'd have to do is double click this
file and now when you press ctrl sorry
Windows key and Q on the say window here
it should close the window for you same
as in Firefox here if I press Windows
key in W now it will close this just
this tab and that brings us on to you
know the next thing which is screenshots
again one more thing I missed with the
Mac's was the father you could just
create a screenshot nice and easily with
just a few keyboard shortcuts I've
actually forgot all that keyboard
shortcut was now I'm used Mac in a while
but I've now created another shortcut
which is control windows key + s and
that allows me to now draw and you know
create screenshots then just copy to
clipboard or save as a PNG or do
whatever I like with even annotate on
them you know drawing you know make some
marks or whatever so this is really
useful and as you can see here this is a
software I use which is like shot
so it's app dot P R M T SC R which
basically means print screen so app da
prynce Green Comm
again the links in the video and in the
document just download and install the
software then in your taskbar at the
bottom you will have this little further
purple further you right-click and click
options go to hotkeys I uncheck both of
these I don't use the other shortcuts
and I change the general hotkey which is
the one that allows you to draw new
things to control windows and s and then
that allows me to do this quickly create
screenshots of whatever I want and you
know copy them and do whatever so that's
how I do
screenshots nice and quickly that's all
the the third-party tools I use there
there's a few more windows shortcut so
you Visual Studio sure because they use
not many we'll just run through these
quickly as well so when I've created a
new say I'll create a new class I call
it a class and now I want to create a
constructor there's things called
snippets so I attach ctor for
constructor you'll see it's a code
snippet for constructor so I'll type
ctor in just press tab twice and it will
then create the constructor for me so
that's making use of a snippet and
that's one of them that you use one of
the few that I use so you'll see me
create a class and you'll see me go see
tour and then all of a sudden s
constructor appears so if you're
wondering how I did that it's basically
it's a snippet that appears and you
press tab twice another snippets that
you man I realize as a snippet but when
you're commenting stuff that you see me
doing in all the video it's like this
comment I just put three forward slashes
then that creates a summary text I'm not
sure whether that's classed as a snippet
but it does effectively the same thing
you just don't have to press tabs so you
do three and it makes a summary comment
for you and then one other one I use is
a region so I won't create a new region
here ready for new stuff just type
region or just start typing region so
are each our eg is enough then tap twice
again it will now create a region in a
closed region and it won't be
highlighted for the name shocking type
this
as a region and press ENTER and then
it's created the region for me which is
slightly faster than you know going Ashe
region my region and turned to hash and
region and then going back and tap in
which you'll see me do all the time in
my videos and it was actually a viewer
of the videos that recommended doing the
the region tap tab to you know create
the regions so I'll try and keep
remembering to use that one and then we
have one last one which is the snippets
for surrounding so say I already have
properties say I have private bring a ma
say I've got some code some really bad
code that's really poorly named and got
some really bad blank documentation say
I want to wrap this in a region so again
actually the manually click the time
region blah blah blah scroll to the
bottom and end region the other way you
can do it is with a surrounds with
region so instead of doing that you
simply select all the text press ctrl K
and s surround and then I've edited my
region so typically you'd have to type
in hash and then region every name my
chakra just region and then you can
press tab you'll see now it surrounds
what I've selected with my region and I
can then type a name
so that's a way of surround him with
this has also been slightly tweaked so
by default this would not have
highlighted where it was so if I
selected here like this and the ctrl s
and then type region I wouldn't have got
the correct space in here here and below
I fixed that by basically editing the
region snipping myself so to do that
yourself you could go to C Drive Program
Files x86 Microsoft Visual Studio 2017
whatever version you're on c-sharp
snippets
whatever language you're in federal C
sharp you'll get there eventually then
these are the snippets and the one about
it is this PP region so right click and
if you go to my blog I'll show you how
to do the openers admin so if you want
to blog angel 6 com
I've just posted how to quickly full
enough for this exact file how to open
things in admin so by default if you
open this text file or the snippy file
in code say and you try to edit and save
you'll get this error because it's
obviously permissions now you need to
run as admin so but usually you'd open
so you'd search for notepad right click
run as admin yes then you go to file
open and then you browse all the way to
the file then you'd open it and then you
edit it a quicker way now if you follow
this blog post as you simply now right
click on the file send to and I've made
this admin code shortcut that now opens
up in admin then what I did was I edited
the name so it was originally hash
region and short-course hash region so
I'll remove the hash so it's quicker to
type I don't have to type hash then
every time I want to use ctrl KS and
then I tweaked this metadata here which
basically means you start the C data and
then it puts in this exact bit here so
it puts region and then a name that
it'll prompt for then it'll put a new
line then I'll put the selected text
you've got to the end of where your
selection is and then it will put the
end region and then its newline
afterwards so if you compare this to the
original file and again the this exact
file is on my blog post this is just a
slight tweak so that the region
surrounds by works well for me based on
how I select the text so I typically
select the line below where I am here up
to the top line and that's how I select
what I want to wrap whereas other people
might put a new line here and they might
go
they might select just the start here
you might select up here so you'll see
when you try to do the surrounds by
control KS
region you'll judge for like if you keep
getting an actual new line here then
just edit the snippet file and remove a
new line between the you know the region
and like this one I'd need a an extra
new line putting there before n region
but again I did a blog post on that so
that should be nice and easy to follow
and I think that as all I've got for
shortcuts so we've we've covered a lot
of pretty much every shortcut I use as
well as the light shot and auto hotkeys
so anything you see in my videos now any
kind of shortcut or anything I'm doing
you should find in this video and Maxie
have made a solid documentation of all
these shortcuts and that's linked in
this post so if you forget what the are
you want to quickly scroll to and find
them and you can again have you've got
any good chalk what you want to
recommend I'd like to hear them you
always learning new shortcuts in Visual
Studio and it's always nice to learn you
know a new shortcut so again do do post
your favorite shortcuts and then I can I
can have a try myself and you'll then
probably see me using them in a new
videos if if I find them more beneficial
than typing out you know the whole the
whole code that I would have had to type
in the first place so hopefully this was
a useful video again let me know your
thoughts and then yeah that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
