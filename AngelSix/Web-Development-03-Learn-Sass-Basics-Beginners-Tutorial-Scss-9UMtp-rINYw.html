the basics of CSS and the video before
that we did HTML so obviously we're
trying to build up to the point where we
now are making an actual website and a
lot of you have started to ask you know
when when are we going to do this server
work in terms of the you know Fassett o
word server that is coming but in order
to do that you first need to know basic
web development so we're building up to
that and we're starting with effectively
a static website so you know how to down
make HTML files and you know how to make
CSS files and they're the the to mean
you know UI technologies for the website
the third really being like Java Script
but the thing is you don't really want
to work in HTML directly he don't want
to work in CSS directly they're not
really powerful and north or they are
but when you start getting to scale it's
nicer to have better tools to enable you
to work cleaner and more methodically
and you know just bringing the power of
it's the difference between writing say
a c-sharp code file in notepad versus
Visual Studio so you want some more
power to you know your design flow so
you wouldn't typically get into SAS SAS
s until you know a lot more about the
web so typically it you know how to
build websites before you looked at
using SAS but honestly it's that simple
and that easy we're starting off with it
straightaway so we've done one basic
intro to CSS and that's all you need to
know and understand in order to use SAS
so that's what we're gonna do in this
video you're gonna get going with a
whole setup of how we you know make use
of SAS how we compile the code starting
from installing in short SAS is
basically a something that compiles the
SAS code into a CSS stylesheet based on
you know the content you enter and it's
very similar to CSS you basically
alright in CSS it just adds benefits
such as been able to declare variables
functions and
including multiple files nicely and
organizing things too you know outputs a
CSS file things you can't do in CSS so
we'll start by installing sass so if you
might expect you basically type in si SS
into Google or you can just go to sass -
Lang com go to install scroll down and
click Ruby installer and then click this
download here and install Ruby for
Windows so I've gone with 64-bit simply
download and install Ruby once that's
finished that takes quite a while then
you can read down here then you type gem
install sass so basically pick a folder
go anywhere
click in the address bar here type CMD
for command and that will open a command
prompt or you can simply open a command
prompt however you like and then in here
with you've installed Ruby you should be
able to type gem and press ENTER and it
gives you this information about gem so
you know gems installed and then you
basically type this command gem install
at SAS and I've already got in the
system but I'll rerun it to show you
what should happen I'm pretty sure this
will simply figure out that I've got
eaten say it's successfully installed
which it is doing so you should see
something similar to this happening
once you've done in the same command
window you should be able to cite SAS -
should be for version and you can see
where we're running SAS version 3.5
point 2 so that's all of us to install
in SAS and then we want to now start
using it so I've created this folder
they'll be a link in the description
it's on my github YouTube repo I've got
into here made another folder called oh
three suspects and I created a subfolder
called web root and this is where we're
now storing a HTML file so in order to
work with any other website stuff we're
doing
we'll use Visual Studio code so we'll
open up visual studio code and then once
in here this is the HTML file I've got I
just made up some random HTML theater to
get us going so we can see its styling
in things so in here now go to file open
folder instead of open file
and go to SAS basics or you know the
folder you're in and I'll just open this
folder and that just gives us a benefit
of having this drop-down here now for
all the files in that folder and we've
actually got that index open so once
you've got this index open on any HTML
you can simply make your own it's it's
not a video on HTML it's the video on
SAS so I've simply copy and pasted some
random HTML into here in order to we did
this in the last video as well to see
like live edits you want to go to
extensions in Visual Studio code and
make sure you've got live server
installed if you don't simply type in
the search bar and then click install
once you've got live server installed
then once you've got the HTML file open
you'll see down here at the bottom right
you've got go live if you click that it
will now open a website up on drug this
to one side and you can see this is the
random HTML I've made if I make a change
to the title and save you can see live
updates so we've been through this in
the previous video if you want more
details on you know setting up to this
stage so now we have a website off HTML
we saw how we linked in CSS before we
just simply do a link with a href to a
path to some CSS and that will then
style the document now instead of CSS
we're going to makes us obviously that's
what we're here to do so in this folder
oh three I've got something called web
root and I've done that because this is
more of a compiled folder if you will
this is where the compiled code is going
to go to so sass is going to compile
into CSS and it's going to go into this
folder but you don't want to make sure
compiled code with your you know your
interpreted code your Sasson and
whatever else we use so for that reason
we'll have two folders you can kind of
think of web root as your bin folder and
see sure kind of a you know compiled
folder that's what we're using this for
it's going to output the final web code
that we want so what we're going to do
is make a folder called source and
that's our source code and in the source
folder we'll make one called sucks
and then finally in the SAS folder we'll
just make a new text document here and
we'll call it style dot s CSS so that's
the the extension for SAS files and so
instead of making a text document we
simply deleted the dot txt extension and
a d dot s CSS to make a new SAS sheet
and then we can open this in Visual
Studio code you'll notice because we
open the folder you can see we've now
got the source folder we can open the
SAS and then here's an empty file so we
just typed in some H warm styler ahead
of one and make font size 50 pixels make
it massive and save you can see right
now nothing happens
so it's just a SAS file it doesn't you
know this is the file we want to get we
want to include a CSS file so how do you
get from s CSS to a CSS file so to do
that you'd go to your folder so if we go
to the main folder where we've got all
our content here so the source code with
the sass in is in here and then the
output because we've got this index here
and the way I'm gonna include my CSS
file completely up to you where you
place the file you can place it in the
same folder I'm going to put mine in a
folder as you can see called assets so
inside web root let's make a folder
called assets inside that I won't make
one called CSS and again this is
completely up to you this is just the
way I structure my websites where place
files and then I want now my CSS to go
into this folder here so let's just jump
back get to the top folder and if I then
type in the command line here in the
address bar rather type CMD this opens
up a command line into this folder and
then all we want to do is watch this
folder for changes and we'll start with
that we've typed SAS - - watch space and
then dot for the folder meaning this
folder so the dot means you know this
folder and then press ENTER and he SAS
is watching for changes right sauce SAS
style so we're now go into our source
folder sass you can see it's actually
made the CSS file for us and you'll see
in here we can see it automatically so
if we open it off you can see it's
compiled our s CSS file which is right
now just CSS anyway and compiled it into
a CSS file for us so that's already
working if you will if we were to delete
these files so we just got the s CSS
file and we make a change you'll see
before I save I move that up there this
down to here if I save this s CSS now
you'll see that this detected changes
and then created the CSS file for us so
we've already got the sass now compiling
but it's compiling to the wrong place so
let's delete those two again in this
terminal where sass is running press
ctrl C to terminate the sauce and then
it also confirm yes and then we're gonna
run that same command again but this
time the first dot is the import folder
well if we're up here this isn't really
we don't want to be watching this whole
folder we want to just be watching the
sass folder so instead of dot we'll type
source for wife's ass which i'll base
for me and watch this folder for this
the file changes that's all we want to
watch if you then put a colon it will
now mean first ones input folder next
one's the output folder well the output
folder we want to go into web root
assets CSS so we'll type
Webroot assets CSS and now you can see
this written is instantly wrote the CSS
file when we opened it's also put into
the correct location for us now so if we
opened this folder sorry this file
that's is showing our justin is
scrolling up there we go it's this file
so we split that again maximize a minute
this is the CSS file and this is the
sass file so rather than change this to
font size sixty and say even then watch
over here
you can see the files got updated so
we've got kind of a live compilation
going on right now we can simply write s
CSS and this CSS file will get updated
so that should also mean if we then
watch the website here we should be able
to live change the s CSS and see the
HTML changing so to do a quick recap of
we're up to at the minute we've
downloaded and installed sass we've made
a web root folder where we've just
simply placed this HTML file and then
we've made a source folder and inside
that sass and inside this a CSS file
right now there's just plain old CSS in
there and then we've run the CMD in this
oh three suspects exfol der to pop up a
command line and then in that it popped
up and we typed in sass and space to
dashes watch space and then the path
that we want to watch which is source
slap sass and then the output path of
what the files to be generated so right
now this is the command you'd have to
run in order to effectively start
watching for sass file changes in the
next video I'll show you a tool up made
so you don't need to do this but for
this first video you know it's perfectly
fine and now with that running and with
the live server inside of Visual Studio
running we have effectively a live link
where we can edit files and this assets
CSS file here gets auto-generated every
time we make a change the index file
we've got them links to that CSS file
here and that's why we're now getting
the ability to change that so that's
give us the real of the environment set
up you know of where we want to be so
now you'll want to know what the
benefits of sass are and we'll go
through of call this a you know a sus
basics but really we're going to cover
almost everything there's gonna be very
few things we won't cover in this video
so we'll get started with the most
basics so one is somewhat two again
c-sharp and coding so you're making a
load of
CSS a new hard you know bunch of headers
and you wanted them all to be say
different or bathe equal one you wanted
them all to be the same and this is how
you're doing it eighty pics or they
depict relates pixels now anyone CSS you
could do h1 h2 h3
you know combine them this way and then
place your value here but this is just
an example of one situation where in CSS
you have no variables there's no way to
share data there's no way to you know
keep things common so if you had headers
with the same font size and then you had
say no a box class and that add some
color of red and then it also wanted a
font size the same you're constantly
repeating yourself you know there's
there's no way to have variables and
that's what you really need when you're
writing any kind of large CSS file so
the first way to do a valuable is well
the only way to do bagel there's dollar
sign and then the name of your variable
so we'll call this header - sighs a
colon and then we'll do say 40 pixels
and now all you do to use that way well
that's like declaring a variable and see
you sure that's similar to go in for
header size and I know you can't do a
dash in C sharp for a variable name but
presume you could it would be basically
this you know that's what you're doing
you're creating a valuable giving it a
name and setting it to 40 it's just in
sass you do dollar to define a variable
then the name then a semicolon and then
the value after that name so now we have
a variable called header size with a
value of 40 pixels so now instead of
hard-coding values here we can simply
paste in the name of the variable never
we save that you'll see it's no change
there and if we also openly CSS you can
see it's compiled to basic CSS which
doesn't have variables but it's simply
inserted the variable where we like and
then we can make use of that anywhere we
like so if you change that to the head
or two as well you know make you to the
variable
again that's all there really is to
available you define it and you use it
where you want so we'll say nothing more
on that really what we're gonna try and
do in this video is start creating the
correct structure as well for a larger
website for full website so in order to
and the I guess the point of sass as
well as to organize those files so we're
gonna move into slightly organizing
these into the correct structure and
again this is my preference this is how
I structure things you're free to
structure the files however you like but
I'll show you my way so we'll go into
the source folder and then we've got
sass man now we just got one file called
style dot s CSS we want to kind of make
a base system which I'll end up making a
full-blown based system to share on
github once it gets more mature but we
will really want to base web system
where we have you know base sizes a
theme some normalization a grid system
for a responsive and mobile web design
all kinds of foundations to building a
website all the the stuff that goes into
the the basics of every website we want
to kind of make a base for that so what
we're gonna do instead of having
everything in this one file similar
again to c-sharp having multiple classes
and multiple files and including them
everywhere one of the features of sass
is that you can include things in
another file so let's just right click
and create another file and this will
call base CSS and then all will do for
now is we'll open this based on s CSS
will move this header size into the
space and we'll save and the first thing
you'll notice is and Webroot assets CSS
it's now generated this base CSS well we
don't want to really generate loads of
CSS files and then include them all in
the HTML because for one that means that
you have more web requests when you open
your page which slows down your load
time and to its we just don't need
individual CSS files we we can quite
happily compiled into a single file
because this isn't the file we have to
maintain or
view or anything this is simply the
compiled version if you will of the SAS
so we want to in one file but we still
want to separate our our actual files so
to do that we could make what's called a
partial class and then SAS a partial
class can be that easily be finite and
replacing an underscore in the name and
now that's been edit we can see that in
here new template detected SAS
underscore base so basically that should
now have not generated anything in here
for the base which is correct so we're
not getting a file for that class but
now the base file contains our variable
we want to make use of it in this style
class
so this is a partial class now this base
underscore and we want to include it in
this style file now so to do that you
type our import and then in quotes end
with a semicolon type base and what you
don't need to do when you're doing an
import is you don't need to specify an
underscore so you can but you don't need
to and you're also going to need to
specify s CSS so you could import this
you could import this you could import
this the law work but in general don't
bother putting an underscore because you
don't need to and there's no point point
s CSS because it's smart enough to know
that so by doing import base we should
now have the ability to reference this
header size so we save that it's now
generated and if we go back to where
Bruce assets CSS I don't know I keep
doing that's right here it is is 40 now
if we change the base to 50 and save
then the SAS is detected that that's
changed it also knows that style is
referencing that and now the style has
changed so that is a partial class and
also importing it into you know this
main class
so because our base class is going to
have a lot more than this one file we're
gonna be splitting it up let's make a
folder in here we call it base I will
just move this base into here and then
if we edit the style you'll see right
now this should fail because it can't
find that import now so what it's doing
now is looking for a base CSS file in
this folder and it doesn't exist it's
gone inside of a folder called base so
we now need to go inside the folder
called base and then to the file pool
base and now it's found it again so we
have that we want to now create one of
the things then this isn't really
related to SAS directly it's more CSS
and web design in general and again this
is my preference so I'm sure many other
web designers do things differently but
I strongly feel the websites should have
a base sizing in terms of everything to
form sort of aesthetically pleasing
design comes from you know a certain
figure I said everything's kind of
branches off and that's kinda like the
golden ratio and Fibonacci and things
like that natural aesthetics come from
an association and a link between
elements so this heading as you can see
has got say this much base above this
much space below but hardly any here but
if if we move this out it'll start
looking nicer I should be able to see
that this header looks too close to the
left-hand side you can't say why you
just know that it doesn't make a
statically pleasing and if we move it
out to certain amount then all of a
sudden you can tell it looks nice it
fits and then what you'll find is the
difference or rather the the similarity
between you know the space above in the
space to the left there's a direct
proportion and everything should size
proportionally so say the top is a
hundred pixels and the left you want to
be fifty and it's a fifty percent you
know ratio of a certain value so when I
design websites I make absolutely
everything in the website follow a few
small base variables Bay
sizes and then if everything follows
from those sizes your entire website can
scale up and down by changing a single
value so that's what we're gonna do here
now we're gonna start creating this kind
of base structure and these base values
because you need to make you need to
start with good foundations so this
might be you know in advance and it
probably is in advance of where your
skill oven might be art if you're just
learning CSS and and sass but this is
the the best way to do it is to you know
start with the right foundations so what
we're gonna do you've seen how to make a
valuable in suss you've seen how to make
a partial file at base so we're gonna
now make another one it's still part of
really this base system that will make
him we'll call it underscore base topped
settings scss and then inside of the
base folder we've got a new file now and
look at your comments in SCSS just the
same like c-sharp so we'll just call it
base setting so it's kind of a header
and then here we'll say this is
high-level settings for the entire site
to create relational sizing and
aesthetically pleasing design something
like that
so in here now we'll make a variable
called base spacing unit say and we'll
give that a value so we'll give that a
value of or let's do yeah do a say 24
pixels and you can adjust these to
anything you like you know we've got a
few things like say they're going to
form the foundation and everything else
I'll size from that it'll create another
one called base font size which again is
kind of the default middle ground font
size we want to work off and then we'll
create another one finally baseline
height which is the space between you
know these two lines of text and for
that we'll actually only make use of the
space in any way so we'll make use of
the same variable so this is actually
setting the value of this variable to
what this variable is so really our
entire site now is going to be based off
these two sizes alone so absolutely
everything in the whole UI design is
gonna come from these two sizes and
you'll see that coming about in the next
few videos so to make use of these sizes
you don't have you know everything isn't
24 pixels never than 16 pixels that's
not what I'm saying
it's that everything is a derivative of
those sizes so things like padding and
spacing between elements so this white
space around here and the you know the
padding and the spacing you need sizes
to work from blah
so we'll do spacing sizes and then here
I'll make a whole bunch of them so I'll
say spacing normal and that value will
be the base spacing unit and that's fine
and then if we copy and paste that as
well as normal you might want to be less
than that and you don't want too many so
you know don't go crazy on them because
you kind of defeat the point if there's
too many steps in between you've simply
made a value for every you know item so
for small we'll do half of that size and
then all do one as her smaller that's a
third of that size and then you can go
above as well so you'll notice in such
as well obviously here I'm do
mathematical equation so I'm dividing by
three I'm dividing by two that's
something you also can't do in CSS so
you're gaining the benefit of using you
know math operations so as well spacing
normal will do spacing large and large
can be say times 1.5 will do larger
which will go to say two
and then we'll do largest gildo to say
three so what we have here now is a
bunch of spacings that we can make
yourself in our design but are all a
percentage of this base spacing unit so
you'll see this coming together like I
say but now we have some units to go off
and then the same goes for fonts so we
want font sizes and you want font normal
which I'm pretty sure you can guess
where this is now going to go it's kind
of exactly the same so you make a normal
size
you'll make a small on I'll be divided
by say 1.3 again these you can play with
these figures once you see your website
up and running and tweak them and until
they're nice
I'll do an extra small and that can be
divided by it's a 1.6 because you don't
want fonts being too small because
they're already your standard base font
is about legible anyway so you don't
wanna go crazy small and then we'll do
font large and that one can be at times
a 1.5 and then we'll do larger largest
similar fashion and we'll do two and
three times so same as spacing we have
base font sizes now as well to work off
now we can also do this isn't really the
same thing as these Universal spacings
but let's also define while we're on the
fonts the font weight which is the
thickness like this is kind of bold this
is thinner so we'll make font weights
light and we'll simply define you know
the font weights and we'll probably move
this in fact no possesses settings this
is fine so font weights are basically
values from 0 to typically a thousand at
most
and on average you know phone waiters
like three or four hundred and likes
it's the thickness of the character so
you have a certain font you use for the
website and you make the font weight
thicker and if there's a bold version of
the the font that's weight as setters
you know that number or above then it'll
go to that thickness so we'll use these
bars of plump knees in for now so you
can you know we have them in the
settings file for completeness so love a
light font which would be like a thin
font a normal font we'll say 200 for now
we'll probably change that yeah we'll
have a bold font which I learned will be
300 but again just chop some values in
until we pick a font then we'll match
these up on a black which is like really
fast let's say 500 I've got some font
weights in there and then we'll do more
now style the or rather weren't style
these will stall them in a minute but
we'll also need base sizes for headings
I feel because headings are used quite
intensively throughout the website
they'll be different from font sizes in
general you know you'll want to specify
specific sizes for you know headers so
they'll header sizes and we will do
header size and we'll make these match
the HTML H one two three four five and
six
so we'll do header size one and again
making use of the base font size that we
have will make the biggest header say x
one point seven and then I would copy
and paste this so we've got six of them
two three four five and six and the
larger the number on the head of the
smaller the gap so we'll do x 1.6 1.5
1.3 do you know normal size font so the
headings not the same size as the font
and then we'll even do a heading it's
actually smaller than the font size but
you know whatever we might need and I
think that's really it for all of this
base units that also we don't here in
SAS is define a load of very
but now they're usable throughout our
our file so we now want to make use of
these or start making use of these so
let's make we go to the folder again
we've got the settings which is where
you know what you will really be to just
tweak the settings of the website the UI
you know the default sizes and things
will make another file called base dot
or shall we call this or do we even need
another file for this because this is
making use of base sizes
nothing will place this in base itself
so that's kind of the the root level of
this this base system because it's kind
of important now we want to apply these
settings to certain specific this is
just generalized things so we want to
say make use of the line height that was
specified for the whole document so for
base you can think of this as the top
level of this base system so normal CSS
you type body to access all of the stuff
inside the body it will do line height
and I will make use of the variable
which we call base line height and if we
save that I believe this won't work yep
jumped imported we save that file you
can see we've got Arianda farm variable
and that's because we need to do the
import in this file we need to import
base settings to do art import base
settings and here I think that should
work
invalid body expected with oh sorry and
then a semicolon so there we go
chaining detected undefined size header
size out where have I used header size
style out in here and the old stuff so I
should feel like that for a minute there
we go so where were we the base now has
body line high base line height style
imports base base imports the settings
so the end result is our CSS has been
generated and now we have this body line
height of 24 and then visually if we
went to settings now and changed our
base spacing unit say to 29 you can see
we're separating the the line height so
everyone's like 40 you can see it in use
but what you'll see is that everything
you know societies in proportion so
we'll make use of line I tear you know
set the default line height same for the
font weight so we'll set the font weight
to font-weight:normal and that doesn't
really change anything here because this
form that we're using right now the the
standard one doesn't really change you
can try changing font normal - there's
our front light gun I thought we made a
light one so you change from wing onto
900 you can see at least it's pitch to
bold or volunteer but again until we
pick a font in a minute we'll mess with
these values to match afterwards and
then you can see the output here so we
now have our base setting and starting
to be used to create some kind of you
know standard appearance and layout we
also made the headers so let's apply
these header styles so let's do h1 h2 h3
h4 h5 h6 and we want all of them
so all these headers will want to have
the font weight
set to a font weight for heading which
did we make like a fun week for heading
no so as well as these font weights you
kinda want to make some default ones for
you know what fonts are going to be used
for the heading and again we won't use a
new value we'll simply set it to a
certain things Oh headers are typically
bold you know so we'll set it to the
variable bold and then in order to
change the the font weight of all
headers you simply change this one
valuable so back in the base here we'll
set the font weight to the bold and you
can see our bold right now is set to 300
which is not bold enough but you know
the default one is actually bolder so
hours have gone thinner which is fine so
set heading bond weights and again you
can always keep an eye out on the CSS to
see what's happening at the end of the
day all were doing us creating multiple
classes and organizing our CSS into SAS
files and making use of variables to you
notes to make our lives easier so we've
got some kind of system in place but
ultimately it all ends up compiled into
bog standard CSS so if you're curious of
what's happening you can always just
keep an eye on the CSS file
you know you'll know what's going on so
we've set the font heavy set lying
Heights set default font weights and
then what else did we have we have this
specific sizes for headings as well so
to do that we'll have h1 and we'll have
font size Oh was it heading size one I
think and if I'm available ahead in size
one
Heather sighs well so you might not see
that change two three four five six
let's apply up to all the header sizes
and save and you can see they slightly
change there if we go to the header
sizes we can either say you make this
one a lot larger by x near by three and
you got a larger having or you could
change if you wanted everything to scale
at the same proportion why is this the
same size or does it just look the same
size
yeah just ellipses in size so how do you
wanted to a pretty similar so I'm going
to actually be taught had him one a
little bit more probably shrink that
down a little bit more something like
that they scale a bit better now and go
so now you can see all the outputs have
been calculated as well so the CSS has
got you know set sizes and pixels and
they've been calculated so in here we've
done it via variables but I'll swear
we've you know once it compiles it's
gone to you know your standard values so
before we go much further as well let's
put a nice font into this website so if
I close this down go to fonts google.com
and this is where you can get any kind
of font you like for your website so I
turn off my stylesheet protesting you
can see you'll get a load of fonts so
I've really popular ones like open sans
Roboto will and later they're all really
common so I've looked through one-on-one
the--one slightly different so if you
see it you want a copy of mine and ty
quick
and we're gonna use this font so to use
it you just click the plus button it'll
go to a thing down here a deed and then
you've got quick something selected go
to customers and we want to have the
options here to you know slightly as
fonts and you can see we have these the
weight through a talked about light
regular medium and bold so if we go to
our settings file a minute and just
tweak these to match so light would be
300 regularly 400 medium as they've
called it we've called it bold is five
hundred and black they're calling Bo
local seven hundred so if we make our
font weight to match this and now we
have all these selected go to embed it
tells us we need to include this link in
the effectively the CSS link there so to
do that instead of having you know a
link just like this that we have to you
know keep you have to then put that into
your HTML will use this import instead
so we can use it directly in sass you
want to copy just this part so ignore
the style around there and copy this and
then we just need to paste this into a
sass file so again to keep things nice
and clean and organized we'll make
another file called base top fonts and
again it may look like you're making a
lot of files here to store small things
but trust me this is this is gonna
benefit you as this site gross because
you can keep things nice and organized
and you're not gonna go right where did
I store that string for the fonts if you
just got one file called base and then
it's a 10,000 line sass file and you're
hunting around for things giving things
separates and then small files as is
really good practice so I made another
file called font base top fonts and here
will paste what it told us to include
which is this import function this is
just plain CSS so it's not actually even
this an at import and it looks the same
as this import this is not a SAS import
this is a box
CSS and then once it on the import we
need to set the font family to quick son
to get that font so in order to do that
we'll put this inside body again
so it's you know applied everywhere I'm
gonna do font family or rather than
we'll just paste it says the font family
and then we will just put a little note
at the top and we are using quick some
font a smiley face and then we will see
you can pick again any font on this site
and the process is the same click the
plus button click the bottom that says
family selected custom attitude to make
sure you include all the fonts that you
want and then go to embed import and you
know do the same protein ur so you can
easily change the font you want now if
we go back to this site now you can see
it's still the boring old font but we
haven't included this base fonts again
so back to our base s CSS file as well
as importing settings let's import the
fonts and you can now see our websites
instantly change to a much nicer looking
font so again like say pick any you like
but this is the one I'm going to use for
now for this and then next thing let's
say the next step in the process and
again not specific to sass but kind of
you know bundler in because we are
making no sass variables and things but
when you make a website you really want
to pick at least a color theme or color
palette and I've settled on over making
multiple websites five colors tends to
be a decent amount of coral colors in a
site and you don't really want to go
more or less so and you can either have
your palette made yourself you can just
pick five colors you like or get them to
blend but I've just tried this today you
know for making this video I thought I
wonder there's any kind of nice
generators for making color schemes so
googled it and basically cool us if you
will see LOL ors co gives you this nice
website where i maximize it a minute you
kind of get this generator
and let me just copy my toad out first
in fact I'll copy out then I'll show you
how easy it is to regenerate different
schemes but you come on to this site and
you see this and you press spacebar on
the site and these colors will all
change you can mess with settings like
if you want them all to be the same
color tone if you will and then you can
do pick colors from an image to you know
match try and find a color scheme from
images you can click each individual one
and tweak the values so we'll have a
play with this in the mini but I've
settled on these powers so I'm going to
click the export and then scss and this
is generated a file so let's just open
the file I'm bothered download in it and
then in here you can see it's made these
a CSS variables so I'll just take the
RGB values they're fine copy and you can
see these match the colors and then we
will add this to another file
we'll make so we will call this base dot
palette s CSS and we open that paste the
values in and save we now have 5 colors
to use called color one to five and we
will then apply them to our side but now
I've copied them into my file I'll show
you this quickly by just doing a refresh
I think there's a load the same colors
again though yes so if I just do
I guess remove this good from you know
this session this is the site you'll
come to start the generator for free it
loads this page then you get a bunch of
colors now we press spacebar you just
generate loads of random colors that you
know kind of go well together if you
found one that you like like say like
this yellow I can click this lock icon
and then press space and that one won't
change for the others around it will now
change you can also say click this if
that's close to what you want you can
click this to change shades and go you
know darker or lighter then click drag
and just simply you know depends on
where you want to visualize it
and you can adjust and then this is
where you can tweet you know however you
like
you know just up or down to whatever
color you like and you got all kinds of
different you know ways to change the
color
it says fairly obvious how you use the
site and like say you can pick colors
from an image or you know low remote
image or local image anything you like
so I've gone with you know those colors
that I've found and this is how I pick
them just using this cooler site and so
that's that's the color scheme picked so
now if we go to use them in this site we
have a fonts to store the fonts in the
basis that the parent of all lists that
come you know as they're effectively
they're the base system the settings are
all the setting is now the palette has
got the colors in so you want to keep
the palette separate from the theming
because this palette is now purely five
colors but if you're making a theme on a
website you mount on the background to
be color one the foreground to be call
of three a header to be a different
color but where and how you apply those
colors throughout your website forms the
theme the specific colors that you're
applying really a separate from that the
palette so you can then change just the
palette on its own so we'll have a file
called based palette for stowing the
course I'll have a file called base
theme which really is the where we start
to now apply these theme settings so in
base as well as importing fonts let's
import theme and we can have will import
the palette as well
obviously and then if we go to theme now
and as our first theme let's make the
whole of the HTML documents so even if
it's a blank page it will make the
background and the variable from the
pallet color one and you see our
websites now turn to that purple color
that I picked
well then also set a color which is the
foreground the font color to color for
and that brings it up to our kind of
white light color so now we're starting
to theme the website we've got an actual
you know a theme going with our course I
mean you might say right that that's to
Kali who's what about links like he
would go linking it's the standard blue
that you get in browsers so instead
let's make an anchor style and also a
color is the third color out of our
theme and it's gone to this nice blue
that we had and then we might want to
hover effect over this you know to go
from blue to something else and so just
zoom in on this one so you know you want
this blue to change so in pure CSS if
you wanted to now style a hover effect
on an anchor you'd have to do outside
here a dot hover and then we could do
you know the color in your hover is
color Tuesday and that'll work and you
can see now it goes to the the bright
pinky color we have but you're in sass
now not CSS so you don't need to do this
separation because really what you're
doing here is saying there's the style
for an anchor but then the hover style
for the same thing is now out to go into
a separate almost class if you were when
you look at it this group so it kind of
separates your visual and you also have
to retype all this
so in sash you can do what's called
nesting and because this hopper is
related to this anchor you intimately
delete the anchor move this inside here
and then because we want it to be you
know a colon hover you put the special
character compass onto the unsigned and
say you will get the same thing and
again if you look at the output the CSS
is generated
if you space it out and and see it's
generated the anchor and then it's
generated the anchor hover separately
and but in our theme it's inside the
same thing and that's all this simply
because of this ampersand so also
ampersand is is the this means the
pattern that we're inside of so is this
a so if we made another thing here h1 h2
h3 and we just did you know fake that's
not a name and we just did ampersand and
saved in the style we should see now I
think it doesn't like it because I've
edited that file and just close that
file a minute reopen and here you'll see
fake is h1 h2 h3 so all you do when you
use this ampersand is it literally it
replaces this value with the parent that
you're in so by doing ampersand colon
hover you're effectively doing a colon
hover because that's what we're inside
of is the a so this is called nesting in
sass and lastly the benefit of that is
that instead of saying you've got an
unordered list and you style it with
margin of zero and then you want the the
list items inside of these you don't
have to do unordered list list item and
then you style down here and then if you
wanted to be on a list with all this
time at least got a div inside you do
down here it's all this repeating ul ul
Li and instead of doing it individually
you can just nest inside and it's the
logical order so now this ally will
cause when we generate the CSS it'll
generate the classes for us that you
know the standard CSS classes but we
don't have to separate them anymore we
can nest them one inside of the other so
we've done the the theming if you will
this is all theme for now because it's
the kind of the point of you've got the
colors we can now use this theme file to
theme whatever we want then we have
we've got this is called a parent
selected by the way the term for the SAS
thing is called parent selector and then
going inside like this is called nesting
right we can do let's say we have this
quote here so in the close that down
close fonts down and the HTM I put this
block quote in now typically you want to
block quote with a block quote to have
like a left border here like a line down
it so we will add this I guess directly
to our style class this is specific
right now to just a block quotes let's
just chuck it in here and so we'll do
some let's say why shall we put this I
thinking he is fine yet so we'll just do
normal CSS again block quote and we'll
do border left is to pixel solid and
then we can make you could call a
directly here so that's picks a local
three some blue or two let's go with
that kind of pinky color and again we've
made you so that the theme but directly
in our style cluster you know the
uppermost one so this style class would
be specific to each website so you can
reuse this base system and then this is
now my specific say angel six websites
so I can still use all the theme colors
where I like by just importing the base
system and that's kind of the point of
that and then we'd also have some
padding left and remember we don't want
to have a type values directly now we
want to make use of the spacing system
so we how its spacing unique normal I
believe that was a value nope
what did we call it space yeah not
unique just spacing normal so we did say
spacing normal you can see then we get
this size here and that gives a you know
a space so one we little pointer that
you want to put a chord line there and
kind of show that you can use the
variables you know in other places
so let's do i guess one more example of
nasty
let's make say a box class that we want
to box something in so i think i've
already tagged a random thing with box
so we've got rounded box i say box so
we've put this paragraph now got a class
called box so in here just do box again
normal CSS you'd have background again
what's made use of the theme coffee so
now we've got this blue background we'd
have some padding again making use of
the spacing system put some normal space
in them now you can now see even though
we've defined spacing normal and the
left top right and bottom padding should
be the same you can clearly see the top
and bottom are bigger and that's because
a paragraph by default has padding
already at the top and bottom so what we
can do here we can nest inside of box
and we can say the direct descendants as
we went through in the CSS video that
there's children directly inside a box
if there were paragraph then we will
make say the padding 0 and I didn't work
it's not the padding as it's the margin
come on
margin and there you go now you can
clearly see you've got this same
appearance outside so already you should
start to see you know things a a
matching in terms of space and they
start to look correct and you know
that's where as soon as this website
grows when we start doing things
sticking to this spacing system you know
really helps it's that's just another
example of nesting exactly the same as
what we've done just so you get more of
a feel and again you can always look at
the CSS and take a look at the fact that
makes it look like it's nested just
because it indents but if you put a
space along and tab back in you can see
it's it's creating the standard CSS and
doing that for us you know doing
the longer winded versions of CSS before
us then we have let's say we want to
make a rounded box here we can use
something in SAS that's called a mixing
and it's pretty much like a function
it's not a such a function because we'll
get on to functions in a minute but it's
it's similar to a function so in order
to style with box and let's make rounded
corners we would have say rounded box
and I guess we can we'll jump to another
function or another thing in SAS just
now it is easy to explain say you wanted
to have a rounded box that is kind of
again if we make it similar to C show up
this is like your base class and this
wants to now implement the base class
you answer and have it from box and
simply add rounded borders to this style
so again in CSS there's no way to do
that directly you'd have to kind of make
both of them the same up here and do you
know rounded box and give them both the
same name and then in rounded box below
separately you died your rounded borders
but again rinse us so we don't need to
be messy we can simply say this rounded
box extends so you type in X at extends
or at extends brother and then the name
which is dot box and a semicolon and now
this will and have it all of these
styles and now we can simply tag on the
rounded border to that style so you can
type in border radius and I say let's do
the spacing normal again and you can see
here we don't have the rounded border
and this is because this value is
because it's not mainstream CSS or so
cheese you know as new features get
introduced then you have to you know the
comma autumn and get a deed or all that
this one will work because it's fairly
modern we just changed the class to
rounded box in the HTML you'll see the
rounded core
but when it's a certain thing like these
for the radius as they get released in
order to support all the versions so
like you know certain versions of ie or
older versions of Firefox or anything
like that they have what's called a
vendor prefix and that allows each
browser developer to you know implement
their own version of this with a
specific prefix so instead of typing
border-radius
technically to support all the browser's
you should offer bend a prefix so you
should have basically - and a WebKit
which i think is apples and then you
should have - Mars for Mozilla which is
for this Firefox and then you should
have - MS for internet explorer and then
finally once it gets fully released you
have your standard and border-radius
so these are kind of the specific
implementations and so know this will
work with the already supporting
border-radius
because it's fallback but let's say I
remove this border-radius that you know
this hard-coded one now that's Mozilla
one would be providing x - we should see
for Mozilla which it's not doing here
that it would go to twice the border
alias see if I can get to force that
though there we go so WebKit looks like
it's using the WebKit prefix here or is
it because of simply order of precedence
swap them around no so this is actually
using the WebKit prefix hi I'm in
Firefox yeah I could have sworn Mars was
the Firefox wrong so the point I'm
trying to get across here is basically
when new features and CSS come out if
you start seeing things like this WebKit
and then a named Mars than a named MS
than a name it's basically called a
vendor prefix so in order to use any
features that are fairly new that
haven't simply become mainstream for
many years yet you should technically do
this for everyone and you can see how
much of a pain this is again you're
repeating effectively all you need to
say is bore
radius and a value and you repeating it
four times and you have to do that and
CSS so in SAS so we can get around this
by making effectively like a function
and they call it a mixin and it's to
pass in what you want so we'll pass in
the word border-radius when i passing
the value and then the mixing can go
ahead and effectively make us all four
of these so we first look at the
outputted CSS you'll see the rambling
board has got what we tie it which is
what we expect but now we want to get
this done through a mixing ad where have
we gone style so to do this because
there's a lot more places you need this
vendor prefix we'll make a mixing so go
back to our base system here and add a
text file underscore base mixing or
mixing is because give me many of them
CSS or SCSS include that in base again
and then to drew in mix-ins
to make a mixin you do at mixing and
then given the impact of a you know like
when you're making a function in c-sharp
don't call it vendor open and close make
your curly brackets so again very
similar to see job if you want to accept
any input which we do here well then
what we need two variables so dollar
sign for variable call it property and
again this is just simply defining two
fields two properties going into the
function if you will and we've give it
this name called property can be any
name you like and then one more call
value and then in here let's close these
others down so what we want ultimately
is this let's copy and paste this m
first so this is what we're after but
the difference is we want to the way
we'll use it in here the way we'll we'll
call the mixing or add the mixing you
ask include and then the name of the
mixing and we give it a name vendor
so in here it would be @include vendor
open and closed and then now it's
expecting or rather if we simply delete
the properties first to show you this
running so there's a mixing called
vendor and we simply include the vendor
mixing so we save the mix in save the
style and then look at the CSS you can
see it's in here so it's done the same
thing if we did like you know times 2
here then look at this you can see is
now you know twice there the value so
all we've done is first moved it out
into something called a mixin and then
pasted this CSS and it ended up getting
included in this that's part of the CSS
but the difference is we want to use s
for any property so not just
border-radius
so the variable here the thing that's
going to change is this border radius
that's all we're doing we're repeating
that and pre fixing it with WebKit miles
an MS so one of the things we want to
pass in is this border radius as a
variable so we'll cut out the border
radius and when we place it will first
bring in a value all we expect something
called property now and then you you
think you just use it kind of like you
normally do with a property or a
variable you type in property like this
but this is kind of a special use case
we want the value of the property itself
to become part of the name that were
defining in CSS as opposed to being the
Barry you know trying to set the
variable itself so to make use of a
variable directly is a name inside we
use what's called what did they call it
I think it's interpolation they call
this one there will be hash and then
curly braces around the whole thing and
this really removes the quotes from the
property of the string so the property
is going to come in like border radius
not because we type it like that
simply because it's coming in as a
property and the type is defaulted to
string it comes in like this so what it
to try and do would be to do - WebKit -
border-radius you know like this and
that's obviously not valid CSS we need
to unquote if you will we need to get
rid of those quotes so it becomes what
we originally wanted which is that so
this interpolation basically wrapping
the variable inside this is what allows
us to make use of the property we passed
in so we copy that and you'll see it
used in a second remove all the
instances of where we type border radius
and replace it with the variable
property and here it's the only one so
we replaced that we save that and it
fails now because now what I pass in a
property so and here we'll say border
radius and save and then we go to the
outputted CSS you can now see it's got
WebKit border radius same again but now
the difference is let's say we didn't
want the border radius and we wanted the
what else is a WebKit specific thing how
do I make any help say test and save and
then the CSS now we'll say WebKit test
Mars test MS test and test so all's it's
doing for is repeating the you know
that's the variable and it's gonna
prefix it with the vendors which is what
we need to like say do certain CSS
styles that need vendor prefixes so
finally then we want to also pass in the
value and it's gonna be included so
let's change I'd like to border radius
the other valuable is obviously this
spacing normal which isn't necessarily
always gonna be Spacey normal it could
be for you know any other property so
we'll just pull this form value and then
paste that in there and then we expect
another property called value we save
that we go back to here and now we pass
in border radius 15 pics we'll say just
for now to get it building you can see
there's the border we save again gets
larger
then we just changed that back to now
the space in normal so you can see
that's now allowed us to create a border
radius with this value but instead of a
just coming out as a single property
like this it gets exploded into adding
all of the vendor prefixes so a mixing
is similar to a function but basically
it's even then guitars a bunch of CSS so
this is the bunch of CSS we wanted that
will get included because we typed
include into this class that we're in
but it all simply replaced these
variables inside of where we make use of
them inside the function so it's kind of
like a you know a variable it's always
it's always adds the CSS to always adds
what's in here to the class when you
include it but it simply replaces the
variables inside one last thing we
should do to this function to make it
more usable though is say we had a board
of 80s you can specify a top bottom left
and right so you should be able to do 20
pixels 10 pixels 50 pixels zero pixels
to specify you know a different size
like this but you might also have an
instance where the thing you're passing
in because it can be any CSS it could be
I'm trying to I can't like I've taught
me how to unload use it but let's say we
have a background I mean this might I
want slowly learning you never of a
comma or in fact you might be able to
have commas and it still work but the
point is if we were to put commas in
here like this for whenever it's a name
then it's not going to pass in because
it's expecting one variable you know one
one value coming in but why have we need
a comma in our actual variable that
we're passing in so a trip to allow that
to simply pass through an addict to you
know dump it out here regardless is to
put three dots after the variable name
and this place allows any number of
variables to come into the function then
and you can see it then basically dumps
out what you typed so it allows this
kind of pass-through of comments and
what it does is turn it into a list of
values so that on our four values so
inside here you could say value in order
to access the say the second item ten
pixels as it comes in now this is an
array if you will this is a list it's no
longer a single item and everywhere it
hits a comma it splits it off so this
would be the first item the second the
third the fourth so in order to access
the specific you know item in that list
you say enth and then open parenthesis
close and you want the first item say
and there we go we have the first item
in you know the specific thing so we
don't use that directly now but that
simply allows this kind of behavior in
future when we need to pass in some
values to a CSS property that have comma
separations in them so you won't
necessarily understand that bit yet but
that's all the doses kind of like the
params in c-sharp so if you ever done
sort of public class or not probably
class probably for function string a and
then you've done kind of params and
passed in multiple so you can you know
pass in as many unknown amount of
properties into the function this is
kind of similar so now even though we
say value it can be multiple values and
it'll simply dump out when we do this
I'll dump out all of them in a comma
separated list which is what we want you
know in those instances so that is
mix-ins again you'll see is using them
so throughout this series will now be
using you know sass all the way through
so this video is going to go through you
know as many parts of sass as I can
think of and to be honest almost all of
them done and then as we now go through
and make this website I can briefly talk
about there
you know what I'm doing like I'm just
nastiness inside of here or I'm just
extending this function but this video
covers them all initially so you can
always jump backwards and if you wanted
to know what a mix and was you can go
back and look at this video so this is
probably gonna be more of a useful video
once the future videos come out in the
following weeks where you can start
using it as a reference back to sass but
there's not much in suss at all and so
there's a few more things
I'll cover one more I think and then the
rest are really they're not used that
often and you can adjust will either
just cover them as we go or I'll do it
another kind of advanced video that
simply covers the the advanced topics so
we've got a mix and let's make one more
mixing so a good thing is where did we
put the anchor style it was in theme
wasn't it so we do this hover effect
that gives us this kind of hover color
and you can also do this keyboard tab
being supported on your side see how I
can tab so I ordered those kind of drugs
and selected text and press tab on the
keyboard
it's just dotted line appearing around
that's for certain situations and
certain ways of browsing so we'd also as
well as Harper you typically have style
for focus so do understand
focus and save and now if we tab you can
see it highlights a column even on focus
so when you're doing like a hover effect
you'd usually pair it with a focus
effect as well so you what I tend to do
is call this focus for you know focus
and hover so in order to do this again
without having to write and call on
hover and call on focus and then your
caller you can do you can kind of make
this part a mixing have you will the
thing that you want to include content
so this is a specific way of selecting
focus and hover so instead I'm going to
repeat yourself every time you want to
remember this we want to turn this into
a mixin so we've got that for now and do
at
include and then we're going to call it
hopeless and then instead of doing like
we've done before which is open close
parenthese and close like that we're
actually gonna make it look more like a
function so we're going to say include
hocus we're going to pass it in nothing
but then gonna open and close curly
braces and put the the content that we
want in there so now inside of a mixin
how do we access this you know the thing
that we want all we're doing is
replacing the selector so if we go to a
mixin here and we do mixin and we'll
call it hocus and here we'd want that so
then this is now this section here we
want to include whatever is in here so
this you access this part of the mixing
by a special prefix art of content and
if we save that and save this a still
got an error undefined mixing hocus
pocus hocus mixing theme mixing that's
not undefined we do have the mixing in
here as well don't we yeah
it's a steam trying to access the mix
and we simply need to include it here so
yeah because we're making use of the
mixings and the theme we need to include
the the file there as well so now you
can see we have this mix and used in
this way and again just take a look at
the CSS and you will see here that it's
basically done that same thing it's
converted the the @include hocus
basically we place that with this
because this is you know the mix and
when you include the mixing all this
gets replaced so you call us include
hocus and you can effectively
think of it as less gets copied and
pasted into where we've said include
like this and that the content gets
replaced with what the content was like
this so that's kind of what's happening
that is replacing the you know the
content with that value so it's still a
mixin but also we've shown there is that
you can use app content and then inside
of the include instead of passing
parameters like we did here well it's
you know pass parameters and then a
semicolon we've done like open curly
braces and passed values in and so you
can use them in many different ways and
we will we'll make use of them as we're
making CSS but it just makes using CSS
easier and cleaner and at first on a
really small scale like we're just
starting out you might think well look
it's all this now we've got a base class
palettes mixings font settings themes
all this lot to boil down to a CSS file
that's got just this in and you'll be
like well into easier to just write this
CSS and similar to code like when you're
doing mvvm and you do we know the
concepts where it seems a more work in
the first place for small output the
benefit of this is not for a really
small CSS file the benefit of this is
when we have 2,000 5,000 10,000 plus
lines of CSS which you will and now it's
organized into a decent structure that
we can add comments to because we
haven't added comments in this video but
we will you know going forward and it's
all structured and clean and you can
flip through it and you can make use of
variables so the benefit of sass is
gonna come as we now use it going
forward but I really just wanted you to
to get straight in with sass to not be
afraid of it's not think I want to learn
CSS first you if you watch the CSS
basics video you know enough and all you
need to really know in order to then use
sass because
sass is just the CSS but it adds these
abilities like variables partial classes
and importing them mix-ins which you
kind of like functions you know it just
adds features to CSS so hopefully this
video has been useful at this early
stage
but really I needed to do this video
first because the next video I'll show
you some software that I've written
again open source free anyone can do
what they like with it called DNA web
engine and you've seen us in this video
doing the sass thing and having to run
this and basically this DNA web engine
I've got will then not require you to
install suss you can simply run this and
this will as well as doing the sass it
will also allow us to move on to moving
this HTML into a dynamic system where we
get the same benefits so we can do like
includes and variables and functions and
everything else in HTML so kind of this
the point of why I've made this DNA web
engine is to at first I was amazed that
nothing even existed that I wanted so
there's this kind of the systems out
there that trying to add dynamic
features to HTML but they're all in my
eyes they're not right the you either
use their way of typing or you use HTML
they don't really just look like HTML
and work nice and have all the features
like sass is good because it's still CSS
you still just type in CSS and you're
replacing values where you need them but
all the HTM outside didn't really have
anything like within my eyes everything
that they did was wasn't close enough to
HTML I didn't feel like I was writing
HTML and simply adding the benefits so
that's why I made this DNA web engine so
we'll use this in the next video we'll
then add this kind of sass style dynamic
features to HTML and then we're ready to
go we've got a web engine that's going
to generate our HTML and CSS content for
us we've got all the structure set up
and we can start actually making what
we'll do first as made like a responsive
grid system to get the whole layout
ready for and you know do like a grid
system and then we can get into
designing the real web site and we're
going to pick back their website to
design
and go to completion with the whole
thing and then after that we'll move
straight on to this server which is
asp.net core they'll serve the facetted
word application so the series should
come along fairly quickly but now we've
got all the all bothered DNA web.html
stuff for the next video we will have
all the base training done and we can
rapidly progress with then making the
website so again like say hopefully this
video is useful I'm sure it'll become
more useful in the following videos when
you start using CSS more but it's
important to do it this way around and
to you know keep things organized
any comments again leave them in the
video and I'll get back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
