terms of creating generic classes in the
last few videos or you may have just
heard about them in general a generic
lists or just generics and wondering
what they are so I thought we'd step
back and actually explain them now that
I've used them in videos and some of you
might wonder what they are so it's just
create a console up and dotnet framework
just so we can create some and do some
examples make a spread it so generics
you well I'll show you what your notes
are first so just create a class here my
generic class there's a regular class
all the generic class is because when
you do these angle brackets and you put
say a letter in there or a name in there
in for everyone so it's like defining a
valuable so I'll just call this T which
is there the classic generic stun to
type I guess generic type same as when
you do a for loop you tend to put and I
just become standard so T is the
standard thing you do with generics you
just you know we don't name it and now
inside this class I could define a
public say int my number and then here
let's remove this first so it's a
regular class right now and we can make
a new version of that and you just
define a new class like that oh give it
easy and name so it's not a special case
so there's a new class and we have a
number which is an integer so to make it
generic I'll get to the reason why you
do afterwards but to make it generic you
do this angle brackets so you put a
variable name there and now you can
change this integer to be a t so it's of
a type that we basically know nothing
about this class doesn't have any idea
what T is but you can now create a class
and use that so now in order to then
create
new instance of that class you also have
to provide the variable here but this
time it's the actual pack so let's say
int and now we've got to see and then we
do see doc NZ we've got my number
it's actually returning an integer so
even though this class has no idea what
an integer is it can return one and then
in a similar fashion we could do a
generic class of billions and then see
to my number it's now a boolean so
that's what a generic class is so let's
explain a little bit about I guess why
why would you ever pick to do this and
this is just one example of many and the
hardest thing with generics is
explaining the reason why you use them
to me it's it's like one of those things
that's really basic flexing why would
you add two numbers together it's hard
to explain so I think the simplest way
of explaining is if it's anytime in your
code you have any logic or data or
methods that should apply
similarly put to multiple types then you
want to use generics so let's say we
have well the classic one is lists which
Microsoft have already done so you'll
see me use a equals new list of strings
and now that will make a little bit more
sense to you because now you know lists
we press f12 you can go in and look it's
got a generic so generic list which
implements a generic interface of an i
list and then inside the list using this
generic T live we turned the type when
you do the indexer when you add you
specify the type you want to add and
then we implement that so there's one
use of the generic class and let's just
make her own plus course my list or in
this case let's start without the
genetics and show you why again so let's
say you have you want to store a list of
numbers so you just have say my number
list in this case let's be more specific
my endless and this would be say in get
number and the point of get number is
going to accept a position and we're
going to have say a private and then
we're going to try and user an on list
here so that's already a generic but
let's just use an array them
so my integer array and numbers equal
and again simplicity just to prove the
point which is making you array for now
just first make a six number array and
the function get number wants to return
basically the position in that array
that you asked for and then you'd have
you know a CAD number such as a public
boys add number you passing it in
because it has to be in in and you'd add
the number so in this case you wouldn't
to this so let's just change this to I
know we're using generics here but
doesn't really matter inside this is
just again to prove ur the basic points
of your so we've made a number array we
wouldn't even need that now we can add
so in the add number you'd then do M
numbers dot add number so they can add a
numbering ingat number let's just check
that works so boss numbers equals new
lion list number start add one two three
four five and then while in fact let's
make it a bit different so that you
don't get computer to get they could do
say number stock get number at position
three and then you can just write out
the console
and make sure it doesn't close and if we
run that we should get number 30 output
to the screen or 40 while they're having
a zero-based index so we've asked for
position for effectively because we've
done obviously a zero base index so
we've got 40 now if you wanted to say
you've got a list of strings that were
storing you know some information and
jermel's or some maybe text the only way
you do that you will also want to be
able to add a string and get the string
it copy and paste a class and you change
it to my string list and now you go you
want a list of strings and the list
there and then add number would be AB
string say and this enough to clear your
string this is up to be a string string
rather an inter-school position and then
you could do just a string rename this
so you've effectively just copy and
pasted all of the code of what was going
on in this basic class to add a number
and get a number and now we could do all
this over again we could do strings
okay a b c d e string list string well
then you get the number you could get
the strings and you'll get 40 and then
whatever the fourth one do is we get the
letter D this is going really slow okay
what's going on there I just didn't see
it so cut that out so you get 14 D and
you can see again this is this is the
basic example of something that could
happen you wouldn't necessarily just
have a list because you've already got a
generic list but the point is you've got
repeatable logic you've got something
that you want to do in this case add
numbers and gap numbers or add strings
and get strings it's effectively a
collection but you want to be able to
add specific types you know you want to
make sure you string list contain
strings only cannot numbers so you can't
go and add say a number to this list
because the class knows you can only
accept a string so you get the compile
time error and that's one of the main
benefits of generics as it can be tapped
at compile time when you're compiling
the code of those issues so this is what
actually happened in the very early days
of darkness before genetics is if you
wanted a list of strings it up to create
a string list of eminent list and a
boolean list then all the functions
would have to repeat themselves and
there's multiple things you could do to
try and overcome that and that was
either to change this list to an object
so that anything can be added and if you
did that then a B let's start objects
you could only return an object because
you don't know what the list contains so
then this would just become
my list say and this would just be list
say your wanted numbers here
you could add numbers but the problem
with an object now is you could add a
string as well so that's one problem now
your list might not be numbers if that's
what you expecting okay so you can add
anything you like the other issue is
then you'll get number in this case
returns an object now as you can see
returns an object so if you wanted to
then do I want you to get to say the
first number and the second number and
times them together so you do that
equals get number first one this is the
second one and then you do result equal
to F times G because the two numbers and
you can't because you're trying to now
multiply two objects so then you have to
cast them two integers node you can cast
them this way to an integer and that'll
then times but the issue is let's say we
got 0 1 2 3 4 we've got the 5th index
I'll quite happily compile as if there's
no issue but if you now run this it's
going to crash on this call because you
can't convert an object to an integer so
you wouldn't know about this issue until
you run your code or until your
customers are running your code so this
is not really ideal this way of just
doing a an unknown type because there's
no there's no limits and there's no
nothing stopping you're doing bad code
so generics come into play to the make
this list of true generic letters type
Safet
so that you can't do this and you don't
have to do this we can then do a generic
list that just simply accepts a time
that we don't know of and inside this
you can create this list and then we're
also going to access the type there and
then we're going to get there and we can
now return the type there as well so
everywhere we had object within replace
with this unknown type of T
and then in the list we can very
explicitly say I want it to be of an
integer and now this won't work because
it knows so we get rid of that and also
get number returns an integer anyway so
this doesn't need so now we can create a
list that's got all these functions to
add and yet and whatever else the worth
of type integer and now we can make one
of a type string so you can now do a
string list and then you can just do a
list to dot and I know it says numbers
is again just an example but now you can
add a string and you can't add anything
else so that's the point of generics for
the most part is taking in specific
types when you create the class not
inside the class itself so this class is
unaware of what type this is but it can
now provide all these functions but it
knows what to do anyways it nodes
doesn't matter what this object is you
can still add it to a list inside itself
and you can still gather the object you
don't have to know anything specific
about it in order to do these functions
so that's sort of the main use of
generics not the one you've seen mostly
and Marcus Lee that's the one that's
already defined by Microsoft would like
lists and sorted lists and linked lists
and you'll see you got collections as
well you've got dictionaries that I've
also got generics and you can see you
can pass multiple types as well it's
just like defining a variable so you
could have a list that backs up to one
thing and another thing another thing
and then create you know a list that's
got the secondary type in them you know
you can do what you like just think of
these as defining variables inside the
class or types of variables that you can
then use however you want and you don't
know anything about them so that's one
way and that's the lists now real world
because it's never never useful to just
show kind of pointless examples so if we
open you've been following along with
videos making facetted awkward what's
going to take a look now at what we did
and why
so in the word application we've got a
login page and this login page has now
got a viewmodel binding so we're binding
to an email and in the background to do
that we would have had to for this login
page we would have to then do let's
start data context which is the thing
that the page is bound to equals new
login view model we'd have to set this
data context to this view model now for
every single page in the application
it's going to be view models so if every
page we make the register page to login
page the settings that shaft you name is
every page is then going to have to have
a behind code that says this data
context that then defines a view model
this way and then if we were to change
this or make it more complicated or want
to do anything custom there's
effectively the same for every page it's
the same and different because it's the
same you want to set up a view model for
the data context but the difference is
the view model is going to change the
view model can be different but there is
a similar type that this is effectively
a view model and we want to set the data
context so what we did was use a generic
base page so we made a base page which
you already had and all this information
doesn't really matter we've made page
load animations but what we did is then
passed in a generic variable name if you
will a generic type and we called it VM
and then we made a public property using
that type VM I don't when we get that we
simply just return a private property
that's the same type and when we set it
we basically set the value and then we
set the data context here to the view
model and again this base page doesn't
know anything about the view model it
simply sets the data context when we set
that property and then because we've
also passed it into the when you create
the base page it's aware of this type on
construction of the base page we then
say well in this case there must create
a new view model let's set the view
model valuable to a new VM so let's make
a new instance of this unknown type and
then when you set that view model it
effectively sets the data context so
then by simply using
while inheriting the space page and
saying the type of login view model what
that does now inside this login page as
we get access to that view model from
the base page it's already casted
forwards if you will it's already
unknown type of login view model because
no plastic there so we got full access
to the login view model that we can then
get the email from and anything else and
also the data context in the base page
constructor has set up our data context
to this view model and new version of
this so this is an actual real world use
of a generic and your mouth is here this
is where you need specific information
so if you just passing VM there's
nothing known about VM so if I remove
that you'll notice now we can't do an
equals comparison because it knows
nothing about the types so you can't
compare you know a view model of an
unknown type with a value of it affects
the same thing but that's still the
comparative itself you can't just do an
equals one you can't compare it's the
same so to do that you do where the name
of the valuable a colon and then with
comma separations you can define things
so I'm saying the VM has to be a base
view model or inherit from it so we try
to then make a base view model of say
mint this will complain that an INT
isn't a base view model so we'll do one
a compile anyway so it's failed here I
don't want to jump over to my fails list
okay me ever list is a bit broken what
you can see here partial declaration of
logging patterns we've got to match the
touches so but let's make this easier to
make another plus here to show you that
publish class a and we want to base pay
each of integer and this should now
complain that it's that there we go the
typing cannot be used as type parameter
VM is a generic type or method base VM
there is no box you nor the moon from
end to base view model so it's
preventing us from defining anything
inside the base page there isn't a view
model because that's the purpose of this
so if you find it as a view model by
defining it as a view model because
that's a class that we made it's
effectively an object so now we can do a
comparison on the objects so our
comparison here is now okay and then in
order to create a new one of it so in
the constructor we made a new VM again
we need to tell it this actually can be
nude up so we've defined that it's
something that you can create a new
instance of and it's also of type based
view model so this is a constraint of
the generic but you can see this is an
actual again a real-world example this
is a this is something we're making that
will work and is completely made for its
purpose and generics have solved the
issue of having to in every single page
we get set up the data context and then
obviously that's like spam to be much
more useful because now we can do
anything on the view model we can
validate it we can do anything in the
base page that is universal to pages
that want to then make use of a view
model so that's a real-world example
where we've covered the where clause as
well in terms of you know defining a
little bit about what the VM is I've
mentioned it can just do you know
multiple parameters that get passed in
and that just is what it is you pass it
another one you give it another name and
then you can use it inside here just the
same you can do what you like with it
you don't have to pass one type and a
real example of that would be a
dictionary
so if we did a new dictionary and you
can see here there's a key and a value
so you can have a dictionary where the
key is an integer and the value is a
string and now the dictionary is generic
you can get the keys which are integers
and you can get the values which are
strings so again inside the dictionary
we just press f12 you can see then the
views of the value which strings when
you're doing a an indexed to get the
value it returns the value type and when
you add in your pass in a key and a
value so again hopefully that's fairly
obvious what they're doing they're just
making use of it as if you order normal
valuable and then another example would
be where I'm about anything in this
application yet because we've got that
far both what we will do is when we
start having to communicate with the web
server and the web server itself for
doing this chat application the web
server is going to constantly return
some data so everyone to ask for the
latest messages or everyone to simply
send a message and get the response or
if you want to log in all of those
things are going to be returned calls
from the website and every single call
from the website for one we want to know
if it's exceeded for two we want to know
we didn't succeed what's the ever
message but then thirdly if we did
succeed we then want a specific piece of
information the data about that message
so if we send a message and it succeeds
we want to know okay well what's my
message ID so I can then add it to the
application and reply to that or if I
log in and it succeeds then what's my
authentication cookie so I can now save
it and then I can login successfully
afterwards so we basically all the web
calls every one will be different but
the similarity with every single one of
those is that you need to know first lit
succeeded and if it didn't what was the
error that's that that's a shared common
thing between every web core and that
will look like this so let's say we have
a public class API
we're response and that's a class and
you can have a boolean if it succeeded
and it also have and we didn't succeed
you have an error I don't know if it did
succeed you know on this unknown type of
response so you can do an object and do
a response but that's that's nasty
that's just you're gonna have to unbox
an object which is slow and you don't
know what that type could be you could
accidentally try and cast it to the
wrong type so I could then say some
pseudocode and then ask for this
response so this would actually call the
web server but for now woods making new
API of web response let's say the server
did that and it said yeah it was
successful and the response was the
number one and in our code because the
API web despondence has just gone object
when we want the number we don't have to
do response or object or this response
of response it have to do say is that
pass it has a part in the response and
then that's your number object to string
oh yes it also have to get that and then
cast to a string or you could simply
presume the types correct and actually
unbox it directly so this would work if
we run this with actually be able to
unbox this number but for one let's
unboxing takes time and it's inefficient
but we've got the number the major issue
is say we've just called this in code
and this was to get a message and the
developer seems to think it's a string
for some reason okay you know can quite
happily compile and now you've gone
exception so the this chances have
accidentally manually casting things
wrong as well as the fact that you just
simply don't get intelligence you don't
see what type is and then when you times
this by a hundred different web calls
with a hundred different responses it
gets nasty so you know who generics and
simply duty as the return type say
and you can call it T response so you
know it's available for the response and
you say the responses this now in here
we have two hard define or expect him so
then the API manager that you make that
makes these calls will in advant tough
to specify I expect this to be an
integer so now the rich server would
return say this this response and then
here we can't cast it to a string
because it isn't mod and circle and we
no longer need to because it's return
the integer so now you could have a web
call here let's say asking for I don't
know guess number of friends and as we
turn the number and then you could say
there's now also a web response that get
my username and this would then be luke
and you can now reuse this web response
in the client and also the server do the
same thing and then you can even share
in a call library these responses as
interfaces so they can share the exact
same interface and make sure that
they're always returning the right
things and again that's another
real-world example and this can be a lot
more complicated than that as well you
can then do custom logic on say
returning error codes in here and then
handling error codes and all the code
then for every single web response
becomes shared in this class this class
can handle all of them for every
response you have to keep checking every
single different web response the only
thing you care about is once you get the
response the client could first check
that the response from the server is the
same as the response were expecting and
if it isn't it could set an error of
itself and you see where I'm going with
that it's all it's all about again code
reuse so it goes back to the same point
that anytime you've got the same logic
or the same methods or something that
should apply to multiple different types
in this case the response then you
should use a generic and then obviously
fill out all your logics that isn't
generic and then at the point where you
need the generic yet you insert it and
so that's just another use again these
are these are hard things
to explain or give real-world examples
about where to use because for one
they're not overly used there's no like
there's no huge amount of times you need
them but in terms of usefulness you
imagine if we didn't have a generic list
then every type of list you wanted in
c-sharp which you use a lot you can list
the strings or esther classes or west of
anything you'd have to create a class
for everyone so even though you don't
heavily use them when you do use them
like this this is now saving you
potentially a hundred classes that you'd
have to make with a hundred different
responder times with a hundred different
well-armed similar pieces of code for
doing the logic of successive era and
then have you changed that code and you
weren't using generic and say you
realize there was a bug in the way that
you detected a success it does go into a
de 200 classes and fix that code so
hopefully that's a been a good
explanation of genetics again I find
that's hard to explain because to me
it's just sort of natural and one of
those basic things that you always find
hard to explain if it is so basic there
we've got any questions on it or
anything is unclear just leave a comment
and also I've just changed the code
color to black background to maybe stop
people's eyes hurting from having a big
monitor with or white space let me know
what you think about the color I can
always change it back to white just let
me know you prefer the dark dark theme
over there the light theme so also that
was useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
