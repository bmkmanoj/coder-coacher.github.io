page UI so we started with making the
chi-wai which is right now just plain
you know static text there's nothing
really done there's no binding there's
nothing there so in this video we're
going to make this actually the real UI
with editable text and things before
that for those following along video by
video I want to stay up to date I've
done a small well I say a small ticket I
did a video on repairing these framework
animations and they just turned out to
be long-winded and very boring so I
didn't bother including that but all's
I've done really is just fix the
framework animation or did two things
wanna tidied off see to this framework
this animation slide indirection enum
and this was a guy on YouTube that also
commented on the recent video of
suggesting why you know I hadn't done it
as way in the first place and to be
honest as there was no reason I simply
overlooked cleaning up the code because
we originally just started with more
animation so I started by cleaning up
the animations so now there's just a
slide in slide out its x and out of the
way and instead of having a slide in
left sliding right sliding topside in
bottom which is simply now pass in the
direction share all the code and simply
do this a little bit per direction and
that cleans up the animation a lot then
I also added a fix it was basically one
fix that turned out to be a decent
amount of work but in short these the
mistake I made was these properties
animation based properties to turn into
specific animations and then do do
animation we were setting or we were
checking as an individual variable
called already loaded or first load have
you remember and the problem with that
is this class is actually shared between
multiple
controls so multiple elements on the UI
so we bind as a fade in to six different
elements it's going to be this exact
same copy of this class so the original
value what we had which was it's a
single boolean if one element loaded and
was set to first load is true or rather
first load is false on the second way
around but then the next element loaded
it would say that it's not the first
load so it was an issue with that so
what I did instead was made a dictionary
and linked in the boolean to the
specific UI element and then set the
flag per one and that fixed that issue
and then the last issue I noticed was
what would happen is we'd say we are all
we loaded and we're not so we'd come
into here we'd wait this five
milliseconds and then we'd do an
animation but then what happen is would
fire this value updated it would be the
first loaded coming to here set it to
false then the value would change before
this five millisecond had ended to say
another value so then I come in here
this was didn't match and it comes
straight to do animation so it had set
it up to the correct value but then five
milliseconds later that old value kicks
in and animates to the wrong state so it
was also to fix that issue and I'm not
going to bore you with you know how a
fixer
it's simple enough fix and if you look
in the peseta word commits and just look
for this fix animation property bugs and
you can see the code added here in
exactly the changes so if you want to
scroll that just do that you've got any
specific comments just leave them in the
video and I'll answer them but I didn't
want to waste a video on just that
because it's a fairly boring thing it's
basically a bug fix so there's I didn't
want to do a video just on an animation
bug fix stuff that will need font or
simulator for the icons for the button
so we'll leave that open for now so
that's the framework animation stuff
fixed and then if we run this as you
mentioned we're now going to do this
codes let's get into it I think the
first thing looking at this the more I
look at it of other quick glance between
that and the preview we did I think this
wants more spacing and I think those are
ones be slightly thinner still
just to tweak that so let's just open up
the settings page first settings control
and let's change the width down a little
bit so I think this 700 a little bit
much to right on the edge so let's just
bring that in a little bit more that
looks more realistic then let's picture
margin as well I think I'll just bump up
a little bit so it's try 2030 yes go for
that nice big space in let's have a look
Alex much nicer now just I think you
just needed that space normal space
these out more in a minute as well but
the first thing we want to do is to move
these right now these are just in a grid
all dumped in and all individual things
and now when we get to one thing to add
hover over and edit effects it's going
to start getting messy so we want to
create a another user control to host
all this basically a label a Content to
button per one let's start with first
let's do the simple stuffs get all the
bulk work out the way we know we'll need
a view model let's go into the view
models one one the core view models
let's just tidy this up as well at the
minute just make a new folder call
application just for general application
wide and then we want a new folder
called inputs I guess for the text entry
because we'll have what's called input
will have more entry fields a lot like a
password one and we'll have potentially
other ways being input from the user
they'll make a new plus we'll call it
text entry view model it's going to be
for any kind of text entry we put it a
copied a existing view model but also
want to do is inherit the base view
model in this case so it's just and how
it the base view model view model for a
text entry to a string value now you can
see this new that's one thing I didn't
fix I was gonna so you can see this new
one's already created the default
constructor for us because I can also
call the public because I added the
default configuration file that again
and all the YouTube comments
showed me where to go to tweak this
start up I can't remember top my head
now but it'll be in the last video we
should also edit this I don't like this
namespace constantly be in the folder I
should tweak the
and templates I don't have to keep
deleting that as well so we've already
got the constructor is ready commented
so we want public processes now and we
want labeled which will be the name
username password that's the label then
we'll have I guess original text because
you've got a bear in mind we'll have the
tactical mes plus the text that starts
getting edited in case the cancel and
you want to revert so you need the
original and the edited current saved
value edited text and connect apparently
not a word
then non-committed that desire they
okayed non-kinetic seems like the
current non-competitive text we've got
the original text the edit text label we
also need a flag before it in editing
mode on/off and I think that's it for
properties now we want some commands for
do things we'll have the obvious one
first edit command and this is going to
put the holder put the text edit put the
this will control into edit mode then
we'll have a cancel command cancels out
of added load and a save command commit
the work connects the edit and saves the
volume goes as well as goes back to a
non edit mode now let's create those
commands and here so click command
equals new relay command Eddie
now we've got canceled save a little new
region for command methods put the floor
and left heading node up couldn't be any
simpler editing it forced crew simple
and type in the word crew correctly
there we go public void camp so again
it's just a simple editing those walls
and finally the save so in here we'll
have to do to save the content which you
have nowhere to save any content yet
because we have no server we have no
back-end storage but it's all the
plumbing that's now done ready for when
we do have a so once we were saved with
them go out of edit mode as well so now
we've got the action here whenever we
want to do anything to save that we can
plumb in later so I think that's the
view models for the text entry done
let's make a design view model as well
I'll just copy another one for the
minute
paste it in and this will be text entry
design model
that will inherit the text and preview
model it's actually got the wrong
description compared to the other design
models it should fix that for the
message dialog line as well we just
which one are we in here the name the
same we need to be careful here so we
named this class first because it gets
confusing we name the file rather click
the comment fix the singleton and fix it
instructor it's now in a text entry
design mode we are label so we'll do
name original text will do name and
edited text to do editing I think it was
it for the three values and then editing
by default is false which is fine
there's our design model for it so now
we've got that we can make a control for
that but then also in here where we've
got this grid of currently four items
these want to be view model bound so in
the I think we've got a set into your
model already oh yeah so in here we want
Shawn
texts and review models this one will be
named the current users name and then
I'm aware that right now we're doing a
text entry for a password again we'll
change that somewhere to the login
screen we'll make a password entry
viewmodel
with you know current and previous and
things but for now we'll just make it a
normal one
you got username password and email so
there's the four properties we can now
bind to and now we want to create a
control so we will need to start with we
go a little the longer job now start
with a new folder here and controls
called
import make a new user control call us
text and create control then in here
again hide down a minute we'll get rid
of the controls and inputs namespace on
both of those get rid of it here they
put a blur and I should add it this
template as well like I did for the
other one really now we just build to
make sure this builds I always do that
one over add a new control first just
make sure it builds before we go any
further so we have a buildable control
now so this control wants to be the zoom
out it wants to be a control /
item so per row so right now the way
this is all done it's not really going
to work so let's just get rid of that
profile details it's in column 1
there we go that's gone and then we'll
fill this back in once you've got the
control so let's just save that move
over so starting afresh the first thing
we were messing on our controls from the
screenshot was the gray on the line so
we know we need to start with the border
to add that so I'm a border where's a
board of brush of AA set of dark and a
border thickness left off right and the
bottom will have 0.4 so this is our and
grade from the line now in there we will
have again the label the text box an
edit button so we need a grid filler
we also want to background on it so
we'll of the foreground line and at the
background foreground lie and we will
want three columns of it or want the
label the text box in the bottom live
grade column definitions common
definition with Auto for the first one
the middle one with the text editor come
fill and then the end one can be the
remaining that would be label name
balloons that one will expand
I'll do one side up so let's put in the
actual text block now the label bullet
mark in text can now be all we need to
bind this actually first so we want the
design-time binding remember I can never
remember what this is
static local where is it just local
static local text and free design model
dot Val you see that I think I might've
got it right forms and then divides that
we have something called label so will
that work notice it's complaining about
that oh it's not that it's in core and
I'm going to define X amount in space
for because it's in a call library now
it's complaining about that so what
exactly sneak building nope okay so
that's also nice three I mean I could
just look this up I always forget the
design time data context else I've got
it like typical go right there I just
that's instance not value there we go
now we have name which is the label
value so we'll good there we've got the
label in just start with that let's also
just remove the width and height so it
just fills to whatever size we need
bring this over
then we'll have the we'll also have a
label here because we're going to have
two things here we're going to have the
content and then we're going to the
editable content as well so the content
is going to be a text block again text
of original text on the grid top column
is one so it goes in the other column
then we will want I guess looking at it
we need some padding in these two so the
first one we'll put some margin let's
just get some spacing around so K looks
a bit high on that looks about right
we've got some margin there on that
control I live same again here need a
bit of margin actually we also need
vertical align by the police because
things are going to be in a different
order let's just do vertical lines
Center on both and then same on this
control like some margin will do 15
again
okay closely matter what that is so
let's just leave up there and then we
have this wants to be
like it let's be bolder there we go and
then we'll have a button actually we
need the Edit content as well so for
when we do go into edit mode we will
need a text box and that will be text is
edited finding edited text same for
exact column one as well but huge
let's change that down fun family an
American family different font size
regular that's better they can see the
slightly misaligned as you can see all
these aren't quite lined up with unless
just put original text for them and so
we can align exactly the same text so it
doesn't start messing with the let's do
for just the padding first to get that
right down so it's closer to the line
which is not showing but there's a line
you know the blue line let's remove that
now let's just tweak this margin until
it hits so we'll start with to see what
10 does we're going to need to do this
individually to tweak each one so the
top left top right
let's bring it in close let's not move
in now okay so that goes over there now
I need to swap that need to be more so
that's not far off I think I'll be fine
with animation you can see we've
actually got the wording spaced out more
there because it's a different font I
think actually you know what I think the
issue is here this content needs the
font set explicitly we mentioned that
the font is not always exactly right
unless it's specified explicit or we
could just quickly spin this off and
take a look at it in the real the real
view so this will be text entry control
this will be tricky even a stackpanel
first there's gonna be a bunch of them
and thread comm is one let's just run
this and let's just see what they look
like in terms of where they're
positioned because I think we've just
got a bit of design time oh yeah let's
put it as a design time binding we need
to change up to full binding for the
minute again so let's just do data
context is four rather let me just do
that so buying this one we're running
so you can see it's actually we need to
shift back up a little bit and I think
that's about it then we just need to
shift up slightly let's change up to ten
let's run again so you can see this what
visual is not exactly perfect to how it
really runs the design camera is
slightly out and I'm pretty sure let's
do two fonts so let's move the loop
slightly back so that M blends in a bit
nicer so we'll leave it at la that's
close enough for when we fade because
the that text in the little fade out and
little fade in so you're not going to
see it exactly like that anyway so it
should be okay there so got the label
the Edit box a content box now we need
the buttons so we're going to have
multiple buttons here again up there
Eddy button initially and then the other
two buttons afterward so let's just make
a grid then let's have bridge rock
polymers to bottoms container really
adding button and then we'll have
the text on the edit button content in
the schedule took three dots clearly
need to remove from a lot padding or
margin so it's got padding down
I don't quite trust this designer to
remove all margins a minute as well so
the margins are still it's a bit big but
I'm sure like isn't there just try
running that again I don't fully trust
this designer knowing it's slightly out
yeah that looks way too big let's reduce
the font size as well for a bit of party
man then we'll have whole family font
size let's get small still looks too
high
oh I know we're stretching out a new
vertical line Center that's what was
going on there we go
does it looked a bit long for a big the
padding was that looks quite nice so a
quick run of that maybe we've got might
want to reduce the border radius
slightly maybe but I think other weeks
that looks okay actually I want to
change that color to gray and then we
want to start doing some fade animations
and binding things correctly so let's
change the background color to
foreground dark there we go we'll come
back to the other buttons after and or
yeah because you want to start getting
this fading in and things and working
correctly so the label is a label the
Edit content which is here we want to
have animate fade in so we have the
animated fade in property value and then
we want to
by not to that editing so we should run
that now we should see a that's
disappeared until it goes into edit mode
we don't see it so that's now got rid of
that this once a hand but nothing for
this I don't know just so it's an
obvious click I think just as a little
emphasis that that's a click so to the
button cursor hand also we can just bind
this button now to forget with this
commands now so do this to the edit
command and that should actually put
this into edit mode so what would happen
is the Edit box should fade in
usually that's faded in now but we also
no need to fade out the label behind so
to do that animate fade in again on the
content and put that top but the
difference is the content we want it to
be the opposite of editing so it does
make a new value converter such a copy
and paste that we name this to boolean
invert converter converter that takes in
a boolean and invert it so we can simply
have in an exact opposite and just
return not a boolean value I am assuring
these functions these methods into the
quicker way in our short - one of the if
the just returning a value you can do
the shorthand that looks somewhat to
making the properties but it's it's
still a function it's simply there's no
need for the curly bracket so just keep
saying shorter so now I have a boolean
invert converter just a matter that we
don't use and we can go to the content
and then the converter of this
I think it's badness - static are too
many different ways of doing this until
remember converter just local
in 2000 roads at dot put on the back
again was it just the name of it
so should just be left thinking let's
run that and we should now have the box
on show and that should fade out in the
other one should fade in there we can
tell now because we can select and then
we now have no way of canceling another
minute so let's just quickly tweak the
text entry view model I just change the
edit command to toggle between troubles
just so we can test the UI
so now we have fade in fade out fade in
and that looks close enough that it's
the nice transition and now it becomes
editable fewer annoying thing as well
for one we need to change us back to the
edit text and not bind directly to the
well we'll leave it bound for now what
we want to when you plug in that really
you want it to focus and select this box
words like that so let's make a few
attached properties to do that go to
attach properties they are um framework
element button attached base attached
property text attached properties could
be taxed because it's mainly used well
in fact it's pretty much exclusively for
text so and here we'll have copy and
paste this one focuses keyboard focus as
element if true and I'm going to call
this focus so similar to the S focus
that focuses on load or simply use this
one to focus at the values true so if I
have a dot new value which I'm guessing
is not get here so if the boolean if
it's true so the new value is true focus
less control and you simply do the focus
itself so now we can just focus the
property if we pass in or rather if we
add and edit control local call so we do
local focus prop it up with value and we
we burn up editing then basically
whenever we go into editing mode it will
focus this text box that's the theory
till we click this now we go what ends
them in focused the other thing we want
to do was to select text as well not
just focus it so we will go back to here
make another one on the other than will
do too will simply combine them focus on
select you can always make a separate
one and select full text in this almond
of cruel focus on select focus and
select now this will need to be a set
box maybe possibly a text box base what
keeps a text box for now because
otherwise we can't do the Select tool
which is part of the text box in fact we
can see where that's part of what text
so we just see where this select all
live with f12 and the outer is in text
box dates so at least we can change that
the text box and base and anything that
has the Select tool we can use this on
using primitives that's fine so we'll
select all the text now we change it to
focus and select property we should now
have when we click the button it will
focus and highlight all the text which
is the way I think we'd want it to work
you can tweak it to just select if you
like or to do what you like but I think
it's that's what I'd like to do and then
just tap in your name that's coming
along these buttons we don't want just
on show all the time either these
buttons wants to well dis button rather
wants to be only shown I think on hover
so I should to add that now so in the
grid itself and make sure you've got a
background otherwise to hover won't work
so in grid glass over over social button
this will be grid triggers and so look
it again copy and paste let's find some
triggers where we already do this which
is an opacity it's close enough and
that's a control template actually it we
double animation I think be probably the
best thing find so we have an event
triggered that does a ask just go for it
just copy this close enough we'll figure
the rest out so in the triggers paste
this event trigger mouse over want one
animation third one then we have two
duration name target property we know
wants to be taste of T target name needs
to be adding button which we need to
then name the button your radiation will
be one second just to see no pasty on
however will go to one so fully visible
copy that
taste that go to zero on leave and so
now we just need to name the button edit
button and by default to make sure it's
invisible before any of the hover
commands kick in
now you're here and on hover there we go
now that's a little bit slow so there's
a speed that animation on steel point
for say
and there we go that's nicer so now we
hover over the cliff we cancel
that's the hover for that so now we want
to get the buttons themselves so when
you click this you want this button to
to fade out and then you want to show an
edit and a save or other cancel and a
Save button so let's make the first
let's make the Eddie button disappear so
it's going to be the fade animate once
the fade away with the content so copy
the same command paste that in there
I've pasted it just below that so now it
will fade out when we're in editing mode
and then we won't be able to exit edit
mode because we don't have the other
buttons but we'll see it hopefully
actually fade out so when they aren't so
the issue we've got here as well is we
can't have this fade in on here because
we're also using a trigger to check the
opacity and this fade and also tries to
change it so we need to move this we can
move it into the bottom container and
that's going to contain other this will
have to be the container for that Eddy
button only and then we'll have put the
other buttons in another one otherwise
they will fade out as well
so because we have the and this
animation working on opacity that tries
to control the opacity as well as the
animation was trying that's rather
buttons weren't hidden when we spoke
last time so we put it on the parents so
the parents controlled by the animation
and inner buttons controlled by their
triggers so now there we go so they're
not visible there and then your hovered
on the visible and now clicking there we
go and now it's completely gone so this
is now one we want to show the save and
the cancel buttons so we're getting
there we're doing this a lot quicker
than I thought we would so we want stuck
counters you've got two buttons just
columns to same as the other orientation
will be horizontal cuz the side by side
and then we'll have the donut which way
around save button the button we want is
to fade in with the addict so the same
as the edit content so of this button
fade n I just content yeah just for now
let's just we'll change us to the font
awesome content afterwards why am I not
seeing the button
I'll be just the edit mode let's just
hide that minute so I can see if or not
we'll see negative yeah that's just a
run see if we can see the button
yep the design is just messed up a
little minute there we have 90 hours to
work so we can work with the compounds
it's like say we'll tweak this
afterwards we want when we press Enter
wrong as default to true so we can
simply type and press ENTER and it runs
a save so the commander won't be bound
to the save command the background wants
to be green so if I get a positive color
padding similar again to the last button
nice and short vertical line Center and
then for small there we go I've liked a
lot of small Save button so paste that
back in for the visibility copy and
paste for the cancel button to the
counter bottom I can put an X for now
finding the same as default wants to
change this cancel but escape button
when you press escape on the keyboard to
cancel out this will be the console
command background will be so that word
orange is like a negative color and I
think that's if that's just run that and
see we should be sitting area the Eddy
buttons faded out for hover that's why
we can't see anyone so hover over we see
those click and it's more padding there
but you can see we've got two little
buttons that should cancel and also got
padding issues that it's growing
shrinking growing shrinking but these
should now be triggering the well sort
of hands on those you should be
triggering the actions
so this button wants a margin of say
five to space out those the Beaufort
cursor:hand and then we had issues with
when these buttons were visible so let's
just fun fact yeah
the padding was just too much somewhere
so as we or was it the buttons this
check of it was the buttons format need
to just remove a long margin fireball
around last zero stop zero right five
bottom zero just want to push out the
margin on the right let's just remove
the bottoms are men and let's see if we
get that jumping down let's figure out
this the text box or the buttons that
have got the extra padding I'm pretty
sure it's a text box so hover over no no
for the buttons of the buttons are
adding not sure I'll have what the
buttons seem to be pushing out the box
large room that they don't feel so
something slightly off there because
maybe we've got you know why are they
because it's the same as
go up into here up there let's change up
2.5 so then I get likes point 4 yeah I'm
not sure why this is growing because
they don't fail anywhere we've got to
zero out the margins on that button
because by default the button style has
a margin so that was why just make sure
that margin is zero now we shouldn't
have an issue with it being too big
there we go so now we get an ax hover
over to edit click fades into an
editable text box click the close or
click to save and we'll put those button
images to some fonts or some icons but
also let's before we forget to change
the Edit content back to actual edited
content edited text and let's also make
sure that when we go into edit mode
change that back to normal and also set
that edited tough to be value so
whenever we cancel out of edit mode we
expect it to go back so basically I set
it on the console simply whenever we
come to edit we'll update it with the
latest current value so this is edited
text equals original text go edit mode
so now if we edit some text and then
type and cancel and come back it should
revert to the original value which is
there you know the behavior years expect
so change it cancel I think from the
scraftman it's the same so that's what
we want and then we could simulate the
Save button here just for kicks this
won't also save anywhere other than in
the RAM but we could say
original text equals edited text and
then go out to the mode and that's the
not really saving but it's obviously
committing it's the view model so in
memory it's it's matched and this is the
affected gear so you'd click in here
you've gotta cancel reverts clicking
here type save and it saves so so you've
canceled that's the box working and I
think we just tweak these icons now and
then I think that's I think quite happy
with I think that's everything done
there so we've got the cancel the save
and the hover effect so let's just fix
those icons so what do we want for you
want like a tick for the save all under
the gun actual save okay floppy disks a
little bit retro thing for the Save
button that's it
tick or a check maybe whatever the call
in it must have there we go yeah fhx oh
oh oh see so we go to fonts copy paste
font awesome
yeah I'm going to call it tick and it
was out Oh see so we can change the and
where are we the Save button content
will be that and the font family will
now be font awesome
so now we should have a check button for
the save
there we go and we want a prop across
them in this case little font or some
cross and know how to do not search for
I also leave the other than cross so see
we didn't spot it guess it bit clothes
or cars or maybe alloy wheel clothes so
could be instead of see don't really
have that doing no so that's the tech
clothes
and that's there we go however a
nice-looking UI in fact let's change
this dot dot dot to an actual ellipsis
as well which I think we've already got
and that lease the old match and the
wall
nice-looking icons who that's not too
good
okay let's put a a bit more padding on
that button because now it's oh no
that's the wrong way around that's right
it's a vertical one so we only have a
vertical that's just okay let's go on
get there is on poor lapses so one for
one let's call it ellipsis one for one
there we go that's massive so a little
dot for editing you click you have a
technic Lowe's tech now works and like
it's only in memory but the whole
application keeps the same instance it
actually technically immersive and well
they're apps running but it again will
do that properly will save to our date
to store and we have one black gives you
an idea of making this quite complicated
but quite neat user control that's
completely now view model bound and all
you have to do is bind the values and
you can now have a so you can present
anything to the user to to save out you
know edit text so I think we'll leave
this video here next video we will make
the will basically change these values
in the settings you model to be the
actual ones name username password email
and then we'll make the password box as
well so that we can see the password so
we'll do that in the next video
hopefully this was a bit more fun video
we're back to doing some I'd say bit
more exciting thing about this user
control I really like these little
buttons and keeping all the effect
except thing it looks nice
so hopefully you enjoyed this video
another one will follow soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
