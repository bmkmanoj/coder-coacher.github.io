window so we've got our own icon in a
nice white style and we just press f5 to
compile and check that we have this nice
window we're now going to change it
slightly so the first thing you want to
do is your login page
so I've gone ahead and done a Photoshop
mock-up so we got like a nice blue
background with some emoji icons I've
made this little word icon and then
we're going to do this sort of sign up
page here we're just going to do the
initial page first no back end code
doing anything no animations just get
this static page ready because that's a
big enough job in itself so you can see
I've remove the line because the
background of this app is going to be
this blue background all the time and I
think the drop shadow just looks a bit
overkill so we're first going to remove
us so we just go to this window you can
remove this drop shadow row definition
in this grid the main window content red
so just remove that row then if you go
to your drop shadow just remove that
completely and then we just want to move
the page content now to Row 1 because
there's no Row 2 and then just press f5
and make sure that's gone
there we go we've never over to that
line and the drop shadow then the next
thing we want is this background here so
you don't now work in directly in this
window the window is the main container
this is now a page this is a login page
so we need to create a new page so we go
to solution Explorer right-click on the
project
add new item and then in the search of
the top just type page and run the page
WPF pull us the login page keep it out a
minute we'll make a new folder and call
that pages res the application grows I
think already got a folder called pages
include I'm going to add the login page
to the pages folder now the basic page
let's just shove a button in so you can
see something else in it so I've got a
big test button so we know that's the
page and then we need to load the page
into this window so in the main window
we need to go to the bottom here this
grid and we want to add inside the grid
a frame I'll give it a name of a main
frame and then the content you want to
bind to current page because that's
going to be the page that loads and now
we need to actually add back to our
window view model so the current page
we're going to have as an enumerator
first so let's just create a new folder
called data models and then we're going
to start holding data for your existing
things that aren't view models actual
data like in this case a page so you'll
see as it grows Wireless is needed sort
of application
Paige and then it's going to be an anon
and you can have one page for now the
login actually this is a page of the
application so just got a any number
which is the drop-down list of URL so
you've got options it's going to be a
login now in the window view model we
want to create something called current
page that we want to bind to here so in
the public properties we will add
application page problem page to get
second one for now of the default it to
login so will now be bound to this
application page but the content needs
to be a specific type like a page or a
URI or a web address so we need to do a
value converter and we've done value
converters in previous videos we're just
going to add I don't like the way that
we used to do value converters which is
to create the value converter first and
then in a resources style so like in one
of these files now through our
converters and you have to add a key
just like you do with fonts and things
so you create the font and add a key
whereas value converters you create a
code file and then you end up adding a
key as well so we're going to do it
slightly differently so create a folder
called volume converters and I've got
one here and then in that value
converters folder we want to add a new
class and we'll call this base value
converter and this is going to give us
the ability to reference value
converters directly instead of having to
constantly define them in a resource
file as well so onto abstract class base
value converter it's going to be a
generic
time so we can fashion a specific tag
and then in order to access it inside of
sam'l directly instead of having to use
this resource we're going to use what's
called a Markov extension and that is
the same as when you type like static
resource or binding things that are
their markup extensions or things inside
that's the curly brackets like that
so we'll override that in order to
provide that ability and then it's a
normal I value converter as before as
well so nothing's changed there it's
still just a value converter implement
that interface let's give it some
comments and then the P as in the
generic tamp was passed in it needs to
be a flash and it needs to be a newer
bolotoff we need to be able to create it
and then these don't need to be run one
week I'm struck we want to leave this up
to the actual plaster and how it's the
base to override comment leave
I'll do for now
and then we just need to implement we
need to have a reference to the type
itself a static reference for the
converter five years for personal so
whenever we then use the value converter
in sam'l will effectively be calling you
know getting the static implementation
of whatever converter we call then we
just need to override the markup
extensions provide value which is what
happens when it tries to actually get
the value in sam'l and for that we just
want to return the converter and we Cody
exists every doesn't then we want to
return it what we want to make it a new
version that's right now I want to be a
new a new converter the tab is passed in
so this is just like creating a new
instance of whatever tab we pass in and
setting it to the static value and then
either way we return so this little
one-liner is sort of saying basically if
I'm converted equals null then it's a
new T and return and converter so this
is effectively the same as this this is
just a a shorthand way of doing this
statement so that's all what does that's
all the first base view model needs to
do in order to now be able to just
create view models in code and not have
to add them in a resource file so let's
just finish cleaning up this class
as a base value converter now we want to
create the actual value converter and
this wants to be to convert the
application page enumerator into an
actual application page so this caller
application page value converter and
then this time it's going to override
base value converter and it's you're
passing it down type so that the base
knows how to create a new instance of
this we then need to implement the
abstract class and to do that was it
simply switch the original value which
is of a type application page by default
if it's an unknown page we'll stop the
debugger so that if you're debugging
your code you'll you'll hit this
breakpoint it will actually break for
you because we know something is
obviously wrong if we're not then it'll
just return no page and if we have the
login page will now just return a new
login page and then this is the logic
now whenever you switch pages so
whenever the view model changes the
current page and you could handle things
like restoring pages from memory and
keeping a you know a list of pages you
can do whatever you
once here but for now this is a nice
quick and simple just a login page
creates a new login page every time it
changes to a login page and that's it we
don't need to compare back so that's the
application page of value converter so
now in order to use it for this content
here you just say converter and instead
of doing your usual static resource and
then having to you know find it from
that way we can now just read a local
and you can see that application page of
value converter and it's found it that
way it's just complaining does not your
list let's just see if it's happy to
compile but you should be yeah it's
nearly compiling so now when we open
this frame is the main content it should
load the current page from the view
model which is set to login and then the
login should fire the value converter
which will hit this and then I'll come
into this convert and it should load
this login page let's just press f5 to
run that we get here press f10 every
turns a new login page then you can see
the test is now loaded so we've now got
a page that's loaded inside the window
so that's the value converted on we've
got the framed on it'll also notice now
because you want a blue background we
don't want this border anymore the inner
content border so let's just remove that
from the new model
in a Content padding we just want to
change to nothing just remove the
padding or in this case new fitness zero
and then that will allow the effectively
I will background the blue background to
to fill everything right to the edge and
then the final thing you'll notice are
just a little bull I spotted the last
time you maximize and you can try and
drag from the very top we've got the
resize border still so you can't drag
from the very edge you have to come in
by the six points so we just want to
update the resize border to take into
account the same as like this borderless
so you simply want to say yeah and it's
going to be returned borderless it
because nothing otherwise it's six and
that's it so now when we maximize or
when we're bored less in any way you can
now drag from the very edge just like a
normal window would so that fixes that
little issue so we've done the view
model changes we've done the value
converter for the loading the login page
and now one more thing we want to do on
the window is this welcome friend we've
now changed to this little logo so and
then this background we want to add as
well map so let's do the logo first so
just go to the tile now the other issue
with this title is you can see here
these two chains this is the actual tile
the size of the title are the text it's
not exactly centered because you've got
a small icon here and then three buttons
here so to get this perfectly Center
instead of it being in column one in the
center we're going to change it to
column zero and then we're also going to
have a column span them to basically
span all three columns
so now you can see the little change
with the very edges so now it goes
through past these buttons and
completely expands so this is on
perfectly Center so that's going to get
that Center and now we want to change
the actual text so we want to change
this text block of header text here to
our word logo so to do that we'll just
do a stack panel and then inside that
we're going to be test lock and because
we want each letter of the text block to
be different we'll do a run inside so we
want to make the font family first to be
bold which we don't my house what's
going out back quickly go to the font
copy and paste the regular call it bold
quite bold here well we're in here we'll
also add some font sizes so we wanted
gobble and we want key and we'll call
the font size regular and we'll start
using standardized values them so on
font size regular font size small
absolutely 14 large security we can
change these afterwards double need
system add in so I'll just press ctrl +
dot and that offered me this zamel
namespace to get added for me and then
it put it in from so let's just copy
that between the three so we've got some
font sizes now we can use and we're now
going to leto bold font so we want the
text to be late so bold and now inside
text block you can do if you want to
style different parts of the text you
can do things for runs and run text the
word w foreground color and again now we
need some colored adding so before we
can do this let's just jump to the
colors
now copy and paste this one we want
another Greg for this gray here sort of
the faded gray so we'll call that one
foreground dark and that call it a thing
for a number right leads Beedie Beedie
Beedie foreground dark brush or round
dark so I've got a dark color and now we
want the four colours of this logo the
orange blue green and red so the key is
going to be call it word blue and blue
is three oh nine ninety five I think and
then we want the brush flat as well so
that's the blue color orange green and
red we won
there are angels f f/a 8l the red is and
was the red pepper for seven for seven
just slightly off your red and then you
want a green which is a oc5 for one
we've got some colors layer to use now
the W we want to be orange so that's
just going to be word our ink things you
there's a W on the Ord and doing the
more capital you want blue red and green
and obviously you could just import a
logo from Photoshop as an image if you
want I just figured do it this way to
show you a new way of a you know making
some custom text and then you'll see the
spaces between that's because we've
actually got spaces here so this that's
white space here ends up being here so
once you're happy with that simply
delete the white space basically put
these runs all in one big line so it
doesn't look nice on the editor you get
this big long string but it does good
enough we now know it's there we should
have bold font it just doesn't show up
in this doesn't actually dynamically
loaded that and then we just want this
by Fassett Oh written underneath and
that will just be another text block and
text by successful and
foregrounds want to be a dark brochure
think and then we want to align it in
the center and there's that we also know
need to set this text size the font size
for this so the word logo is a specific
size instead of just going 50/50 and
fitting into the view the font size will
start in front 20 let's use the new font
size font size regular and it looks a
little bit small we'll see what that
looks like and then we'll do just a
little margin we want to bring this for
Seto closer survive zoom in on that a
minute you see this big space between
the Fassett oh and the word let's just
add a negative margin to the bottom of
this word so for that you just add a
margin left right soft and then bottom
will do minus 5
and now we're going to brought the
Fasano closer we're now right at the
very edge as well I think we might want
to add a little margin to the top and
bottom but to be honest you can just go
all around that's brought it in flood
them with too bad let's see what that
looks like
press f5 so I Felix fact I've got a cool
a logo now let's actually just cure saml
just our font with the colors so we've
now got this this title pretty accurate
so I'd say that's that's as accurate as
we need it there that's pretty cool and
now we want to do this login page so
we're going to put the background on the
login page for now I mean we could put
it on the the overall background which
actually might do that my plate on the
window is the background and yeah I
think a royal
so first let's add to the images folder
create a new folder called backgrounds
now go film that I do this
yeah I created all the folders in
advance and then include existing item
and if we go to resources in the git
repository from them backgrounds you'll
see I've created this emoji background
it's just a transparent PNG so we can
style the color whatever we like and now
we can use in this border let me use a
border background background I'm going
to then user
I think it's an image brush it with tile
mode set tile and the viewport units set
the absolute to the size of the actual
image that we want to tile and then set
the viewport self
and what we have a lot about I think
it's basic zero zero five from this 500
yeah so that's like a 500 unique wide
for the image so the original images one
and a half thousand pixels but I'm a
good size will be about five hundred
units for all those icons and then
they'll tile and repeat themselves over
and over image source is images
backgrounds I think it's called in those
you background got PNG we need to set
the or we need to wrap this in
another border so we can do a background
within a background let's put that
border inside another border and the top
borders background can then be the blue
color which let's not work
for some reason sir hello this so the
content presenter end up flat round
after maybe the content presenter is
going to override it not going to be
transparent let's just check it's open
the pages login that's just horizontally
aligned this so it doesn't take up the
full width and then run and let's see if
we can see the background behind this
which I think we should I think the UI
is just not going to show or not so
maybe we have to set the background to
some pound nope
okay so that isn't going to work that
way we've got a background on this
content and again oh so now we'll just
move this out so just get rid of that
leave the content presenter and we'll
figure out a way in future to put this
inside the content presenter the main
background so for now let's just chuck
it in the login pages background so
let's get us over here and then similar
to before we want to now do a border of
the top one the background wants to be
the blue color on this bottom and then
wanted grid for the rest like content
you can put the background on anything
so I'll put this image background letter
repeating brush on the grid
Megan see we got this a emoji background
so if we press f5 you should just see
that now is a nice blue background and
there we go and you expand and it just
carries on tiling that gives us just a
nice looking form and I thought we'll
have that as the main background to the
whole application
it's just that I'll figure out a way to
put that in the the main window as
opposed to the login screen but for now
it's fine there so you can see where it
is so we know about the background so
next thing we want to do is the sign up
we want to start putting all this
content in so this is going to be a
border first the main outside part but
we also want to run actual the entire
screen to be scrollable so if this was
too large the content of this login was
too large wouldn't be able to scroll so
start with a scroll viewer to keep
everything else inside of change the
visibility freak toppings are also so
they don't show all the time and now
inside the scroll viewer we want the
stat panel to start stacking things down
we want the stat pal to be this though
this the whole content we want to align
horizontally Center and vertically
Center so in the stack panels properties
will have vertical alignment Center
horizontal alignment Center we want all
the text so every piece of text we put
in we want to naturally Center so we can
just do that with let's presume it's all
text blocks which is for the most part
all of them text alignment upper center
so this property will pass down to any
text box inside of the stack panel I
think that's it for now and then inside
that we now want to do this white box
which will be a border with a corner
radius similar to what we did with this
window so I'll have a border for the
background static and it's for Graham
light brush corner radius will do about
and then we want padding inside to give
this padding to these don't come right
to the edges you'll do some padding yeah
we'll do what should we do we want the
big one here at the top so matters I'll
have that padding to the border so say
about 50 and then put like 15 around the
edges so left 15 tot 50 right and bottom
15 then we want one to set the width of
this I don't know what it's going to be
right now it's just surface a 400 at the
minute and then we want to margin so
it's away from the blue if he does get
to the point where you drag this off to
you know a small window we want to keep
at least about a 50 point border around
all of this so you see the background
all the time so you want to do want it
all around except the bottom because you
want this text at the bottom so this
will then Pat out afterwards we don't
need a big you know margin below the
white box because the text go in there I
think I'll do for the border and now we
can see the border now let's change this
to something more realistic zoom out a
little bit
and they can see the white box there's
nothing right now so you want this sign
up tap next
so we'll just do a text block okay
sign up font size want to be large using
our new font size that we created font
family I will have a regular social
slightly thick and then the foreground
we want to be the blue color see what
that looks like
doesn't look too bad he looks about
right
and now we want this text below here we
could always move these into styles like
header styles and stuff but for for twit
mess for this rule won't bother with
that for now
so another text block this kind of text
it's about to get fun the last and addy
instead of sex and so I was like
complaining that
childÃ­s at more than once we're going
to border we can't be in a border for
that we need to put a strap panel here
zoom in on this a little bit so that
needs to be a lot larger and the right
color so that will be font size regular
there we go
I just need to fix the color and for
that we'll use the new foreground brush
we made and there we go there it's about
to get fun sets which again looks pretty
accurate
we should probably comment this is the
white box
and then this is the signup header
signup the subtext hey what do we need
next we just need the two text boxes so
the two text boxes now and then we'll do
a style for this so that'll be their
username and password the password will
change to a password box booked we're
going to leave the password box until
the next video which I'm going to do
about attach properties because it gets
quite long-winded to do placeholder text
so we're going to save the password box
till another video but we'll style it as
you know the same for now and then we
need to be important so then this next
button you press f5 let's take a look at
this I know it's not styled fully
epaulettes check all the elements are in
there so we've got the signup page we've
got the scrollbar when it gets to small
which I think we can reduce that width
it's a bit wide and then when you go off
we can't get off because it's past the
minimum size but you see we keep this
top and bottom a slightly smaller at the
bottom of the menu some more space at
the top but when we add that text that's
going to shove off let me just need to
style these text boxes now and the
button so let's just shorten this width
slightly change up to about 3:30 there
we go
this is email password next button and
then outside of the border we want to
put the text below which is actually
going to be a button so it's applicable
so it says I already have an account it
looks like text but that's going to be a
clickable link so we'll make it a button
and then we'll style that again I
already have an account and we'll ask
the style when we've made one so right
now it's a button we don't want to go
full width we want to well actually it
doesn't matter to be honest you can well
yeah we don't do forward let's do Center
same for this next button you don't want
that full width or style that because
it's not full width it's just you know
cut off there and so horizon's'
alignment center that's about button
well let's get down to styling this so I
think that's the login page done we'll
start with some simple ones so we'll
edit the buttons so again we'll zoom in
a bit we're going to edit this next
button and so let's first click there's
a way to if you're styling there control
the buttons a specific one because the
text inside of it has an issue like if
we do font family and we try and make it
bold and you'll see it looks bold there
but when you run it's not really bold as
it's done is put a faux bold on and then
you see it's gone so you can't actually
set the font of a button content
directly so we're going to have to
override the buttons template to allow
that so instead of just creating a new
template for a button and losing all of
the current styling you first want to
start with the the entire template of
the regular button then twiki to suit so
we want to make two styles we want one
for this orange button which will then
become the default for all buttons so
just right click on this button it can
be any button in the UI
edit template editor copy let it add to
this document - just click ok that's
fine and then it's adding it to this
document and we're just going to cut the
whole control template out so this is
the default button template I'm going to
cut that away
delete the resource go down to the
button and delete the template for this
sati does there and now we go to our
bottom styles and we minimize these
others I'm going to add our own style so
style target size is a button based on
the H style as always first our new
style this will then become the default
for all buttons yeah then we can do
don't need anything else and now if we
go to the setter make the property
template set it up value and I'm paste
in that control template it can remove
the key and now there's the default
button so we've got the whole default
button template so all this is done now
is created a new a new style that hasn't
got a key so this will apply to every
button that's effectively like a copy of
the original button in WPF and just to
prove that we've got that let's just do
set a property background value red and
there you can see every button has now
got this default style which is the
original style as well we haven't lost
anything so now with that original style
we want to change just the things we
want so the background we want to be the
orange color we've got let's do this
orange
the foreground wants to be the white
going get rid of the border so the the
border that allowing the buttons just
change the thickness to zero that will
get rid of that see how we're looking I
think starting from piles let's try and
build because it's usually updates
pretty there we go so you see we've got
the white text the orange background we
now need a radius around the bottom
we need this nice curved radius to do
that we need to look into the actual
control template here's the border
around the bottom so bring that down and
then let's just add to this corner
radius of say 10 there's a little corner
radius set the back up to here we want
the font size it's going to be used a
large one I think it is build
yep so the font-family for good measure
and we're going to have the regular the
slightly bolder font now we need some
padding in these buttons it keeps going
back to the original style to separate
you should I close that text was to the
edge so let's just plug that out we want
quite a lot of padding left and right it
looks nice on the buttons to have a bit
of space so we'll do 50 on the left and
right 10 on the inner and then we'll
also add a margin around the button top
and bottom by default so that when we
place these buttons in they're not going
to be all squashed up you know to
everything else it will add that to the
actual button I think that should almost
style just like the button in the photo
shop so go to press f5 and take a look
at this that's not bad we don't want
this blue cool this is the windows
default blue you'll notice the font I
was mentioning also hasn't gone bold
even though we set it to regular which
is like CEQA so let's fix the text and
let's change this hover effect to be our
blue this blue background so let's do
the where are we see the text first so
right now those content presenter well
because the buttons content could be
anything you don't have to set text in
here there were always it does upset
text here but we are going to our button
style is going to be text just for this
example so we're going to completely
remove the content presenter just change
it to a text block for now so we don't
need the content presenter name which is
also reference here let's remove some of
these additional my toggle check to
don't care about is pressed we don't
care about mouse over sure I don't care
about that and we don't care about a
border anymore so just remove all that
content template we don't care about but
we do want the content
in this case text wants to be the
content don't care about the format we
don't want the focusable well horizontal
alignment matches margin matches remove
vertical matches so now we want to set
the actual font family that wasn't been
set before and that wants to follow the
template bindings font family so it
picked this one up and I should fix the
boldness of the the font so let's check
that and there we go now we got the bold
foam that we wanted let's fix this half
a color so we've got these triggers here
onmouseover sets the background so it's
pretty much already set up sets the
border which is this one here this is
the background color of that border and
we just replace this with our and now it
just there's an issue with visual studio
the intelligence gets lost inside of
triggers for some reason so we just copy
this word one here from orange and on
however we want it to be our blue let's
see if that works so there we go there's
our blues there's the button pretty much
done now you got remember about the
button style as well there's a hint here
is enabled false so we also want to
handle when the button is disabled so we
totally got the trigger ready for us
which want to change that background
color to another state for Seto I don't
know not for certain foreground dark
I'll see what I can also disable the
button to check it out let's go to this
button just set is enabled for false and
there we have the nice-looking disabled
button and I think the hover them won't
work on there okay
there's no color call but I think that
sir oops
I think visual studios got a bit
confused just need to clean and rebuild
seems to think there's a some style that
wasn't there now why is it finding this
one there's nothing there okay visual
studio is a little bit messed up so
let's let's anything do it that
okay so there's actually an issue with
enabled but that's I'm guessing pulling
in this which is aa my issue foreground
brush you don't want just the color he
need the actual brush and now we go
stairs the disable button so the buttons
done let's do this button now which is
almost there
we basically just want to change the the
hover from being you know white text to
being orange text I'd say instead I'm
obviously not having this button border
so this one is P and pull it regular
button like that you know the button
that's now going to be used all the way
through the app we will we can style
this you know over overlay the style and
replace these templates but for how
small it is to be honest we're just
going to just going to copy this
template for once it's not that big of a
style so I'm not too worried about it
being you know a new a new style of you
will will call this text button based on
button will give it a key of text button
so all you want to do for that is the
background now wants to be transparent
the foreground wants to be the line
brush which it is and the font size want
to be regular we don't take a bit of
huge from border fitness we've already
got a font family is right the padding
we leave the padding the same the margin
the same and I just want to change on
hover this wants to be foreground we
want it to be the orange color
and the disabled the foreground and it's
not the border anymore it's the
foreground of the whole thing so we
change it to orange on father style this
button with that style text button let's
run and see what that looks like so
there we go we've got that got like a
little hover text I can turn off the
disabled Phyllis button man
and there's that that's all the button
done that wasn't too bad
and now we can you know we use that
style
we've already the colors the fonts so
the only thing left now is the textile
so we want to go to the text saml and
then in here we want the new style and
we also want you can see this email and
password this is like they're the
placeholder text the watermark if you
will before you tag an email you've seen
them on most websites so at the same
time this styling this we're also going
to add a placeholder text so we'll
create a new style do the placeholder
first and we'll call this textbox
placeholder so we're not going to add
any custom style to this this style
we're literally going to add the ability
to have a a placeholder text then we'll
go override this style and add the
styling to it so that we can you know
keep those two things separate like
override the base style as always and
now the first thing we want to do a
property the border brush the color of
the border you can see we want this
underline want our blue color so that
value is going to be
the blue color in fact I said I wasn't
gonna statically I'm actually going to
style it
so ignore members going to style the
whole button and add the placeholder
text and then what we're going to do is
add finishing torture so we want this we
have this on the line we want this call
we want this place all the text things
like that is standard then what we're
going to do by default is just a black
the padding the margin little little
extra bits but we're going to add some
style or now that's in fact let's just
style the whole button like this so what
we want to do anything with that now
okay so let's just remove that let's
make this the default style my style the
whole thing so we could always change
this after if not but let's just go for
it
so the font size we want to use we'll go
with large nice big chunky text on some
padding inside to separate the text
let's just give up so you can on some
margin around similar to B button so if
it isn't squashed right against this and
again we want just the top and bottom so
it's just out of five pixels out of five
points top and bottom padding we've done
the border brush in blue and now we only
want the bottom border so let's change
the border thickness you on the bottom
so it's left start right and on the
bottom one still want so as the border
font size going on font family we want
the text that we type to be bold
so the placeholder text is going to be
light and the text with tab is going to
be like this bold text so this is the
actually text for typing this wants to
be and say bold is we don't want actual
bold regular our kind of semi bold of
you will set the font family as all your
styles
I don't know how that'll look let's just
run that and see then we're actually
going to have to override the template
now so we'll do the same trick with the
text box template that doesn't look too
bad actually so in fact that's almost
spot-on there's very little to do
whether than of the placeholder there so
go to here click one of the text boxes
right click Edit template editor copy
place it in this page cut the control
template you loot the resources that is
added delete the template it put on your
text box and then go into the style
setter property template and the value
paste the control template delete the
key and now this is the default text box
style so in order to add a placeholder
we'll get a place we're going to wrap
this whole thing in a grid because then
you can place two things in the exact
same you know one on top of the other
I'm going to place the placeholder text
directly over this text and then Harry
from the actual the Styles of the
original so this is the original
template or in fact move those Styles
out this is the only thing that's the
original text box the border and then
the scroll viewer with this special key
that gets replaced so all we need to do
is wrap that and a grid sadly original
and now as well as the original we want
to add a text block we don't want it to
be clickable because that obviously stop
us clicking into the actual text box we
just want it to be a visual so hips as
visible is false the text we want to now
we could do like attached properties and
things but for now I'm just going to use
a tag which is nice and simple so on
this text box we can use a tag which is
like a universal property used for end
we're going to just use this value for
the placeholder text that we want it to
be and we're going to bind this text box
to that value over tag we need to give
it a name so we can access it with these
triggers later so call it place all the
text or call it placeholder rather set
the font family and let's can we want to
set explicitly to thin because you want
the main text as we spoke about being
thick and the placeholder text to be
thin like that one the padding to match
the actual padding of you know the text
box so if we set padding ourselves it
mimics so that the text stays in the
same position and overlays the vertical
alignment will want the force sensor
because by default the text box does
this but it doesn't actually do it in
the binding here so basically force its
center because we know that so it always
is whereas the horizontal alignment we
want to keep the same as a template so
that whether you align the text left
center will write the the placeholder
text will follow that alignment as well
and we just want to set the foreground
color to the very job brush and then we
now need to set the visibility I'm going
to miss so the visibility to visible by
default which are actually good ideas so
we don't need to specify them and then
we just need a style
and we need to style for doing triggers
yeah we're gonna have to do the style on
the triggers so we've got Sonic type
text block yep that's right so we've got
style do style dot triggers and we want
to do a data trigger and we're going to
bind it to the text of this box and we
need to find that because we're now
inside this is a template we need to
find the templated property you can't
just use this template binding inside of
a style because we've gone from being
inside of a template to now be inside of
a template of a template so you're going
to have to use binding text with the
relative source such a template binding
so the same thing is template binding
but you have to specify it this way we
want the text in the data trigger set
the default value to nothing to
effectively so it's you know by default
it's not knowledge nothing and the data
trigger will work by stating if there's
effectively data then if the value is
this rather the value is nothing then we
want it to be visible in fact yeah so we
want to set it to the visibility to
collapse by default and then this data
trigger will fire when the text is equal
to nothing and when it's texts equals
nothing we then set the visibility to
visible nothing that's right so
effectively this text box here and we've
got rid of then we've got rid of
collapsed and the whole style and we
just run this now we should actually see
this text block with the values in there
there you go email and password but
they're always there
so we've now styled it and it's in the
right position you know it's like if we
type email it's basically directly over
we just want to hide this now when
there's any text in there so that's what
this does we hide it by default and then
we trigger when the text value is blank
so there's nothing in then it becomes
visible again otherwise it goes back to
this which is collapsed so this should
now allow us to see it by default also
we can't set the it can't be set before
yeah so you can double its visibility
here you can but if you set it in a
trigger here you've got to set the value
first so it's a little fork so we need
to set the visibility to collapsed in
the style and then we need to override
the style oh yeah so I've done this from
here this relative source is has to be
relative source and then come places
tournament so on and I think that should
work now
so there's the email and now yes it just
appears when you type and after the
password will become a flash word box in
the next video
so almost there now let's take a look at
this and compare it to this
so as the screen the actual one above
and there's the Photoshop so you can see
we've got this is close enough with your
slightly larger but it's close enough
what we want I'm getting confused which
one's the posture Photoshop now so
really we want a slight margin between
these two I think a little bit more and
we need to do some one here between the
bottom I think I yes I think it's going
to be the same then so let's go back to
here go to pages log in I just want to
make a little bit more of a margin
between this text block so just other
margin to the bottom margin and then
same with this text box after the text
box and 30 say let's run that and you
can go out and move these styles into
actual styles of your lack there's the
Photoshop and there's this one that's
pretty accurate
so overlay that and you can barely tell
the difference between the two so I'd
say that's a nice form now and then we
can if we drag up we've got the scroll
bar as well and we go maximized we've
still got the window here all nice and
looking cool
so I said sir you also see you get this
nice little effect we've got due to the
curve we actually have like a nice
curved scroll bar like a little radius
on the scroll bar due to that wrapping
that we did in the custom window and
this moves around so
I'm pleased with dialing Alex nice so I
think that's where we'll wrap this video
up then the next video we're going to do
this password box convert it to a true
password box now we'll probably bind it
to a view model then and do the
animation as well to animate the effect
of you know a peer in and fading and
going to the next page and probably do
the signup page as well so the sign-in
page so I hope this was a useful video
and the next one won't be too long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
