use of online web fonts in a web
application as I simply click the font
select this fonts this is to be using
google fonts and then down the bottom
left it's got one font family selected
your customize select which font you
want from the list and then you can go
to embed and it will show you that this
is the link you need to include in your
HTML and then you apply this wherever
you want to use the font some of you
have a swell sometimes I want to just
embed it in my own website because while
this link goes down or you feel like you
want more control over you know the font
so it's really easy so instead of
including this link you simply click the
download link which you can't see here
except for a styler on to make
everything dark but you can see this
download button here when you want you
know non-inverted click the download
button and then save the font file and
just turn back on my dark style and then
in your downloads folder you've got open
Suns so we'll extract that and you'll
see here's the fonts so these can be any
fonts from anywhere so they can be true
type fonts it could be OpenType fonts
but basically if you use it in the web
you want you know all of the desired
font formats so the quickest way now to
embed this directly in your website is
to use this website called transponder I
need to click you can select your
options here so I'll just leave them all
as default you know these three are
typically all you need for you know
these three formats to load on almost
any web browser so we'll just click Add
fonts and then it's gonna ask us to
browse to fonts so I'm gonna go to
downloads open Sun so I'm gonna add all
these fonts it will upload all the fonts
they're all done and then you just click
convert and this will then simply
convert the the TrueType fonts into the
web formats so click download now and it
will also add
a demo HTML file so we extract this now
you'll see in here it's basically
converted D there TTFN to e ot and while
format as well for every font it's made
a style sheet which if we take a look at
I just got the font family by name and
then the path to the font which right
now is the same folder and then he gives
it the specified font weight and the
style that's been read from the font so
it generates the CSS file
and this is the same as what and the
google fonts is you know the google
fonts generates the same kind of style
sheet and we have this demo HTML file so
if we just open this you'll see that
then the fonts been applied and that's
just using a style that sets the font
family just you know like this just set
up you know your font up this way so
that's all there really is to it the
only difference between embedding the
google link is instead you embed the
stylesheet will you simply paste that
code into your own style sheet and then
if you want to move these into a folder
which you typically would like say
assets and then fonts you just open this
file and everywhere there's an ill if
you do like a control h to replace a and
apostrophe and then you can do sits in a
subfolder called assets and then fonts
you can do assets /font /m replace all
and it would update all these links to
now look for the font inside of a folder
called assets and then fonts which is
just basic CSS styling so that really
has all the ways to you know taking a
downloaded font from anywhere and
embedding it into your own website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
