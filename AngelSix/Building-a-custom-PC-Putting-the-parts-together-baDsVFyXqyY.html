thing to do is open them all up so we've
got a case you can do it a second we'll
start with the big box of goodies so
just find yourself a big area to work on
I'm just on the kitchen table so you've
got plenty of space and then get a wall
packaging and then I guess third thing
to do is make sure you've got everything
you ordered so we've got one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
we've got eleven items but we have one
two three things on there are just game
codes so with your art processor nice I
seven six nine hundred K or 69 yeah five
hundred go got the SSD which one did I
buy one terabyte I've got the RAM a big
fan cooler there's power supply let's
bake everything motherboard and graphics
card you can see why we love you so get
a lot all the way and then place all
this here
and all the others saying we'll just get
this case open them out the way oh you
got a big staff each shot as well
usually off the cases so you probably
heard that on camera a bit click and
then one thing to be careful of when
you're building computers really ships
the anti-static safe or rather stuff
it's safe so you don't get that kind of
bulk to the electronics but all's I've
done I've done hundreds of machines
obviously touch touch this case before I
start working and generally yes you're
clear of stuff except some start with
the case because Leslie Sprott not
necessarily the case but we'll start
with this after we put the cooler on the
motherboard so I've seen most cases
these days but can zoom in on that they
come with these sort of easy finger
adjustable screws and then if not you've
got the head of the screw right into
here's a screwdriver and get that there
actually no I'm doing there you go
second issues a normal screwdriver them
up so you just remove the two with your
finger and then you can take off
case a la bete and then depending on
what side your job you tend to want to
open so it's facing you like this and
you want to open the left side here and
take off the other sides of this face
all this back face so you're you should
put your hand into the case and then you
know you've got the right side so we're
going to do the case in a moment for now
we'll just move that out of the way and
we'll start with the motherboard so get
all this light out get down to another
board and then the first thing you want
to do is which you sometimes forget is
to make sure you install the CPU cooler
so let's also get out ready so you want
to make sure you put this on because
there's a piece you'll see that has to
go on the back of the motherboard and
then you install this motherboard into
the case then build the whole thing off
and then you get to the CPU and you
realize you haven't got the fan
attacking on the back so again I'll just
get rid of all packaging so this is the
you'll get the backplate that will go on
the case in a minute specific to the
motherboard so we'll put on one side I
don't need is what the jumpers for I'm
typing on in the camera these a little
jumpers for the motherboard CD guide on
fan cooling they can main instruction
manual I tend to not use any of this
just remove it all out to the case then
get the packaging out of the way
you can always get the button
you need to work I like the caffeine as
clean as possible so start with this so
we have Center good working session
first so how are they around there I
would say so we've got the motherboard
and we'll need to do the CPU before we
do that sometimes you'll find at the
back here this big block is where you
need a cooling fan attachment so we'll
open up that the fan cooler first and
that's really close to it so we gotta
I'm cool doing so off-camera the name so
we've got there that'll cool that come
out of the box and those are fan and
then an instruction guide and what else
do we have these will be the back plates
so these are all the plates this is what
you need to attach so again we'll get
these down here that's like a 70 pounds
away and we need to remember what CPU
socket we had so we've got on the CPU
algae a 201 one so in the manual to the
CPU cooler there should be a page
somewhere and you can see face oak
you've got LGA 1 150 and here's one we
want LGA 211 so it says to affect the
shipping system installation of the
mounting bracket screw the LGA to Oh 11
studs number eight we figure these studs
have got to go on the front so let's
pull out this arm first
 you then pushes em Matalon there
and there's left out the word this comes
out ready for the cpu
let's probably just drops out and
there's all the pins to CPU you don't
want you let me talk to you so we're
down to what looks like on this
motherboard there we go
so we have those there like space
instance we've also got these in the kit
so we want to make sure these go on so
these will usually place between two
studs and will usually go through so if
we take a look at the picture here now
you can see this bit here that goes
across and then up and down and you've
got like an angle there is basically
this bracket facing you know that way in
the picture so we know this wants to go
there and then the other one goes there
so we can gather that now just from
basically looking at what we're doing
here looking at the picture in and scene
and it looks like the studs go in first
so these studs go in first
this sits on top and then these screws
go afterwards so it looks like we're on
the right track so we screw these down
just finger tight for now
under this one and this is probably the
only federally part of the thing in
after solving the whole build we'll have
it in answers the straightforward of say
installing that the modern CPU found is
that you know the trickiest start it
also looks like this plate backing plate
isn't used so typically they are the
last bill that it was but you can see on
this diagram this is for the LGA 1 1 5
oh and it clearly shows the bracket
going underneath
whereas our picture has no bracket so
luckily we don't have to fit this
bracket underneath which we usually do
so that's why it was a little bit
confusing and start because I usually
install these so that's out of the way
we've got the four studs on so now I'm
getting them back in that this one will
go there this one here and screw this
down just loosely
and that's it so that's the cpu fan
cooler block install crap in terms of
the supports for it so again I'm looking
at this that looks like all we have to
do it's just got those brackets on and
then I guess the next step is to simply
mount this through and it looks like
there's a this bar which will be this
bar it's sort of cutting through the fan
but we'll get to that one we install the
fan so again don't worry too much about
trying to figure it all out until you
get to the stage and a lot of it is
doing just by you know seeing firsthand
so remove these bits out of the way
again
so now when you come to install the
motherboard into the case well first
want to get all these cables out of the
way and then you'll usually get a bag of
screws and speaker sometimes for the
motherboard which is the beat sound when
you turn it on this is a spare grille
for the back here for where the graphics
card goes in case you don't do that case
you're using an onboard graphics and
then some screws for the motherboard
which will make yourself now so again
all the junk out of the way this is the
fan so some cases come with a fan
already
and then it's expecting us to either
connect it up via three pin power from
the motherboard typically or just
directly from the power supply to run
all the time so we're just going to
connect it to the power supply to run
all the times it's just a basic case fun
but move that other way get all these
cables move them out the way for now and
then what we'll find is when you come to
install into this case you'll see I can
get this angle correctly you must move
the
the focus oh there we go so you've got
these Spacey studs and typically the set
up correctly so if we then look at the
motherboard you can see various mounting
holes so there's one here and there's
one here and there's one down here and
one here so you've got mounting holes
all around so you place this in and keep
an eye on those mounting holes and this
is just figuring out where we need to
place these there so this one's got the
power hole at the top some cases up
power holes at the bottom and some of
the powers at the top so we'll put the
power in in a moment just before the
motherboard but we'll get all these
connectors and I'm ready so looking at
this you're basically through the hole
also now you can see already that we've
got one two three we've got four five
six of them lined up and the extremities
so these ones on the outer edge don't
have any support behind them so you push
down on the motherboard to technically
touch the bottom but we've got supports
rather up to here so if I move this out
of the way you can see that it was
resting on the support earring so all
these already match this motherboards
mounting holes you can then go further
and install the mounting holes into say
these here so you get the bag that was
inside the motherboard and you empty out
the screws you'll see that you've got a
few additional you've got three more
mounting screws so you can just go ahead
and screw those three into position you
can go there and basically screw it in
and then just do the same for the other
three
and now before we then place this in and
screw it down we'll do two more things
we will install the power supply to get
that over waves it quite happy we don't
want to hit the motherboard and then
what was the other thing
oh yeah and then we'll install this that
we had in the case so we can do this one
now because this is nice and easy so
this is that the backplate basically
this this hole here you can't mistake it
this wants to go behind and pushed into
this hole and if you wondering which way
it goes simply get your motherboard
which will only fit in the case one way
and you can see this has to go to match
this hole here motherboard has to go in
this way you can see that your audio
sockets here and your ps2 and USB at the
top let me forget the adapter plate you
can see these have got to go at the
bottom these at the top so it goes in
this way you go in from the bottom and
basically line it up and just push it in
it's just a push bit and that's destined
again and then the motherboard will push
against this as well and keep it in
place so the listening
again nice manual packaging down to the
actual power supply so you can see here
these are the modular connectors so
normal power suppliers come and all the
cables are coming up here no matter if
you want to use them or not you'll have
every single cable attached but slightly
more expensive ones like this one come
with a lovely little bag and all the
cables in so got all the sounds away
then we have this power supply and then
in the back
we have all the module cables we've got
a EU power supply even though I'm in the
UK and that's it so I need a a UK power
supply low key up I've got plenty of
them
so then couldn't we will be any simpler
the back face of the ktf wants to have
obviously the power cable bit coming out
so that goes that way
and then up or down it tends to go with
the logo facing up to the top of the
case drop it in now we can see the screw
holes are just about lining up so we've
got one up here a little bit hard to see
but yeah the screw holes are lining up
there from there so now all you need to
do is screw the screws in but that's not
got the power supply in but we've no
other buck tanks in as well so we've got
this back plate in so now time to
install the motherboard so about the
motherboard back and hopefully this is
going to be large enough now without the
the lighting at the distance Judy
laughing so we've got this in and again
you'll place the motherboard onto those
supports and they'll also be looking for
at the back here you can now see this is
the motherboard coming up to all these
so it's aligned so what you want to do
is you want to get the motherboard
screws which are the screws with the
sort of like the washer already on the
screw right there you want to get your
screwdriver I want to get it to screw
over the first hole so over the the top
usually go over the top lap mounting
hole there and then push the board in
and then with it in you should find the
screw hole nice and easy
and then find that one down then now
again I can get this in the shot you'll
see we have the school there nicely
lined up with the screw Center to it so
that's the first line and then what
typically do is pick now the screw at
the other extreme so we did the screw up
here will now we'll do the screw down
this bottom corner will go for this one
right down here I'm not able to get in
on that we've got ya this screw right
down here down there and you can see
that one's slightly out to line as well
so same principle get your screw over
the hole and this is actually not far
off the ship find its way in and tighten
down don't over tighten these screws if
you want to break that for the board the
better to keep their another board in
place so you don't need to go crazy with
that how tight you're making these
screws so with that done now make sure
you screwing all the other holes that
you can see so I'm just going to go
ahead and finish all these screws and
you can just fast-forward the video so
let's go ahead and install the CPU next
so we've got the mounting brackets
already on ready and what we want to do
now is we'll have these springs either
side of the CPU which are a bit
difficult to get I'm hoping these arms
are going to be in the way so it just
about lifts through them make sure the
oil bacon so leave it up click not
usually interfering that much so you let
these two prongs out obviously just
pushing inwards on the front and in this
page flips off so this moves our way
and this cage flips off so let's open
the CPU you want to be careful here
because the CPU is flat expensive as
usual only the most expensive parts of
the computer you can get that on camera
and then get the light just right you
can see there Intel Core i7 i-76 900 K
so there we go
you'll also notice on the CPU you've got
this indicator here this arrow each
corner piece each plastic like this bit
here is square so you can see all three
corner the square square square this
one's got a little notch cut out to the
top corner so I'll zoom right in that
little notch there let's cut out so
that's the indicator that matches the
CPU ro so you want to take the CPU you
don't want to touch the underside here
don't get touching any of this keep your
fingers on the edge notice the arrow up
here and place that so it's pointing on
the arrow and all you do is gently place
the CPU down into position and just make
sure it's lined up and then you can see
to check out line dot you'll see it's
dropped in to position so you'll see
it's gone right down into the corners so
that's what you want to see and then
with that in we want to take these arms
or rather you want to fold this back
over first and this is the thing that's
going to push down on the CPU and keep
in place then you want to fold these
arms back into position which lock in
down there and this one
locks in down there so we've now got
that locked in solid that's not going to
go anywhere you see on this case we have
these four slots these four slots and
these are the RAM slots if you get the
motherboard manual so huge grub this
mind will come of the motherboard
typically you'll find very easily or
usually the any of the start of the
manual try and keep it that way I guess
memory there so en 14 so we go to page
14 you can see that memory you can also
see dim 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 8 7 5 6 7 8 go
backwards what you're looking for is
typically when you buy the round as I
mentioned don't buy individual sticks
buy them in in sets because they've been
balanced so these are two steps we've
got 2 times 16 gig so we want to install
two memories and you can see here
channels a B C and D so you want to keep
these in pairs so you didn't marry one
and two three and four five and six
seven and eight and well let's double
check that actually so now rather here's
the suggested installation for the two
witnesses why I was highlighting this
you might expect to install the memory
just here so you know just pick two and
installment two and it will still work
that way well the way the motherboard
has been optimized and the way that the
high-speed channel has been done that if
you've got to they recommend this only
on one and five to pair off if you've
got three it's 1 5 &amp;amp; 3 so the manual
will tell you which are the desired
Channel so we're going to use one on 5
so we'll get the run and we'll open this
up
and that's a really nice-looking round
so these are keyed so we take one you'll
see you've got your notch here now
there's not just slightly shorter one
side so it's here is less than one
camera focus there we go so this side
slightly shorter than this side so it'll
only fit in one way so when you come to
install the round in slot 1 which is
here you'll see that you have the the
notch here so when we install it you
push back on this tab so there's tab CA
just push them back you can do that for
a lot of them and doesn't matter
so only one side has potable tubs and
then you can simply try you can either
look with your eyes and see that you
know that's going to fit that way if you
can visibly see if you try the other way
you'll see that it doesn't quite line up
with the knotch so if I try to install
it the long way basically won't go in
and you can try and get them but you can
see that that knotch is not aligned so
notch is there it's just slightly up to
line so you have to turn it around and
then you see the notch is going to line
up there so you know that's going to go
in so that's the way it's going to go
around the side that you push to this
flat back on tends to be the sadly you
don't start that so you start with the
memory at the other side you push the
memory in so just download line you're
feeling you're down and then this side
goes in but you don't to push too far so
it starts at this end then you try and
get them in evenly and then push down at
this end and push down there something
should hear click so you hear that click
and that's that latch at the back
locking them up that's the noise a black
going
so that's what you're listening for and
then you know the Rams in good same for
the other one which if you remember was
that's our one so just drop your that
memory stick tip the side that matches
she's that side slide it in there the
other side and then push down you can
see like flicking as well as the
motherboard settling in on the mounting
screws that are just a bit of movement
on the screws that that's the ramen so
we've never got CPU and RAM just do a
bit of cleanup
so let's first install the fan fill
you'll notice and at the bottom of the
fans this grease with this cover on has
just fell off and this is thermal paste
so you absolutely must have thermal
paste on the CPU and that comes
pre-installed on this cooler
that's that wide gone there so with the
CPU in place and following again the
syllable instruction that come with a
cooler you can see the picture shows the
CPU fan with a bracket going it over
into screws so it's fairly easy to
figure out that it's this bracket now
come with it and these two screws again
just look at the pictures and and figure
out based on the pictures so this we
know the farm as a whole will want we
know the fun is going to be facing here
you know well this way generally so we
know we want it we don't want it that
way because then the air would be
blowing it up and down the case where is
the vent of the cases is our woods here
so you install it this way plus the
other telltale sign is if you look at
this case the groove here where the
mounting bracket is going over has to
line up with these two holes where it's
going to mount so if we install it that
way
the bracket would go over here say like
mask and it wouldn't attach to anything
so it has to be that way so let's go
ahead and install it that way first
place this gently because you've got to
place this right because of this thermal
paste you've got to make sure when your
contact it's going to touch the CPU so
place that over the CPU so it lands on
the CPU and then it will slide a bit
because the thermal paste and then you
want to slide this mounting bracket
through and then line it up with the
holes and then everything should sort of
lock into place so you can feel that
that's all locked and that's a good view
it's also like nicely locked in place
now also we other screwed it down where
everything's lined up so we'll take the
screw and because this is going either
side of the CPU we'll put the screw in
get it started off or don't over time
simply just until it starts moving and I
will go to the other side and we'll do
this screw and they can tighten down
till you just see the bridge moving and
go to the other side and just tighten
down each time few more turn that side
few more turn that side these clearly
cook in like this leave the sit in the
fan and they definitely could come out
there so we'll get both of them and
he'll take the brackets basically just
hook it in to the holes now you've got
sort of a and get a hold of that you can
tell us that's obviously in some way
right then we just place this down and I
noticed the side here and I think I
remember now this is how the last one
work
similar you can see we're very close to
the grills so we're very close to sort
of this line here which got me thinking
and you can also see the bars slipping
through the grill so although I did was
sort of pulled on this like a spring
Lincoln C is now latched in sort of
locked inside there the grilles and
that's now latch down so you pull out
and it comes out and you push in it sort
of locks in so that's how they work I
took about ten minutes to figure out and
then do the same the other side just
simply pull it into place
there we go one very complicated CPU
cooler and now we've got to plug this
end of the fan in this is also really
important you've got to make sure you
plug this into the motherboard where is
this usually one spot and usually says
CPU farm so right felt that off and get
there you can see hopefully and get to
the right spot and when the camera
focuses is either CPU fun Y so you want
to take the farm and plug it in and it
will usually only fit in one way as well
so let's just place that in so basically
try to fit it in one way if it doesn't
work push it in the other way so that's
the CPU fan installed so that's that
you'll also see next to that was sits
fun so we could go ahead and install
this farm here with this connector to
sit upon you can plug it in down there
and that will act as a system fan and it
just means that the motherboard the BIOS
will have some kind of feedback based on
the fact that it knows that this is a
fan for the system you can get some
control over it and some feedback I'm
going to place these wires anywhere for
the moment
and now we get the graphics card so
we've got the GTX 106 oh here so not top
of the range but not far off take a look
at this so a box full of manuals which
again I'll never read or a big manual
and there's a poster we've got a giant
poster with this opinion yes arm
yourself so I'll zoom out even more for
a big poster so I don't need that I can
go all the other boxes and onto the good
stuff
so and again when you messing with bar
just keep touching this case to get rid
of any stuff deep when you've mastered
casing just to get any static on your
fingers it's also comes in an empty
stomach bug
and now we have us a nice graphics card
so got all plastic CL over there we go
it's a double width or a double depth
I'm not sure what your cluster mass GPU
so it takes up two slots and the
motherboard right DVI and the modern
ones come with these covers again now so
sort of took attack from dust all the
ones you're not going to use you pull
these out and there's a DisplayPort and
you keep those in when you're not using
them and that looks like another as a
HDMI so one DisplayPort on HDMI so far
another DisplayPort tripped reduced
label on HDMI so got three display ports
on one HDMI which is cool
there's display ports the more modern
connector anyway so move that out the
way and then in terms of installation
now the graphics card goes in typically
you try and fit it in your top PCI slot
ever not you can go the one below so
these are your PCI is that's a full-size
PCI and the local one move your hand all
the way here these little ones are still
PCIe they're just smallest lots of
Xpress commenting on the names that I
think like 32 and 16 and there's four
speed HP but typically your fastest at
the top and they're written on the
motherboard so we want to solve a
graphics card there as we heard this is
a double that so in terms of back of the
case now we're going to need another one
removed before we move these out because
they tend to be single time removal that
sort of bend and twist the metal out and
once them out they're out so we will try
and get it put angle of this again to
see what I'm talking about what you want
to kind of take your graphics card and
try and place it in two
possession so you'll be looking for
lining off disconnect F which is also a
guard on that we have to take off so you
looking at line let's connect rock with
this connector and then seeing where
this face sticks out here so if I line
that up roughly there that's lined up
with the connected and edges roughly but
that will give you a visible indication
of I'd keep this still and get around to
the camera you can then see if I whip
this up it's actually it's over here you
can see it's falling on these two slots
so this one we want to reinstall and
hence why we had the spare bracket at
the start somewhere over here so we've
got this bracket space well reinstall
that one move the graphics card out the
way now we need to remove these two so
these tend to just twist out like this
he just literally pretty much snap the
mouse and they're just attached with
little tiny nips so I can get my cameras
off here you see the little nib that's
that's broke so this is just a few tax
of metal they keep those in so again you
just take it sort of push and just
rotate back and forward and they tend to
sort of snap out fairly easy so just
really giggle them about with those out
now again the cases are all different
but you see the back here this is got
God overall ports so want to remove
these two screws and get to this port so
if I can keep that in camera
remove these two screws and then this
bracket comes off place that to one side
for the minute grab the graphics card
again and place it in and now what you
should find is if you lie off the
connector should finally basically slide
into place and then you can push down
again similar to the RAM this has also
got a clicking lights of your Porsche
you should hear a click make it more
like a crack there below us
I was the click another graphics card is
in place so we're going to get the spare
copper that come with the case we're
going to install that by going from
behind down and just sort of resting it
there that covers that hole that's not
used take the plate that we took off and
align that back up over all them holes
and the point of these plates is so you
don't have to put screws and individual
holes you can just cover the whole lot
like this and then screw it in to retain
them all so just reinstall this bracket
that's nice now we need to get power to
the graphics card and is generally
powerjet to everything so there's one
last thing to install before we can
connect all the power and that is the
hard drive so this is a nice and simple
one so again we'll just open that up
okay so come the hard drive nice and
super light manual boop all stop to go
again and this is like almost all modern
hard drives you should get this is a
SATA Drive in terms of connection so
you've got your power input here and you
start the cable here so your power
supply should have come in all those
bags dimensions or if not your
motherboard should come with a SATA
cable and they look like this and you've
got one with an angle and one with a
flat typically the angle will go in a
motherboard because they're all in
different places but you can look in
your motherboard manual you can see just
about down in the bottom corner of my
motherboard and again look in your
manual if you're not sure but I I know
that typically always there so that's
where I lived and that's why your cable
store angle because then you have the
back again you can take the angled cable
and you can plug it in so that's like a
click and it won't fall out once it's in
won't pull out so I've never a
connection to a SATA cable alright then
we get the hard drive and this cable
will only go in one way again so if you
want to look carefully you can actually
look at the connector and see that out
and then you could look on the hard
drive and see the AL as well so you know
it goes that way and clicks on so that's
the hard drive in the other one is power
so we haven't got power to anything
positioned anything so I'll just leave
that out of the way for a moment and now
really we're getting around to
installing power in the system but right
before we do that we will now connect
all this bundled cables which you might
think looks scary but this is really
easy so start with the big ones again
most of these are the same and you can
see you've got a big cable this I
believe is USB see I just take the loop
on your motherboard against it we can
your manual or just will go in your
motherboard I can see straight away so
down here I can see that red one there
if i zoom in maybe you can see there we
go so WebGL USB one so that is the
connection we want and that's that blue
one in so these big cables one has HD
audio so again on your board you should
only have one connect to others fits and
you can see it as a distinctive second
pin message and usually the down quantum
corner so they're usually down here
again all boards are different it's
going to take a look at mine and yeah
mine's at the bottom corner right down
here so I'll try and get the simple view
again I come to the bottom corner and
you can see not quite here right down
there but it says J audio down there
just by the made in China and you can
see that distinctive second pin that's
missing something's going to plug mine
in there that's the audio one in and
then we've got this one left which says
US beef again distinctive single pin
missing at the top click on the boards
up as incredible using down the bottom I
can see them already so they are down
here these two here again on zoom in
you can see it says USB 3 USB 4 and
you've also got more satterfield empty
so you could have connected your hard
drive SATA connector here in these two
as well as you know the other site is
there now those cables in now finally
all these more you'll find on these
cables as you have a hard drive light
plus or minus you have reset switch
power switch and then to separate which
is power LED so these are all in one
place again you look on your board and
this is where you can usually refer to
the manual to find these are you know
these specific pins you can look around
or I'll show you how to use the manual
to find them as well and really it
should be on the first few pages of the
manual so I send just flick to the start
and you'll know what you're looking for
because you'll see a bunch of jumpers so
you can probably guess from this page
that if you hover over it shows all the
main part so you can see we've got
softer here which we plugged in we've
got the CPU there which we've plugged in
the CPU fan up here which we installed
we've got the audio down there which we
installed got the PCIe slot so again you
can revert the immanuel you like so also
you want to look for you can you can
read this and just try and find but
honestly I tend to find just flick
through and within a page or so you
should come to a diagram you know this
is showing how to install the CPU that
we've already done heatsink that we've
done the memory and this is kind of the
order you build in any way then it's
showing you mounting the holes which
we've done and then here we go so when
you get star going to things like this
these are the power connectors you need
which will do after this is the slots
that we've done with the graphics card
we're getting close SATA ports
I'm not - for Horus drives here we go
it's little more promising cpu farm and
there was your front panel connector so
you can see jfp 1 and jf p 2 there you
can also see pin 1 to mark there and
then 9 10 at the end which means the it
goes 1 2 and the bottom on 3 4 bottom
and 5 6 7 8 so just goes like a zigzag
that's the pin numbers same for the
other side and then if we refer back to
the manual to double check you can see
paper out way up it is basically showing
you the board as we looked up it
straight down so you can sort of look at
this picture and simply connect so the
first one we do would be connected to
the bottom left which is the hard drive
LED so you take your cables and you find
as the power switch as a research rich
so that's the hard drive LED you can see
that pause next so basically the red is
going to be connected to the bottom left
and the white one next to it and then
the same for all the other pins simply
and the switches for some reason they
give a polarity on switches I guess it
switches to have LEDs built into them
otherwise it doesn't matter when you
connect them back to front a light
simply won't you know appear so go ahead
and install those based on you know the
names of these like power switch will be
power switch to there and if they
haven't got and I'll even got a polarity
written on the cable here then simply
try it one way and when the system boots
up if you say it's the power light
doesn't come on just flip the connection
around but for the ones that have you
know plus or minus retina then you know
the red is plus the white is minus you
can also usually make an educated guess
that if you look at all the cables all
the ones with a polarity written on have
the white written as the negative for
instance so like the power LED white so
you can make an assumption that the
white is
the negative and then install them that
way so I'm just going to go ahead and
install these cables down into jfp one
down here
and that's that don't so if we then take
a look you should end up with something
like that which will also be different
based on everybody's individual
motherboard but you should get something
similar that taking up those pins and
then we'll do jfp to next
okay so positive red black negative and
then on the book so you want it going
this way around on the top jfp to
installed so that's all the cables
connected to the case the last thing to
do is Mount this hard drive to make sure
it's in position so with the power
facing outwards we're going to just
slide it under here and you should see
the screw holes line up so if you place
it here you can see the screw holes line
up there and there
what the hard drive mounted also now
need to do is connect power to
everything and we're good to go
so there's a few things power wise if
you've got a single power supply that
isn't much less than all the cables will
already be coming out otherwise you'll
have all these you know connectors the
comic your power supply so take the
power supply again this is probably
gonna be attached on yours if you've got
a modular one and these need to plug in
for the modules that we showed at the
beginning of the video so again it's
going to be hard to get in there now to
show you on the camera but it's the
modules all down here so I'm going to go
ahead and connect this module off that's
that one in to the power supply now this
need to connect to the motherboard so
again it's almost always in the same
position but we are looking at this
connector down here this big block
connector so we'll go ahead and plug it
into that one now that's on the main
motherboard not usually a 24-pin
connector so now we've got this main one
I will label try and hook all the cables
out the way as we go keep it clean so as
you can see there we have japw R 2 which
is 4 clearly the secondary power to the
motherboard so we zoom out you'll see
we're about done is that's wrong I'm
going to install this 8 pin connector
okay that's that connector in next we
need to power these graphics card so you
can see here we've got powerful graphics
card so we're going to note that for
that you need a six pin or eight pin
PCIe connector for the typically come
with a soft split six secretory
connector and I'll say again some archly
Telly's it says PCIe so connect this one
off to the graphics card on the same
process and that's that one and again
make sure sometimes CPU hairpin CPUs
sometimes graphics cards have two power
connectors so look around make sure
there's no expected secondary for the
connection which on this one there isn't
now we want to power the harddrive so
just talked awake in here so we don't
want to forget to provide supper power
which looks like an elongated version of
the other power so plug that into the
hard drive and then with that fit then I
believe we have everything connected so
it's just do a sanity check so we have
the CPU which is connecting to the
motherboard which where it gets power
from we have the main 24-pin power down
here the big 24 pin we are there Fazil
retail in here we have the graphics card
play up the hard drive and we have this
fan
plugged into sis fun at the moment and
most importantly the system CPU fan more
than two CPU far so that should be
everything connected and effectively
this computer now built
so just get the lid and we install it
and then put on finger tight Jewish and
we will just apply power so we've got no
got no you know monitor anything but
just to get a feel that this thing
powers up and spins and is going to take
this off so you can see you know the
boot up sequence is Ralph of what to
expect because remember we used RAM in
this that wasn't technically specified
is supported on the processor on their
motherboard or I'm sure it'll be fine so
the power limp are flipped easy twelve
out to flick that switch to make sure
it's on so now we've got juice to the
motherboard you can see we've got a
green light down there which is sign
that the motherboards got power I'm just
going to press the power button on the
front of the miter here which is this
power button here and then you can see
the CPU fan spinning and also the system
fan you can see down there we've got a
blue light and now we've got another
green light down the bottom now which is
reset which is the sort of on board
overclocking ability and then the first
boot sometimes takes a while so you can
see the CPU fans are still spinning
other than issue then typically these
that simply stop spinning the whole
system is turned off but it looks like
the system is running it might still be
doing its very first boot but sometimes
it takes a while but what it expect is
you usually get a beep and you know says
that it's about to boot and obviously we
could just plug the HDMI cable in now to
you know see what we carry now I guess
that's actually the build up and then
the next video we'll go through
power we not been installing windows</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
