new gift package from our project so by
that I mean he is the DNA framework
which is going to become the universal
source of all of our projects going
forward with kind of really common cold
and common set up that we want in kind
of every project I'm right now in peseta
word we reference this actual project
and source code which is not really what
we want to do instead what we want to do
is reference he just like we reference
everything else with these nougat
references like we've referenced here so
in a project if you right clicked manage
nougat packages and you browse these are
kind of this is how you want to install
it with these package references and
then the installed ones are actually
here so we want to see DNA dot framework
in this list and to do that it's pretty
simple so I'll show you how to do it you
can see the main package sources nougat
org so that's where we're gonna start so
the plan is to get this actual project
into a nougat package and then our
Fassett word in any other project going
forward you don't need the source code
you can just right click manage nougat
search for DNA dot framework and install
it and then when there's an update you
just update it as well so we'll start
with that the first stage is to go to
new booth - org which will take you to
just the homepage click sign in or
create account so I just look creates an
account because I've got two-step
authentication so I just want to cut
through on the video so you don't need
to see that so
I'll just sign in to this and then I'll
show you where to go so all you need to
do is create account it's free each
specify you invoke and sign up and if I
can remember correct
see if we get in now there we go so
we're now signed in and that's all I've
done I haven't done anything after this
account yet I've just created an account
so we'll start with this
you want to go to API keys and create
and this is so that we can push to
nougat using the key and that's how we
kind of publish so we'll do a key name
of I don't know just call it loop games
room because that's where I am
select scope you want to be able to push
new packages and package versions so
that's that's it
the glob pattern we want to just put a
star which means allow everything you
know don't bother filtering you can do
is example show here so you can allow a
key to only pushed a certain packages
but this is one I just want to push
everything and that should be netted
click create so now going new API key
and I copy so now it's copied to the
clipboard keep that private because this
will be used to obviously push something
to this site in a minute and then I'll I
just open up a notepad and paste yeah
I've got my key so obviously I won't
show that on the video that's my private
key to push here so we click copy you'll
be able to paste it into your clipboard
so that's the first step so now we've
got this account it's all ready to go
we'll go to the actual project that we
want to make a package for which is this
one and obviously it's a dotnet core
standard library in this case this is
the one I'm publishing right click
properties and then just go to the
package section and in here you see this
generate nougat package on build so we
could do that but I'm going to manually
generate it as and when I need you to
you could check that but I'm leaving it
blank the IDE DNA that frame works fine
the author is me company is angel six
and the product is DNA DUP framework the
description of my product if I just copy
and paste from the github source code
copyright there isn't really one it's
open source license same thing project
I'll just put a project tail again of
the source code
get off remark I am gone icon well how
much we got an icon but I believe the
icon needs to be a PNG it's worth oh no
I don't have an icon yes I've got a
comedy in a web but I don't have one for
DNA framework I will be getting one once
again that file I'll put an ill link to
the PNG of the icon and that'll appear
in here so I'll do that after and the
repo is the same the repo type you can
read up on specific types for now I'm
just gonna leave that blank
the tags can be anything we want so I'll
just type in a bunch of keywords
obviously the first ones DNA framework
and then a company name and just general
bits release notes I'll just put the
same as description for now it's the
first version and save and that's all
you need for the package so now when we
want to create a package if we were to
open this folder and then we right-click
on the project or in fact first you want
to change to release if you're not
already to make sure you in release
build you don't want to publish a debug
version right click on the project and
click pack and that should generate in
your folder in the bin folder and then
release you've got now your package so
this is now all we need to publish to
the nougat package website package yet
nougat org so you can go in this folder
click up here and just type CMD for open
command and then what we want to do in
this command now type in dotnet first
make sure you've got dotnet if not make
sure you install the.net core SDK but
this comes with Visual Studio you should
be able to just type dotnet and to
publish to the nougat site you type
dotnet nougat posh and then the name of
the package which is in this folder so
it's that one - key and then you paste
your secret key into there which I'll
leave out for now so the packs for the
minute - s and then the site that you
want to push through it's HTTP colon
forward slash forward slash it's on one
line
and it's API dot nougat dog /v three
four dash index dot Jason so if I can
I'll just go ahead and put my key in
heels I'll do is blow this on the video
so you can see what actually happens let
me just copy go back to here go son back
to him replace the F Mikey not just blow
it out press ENTER and this should now
push to the actual site so if all goes
well this will be pushed in a minute and
there you can see it now says your
package would pushed so we close that
down you can make a command line of that
if you want to do a you know a push
regularly enough to remember that so you
can create a new file say and just do
push CMD or dot bat whichever makes no
difference and you can right click and
edit and you could paste the exact same
thing in here so dotnet knew got posh
Kiki you know the file like this and
then point inside the correct folder
where you expect it but don't commit
that's a source code with your key and
keep your key private don't push that
public because if somebody gets access
to that it's like in access to your
password so now if we go back to the
site and we go to manage packages
published packages you can see one so
it's now there and sometimes it takes a
while to appear but now we should be
able to open for set up word and find
this package now so if we go to here
we're done with that one close that down
open up a fresh one and then we can open
all facetted awkward and one thing
you're fixed as well I believe yesterday
in this off video he will was the
reference and here these were failing
like Fadi was failing specifically so to
fix that if you wanted to follow along
with the originals his right click on
lobe project right click Edit CS proj
and at the very bottom of this file
there was a item here that was obviously
a reference to Fadi and then a statement
in an item group stating if body isn't
found
throw an error so we deleted those few
lines of code and I can actually pull
that off on github so I'll show you the
actual commit just so that you can again
follow along just sign in over here a
minute so it's off camera viewer and if
we go to faceted word then commits and
you'll see
I fixed the CS proj file and we had this
n-well lasted Jason one this was the 41
at the bottom so we removed this part
and then once I've removed the old one
so I removed Fadi from directly from the
CS proj and then we loaded the file and
then I deleted the n inject and the
property changed manually from the
references by just clicking on and
inject and clicking the delete button
and the same for that and then I right
clicked manage nougat packages and
search for the new packages for 40 and
inject and property changed and you'll
see this blue icon this is what's called
a pocket reference this is the more
up-to-date reference now so we should
really delete all of these and anyone we
can Andrey reference them the same so
we'll do that in a minute but let's
first get rid of this DMA framework
project just click and delete the
reference has now gone because that was
referencing a project and let's see we
can actually find DNA dot framework
and see so it's not not there yet
it just takes a while to appear so let's
just do an update first fadis got an
update let's update that one and then we
will delete any references and we add
them so we'll go to installed in fact
they're the only three we've got so
these are already up to date that's
referencing our actual call project and
these are built in to the framework
already so none of these are external
references so after a few minutes it
usually takes just a couple of minutes
this should update to you know find the
package so I don't know we can force
their said I think it's a pre-release
it's just simply gonna take some time to
appear so we could type it in into the
package manager and install it this way
but I'd prefer to just simply wait and
you know once it's done so you can see
here this package is not yet been
indexed it will appear in search results
um will be available after the index in
this complete so we simply just up to
wait until this message goes I guess so
I'll just pause the video at this point
and keep refreshing this page once this
is gone
well then resume and show you how to
install so we'll come from there in a
second so a refreshed of 25 minutes it
still wasn't there 33 it's now there so
it looks like it's about half an hour
and one of Google's four times the state
to stop new at the old page used to have
an index lag page that they like the
bringing back but until then we can't
really see anything so when you push a
new good package expect about a half
hour delay based on this so presuming
that now we should be able to search
here and there we go it's now shown on
so now it's same by look Malpass so
maybe I want to change that and the
author maybe to angel six as opposed my
name so I'll probably change that in the
next push but to be honest that the
author has me but he just doesn't show
that the company had expect the company
to be shown so I'm probably gonna change
all that
angel six maybe
but anyway there it is so now in the set
a word project we can just click install
and it will install dependencies which
is whatever we're referencing we've got
to accept the licenses from after the
the references we have not necessarily
ours now you can see we've got DNA dot
framework so now instead of having the
actual source code were just reference
in a package so if we just do a search
for item e search box lets me search box
gun start showing up I mean just white
was this one we open something's gone
funny with me search box I've shattered
our word and don't have my search back
no I don't get where my search box is
going it's just doesn't seem to appear
okay so I'm just it's not there I can
use it I don't really get that search
box has vanished
so we referenced it but we don't really
make use of it anyway yet we've got the
DNA here and we do the framework start
up so now you can see it's got the
framework you press f12 it'll now go to
the DLL because it's referencing the the
actual library now in the new with you
know the nougat store so that's now
reference correctly and we published our
own package so now you guys can just
search in manage nougat past you can
install the DNA framework going forward
and all I have to do is right-click an
update the package whenever I do an
update so that's what we'll do going
forward and that keeps up nice and clean
and the next thing we'll do now is in
this actual DNA framework source code so
if we were to close the solution and
we'll open the DNA framework in this now
the first thing we'll do is to add a web
manager so something that our cetera
application can then talk to the server
the the facet o server were making
through API not necessarily restful
which is just what you probably hear of
is like a a word for how to communicate
we're not technically gonna do restful
as such I don't really like that method
I don't like doing HTTP specific calls I
just like to do posting gets I don't
like to have to do deletes and options
and all things like that so there but
the bottom line is we'll be doing web
calls from the Fassett a word
application to say you know login and
that will fire off to our main server so
we're gonna make a web a web manager
built into this framework and then we
can simply consume that to fire up
requests to the server so that's how to
make a nougat package for any of your
projects that you want to be able to you
know reference this way so I'll now put
a link in the source code of this in the
description readme file that points to
you know that you can install it that
way and that's the recommended way going
forward and then the next video we'll do
is gonna be on making this web manager
so hopefully this was a useful video
I've obviously got now patreon page so
I'll start putting that in the links to
each video if you want to support what
I'm doing and donate to me that'll be in
the links and as usual any questions or
comments just leave them in the video
and I'll get back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
