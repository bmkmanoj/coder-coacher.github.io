application this time we are going to
add we've done sending messages now we
can send the message we're going to add
the ability to at least view picture
messages and then eventually we can do
the you know a touch from computer and
show a picture message and show all the
files but we'll start with the basics of
at least displaying a picture message
and binding that to view models so in
order to do that we'll obviously need to
adjust this view model that's bound to
the the chap message item so that would
be the chat message let's start from
view model and then here we'll need to
add another item really for attachment
or you know specifically say image and
then we can tweak we can either do one
thing and that's to have an attachment
for an image an attachment for a file an
attachment for you know specifics that
we understand which is then what we're
going to do or you could just have a
generic attachment that kind of gives
you you know the the file size the file
name the file type you know and then
handle it that way but to start with I
think we're gonna have more of a basis
of as we get the data from the server we
all figure out what type of file it is
and we can have handles to handle those
specific pieces of information like if
you send a link to a website we want to
then display a mini picture of the
website so we're gonna have a few model
for each type of attachment and so let's
start with creating a new file for that
so if we go to the view models minimize
all this lot
and then we got the chat message list
item view model it's just copy and paste
that changes to chat message list item
image attachment view model so nice big
name a view model for each chap
thread item items attachment in this
case and image in the chat thread so
that's that then in here we can clear
all this off I will start with will
probably end up with also a base
attachment but for now again let's just
start with what we have so we know an
image polygons a title so the tile is
gonna be different than the image name
you know the file name there we might
allow them to send a picture and give it
a you know a specific title so almost
like a name without changing the actual
file name so at the point of that they
won't have the file size and part will
also have as we just mentioned the
actual file name so that will be the
original file name of the just a
attachment the file size in bytes of
this attachment we have file in file
size will want we can have file Thai all
can just have say extension so it
depends I want to handle this we've got
an extension in file name but in terms
of them binding we could have that or in
fact we'll leave that for now until we
need something you know like we might
handle pngs or JPEGs differently so we
can always add it later but let's just
leave it like that for now then we have
we'll have a public string for the
thumbnail ill and remember this is
coming from the web server when we make
the web server so for now we don't have
a web server we're just going to we know
we need one though so we're gonna first
make a region here if I can remember how
you do that shortcut before telling me
there we go region then double tab and
it automatically makes a region private
members and then this will be private
string and from a lil that will do for
that just want to check about actually
do so I'm just gonna check the comments
and they usually do for private they
usually do the full one okay the
thumbnail of this attachment so the
thumbnail we will return the thumbnail
fine then inset we will have so that if
the value is the same form then we don't
do anything
then if we do have a value we want to
update the value so update the vacuum
field here and then here this is well
put it to do that because the problem
with not having the serviette and not
getting a lot of stuff that I wanted to
do in this application we need to start
separating core out and adding more
things like a web manager so we can
download things and we can query the API
when the websites off all that kind of
stuff isn't done yet but everybody's
after you know these videos on WPF so
I'm trying to build the website and
slowly start building the additional
backing code in other videos but also
try and maintain doing some UI videos at
the same time so for now because we
don't have the download manager we'll
simply put it to do and state what we
have to do so this would be originally
to download an image from website you
know from wherever we gained from we got
our nails were basically a link to a
picture on our service website
eventually and then we will also create
a thumbnail the male sized version
because you'd have you download the
whole either this would be an actual
thumbnail of the file which is the ideal
in fact it would be so we wouldn't
create a thumbnail the server would
serve a thumbnail and then when they
click we could also ask for the
full-sized version so we download the
thumbnail and then we would save file to
local storage and cache so we don't have
to download it every time we look at the
picture and then we would set local file
path value but we don't have yet which
is going to be public string local file
path this is the this path here
so once you've downloaded the file and
you've saved it to you know the local
storage on this hard drive in the
applications cache folder which
we've got to build then we would set
this local file path and this is the
ultimately what will bind the image in
sam'l 2 so this would be the actual
literally a path on this machine to
simply display an image which would come
from setting the thumbnail oil so you'll
see you come together as we go on with
this video so this is the local file
path on this machine do the downloaded
for male so we would set the value to
that and so then for now you just leave
em each directly directly so this is
just gonna simulate your set and oil
will pretend with download date and then
typically we would set the local file
path to wherever the result of the
downloaded image come from but right now
we're just gonna put a dummy
we'll do our sample rusty picture that
we already have in our application which
we have in images samples rusty so for
now any picture we specify a thumbnail
tool will always be this image but it's
good enough to get the UI done and you
know that he is effectively where you
tweak you'd do this if you wanted to do
it in advance of me doing it so that's
the I think everything we need for the
view model there I want to rename the
class or the file rename file there we
go and then to now make use of this we
first need to have one of these items so
we need to have it in chat message just
item so it's in here so we would have
public big long name image attachment
and the other thing I'll mention here is
that with doing the photo previously in
doing all the chat applications
I will now strongly strongly recommend
the single unit a single message coming
from the server or being sent
always only ever contains one attachment
so you might want to attach a website
mountain or touch my websites about
example that's just a string in the
message but you might want to attach a
PDF amount to attach a file or a video
or an image or anything else in the
current for settle application the one
that's live on the store we allow
multiple attachments in one message and
the issue that leads to is one
maintaining the cache the state the
restoration and the clearing up of file
that could have nine out of ten files
uploaded and then gets canceled or
deleted or crashed or anything else then
you've got nine files left in memory and
left on a server in the middle of
nowhere
you've also got them handling viewing
multiple files and doing a UI to then
show you multiple files you have to do
the UI for them deleting and managing
attachments before you send them there's
so many additional requirements wouldn't
you start simply attaching multiple
things per message and you also lose a
lot of the benefit of being able to then
directly comment on say this single
attachment all of this message has only
ever got one attachment and you wanted
to comment effectively on this image you
simply comment on the message so then
the system that allows you to comment on
a message that we'll do in future would
be the same you wouldn't have to do
extra work so simply from hindsight and
the fact that I've done this many times
before I would not recommend doing
multiple attachments if you want to send
ten picture messages that's fine we
simply build the client to upload one
picture send it as a message upload the
next senators message and process it in
that way
don't talk load a bunch of messages then
attach them to it don't bunch of images
attach them to a message and send a
single message that's not really ideal
at all so with that said we've now got
an image attachment here a single one
and we'll couchette if we then attach
PDFs we'll have probably another view
model like this that says PDF attachment
specific ones that we want to handle
differently that is and then we'd have a
generic file attachment for everything
else that we simply show with you know
attachment download file name file size
type of thing but the reason we want
specific attachments here as I mentioned
is so we can we can actually make a
visual display differently so the attach
of video we can make a video attached
model
that could actually play the video live
inside of another message and to do that
is much cleaner to simply have multiple
attachments so again all this will come
clear it as we go forward but that's
just a little background as why I'm
doing this if you're wondering why I'm
not just saying you know attachment and
it can handle all attachments it can but
will have a file attachment for that and
this is then special cases form we want
to handle them differently like DM each
way we want to display a full-size
picture and so this is the attachment to
the message they type into the message
or rather the image attachment or now
it's open to the message as it is of an
image tab and we now have the image
attachment and want a few helper
properties so we will want for the UI
side of things and we want a boolean
because now what we want to do is say we
send a picture message you know we
attach this but we said no text we
simply want to send a picture we don't
want the bubble underneath with the text
to show a blank bubble so we will do a
has message one first that is simply
message isn't it that's all check like
indicating every have message or not and
what's you complaining about
oh yeah I'm thinking I'm leaving data no
in fact you know it is I guess if I just
I don't need to get set it's not
suitable there we go
so that will simply display true if
we've got a message false if not I'll
have any message text then we'll do the
same for image and then we do the same
eventually for standard file attachments
afterwards so we do have has image
attachment let's say and this is EV
image attachment isn't equal to null all
right so what the house message has a
mean attachment I've got the image
itself so I think that's all we need for
the UI so we can always come back to
this if not so there are the three
things we've added to the view model at
the moment and now I think we should be
good to go to list item view model and
when we open it let's at least add some
picture message so the bottom one you
know this is a bit of a new line issue
there it's all copy and paste this
bottom on again well in fact we'll just
change this bottom one so I'll start
with a message and a picture so we'll do
the message that and then we'll simply
do image attachment is new view model
you'll see we don't come up far in file
size anything for now we just simply
want the thumbnail l equals HTTP
anywhere weather doesn't matter so this
would be the you know the thumbnail this
will obviously come from the server like
we're typing here this would be
specifically pulled them from the server
and it would be an oil to an actual
image but if it doesn't matter for our
case because we're simply bypassing that
as we mentioned here and just setting
by default so we've now got a chat
message with an image attachment and we
expect this to show now in the UI so
that's where we need to start going so
we've got the chat message list out and
control and we are going to start with
we want the way I'm seeing it is you can
attach a picture you can also have a
message as well so you want them picture
to appear both in its own little bulb so
we need to separate this UI a little bit
first let's try and figure out where we
are with this
we've got speech bubble rectangle chat
bubble anchor and time container so the
time at the bottom wants to stay where
it is the chat bubble anchor and the
speech bubble rectangle those two things
are really specific to this chapel
so we want to keep them together but we
need to now have because we are in a
grid here
the main container we will need to I
suggest this so we know this is going
let's just remove this for now but cut
it so control X to keep it in memory but
that's gone we are now need two rows not
three because we have the tank container
and then all the content so we'll have a
new container just a grid for now that
is now going to contain all the new
stuff that will want to rose again let's
just paste this back in now first and
we'll cut it again just so I can move
clone this here so this is now the
message message text attachments red
with two rows because right now we have
an image and when I'm this original so
we recut this now I've already done that
border all the patterns going on here so
it's that one again so we have two grids
we will want another grid for Jeff
message tapped bubble that's what we
originally had I can now finally go in
there so all the donors move things
around here we've moved effectively this
speech bubble an anchor with moved from
outside this top grid into a main
container grid and into a sub grid and
this bridge wants to be on Row one
because we want this text to appear
below below the image just wondering why
that and because the speed it's up there
now because this is got grid row
oh so this grid also needs a rail
because this originally had a row so all
of them I've got two rows at the minute
there we go so that's now moved in
that's all the same and nothing's
changed so that should be good to simply
minimize at the minute so we take a look
what we had that hasn't changed us so
we've removed one of the rows from the
top red because now we've got a so
instead of it having you know this Bob
all this anchor in this text it's now
just got the whole contents and then the
time so remove the rail created in your
master grid there's kind of two rows one
for an image one for this text bubble
and then inside we've specified the
second grid already
just for the tax bubble which then has
the two rows again as it did before and
dump them in so it shifted all that
around and now we should be left with an
area here to now do our image bubble
this will be immediate action and then I
won't know one thing we wanted to do is
this whole row for the catch bubble we
wanted to set the visibility to the has
message and the converter needs to be
now will lead a new converter because
that's boolean to visibility converter
does hidden and we don't want to hide
the bubble we want to make it completely
collapsed invisible so if we just
quickly make another value converter
boolean to visibility copy and paste
that and one thing I will do in the next
video is we really need to reach invert
these values right now by default if we
specify true it's hidden and false the
other way around
sounds really annoying so for this new
one we'll fix it and then we'll go back
and fix the Leola so boolean to
visibility Dom convertible calling this
new file copy and paste it there first
it takes in a building with invisibility
where false is visibility dot collapsed
rename the file flip these around so
I've got this one pasted this one the
fact I'll showing you short but to keep
forgetting to use your simply on the
lining you'll hold the Alt key and now
press down you can move the the lines
around that way as well and instead of
cutting and pasting so we have we've
inverted the logic so now it's true it
will be visible and if it's false we
want to now change it to collapse
so that's all we need for that new value
converter so then this can now be that
one and the whole chat bubble now will
only be visible if we have a message
otherwise it'll be invisible that's good
now let's move on to displaying an image
in this grid so I think for that we will
need a border we know we want the corner
radius ten inside the border we'll
simply want the image itself and we'll
won't now the image is inside the Oval
the path to the images inside the actual
image view model so we will pass in the
image as the data context and then we'll
then hunt the source of the image being
the local local file path I believed and
I think that we'll be able only to
convert it to a know it that'll be a
path so don't need any convertor we
don't know nothing that's all we need to
display an image so I think if we run
that I think it'll actually should work
in some fashion we'll need some clean up
and tidy up but I think I should be
click maybe not okay image ok let's try
let's remove the binding initially bound
on it's not gold image called image
attachment doesn't it there we go
there we are
oh well that's a big picture of rusty
okay so we'll get in there we've got a
bubble we want some padding here first
between the two that's a bit too much of
a you know it's obviously butt up
against there some text so we want to
add some margin to the bottom some
bottom margin let's just quickly recheck
that and now we've got the padding we're
also a bit large when you don't like to
continue to expand them indefinitely so
it's good that it resizes you know some
resizing weather support I think we want
but let me Tom that size so there's
never too large so let's just simply put
a much width on this of 600 and so I was
like so that the image can never go you
know just keep growing too crazy sighs
that's better so that's a nice big
picture and you know that's its limit
you can even change that to whatever
you're a graphing nutter
a big enough picture otherwise you start
getting distracted with all the you know
that the huge image especially there's
multiple we've now got an issue with
this isn't rounding the corners and this
is a it is often done in multiple
different ways and typically the way you
do it is draw a region or draw like a
you know a path and then as a brush
should fill that region in and I don't
really like that that's always like a
bit of a hawkish workaround and the
problem is that because border gives us
this ability to do rounded corners and
we get so used to it and it's so nice we
expect to simply put a rounded border on
the border and everything inside clips
inside of it and that's that's not what
happens so instead of doing like oh well
we want this image now to specifically
be clipped and then we have to do you
know specific code just to draw an image
but then the next time you want it to be
a video clip you'd have two totally
different code again instead let's make
a an attachment for any item inside of a
border that can then effectively create
a region through an attached property
that matches its corner radius so what
we'll do is have an attached property on
the image that will set because in order
to clip the image you can do image clip
and then you can make a rectangle
geometry and then you can specify I
think you specify to me the values
wherever you do but you basically create
a you know a clicking region there so
that's all we're gonna do but with an
attached property that will match the
corner radius here and create you know
the correct rounded corners so let's go
to attach properties copy and paste
anything and do border attached
properties and then in here we will call
this clip from border property which
basically means you know create a
clipping from the parent border so we'll
say creates a clipping region on the
parent border corner radius then on
value changed its first white ball
that's kind of the same you have to
first get itself which would just call
self and send it is just gonna be
anything we're gonna work with anything
here so framework element and we know
that work that's fine
now get parent border so first if but
Jack we have a parent order and if we
don't we'll simply return so if not
stopped up parent as is border for the
variable called border then we'll return
but we'll also just think well we're
testing this or you can stay in anyway
I'll just did you buggered up break so
instead of just blatantly ignoring the
fact and wondering what's going on if it
fails we'll it'll stop the debugger at
this point for us to make us realize
we've done something wrong then if we do
have the the parent border we want to
first see if the value is true if true
look into events so if boolean you got
new values of the specified true or look
into events otherwise on hook so the
events we want would be when the border
first loads because we want to get the
what we want to do when it loads well in
fact it's gonna be the same thing both
times when it's loaded will be the first
time we have an actual width so it's
been rendered at this point then we can
draw the clipping area but then as well
as once it's loaded every time it
changes size we need to redo mmm
delete that use the same one so every
time you change your size you need to
redo the clip you know because the
clipping region you've specified is the
exact rectangle it's not like a
adjustable thing like in a grid where
things resize you have to redo the
clipping area every time so we have to
do every time it loads or rather the
first time it loads because it only
happens once and then every time the
size changes so if they change the value
to false we'll remove the event handlers
and we will also probably own a WPF
video but in a general c-sharp video
will also talk about event handlers and
on hooking and things because I'm sure
we'll have some memory leaks in this
application now that we should start to
debug mainly around almost definitely
around things like attaching properties
and attaching events and never on
hooking and lifecycle changes so that's
for another video though and it won't
harm us for now so when we set the value
to true which we will do will hook into
these two events and then in the was it
created two events oh no we don't need
that I can do it that one the both
handleable by just a rigid event all the
form the order is loaded and change
sides so now every time the border
changes first we want to make sure the
sender is a border I'm not really really
need to do that because we know it's
always s because we've attached it here
so in fact no number there doing that
let's just say for our border equals
order Center we know it's always s then
we want them to figure out the child
which should only ever be this property
and can really only ever be it because
we attach this property and the parent
is not a border we return so if we carry
on we are the child of this border and
we hook into the events so the only time
really this could this could be wrong
here where we're going to get the child
like this which is effectively it should
be ORS is if the child has been changed
and we haven't handled on hooking which
is a possibility and it would happen but
for now again we'll come back to clean
up this the only other way we could do
this is again with kind of a lossy we
could place this event handler code
directly in here but then on who Keenan
who kena wouldn't be the
same value in fact I know a way around
this we will want to that's a good way I
want to do a private routine event
handler and this would be the M border
size changed event handler and then in
here
remember that vigilant and the Sachi and
okay so can we not do instead then a
think of this would be maybe a delegate
of an action of object and we did event
aaaghh maybe not an event delegate
action and will that work
no okay save me messing around trying to
figure out multiple different syntaxes
the syntax here too to do this in line
in fact let me just try see that'll give
me the hint or what I'm after what I'm
creating here so I've done this before
we've done this on the unhooker ball
event somewhere unloaded equal so what
did we do with this
oh yeah rooted event handle so we did
the same thing but the problem is then
we don't get the benefits of doing it
both the same so yeah we're gonna have
to now create two event handlers which
is it's okay it's it's not at the end of
the world was him to make a helper
function so you'll see why I'm doing
this in a minute I'll explain so let me
just hammer this out and forwarder and
size change the event handler so this
will be private members so we've got
actual properties here now and then we
we will hook and unhook from those and
then on the size changes do the same now
the difference is we will have now a
private helper function order and just
call it boarder unchanged and then in
here now so we'll stay inside this on
value change so we have access to it
ourselves
well then say I'm border loaded equals
estarán yuan and this will call border
unchanged and so on
settle loaded event and then setup size
changed to do the same thing so now we
initialize the two variables here
instead of having it in this function
because what happens here is in this
function and in fact we will pass self
so the issue we had before in fact we
don't even need any of those even if
this we're not doing anything with them
why should we open it with s1 to leave
them in so if we did just the standard
rooted event handle and size changed in
here with the border
we couldn't get ourselves guaranteeing
that you know self is this exact item
because as mentioned if we attach to the
border then we hooked in to the event
here and then the child changes on the
board a Worstell hooked into the event
so then when the size changes it tries
to get the child presuming it soars and
it's now a new child and then starts
doing things so the issue becomes when
we wanted to get ourselves so instead of
just simply hooking into it a method
that's outside we do an internal method
here so we set them up internally so
that we can not pass ourselves so this
will be a framework element child need
child on ourselves border so now the
child we have so can get rid of that
childhood passed in that's all good so
I've changed it's never assigned to okay
it's assigned to right there that's
weird okay let's ignore likes it as
assigned I think it's just a bit
confused there that's just took I think
as a compile time
yeah it's a bit strange just you do that
and then fail so it's definitely
assigned to so that should go away when
we built that back to over so now
anytime the border is loaded all the
size changes what we want to do is get
the border which you've now gone get
ourselves which we've now passed in as a
child and we first need to check because
this is going to be fired both on loaded
and sighs changed and things like size
change might be called before loaded
when it's figured out its sizes but it's
never rendered yet so it's reading all
the time so we'll know when it's fully
loaded and we can effectively do
something with it once we have an actual
size so we just will do Jeff we have an
actual size and that's a simple case of
we will do a border actual width equals
zero and border actual height equals
zero so both of those are zero then
there's nothing we can do because we
don't have a size to work with if we
have a size to work with then we can set
up set up the new child flipping area so
onto rectangle as you mentioned before
which a new rectangle geometry geometry
in fact we can undo side like that and
the radius x equals can we do radius no
okay we're going do that because we want
to set the radius x on y to be the same
so wrapped up radius x equals four X dot
radius Y so set they're effectively the
corners of the rectangle which is what
we're trying to do we'll get there
into the corner radius matching the same
that will need to be the we don't want a
negative value so let's just make sure
mathematically the zero so it never goes
below zero or it'll be the border dr.
Korner radius and the corner radius is
or has okay top left bottom right so
pick the top left and I think that will
be Oh precisely you can have corner
radius is all around so the only limit
here is that we can't a corner radius
goes up different sized corners so we're
just gonna simply have to pick one of
them so we're gonna presume the top left
corner is the one with a clone
so this will only work with corner
radiuses that were the same all around
which is pretty much all the time we
never do a weird radius different on any
corner so that will work but we've also
got to factor in the the radius has got
to take into account half of the border
thickness because if you have a corner
radius of ten then you have a border
thickness you've got to account for that
border around it and fatally hard for me
to get to the center line to give us
where the curve should be so if you have
a really fat 50 pixel wide corner a
border then the corner radius is gonna
sit halfway between the outer edge and
the inner edge of that line have that
makes sense so we simply have to account
for taking off half of the border
thickness and again we'll just take say
the left-hand side Kanzi 0.5 to give us
half so all that's doing is setting up a
rectangle with a corner radius that
matches the ball just called a radius
that's all it does
that's the corner radius with the
borders for radius and then we now need
to set the actual rectangle size with a
set rectangle size to match child's
a full-size and this is where I'm saying
you have to this is why I have to
readjust all the time because the
rectangle is the clipping area specific
to an exact size it's not a flexible
value so for that we need to set the
rectangle of the rectangle over again
and that makes sense so that would be a
new rectangle that's a simple case of
child render size and then we assign
that finally to the child so sine
lifting the area to the child to child
dot clip equals the rectangle and that's
all there is to it
so what happens here is basically we
attach this to now we attach this to
anything that's inside a border which
can only be one thing you know at a time
this will then come in hook into the
loaded and changed events once you
finally gets a width and anytime you
change your size we will then remake a
rectangle that's got the same width and
height as the child but with a corner
radius of the what the board has got so
I'll create a constant clipping that
mimics the border hopefully so let's
apply this to our image here let's do
local : clipping border property equals
true and let's run that and see if we
get the clipping area
there we go now we have a rounded region
around and then one resize it should
yeah their readers the clipping area so
that's now a image coming in the only
other thing here I'd say is this is not
this is not how an image is loaded
because you'd have to download it from
the internet you know it to once you get
a thumbnail ill you'd have to then go
and fetch the thumbnail so we will have
where do we set it out touch with and
remote property not that but where did
we I'm forgetting warm afternoon what
was I looking for oh where we set the
oil is in the actual thumbnail so at
least let's simulate some kind of delay
that we're downloading because this
would take time so let's just add a task
dark delay of say two seconds and then
once it's done and if you're wondering
what I know using the background as it's
my dog snoring in case you can hear that
on the mic so after two seconds we will
set the thumbnail path and then this
will give us more of a representation of
you know the message load and the
picture comes in so there we go and
that's not as I mean that works but
that's not ideal he just like jumps and
appears at you so I think what we'll do
I'll split this video ox I know people
like shorter videos when we've we've had
like a good milestone here where we're
actually displaying pictures in the next
video we will animate this in will
create some kind of loading you know
circle here that lets them know there's
a picture loading and then it pops in
when there is a picture and it will also
fade the image in whenever he changes so
it's a bit smoother than you know just
banging in your face but I think that's
a good enough stopping point I think
we've reached a point there where we can
now display picture messages and
animating the picture masse
Jen and displayed a you know a loading
scene is kind of a separate video on
showing you how to do that so I'll stop
this video here and the next video the
very next one I'll do will be you know
how to animate this in so hopefully this
was useful in showing you how to now get
pictures into your chat messages again
any comments anything you want to see
you next anything like that just let me
know and I'll get back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
