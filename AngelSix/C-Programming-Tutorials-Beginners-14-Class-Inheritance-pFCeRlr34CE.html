inheritance specifically class
inheritance and it's a really simple
concept so it won't take long to explain
it's just understanding a few core
concepts of what it means so almost
everything in c-sharp is inherited
anyway so everything you have another
thing you do is typically at least
inherited from object which is a class
so every class after that like even this
class every class is inherited from an
object so we'll start with basically
creating a class so we just do public
class and we'll say car in this example
so this is a class and we can also have
a constructor so if you don't specify a
constructor it will be there anyway
but so we can see it there's a
constructor so this gets fired when we
create a new instance of the class so we
do VAR car equals new car and then we
put a breakpoint here here and here so
and run the application we'll see that
we'll get to the car statement then we
will create a new car and then it
automatically runs the constructor
function for us because that's what this
is this is calling the constructor and
then we get an instance of the car so
I'm sure you already know that and
you've got a class and classes help
instructors and now in an inherited
class so this this right now is just a
class but if we decide to make another
class inherit from this class then the
terminology is this is the base class
and the new class you created that
inherits from it is called the derived
class so this is the first point we want
to cover so we have a car we've got a
constructor let's say we put a few
properties in there such as wheel size
which all cars will have and say number
of doors so these are two properties
that all cars will have and we cover
this an abstract class
kind of using a car as an example of a
base class so now let's say we want
specific classes but we don't have to
redefine everything that's we know
exists in every car we simply want to
define the specifics of a new car so we
would have public class a Ferrari and to
make this now inherit from car instead
of just doing theirs the class which is
fine if up here just after the name of
the class you put a colon and then the
name of another class in this case car
this Ferrari now inherits this car so a
Ferrari you can now say is a car it is
this class it's derived from the class
so you didn't have its the you know that
class so that's how you make an
inherited class which is this thing here
and in order to use it you could have
var for R equals new Ferrari so now
you're gonna say what what happens with
you know constructors and the link
between these two classes so when you
make a Ferrari if we then put a
constructor in here you can see Ferrari
if we put a breakpoint on this
constructor in this constructor and also
I just comment out this for now so it
doesn't run that one if we run this
class you'll see that we go to create a
Ferrari and it first goes into the car
and strokes the car and then it goes
into the Ferrari afterwards so it steps
off the inherited ladder and this means
that there's there's no way to run you
know creating you instead of a new
instance of Ferrari without also calling
a constructor in the base class and by
default if we don't specify a
constructor then it will simply call the
default constructor now if we have
multiple constructors which you can have
so say we want to initialize a Ferrari
with a wheel size so I'll make a
constructor I will pass in wheel size
say and then in that constructor
we would then set the wheel size equals
the fast in wheel size now if we put a
breakpoint here and leave that one on
there and instead we now pass in 16-inch
wheels or tiny wheels for a Ferrari but
we'll pass that in you'll see Ferrari
I'll get called it are still called the
default car and then it'll call the
specific constructor but it won't call
this constructor because we've specified
a specific constructor this is point two
of what's happening in the Constructors
and basically you'll always have to call
the base classes constructor because
that's you have to you have to create an
instance of a car because a Ferrari is
an instance of that class so it creates
an instance of this class than an
instance of this class if you will even
that's the same classes for explaining
it that's how you think of it now let's
say car has another constructor and it
also has the same wheel size and it's
gonna do exactly the same job just for
the point of this explanation now if
we've got a break point there on all of
them we run again you might expect it to
simply call this constructor but it
doesn't it calls the default because we
were explicitly called the derived
classes constructor
it doesn't mean then that this base
class is going to have its specific
constructor called
so if you want that which typically
award say we don't need to do this
because this line is gone because the
the car does this anyway but now we
expect it to call that class similar to
when you derive a class here little on
to do in the constructor has put space
colon space and now we type the special
case word base open and now you can see
access to the the cars constructors so
we can now tell it when we call this
constructor specifically which base
class constructor to call and by just
passing in just like calling a function
passing in the back-right variables will
then call the correct class at the
correct constructor so if we run this
now you'll see we hit Ferrari and that's
hit the specific car constructor because
we asked it to here and then it will
call into you know the the top level so
that's how the Constructors are set up
in the class and how you would
specifically you know call certain
constructors so another point I want to
cover is when you use base classes and
you derived them there might be some
core library that you have or some you
know functions lower down in your
software that wants to make use of a
class but it simply doesn't know about
specifics these might be user created
classes they might be plugins they might
simply be higher up your software stack
and the lower levels want to do specific
things with all kinds of cars but they
don't know about all the cars that are
coming in the future and all the things
that could happen so in order to access
and make use of effectively anything
that derives from a car you could pass
down the Ferrari into a lower level
function that only knows about car via
simply casting it so you could say car
equals and then do an explicit cast from
the Ferrari to a car so now the Ferrari
is a Ferrari class and the car is a car
class but that is still the Ferrari
class and so in order to check this we
can do we create a fryer with 60 inch
wheels and we get to this car class and
then we see through the car variable you
can see the car I saw a Ferrari it's got
16 inch wheels but we've now been able
to pass this around as a car object so
it doesn't have to be passed around as
the specific so you can effectively cast
downwards down the stack you can you
know cast a Ferrari down to its base
class and you can cast it further Hobbit
as I mentioned everything in c-sharp
every class in c-sharp comes from an
object and that's still a base thing so
you could say var object class equals
object of car and you can cast down to
then an object and you'll see then the
object class
these set of four functions and that's
all it has and that's what everything in
c-sharp yet so you can always cast up
into a string you can always get the
type and the hashcode and you can always
compare so that's basically casting down
words of you know a specific class going
down and that is mainly for when you
want to do you know you create high
level classes but then you want to make
use of functions that's a lower level
that don't understand the specifics and
also it means you losers say a Ferrari
has a new thing called model number that
obviously would be on old cars but say
it's specific to a Ferrari now in car
you now don't have access to that
variable because it's in the Ferrari
class which is there so you have to bear
in mind when you're casting downwards in
order to make use of functions that the
thing making use of this will obviously
only have knowledge of what it knows you
know at the lowest level so it only
knows about this classes details you've
got another thing that I'd would
strongly avoid just because it caused a
lot of issues in the past with you know
lockdown source code and then people not
being able to inherit from other classes
so see we've got a car and then we've
got a Ferrari say we wanted to prevent
anyone from inheriting from car say we'd
done couple of classes and we no longer
want this to be inheritable you can put
the keyword sealed around the class and
now you can see we've got an area that
you can't derive from a sealed class so
it prevents this from being possible and
it prevents you from being able to do
this now some developers you know found
a need or a desire to do that but
personally I can't see any any reason
why you should prevent people from
expanding on your code so if you don't
want anybody to be able to inherit from
your class simply keyword sealed before
class and that will do that and that
that's really all there is to say on
that matter it literally just prevents
the classroom being de Rivel so there's
nothing else left to say about that and
then the obvious fact that might be
obvious to sörman maybe not to others
is that you can obviously continue to
inherit further down so you can you can
inherit you can have the Ferrari inherit
from car and then you can have say a
specific model of the Ferrari take it up
a public class Ferrari say 488 and that
can inherit from Ferrari and you can you
know now have effectively a Ferrari 488
that is here that can still be cast to a
car it could also be cast to you know
down to a regular Ferrari of any kind at
Ferrari before a date and now you'd have
access to say Ferrari which is got
access to the model number but they need
out of the 488 having very specifics to
that model so you can simply keep
inheriting from the class after class
after class going you know building up
your structure and that's what you can
do with classes you can inherit from an
inherited class the one thing you can't
do which some people struggle with and
think or how you know I really want to
it's it's a very googled topic is you
cannot inherit from multiple things so
you've gone and have it from two classes
it's just not in the the structure of
c-sharp it's not designed that way at
all so you can't ever have multiple
classes and nor will you ever be able to
it's just as it's the the fundamentals
of how C sharp works it's not designed
that way you know the whole principle of
the lifecycle of construction everything
about it doesn't allow for multiple
classes you know multiple interfaces
because they are simply contracts and
definitions of how something should be
whereas a class is the actual
implementation of that contract if you
will so you can only ever have one class
inheriting from another and that's
really all there is to inherited classes
that there is nothing special about them
there's it's simply a case of if you
want to gain all the benefits of the
class below it and there's some
standards involved
then you create the the base class
should contain all the information
that's identical between all future
inherited classes if you also in
instances of cars and then it's a case
that they should all have wheels that's
kind of a definition of a car they
should all have some number of doors
things like that but then you can create
a derived class that then goes into
specifics of you know say you've got I
don't know sure I think a three-wheeled
car so then you want to specify that
there's only three wheels so you simply
and have it from a car and enforce the
number of wheels to be three all the
time or you could have a car that's got
electric windows so then you might
create a car class and Matt create an
electric window car class then all cars
that want electric windows can inherit
from that things like that so it's up to
you how you use it but in terms of how
we use it in real-world situations
I'll give you a quick example so if I go
to the Fassett a word application that
we're doing right now and I just open
this solution you will see that if we go
to base attach property we have here a
class so it's a generic class it's also
abstract but none of that really matters
for the point of this we have a base
attached property class and then here we
have a lot of things so we have when
values change and get updated we have a
parent of you know any type it's passed
in as a generic then we have a value
property we have on value changed we've
got a lot of methods and then anything
that simply wants to make use of all
these features which you'll see there's
plenty of so this
one circumstance find a good example it
gots a auto scroll to bottom which is
now an attached property that wants to
scroll to the bottom one we're close to
the bottom but all's it really cares
about is when the value changes we want
to monitor for the scroll change and
then when it has changed we want to
scroll to the end of we're close to the
bottom but it's inherited from the base
attached property so that it doesn't
have to bother with hooking into on when
the value changes and handling all that
and firing off because now the base
attached property does all the work for
it it's got the defined values and it's
it's all set up to monitor for these
events so it's a case of all the messy
code involved in hooking in an attached
property to the URI and monitoring for
changed events is all done there and
then when we want to do something
specifics all's we have to do is
override the or value changed and do
exactly what we want to do and then
that's it that's all the rest to it you
just derive from the base class so
there's plenty of real-world examples
but if you want to see it in action then
there's there's all videos on Fassett o
worden and building this animation
attached property stuff and that's a a
good real world example of base classes
and inheritance so oprah's has explained
inherited classes and it's really as a
simple concept so if you get stuck on
anything or you've got any questions
just you know post a comment in the
video and all I'll answer them for you
but hopefully this is this has been
useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
