really make an actual website now we've
done the basics of CSS HTML some SATs
and it's time to really dig in and start
making a website so quickly mocked up
this Photoshop design for just going to
remake my website just for these videos
so I've got a new logo new little mascot
the tiles here and then it's kinda gonna
scroll down I mean this is we want this
menu to be you know we should scroll
maybe we juices open it maybe put some
animation on this number 6 and then
we'll have say this guy slide in and
maybe just hover around in a kind of
pattern constantly well probably on this
text end up typing in so he's like you
know it's like a typewriter effect as if
it's typing as like the header if you
will so this will all kind of slide and
animate in and then you just scroll down
you can imagine if I poisons kind of
like a full-screen mode it'll sort of
slide down and you'll have hello my name
is loop and then just keep scrolling
down nice big font II know classic
modern website appeal and that's kind of
where we're gonna go with this so I'll
just mess around with Photoshop I will
do tutorials on photoshop eventually as
well but for now we'll just keep it to
the web then I made like a contact me
page which is nice and simple it's just
going off the same website and then a
blog page which will be again just a
just a modern clean simple Luke so we're
gonna make this whole website in these
videos we're gonna start with this top
menu that's probably one of the most
tricky things on the website compared to
the rest which is pretty easy he'll will
come together really fast so this is
what we're gonna create here this kind
of top menu and as it collapses to
mobile it will go to like a hamburger
menu and slide down and things we'll
have to get some JavaScript involved at
that point but this is what we're gonna
make so to get started you should all by
now
be using DNA web so if not just go to
DNA web - IO and download the latest
version which is 1.04 at the moment once
that's installed we're just going to
create a new folder called test for the
minute and in the head of our describe
DNA web and I've gone ahead and actually
made this the point of this DNA web and
these templates is to aid rapid web
development so at the end of it you
should be able to make websites like
this new angel 6-1 in like 10 minutes
just chunking together pieces so I'll
show you the completed top bar and then
we'll go through making it from scratch
so with DNA web spun up in this test
folder just type their new template
bobrick dot modern one and just press
ENTER twice a lot of go ahead and create
the whole blank website and you can see
then we've got this title top menu bar
let's just scroll down it shrinks so
it's a nice animation is you reduce in
size it goes to a hamburger menu and
then you click on it and you up there
the menu slide out so got your mobile
view and go right the way down and you
know still got your view and you can
scroll back out and you've got your
normal menu so this is all been made and
you can now make use of this inside of
the fabric template which is it's the
way you'll work as you go forward you'll
see is you can then just simply start in
your web design with a fabric template
and you can type in you know like say
top menu style one which is what this
will be and it will inject like a style
like this then you can tweak your icons
your color scheme then you could inject
a head of a certain style and then a
banner of a certain style and it's gonna
be like chunking together bits of
websites in modern styles so this is the
first part of this kind of theme that's
available so if we did like live
variables know live variables you'll see
we've now got this fabric top menu dot
standard so if we have a look at la
fábrica top menu standard
because it's gonna dump out this div if
you will which will automatically style
if you're using the fabric engine into
this top menu instantly without your
having to do anything but behind the
scenes it's all just it's all in the
fabric source code that you can see it's
nice and simple and clean so it doesn't
take anything away from the user it's
still just HTML CSS and the JavaScript
is in there but it's nice and easy to
see it's not using any third-party
libraries it's not clustered it's just
clean simple and all works with the
whole the you know the web template if
you will so this is what we're we're
going to be creating so we're gonna now
go and we'll make another folder and
we'll make this a blank fabric template
so start with blank here make a folder
tab DNA web no one giving you templates
bathroom which is typically what you'd
start with now create a new blank
template with just the you know the flat
fabric engine ready to go then if we go
to blank right click and open with
visual studio code and we'll do the same
for the test folder so we've got the two
open in fact we don't need the we don't
need the test one open because we're
doing from scratch let's just start with
the blank one and we'll go into the HTML
three is HTML so we'll just try hether
one test and save and you can see we've
then got tests here so if we bring that
maybe out and across bridge that in you
can see the updates are then live so the
first part of designing the top menu in
any kind of HTML CSS is usually start
with the HTML so we're gonna make the
HTML in this part here and I'm sorry I
mentioned in the last few videos this
we're gonna try and keep this all to the
most modern standards and typically at
just a generic group of you will as
you're constructing HTML you use dibs
and we'll still use dibs but we'll start
with
making use of some new names that you
can basically replace dibs with there
are to help search engines and things to
find areas of the website so a classic
one is the navigation the top menu or
the side menu wherever your main
navigation of your website it's so
instead of putting like a dip we'll
start with now and those base leads to
dip just a different name to help search
engines to be able to find our
navigation area to then offer like if we
go to Google and titrate angel 6 and you
can see here these links below because
the search engines managed to find the
navigation so it helps you know search
engines figure out where your pages to
your website are and offer nicer layouts
so we'll make it enough and then the
other thing I also try to do is in HTML
I try to keep the class names the amount
of time just you type specific classes
and try to style you know a control of
you like this whole top navigation bar
to an absolute minimum in HTML so what
I'll do is I'll put a class at the top
level and I'll call this top menu
standard which is what we're creating
but because this is now already baked
into the fabric engine if I do that
it'll already style for us so I'm just
gonna call it top menu standard too and
that should be the only class really I
need in the whole the content inside of
your will don't start then trying to
style based on things inside we'll do
that in the sass file so always think of
the HTML you're going to try and keep it
as minimal as possible in terms of class
names and structures keep it as simple
as possible so this will be the top
navigation menu and inside here you'll
get used to how to think about these
them all you do as well so I've
obviously already got the knowledge and
I'm gonna try and explain but my natural
way of thinking is to group things so as
we look at the menu we've got an icon
over here we've got menu over here and
straightaway the icon can be an image
and the menu can be a list because
typically again for search engines
benefits if you put your navigation
inside of a list
item like an unordered list it helps so
even though we could style it in many
different ways using dibs or any other
kind of element it's most common to put
your main top navigation inside of a
list because it's kind of a list of
links if you will so the menu items
would be an unordered list and each want
to be a list item each one will have a
link inside so a href we don't really
care about now about what the link is so
I'll just put a hash and inside the link
will have the name so our blog if we
save that you'll see straightaway
there's a single item called blog then
if we paste one two three blog YouTube
SolidWorks for setup contact so we'll
have blog YouTube
SolidWorks now I'm doing mine lowercase
just for the style quite like the
lowercase writing for the new styling
game with and settle in contact so I
save that you can see this is the
structure so when you're constructing
the HTML initially like this don't
really think too much about how it's
appearing here it's more just about the
structure we can restyle this in to look
at any way we like with CSS so it really
doesn't matter how it ends up coming out
here it's more about just getting the
structure out in general so we've got a
container itself first which is the nav
so then we can do like a full-width
background image of your well and that
will contain all of this will then need
to wrap the the whole thing in a grid so
you see how I expand here this fabric
engine comes with a grid system so that
we can nice and easily add a website
inside of this grid and as we resize the
sections the columns resize and alter
according to responsiveness so the
source code for all this is in the
fabric source code so if you went to
HTML fabric or there's nothing in there
real it's as the sample grid that you
seen here and then SAS fabric all of the
stuff to do with this end this grid
system if you will attend here
and that the fabric template that I'm
making you can see all the source code
now I'll explain it is late to date but
together is going this is all been done
so that you can start with a website
with a grid system ready for you to use
you don't need to really know much more
than it's now going to contain the grids
within this area if you will and as you
go down the roll it gives you all these
options and you can see the source code
nice and easy and just think of these
containers as way they want to place
your content and in general you'd have
if you want any background to be the
hundred-percent width like as you drag
out and some websites have a lot of in
fact if we go to your angel 6 take a
look here you've got a full width blue
background that just keeps expanding but
the content is within this grid here
this area that you see here so the
initial outline if you will the main
full width will be our nav item and then
this content is wrapped inside this grid
there will be called the wrapper if you
will so that it can stay you know the
width of the page so if we go back to
here this enough would have a background
that's going to span the whole width and
then in order to wrap our image in that
we're going to just rock a div inside of
here and we'll move the menu items
inside so this dip will then become the
wrapper that I'll stay within the grids
width so we'll fix that to the same
width as the grid and then inside there
we've got the menu items we also then
want an image so because the image is on
the left and it lays out left to right
by default to make it easier for the CSS
we will pop the image first
so we'll just scroll this logo I'm gonna
type in image source equals assets
images logo flat dot PNG and save that
and by default images are due to the
template again we make images 100% width
by default the one thing we will do is
just quickly Nick the already existing
image you've got from the fabric modern
one template so we just got into the the
first one we created with the fabric
modern one template web brutes assets
where brute assets images and then this
is this logo so we're just pinching that
we're gonna chuck it inside of our new
blank one in the assets and dump an
image in here and then if we refresh
this we should see that image so you can
put any image this is Wade simply locate
your you know the logo you want for here
now and then we've got the list so got a
top navigation we have the image with
the link in there we have the menu items
and then the one other thing we will
want which will use some JavaScript to
make fully work but for now we'll drop
it in is when this website goes small we
want the hamburger menu the which by
that I mean you know this type of thing
here that's all hamburger menu so we'll
place that in HTML so it's really there
so I'll call this menu icon I guess and
we'll just make this div and do want a
menu icon the one thing we'll do here
invite me you don't need to do class
there well fearful will put a class here
just to make it a bit easier to select
inside so now I don't want to put many
classes I couldn't remove it but for now
we'll just chop this one extra class in
just to make it quick and easier to
select that icon and again you'll see
this coming together as we start styling
the CSS inside that div we will show
another link because it's a clickable
link if you will and also the again the
fabric template system has got icons
built in so this is what this icon sheet
she says so if we were to go to here and
for
towards lash icon - cheat cheat cheat
cheat cheat sheet we see all these icons
and these icons are the ion which is a
bunch of icons like loads of icons you
can scroll down in a font file and they
are MIT license which is open source
like everything I'm doing at the moment
so it was a good fit just gives you
loads of icons you can make yourself
that are vector so the scale is large as
you want and they're very small with
them being you know vector icons so this
is already baked into the fabric
template system if you will and again
you can take a look at it by just
looking at the source code in the SAS
folder so you can see fonts you've got
ion fonts you've got all the original
links to you know the guy that made this
and all the source code so again you can
check that out but it's just basically
an icon font file fairly standard thing
so you can make use of that and we'll do
that for the hamburger menu if you want
the icon because they have one in that
icon list so we took a look at that
cheat sheet you'd find that there is one
in and to make you sahabat you do an eye
and so you open and close this eye and
then in here you simply out of class and
the class for that is eye on another
icon around nothing guess if we save you
can see there this is the little icon so
that's again ignore how it's all just
dumping in was simply getting the HTML
ready so we have now I think here
basically this is the HTML structure
then we'll play with and you don't
necessarily always just make this in one
go and you simply then move to CSS
there'd be a lot of going back and
forward you'd you'd make it as clean as
you can then you start styling with CSS
then you'll find out that you you know
I'm I need to move this up or down or
you might need an extra div or things
but because I've just made this I know
this is gonna be a usable structure but
all you're trying to think in general if
you're making this at first
is you look at something then you go
like here that you've got a menu at the
top so you know you've got an icon and a
logo area if you will and you've got
your main links so you'd make a link
there and then you potentially think as
you're doing it you go to mobile and you
see you get this other icon so you start
building up and the more you do this as
we build the whole website you'll get a
feel for what we're doing so right now
your planet just be following along and
you're not sure why you've made these
choices but until you do it enough times
and you'll realize why
that'll naturally come so don't worry
too much if you don't fully get the
choices we've made here because you just
you just won't until you've done it a
few times so all you can think of devs
are kind of generic groups as you you'd
jump down and as you start applying
styles to dips you'll get a feel for you
just think of them as kind of boxed
areas like this could be a div around
the bottom this could be another div and
then you simply style it so this divs
50% and left-aligned and this is 50% and
right aligned and things like that so
you'll get the feel as you do more
styling of what to do but majority of it
is basically a bunch of divs that your
style so you got a nav which is
basically a div just with the nav name
another day of another day of it's just
basically a bunch of sectional areas
that you're styling so we'll start with
this now and the only real key thing we
have to start with is this top menu
standard two class that we've given so
to start styling let's jump into the
style dot CSS starter class which is
basically slots with a dot and then top
menu standard two is the name so now in
the style that's us and I usually check
to make sure I've actually got the in
the area selected first start with
simply type in display:none which will
completely hide it and if you say if and
it goes you know you've managed to
select my item and I've done the video
on CSS and SATs which shows you how you
select all these things
so if you're unsure you can watch that
previous video so now we know we're
happy that we've got this top menu
standard and we know that initially
we've got the div which is the whole
background that we're talking about
so we'll start styling that by we will
because as top menu is gonna stick to
the top and we're gonna scroll down this
content like here wants to stay
underneath so if we first make I guess
we can make the the position of this
whole div so if we do position there's
one item called fixed and if we save
you'll see now it's kind of jumped and
Sutter above everything else and as you
scroll everything is like behind it so
fixed as as it states it's never moves
regardless of the page scroll and that's
kind of how we want the menu to be so
we'll do fixed position and again by
default it's sticking to the top but if
we type in top zero to force it to the
very top you'll notice it didn't
necessarily start at the top so the top
position was pushed out and so will
explicitly state it's a fixed position
and it starts at the top then you'll
also notice that if we put a background
color on so we will want start with the
main background color and these colors
I'm going to pull in from the fabric
color schemes so we have a palette here
which you can edit to suit your colors
and these are again I spoke about this
in a previous video but we have really
like a main dark color to main highlight
colors then two main shades of the
highlight colors and then two generic
bright and dull colors and that should
be enough throughout the whole website
for majority of all things so if you're
gonna change this theme generally keep
it that these two are your standard kind
of usually use for text very usually
white and black that you need for the
general site then you have a kind of
your themed dark background your theme
to bright colors and your theme to dark
colors that are matching those bright
colors so like two and four pair up
three and five pair off that's how I've
kind of worked this theme system in so
we're gonna keep the standards because
it's already themes for the right color
for me I'm going to make the background
of this menu the
caller one which is the background of
this already so we'll do background
Palawan and save and I can see if we did
a quick border one pips or solid red
you'll see
now we've fixed it to the top by default
the width of this is no longer 100% the
default is now simply the size it needs
to be so because we want the top menu to
be all the way across we then want to
force the width to be 100% so max width
so I'll do with 100% and will force the
width back out to 100% then we have get
without border now if you see that yeah
we also want to change the standard
color of the these icons the you know
the general color of anything in the
mouth to the standard plain color here
which is why you should cover 6 so I'll
say text is general bright color
call it 6 and you'll see all that's done
really is made the the dots white
because these are all links so
everything else has kind of already
styled with a link but either way if we
were to change anything about anything
we want the top menu to generally be you
know the white color so we'll start with
that also even though everything's
appearing below the menu right now if we
were to style things differently like
this fabric sample grid say say just for
whatever reason some you know the user
or the developer of the page decides to
go oh I want this to be on the higher
level because they're trying to arrange
their CSS the map chocolate honors at
index of 3 which hasn't seemed to
actually worked
interesting oh there we go so you can
see here I've chopped in the said index
on out chopped on the specific
Paul and you can see that showing above
the menu by you know things that are you
know users can end up styling as that
index and the Zed index is the 3d layer
so you think of the webpage as every
element is stacked one on top of the
other coming out towards the screen when
nothing is specified then the Zed index
is rule 0 but users can change the Zed
index so to be sure that our menu always
stays on top will basically make sure
menu stays above everything else and
typically a safe Zed index it's like a
thousand you're talking you know when
you style you tip to do is add the next
one to ten maybe a hundred but keeping
it a thousand simply keeps the top menu
above everything else so so long as you
your style it correctly you shouldn't
have any issues there so that's the
start we'll come back to other bits
after we now want to let's first select
the inner because we mentioned now this
will grow to just keep growing and
growing and growing you can see the
width goats the whole size of the page
regardless well we want that top menu to
wrap inside of a wrapper so let me just
first put this in so that image isn't
ridiculously large for the moment just
Chuck that in with water so it's a bit
more realistic to see now so you can see
this menus coming right out to the
corner even though the grids clearly
stopping here so as you're doing that
that's obviously wrong and that's
because we put in this div to wrap to
the size of this grid which is again the
fabric grid that we've got so we want to
wrap the first div so we'll first select
the the wrapper if you will which is
basically the first div and that's how
you make selections to it and we've
already got a class built into the
fabric engine again which is
called the grid wrapper so we can just
do the extend sass function which simply
makes this class copy all the content of
another class and that class is grid
wrapper so we did that and now expand
you can see now our menu is staying
within the grids area and to make it
really obvious if your district or
background call we read in to see you
can see there's the wrapper area and
it's stayin within the grids area and if
you want to see this grid wrapper you
know what's the squid wrapper doing
press control shift + f4 find and just
type in grid - wrapper and press Enter
and you can see it's inside of this
class here the grid the DNA fabric grid
styles and it's a grid wrapper and alls
it's doing is making the padding to be
matching the grid column padding and the
match width to be the grid max width so
we could just simply say max width is
this and get the grid the fabric grid
max width value which is in the settings
and that's simply the max width of this
grid layout but because there's no real
harm in all the other values inside the
grid we simply extend the grid wrapper
so we can say make menu rough two grids
match width and that will keep our menu
styled the same width as you know
everything else that in the website
which is going to wrap to this grid so
we've got the overall width there then
we want to we also need a padding you
can see all this is right to the top you
know right to the top of the page so
inside of will do it on the main top
menu content you could do it inside the
div as well but we can do it inside the
main content you can say add top/bottom
padding' and to do that you can do from
padding and really we want to start
specifying some variables so because
this menu is going to be usable as a
module of your well that can be dumped
into anywhere
and changed and said they're simply
typing affixed padding we'll just don't
put a variable up here for now and then
this will move into the the fàbregas
engine system later and we will say top
menu what we'll have standard padding I
guess because this is gonna be a top
menu and the style is gonna be standard
and we'll call it padding so the top
menu standard padding will make use of
again the fabric engine base spacing
system which is spacing normal and then
the padding here will be this volume
this is the base of the top menus
top/bottom padding' and again by making
use of the existing spacing system in
the fabric template engine then it keeps
everything proportional and
aesthetically nice so you can see now
we've got the spacing here from top to
bottom which actually matches the
spacing here between the each grid
element so because we're gonna use that
throughout the site it will make
everything stay proportionally spaced
out the same and that will give a nice
professional feel and a very aesthetic
appearance so we've added the pad in
there
you'll also notice because we have this
fixed above all the contents below you
know that you can't see so the some
content here so once we've styled the
grid or rather styled the whole top menu
and we have the overall height well then
add padding to any element that comes
after to push it below the menu but we
won't do that until we've kind of
finished styling everything as always
stuff to remember to come back to that
so we'll move on now let's just delete
this temporary image thing here and
let's fix this image up so inside the
diff because it goes in the nav than in
the dev and now it says image will style
the image net so it's directly inside
the div and it's an image and here we
want to have a height which basically
what we just specified we have a high
but instead of typing directly again
we'll make a variable so we'll so
a logo height and we'll simply do top
menu standard logo height and that will
be it will do spacing probably largest I
think I might be enough should be enough
we'll see and then again the reason
we're sizing everything based on these
spacings is again for the aesthetics so
instead of just putting random values if
you keep everything based off the space
in size and it's proportional to it then
I can say what you'll find is naturally
things just look right
the size is end up looking correct make
the width or toe so it scales based on
the size of the height and you can see
there's the number six now and again
wouldn't you start looking at that you
see that then I can't compare to let's
say the text height it kind of matches
nicely it just generally looks right and
that is because of following this
standard spacing so here we will set set
image size and we can also do something
cool so on hover of this we want to kind
of do something so I can put a shake
animation and again built into this
fabric template we have started just one
I've started to make animations so if
you look in the sass and you want to
know how it's done then it's quite
simply here so I've just made a class
called shake and on hover when you hover
over anything with a class of shake it
will start the animation called shake
that'll last for 0.8 two seconds and it
will do a cubic Bezier or which is
basically the speed at which it does the
animation in a certain pattern and we we
do a translates of 0 to keep it fixed
and then we just do these keyframes so
this is basic CSS animations which we'll
do another video on but for now you can
already make use of this existing one if
you like and then again like I say I'll
do videos on CSS animations but this is
just a cool one so we'll chop this in so
for the image so you don't have to go in
here and go image plus equal shape which
and like I'm saying you want to avoid as
much as possible either because then if
you want to change the class you've got
to go back to the HTML I prefer to try
and make the HTML rock-solid that needs
no editing and any changes you need then
can happen in the CSS if you start going
well I want this icon to shake and I'll
put a class in here shake but then I've
styled everything else in here you've
got yarn really separating your concerns
and it's it's very hard in the web to
separate your concerns because HTML and
CSS are very tightly joined anyway you
know this structure is now very hard
coded with this structure but the best
we can do at least is to start with a
top-level class and then as much as
possible simply work on the hard
structure so this keeps as clean as
possible so long story short you could
just put class equals shape on this
image and it would shake but the same
thing in the sass file is to do the
extend like we've done here so if we
simply then say extend shape it will do
the same thing it will add the shape
class to this image for the most part
you won't technically out the class name
shape but what it will do is now this
style will have all the properties of
this shape class so it's exactly the
same thing but now of any point we
wanted to change it with and just change
it here so now if we go to here you can
see when we hover okay there's a nice
shake effect just a little visual nicety
so on the website the scrolling through
in the app to hover and the like oh
what's you know just look so just that
little thing that I think looks nice on
this particular website because I'm
going for a kind of you can see kind of
an organic DNA evolving number six so
it's kind of goes with that that it's
got some motion in it so make it shape
on hover we've set the size up there and
then I think that's it for now one thing
we'll do because this will start
animating when you scroll down we'll
want to reduce the size of the
the icon and things we will want this to
animate smoothly so to do or rather it's
called transitioning transition smoothly
so I'll come back to this but I'll put a
note so I don't forget and I think also
want to do that on the top level one
here the main menu because that will be
shrinking it's probably padding maybe so
I'll put some little to do so don't
forget otherwise I'll I don't forgetting
to do that so now we've got this image
styled there I think that's all we need
touch that looks fine and goes
everywhere needs for now so we've done
the image so this would be the little
girl now we'll move on to this menu list
which is here so we'll start with menu
items and here because we have div then
an image than a div telling you well it
kind of makes it a bit easier so I mean
we could we can select this one with you
well so I think we will do yeah let's
move on to this ul first so to select
this then we'll do the UL so we are
inside the div and then we want the UL
so this will select the menu list there
now we want to first want to remove all
the UL styling to get rid of the the
natural indent that we've got here and
the bullet icons and everything else
like that and then we will want to float
all of these to the left so they go in
line so instead of going down they go
horizontally across now again I've done
that if we take a look at the sass
folder fabric layout and then menus and
I've made a horizontal menu there which
is the one we will extend and this
extends horizontal so we'll take a look
at horizontal which is in less
so the first thing in order to clear all
the styles on this list we basically
have to set the list style to outside
none on it's like a blanking thing
remove the padding remove the margin and
make each item inline-block so instead
of them being block items on the line on
their own in line block sets them like
textures so again I explained this in a
previous video but this will blank off
basically turn in an ordered unordered
list
remove all styling and each item in the
list simply turn into an inline block so
that means each one of these will simply
flow across so we were to just copy and
paste this in for now and show you one
line at a time what happens then you'll
get a feel for what's going on so if we
were to comment this comment this
comment this let's make the background
read again just so you can see and we
start with just the background being
read first so you can see where this UL
is so you can see by default this UL
that's got padding on margin on the
right margin on the left margin top
margin bottom going around it so first
if we bar remove the list which should
get rid of these bullets and then we
move them bullets so it doesn't show
anything but it doesn't got rid of the
padding or the margin inside the list
items it also hasn't got rid of them the
padding on margin outside so we remove
the padding you won't see much you'll
see that go which is the padding way it
pushes the list items in the margin
should then remove the outer ones which
will then top and bottom so actually
what you're seeing here is there we go
the what you seen this edge here if we
inspect if you're wondering where it is
then you can simply see as you click the
top menu we've put padding around to
bring it in that's that padding we're
talking about so we brought that menu in
naturally which seeing that do we want
to pad all around I think so because it
just makes it nice and yet inline so
that's
or padding around their brother were to
turn this color blue say see there's our
party you removed the padding and
there's the background so you can see
that kind of nicely basically we've
removed all the padding it's the bottom
line now we've got rid of the padding
and the margin around the the UL and now
it's it's forming right around and then
each item we make in line list and then
you can see they all basically flow one
after the other so by doing this style
it just turns an unordered list that
goes down with bullet points into a
straight forward kind of one after the
other list in horizontal order and this
is how you do this is just a basic way
of blanking out an unordered list so
instead of having to tap that in there
because I've made it a built-in class
called horizontal we can just do the at
extend horizontally and you can see the
dots don't go to a dot you can see the
point of this fabric template stuff is
so that you can do nice quick things
like this it gives you helper classes
but the helper classes are nice and
clean and short and you can always go
and simply find them in this you know
system so you're not just going well I
don't know what that does or why it's a
simple thing that there's a lot of
standard things you do in HTML and CSS
like this to blank out a list and turn
it horizontal that you just don't want
to keep repeating yourself so we eat ads
these basic classes to it so turn UL
into horizontal list and that's the
first bit then the next thing you saw
was actually a horizontal menu of come
from a list to a kind of a menu style
and that's the next class up I did so we
made a horizontal list like this and
then all we had to do was inside of the
list items we would change the any
anchors within them because that's
typically what you do in a menu you have
an unordered list a list item and then
an anchor to click so it's expecting
this style of HTML to work
and then inside of each of those we set
the font size large the font weight the
padding so again what we'll do we'll
copy all this and we'll do one line at a
time so you can see what's going on so
we go into here we extend and we start
with so the line height is basically
because if you want to do some vertical
alignment yet one of the tricks is to
set the line height to a specific size
to make it central so this is kind of
like a reset if in case the user
explicitly sets a line height so on this
example you won't see anything change so
we just delete that for now doesn't
really matter for in the the core system
I've added that the transition will come
back to that's again the well the
transition is basically a if you change
the size from one thing to another this
makes an animation between those things
so by doing a transition on the padding
and the color like we've done here and
using this value transition normal which
again is simply in the settings I
believe of the fabric template engine we
are basically like 0.7 seconds and ease
as the output so this ends up boiling
down to transition 0.7 seconds ease and
color 0.7 seconds ease it's just that
they're stored in variables and by
adding this it means that if we change
the padding or the color on these items
that they'll fade nicely so you can
already see the anchors already fade so
that colors fade in nicely and then the
padding if you were to change its see
animate so you wouldn't see that yet
because not changing so I'll still eat
that so the first thing we do we can
comment out the others these are all
nice simple CSS edits so you'll see come
together in a nice order so we start
with nothing the first thing we do is
change the font size
now we haven't put this inside of the
list item which we should so we can
select the list item and then the anchor
button to copy and pasted it correctly
so you can see there now we make the
font Becker first which is one thing we
want we make the font weight light so
it's not thick so it's now gone thin all
simple stuff we make the padding around
each item you know the gap around all
these the top and bottom small so you
get a small padding top and bottom and
the left and right to the normal size so
we'll add some padding around like this
to space them out nicely and then for
each item if we then make the background
red you'll see there's the background
and if we were then to also make this
unordered list background blue so you
can see that you'll see that basically
there's an ordered list it's not really
expanding we do highlight say 200 pixels
so you can see that this is how it's
currently laying out as they'd it's
flowing inline-block
and that the unordered list is not taken
into account the padding on the list
items so if you change the display of a
list item or rather the anchor inside of
the list item to a list item itself it
fixes that kind of positioning issue and
moves them inside so again this is just
simply a thing you'll learn in CSS and
this is one of the the main annoyances
if you will of CSS I find that a lot of
this is just you get used to it you
build items you build some values in CSS
and HTML and you figure out the best way
of doing things it's mostly trial and
error you understand most things but
then you'll try all different things and
see what your result end up with and
that's why again I keep doing back to
like why I've made this fabric templates
dothis so you don't have to remember all
this stuff you can see how it's done and
you can build it up as you go and you'll
learn this knowledge yourself but in the
meantime then once you've made it once
and you've made
this kind of menu you'll that makes a to
three more websites and you'll change
styles and do things then you'll have
forgotten how you made this this top
menu and you'll basically remake it
again doing the same procedure you're
kind of figure out where you're going
you'll dump things in you'll see what
works and it's that kind of repeat
behavior that instead of having to
constantly repeat yourself you can just
simply then make use of the underlying
classes in this template system but the
difference with this as I keep this
super clean as I keep mentioning so all
the existing web templating systems out
there are so overloaded they've got so
much in they use third party things
inside them there's hundreds of files
there's hundreds of dependencies you
know they're really messy and clustered
so this is more of a you know
developer's kit if you will people that
really want to stay close to the code
and not have anything else in it that's
needed and this is all that's needed to
make a menu and that's all that'll be in
there so again I guess I keep coming
back to if you don't necessarily
understand this because this is your
first delve into the the CSS world it
doesn't really change unfortunate this
is kind of how it works you'll get used
to knowing what padding does and font
weight and font size from plain but then
you'll just build this all kind of well
at least I'll this is how I work I build
it up as I'm going like this step by
step I know this one's spacing around so
I'll triple spacing
we've still got our line this over to
the right yet but I do it in kind of
steps under the font wants to be bigger
so I'll make it bigger I know it wants
be lighter so I'll make it lighter put
the padding around a little ease work in
steps the next step is I want this color
to be white so we change it to the color
theme white there and then by setting
the color you have overridden the
original hover effect of the links like
this one's got so then we have to set
the hover effect to then call a two in
the theme so when you hover it now goes
to that color so you can see I'm just
building up in chunks an order then for
all this to do that we kind of now have
a menu so we set the background to red
again so you can see the background
you've got your menu there you have
the you know that the menus now spanning
the full width and everything's left
aligned but it looks like a menu so
that's kind of getting getting to the
point of what I would call just
basically a horizontal menu to me that's
a fixed style that's kind of a nice
theme it's it's big writing is links and
it looks like basically a standard
horizontal menu that you can use in any
website so that's why then at this point
I chose to turn all this little bit of
style that's a lie style here into the
other class which we called put in the
menus file and I called it the
horizontal menu so again all those
styles are baked in now so we can make
use of that without having to repeat
ourselves and we'll also then or rather
instead of extending the horizontal
class because this horizontal menu
already extend this horizontal class you
just have to now extend horizontal menu
instead so we'll just do horizontal -
menu and we'll find now so long as I
didn't give any errors yeah it's fine
that we have the horizontal menu style
you know the generic one that we can use
in any other part of the website is the
point so we've now got a horizontal menu
not ours on the list and the next fix is
we want this menu to be over to the
right so simple way of doing that is a
value called float which you don't want
to use often because it takes things out
of the general alignment of the HTML but
in this case is fits ideal so menu to
the right never you save that you'll see
the menus jumped over to the right which
is we know where we want it so let's go
over to the right in fact if I just
enable developer tools a minute
responsive design then I can now kind of
drag this
slides around so we can see there's the
size of the menu which works for the top
menu you know the appearance that we
want for the top menu so we will have
what else is there I'm just trying to
think why this would not be we want to
get this up here don't have a quick look
at the structure
I think what's stopping this is yeah
we've got this menu icon which is taking
up the full width right now as well
otherwise this menu will he been floated
when he was floating right it should
just bump up wherever it can fit which
should fit in that gap so because we've
got this menu icon at the moment taking
up the full width I think we'll just
jump back and let's fix this hamburger
menu if you will so let's go backwards a
minute we've got the logo we've got the
menu items so in the middle we'll just
put in here the menu icon now this is
why I ended up when I did this putting a
clasp on here we can remove this class
let's just go ahead and remove the clasp
because we could have then just selected
it in style here by just Jun menu icon
but again as I mentioned you want to
keep the classes as small as possible so
what we'll do here instead is select the
the div that comes after the image so we
can do basically the image with plus div
and again that should now select if we
make it invisible the hamburger menu so
they go the hamburger menu is gone you
can also see from that then this is now
floated to the top and then basically
once it can't fit in it jumps below
which we won't care about because once
we get that low we're gonna turn this
menu into the hamburger menu so we're
gonna add some responsiveness but now
there's the overall you know menu
starting to look very close to to what
we want it to be so let's just fix this
menu icon in that case
so the menu icon we want to be I guess
hidden by default so at the you know
regularly it's just not shown so I've
got a class again which we just extend
called hidden and again if you want to
see what that is
control shift fine type dot hidden and
go to the class and it just simply says
display not so it's as simple as you
could type just displaying on but I just
do hidden because I've got the class
there just a it's a bit more explanatory
you know when you you're looking at the
code again it says hidden it's kind of
obvious is gonna hide it so I know it's
a bit weird having a class for a single
element li you could simply type just
plain non instead but I just prefer the
look of it seen hidden none of any point
in the whole system we ended up deciding
to change how we hide items it's in one
place instead of having to go and change
everywhere wherever you're at display
not so by default it's hidden which is
what we did already anyway and then what
we want to do is bring this menu in when
the the algebra this we want it to be
when we are below say laptop in terms of
size so to do the responsiveness again
we saw in the responsive video all
you're doing really is making a media
query so you're saying you know at media
blah blah blah and doing you your
specific media query the fabric template
engines got a helper built in so all we
have to do whenever we want to do
certain things at certain sizes of a
screen as we do we can do well in fact
I've got a helper for that as well but
basically you would do the art include
media which is my helper mixing in this
version and then we've got specific
break points so if you wants to look a
break point you could do dollar break
point
and you'll see then where is the brick
bit easier to just look for them here so
SAS base breakpoints and you can see we
have these values defined and this is
baked into this whole template system so
the website's expected to have these
specific points at which it changes its
style or class in anything above a
thousand pixels a desktop anything below
a thousand is a laptop anything below
900 so anything between 600 and 900
tablets and anything below 600 sends a
mobile so you've got four kind of break
points of your watch as these which you
can reference and then you've also got
things that are below so below desktop
effectively that would be mobile tablet
and laptop and below laptop would be
male about on tablet and then anything
below tablets simply gonna be mobile so
you can make use of all these
breakpoints to do you know what you need
to do and you could do here then media
and specify a break point so you can say
media break point would be we want to
show this when it's below laptop so you
can do this include media below laptop
and then we could have display is block
and then that is now showing apparently
that's below a laptop so let's just make
this big and go larger and they cease
disappeared there and when we hit below
a thousand pixels or rather below 904
below laptop then the menu appears so
we've got the breakpoint
I think that's maybe yeah that's about
right because if we look at the blog
it's getting close to the writing if we
were to go to the next breakpoint which
is 600 then it's way too small would be
down here so the point at which you want
to bring in the hamburger menu is is
there
right about there which is the 900 so we
brought it in at the right time we've
made the style just say when it's below
laptop 1 below laptop you know show
block again because showing and hiding
about certain breakpoint says is fairly
common I've made a fairly useful little
class already that you can make use of
so all you need to do for to replace all
this which is doing just exactly what
you seen here we can do an extend again
for a class this time we want to include
the this below laptop value which is
just the text to be low - lap button
Casey changes in a variable or to make
use of that variable instead and
basically it's gonna say where extend
below lap shit'll block which is just a
class I've made if we save that I should
have the same effect and when we're
above the laptop then it goes away so
we've got the same thing happening it's
just that it's in a class but because
this value is in a variable in case we
change that name or in case you decide
to change that name you replace the
below lap part of the name with
basically hash and then two curly
brackets and inside there
place the variable name and this bit
here gets replaced with the actual
variable itself that break point below
laptop which if you do control shift
find or rather again that's easy to see
just go to the break point class it's
this break point below laptop see it's
going to be below lap so for that we
save we get exactly the same thing again
nothing changes but then we get the menu
shown at the right break point so one
below the laptop show
and that's that bit we also then want to
similarly to the this menu we want to
float it to the right so we'll float to
the right and you'll now see it's up
here so then we want to when we're below
the laptop we want to then eventually
hide this and move it off but we'll do
that after
so we've floated it to the right and we
also want to make it bigger so I think
that's basically a bit small a minute we
just that I think this this is just a
bit small compared to that so we'll make
the font bigger and because this is an
icon in a vector format in a font file
it it's changing size by the font size
so we'll do font size and then use the
variable again built into the template
system so it's all staged proportional
and we will do fun lodge or a large or
maybe there we go that's nice and big
for a menu then so it looks better
I've got the font larger we will now
also tweak the padding because that
padding's got a little bit more there
than it doesn't both do to the standard
padding so if we inspect the item or as
the padding
hmm well rather it's not got the padding
as such it's the this has already got
padding that pushes it out so we just
want to change this padding basically to
loop more in in line so make padding
same all around so for this we will do
spacing small and then we've added the
padding there to push it out kind of
teluk in line if you want to look better
wear it you know the position wise so I
think our padding looks better than
before kind of keeps it like I say in
there
the correct spacing and then we we can
fix you can't see here as such but I
tend to get really annoyed by visual
lines and this font with it being an
icon it's not actually on the base line
of a font file so we just then do
vertical align in middle and then say
you should see this slightly tweak I
don't know it doesn't maybe it is
oh yeah there so look that's top and
bottom so that shouldn't be required
yeah so I think that position wise that
isn't too bad men you call up we want to
change so we don't want to be in that
color again let's just change the anchor
within the menu which is the hamburger
and we will have again to do transition
nicely I want to come to doing the
animations nice and smooth we'll have
the color ask call us six as the white
again so general right color of the well
yeah we want the hover effect we have
in order to what I want to do when we
hover over this as well as I want to
grow this menu so because by default
this is in line not an inline block in
line as we say like individual text like
as you type that's right in each
character here is an inline item an
inline block it's got its own kind of
group around it these are inline blocks
so you can add padding to them you can
add margin spacing you can scale them
inline as opposed to inline block they
can't be change you know you can't have
padding around them individually so
we'll make an inline block which I'm
wondering whether changes the height
there we go so change the inline block
so you can scale and then we will have
on hover we will change the color to go
to the pinky color right on the color
and now we get the nice color there and
this is where we now want to grow so
grow when we hover and to do that we can
just do transform scale 130 percent on
the act on y-axis now when we hover the
menu grows and if you see if we remove
the display:inline-block that it won't
grow because it's inline so that's why
you have the inline block because it
allows scaling you will also tell we
actually need to make sure the transform
origin is 50% 50% which means where it
scales from is the center as opposed the
top-left corner so we were to scale it
by
three times a sighs there's a bit more
dramatic and remove this possession as
we scale oh by default this one's
actually central anyway but sometimes
their origin might not be there so if we
set the origin to zero zero you'd see
that it grow from the top left so
instead of leaving up to the browser to
decide we explicitly tell it that we
want to transform from the center and
then we want to transform by you know 30
percent and there's that now this is
where I want to start adding transitions
so things look smoother so right now
that is just an instant grill so here
where we did the transition in order for
it to smoothly transition between them
guitar transition and then you specify
the properties that you want to
transition so in this case this will be
the transform property so tap transform
and then you can type into 0.7 seconds
and save and that will now grow nicely
in shrink nicely but instead of
specifying and then you can also specify
type like ease so it's it grows kind of
gradually or you can specify like linear
so it's a constant direct path of growth
you can see that's doesn't speed up or
slow down
whereas ease has more of a starts off
slow speeds up and slows down so these
are kind of your animation curves so you
have the property you want to animate
the time and then the type so because
again to keep the whole website looking
the same and not have to retype 0.7
seconds Andy's everywhere you go I'll
turn this into a variable which again if
you just go to the base settings you'll
see them here so I've just made a
standard 0.7 and ease as a property
called transition normal so instead
they're doing the open 70s I'll do
dollar transition normal now I'll do the
same thing but now I can reuse this
property to set all the animations to a
similar thing so transition
we have the bar the hover the color I
think that is probably it for that but
nothing looks alright so now we have as
it grows it's gone as it collapses it's
there so on collapse you want these to
all hide and again we'll bring them in
with JavaScript to when you click this
it kind of grows in so for now we'll
jump back to this menu and get this
hidden so the first thing we want to do
then it is basically when this goes
below laptop when I hide all these as we
say so let's start with that and let's
go to the menu items which is here which
by default always shown and then what we
want to do is do an include media like
you mentioned before so basically this
is going to be when below laptop and
we'll do the dollar sign breakpoints and
use that variable below laptop so
anything in here happens one below
laptop or start with the usual display
nom - first we'll make sure we have it
right you can see it's then disappeared
so the show higher they show they hide
so we know we've got the selection right
so now in here what we want to do
because each item if we look at these
inspect the way the in fact you know
they don't I thought we floated these
and then we do so we don't need to do
anything there we will want to when the
small and the shown we would want them
to be full width cut so one per line so
we want to make full width so with 100%
or rather you can't do with 100% because
they are well we might be able to but
instead what I'm going to do is
you position:absolute so each item can
be positioned oh I'm gonna no I don't
want to do it on I'm doing it oh yeah so
we are in the main I'm thinking each are
in the overall you out the overall list
so start that again got my bearings
let's turn the background to red so you
can see so right now as we're growing
and shrinking we have this you see this
positioning due to the grid layout and
things and the style it's it's not you
know the position isn't right so if we
make the position absolute below laptop
and then we do the left and the right to
zero will effectively get 100% width now
so we drag this menu to on represent
with so when it's up there it just
floats to the right over that's the
point we need to remove that float I
mean technically we don't need to remove
the floats because the absolute
positioning removes it but it's it's
nicer for their the browser to layout
easier so we remove the float and then
with position basically absolute from
relative to weight would already be and
make it a hundred percent width and
height so it drops below drop fill of
the icons and we've made the width all
the way across now we would want to we
really want this background to cover
everything so let's make the height will
do two thousand percent if we do say
100% height you might think to take up
the whole page but this height value is
based on its parent which is actually
this menu above so this height is
exactly this height because the Heights
coming from the parent so because the
hat is coming from the top menu we want
to just make it a really large value so
we can set it to a static pixel size but
we can judge the proportion that your
top menu
should never be 20 times smaller than
the pages hacked is basically the
principle on based on so we did a two
thousand percent height then in almost
every situation on a big device you can
imagine that's gonna fill the screen so
that gives us kind of this overall fill
the page basically with the background
which we also don't have because I've
set this to red just to show you that
but by default when we float we lose the
background so when you do that add
background back in that we lost from
position absolute the background would
then be the color one again to bring the
background in so there we have the
background being brought back in and
then what we want now is for each of
these items to be shown on their own
line so let's select each item and then
in here we should be able to do are we
be a little laptop yes we are basically
under it with under percent and then
text-align:center and there we have a
menu that's kind of how we want it to
look so when it collapses you get this
menu when it's above you get this menu
and obviously will hide and show this
with JavaScript now so we can do it by
injecting a class directly but that
we're getting there now so you may end
up some width and then what we'll need
to do in order to animate this in by
default when it's below laptop we will
hide off to the left and we'll do that
with a
form because that's hardware-assisted so
it works better do - 100% on the width
and zero for the height so I'll
basically ship this off to the left so
we don't - 50% you'd see we're shifting
it off we're starting to shift it to the
you know that way so - hundred percent
shifts it right the way off the page so
we know it's there and we know it looks
right but we simply shifted it off by
default and then what we're gonna do in
JavaScript is when we click this
hamburger menu so when we click this
icon here we'll you want we're gonna add
a cloth to this with menu item list and
we are going to then style it based on
that so we'll simply be adding a class
and removing a class from this list so
we did class equals and then we did
we'll call expanded I guess and saved
again this this won't stay and this will
be injected by JavaScript but then if we
were to style all of this based on that
we would want to below laptop all this
lot runs from there hide off to the left
and show when it's got the expanded
class so we then do and cold and dot
expanded when it's expanded reward
change the transform to 0 0 to bring it
back in so because we've got that class
on we inspect this I've got this class
we were to change the name this he's
disappeared and then if we were to
collect the menu let's brought back in
so again we want to make this smooth so
transition smoothly and we'll do
transition the transform I think it'll
be and then again the transition normal
value and I think
I shouldn't do so now in here if the
JavaScript was to remove the class you
see slides out and we add the class back
and it slides in so that's how the menu
will now react as soon as we add
JavaScript to do it but we can easily
play with it by I'll take editing this
so you can see that the menu will slide
off and the menu will slide in so
there's this menu kind of done if we
remove that class now because we know
that will work when we are out here and
in there that's all done I think there's
nothing wrong with that now and then
obviously that's this animation will
happen now with JavaScript which we'll
do in the next video but we now have a
menu thing you're almost done the only
other difference I've have is when we
scroll down we want to kind of reduce
this menu pad enum and sighs so just
shrinks a little bit and doesn't take up
as much space as soon as we start to
scroll so again the scrolling action
will do with JavaScript but we can at
least add the style to you know the
class so we'll do that now and what we
will do is basically when we're scroll
below certain point we're going to add a
class again to the overall top menu and
we'll add a class called we used to say
wouldn't be anything class you want and
when we're then reduced we want to style
this differently so now we've got the
reduced class applied for now just to
visually see let's do what we want to do
so the first thing we will do is add
scroll up we have the menu itself we've
got all this here got padding so the
padding is there and then and dot
reduced so when the menu reduces in size
we will want to reduce the padding so
we'll take this padding
and we'll say reduce party we've got top
menu standard padding so we'll have a
new variable called top menu standard
reduced padding and then the user can
tweak the value up here copy and paste
this reduced padding and we love chains
up to small probably and you can see
then the padding is reduced turn off
this responsive mirrored you see the
padding is now reduced to what it was so
if we were to comment on a minute
there's the original which we have to
stay just above so that's how it looks
without being reduced and that's how it
looks with being reduced again you can
see there's no animation there so in
here we've got to do transition smoothly
I'll add a transition for the padding
and transition normal and now when we
edit the class which is what happened
this reduced would be removed you can
see transitions nice and cleanly so as
we add it back and effectively scroll it
reduces down there we will want to do a
little bit more as well we want the
image to reduce in size so as well as
the padding we will then have we have to
go back inside the div into the image
again so div image reduce image size and
the image height slack here copy and
paste in and we'll have the same thing
logo standard logo or standard reduced
logo height
and from spacing largest will go to say
just spaceman larger maybe and again
that whale just jump
so they animate but the logo just jumps
so we want to add the animation to the
image which we've got here to do
transition and that will be transition
height in this case transition normal
and now when we change it to from
reduced default and now grows nicely and
then shrinks nicely now we also want
this text this text is a little bit
large so let's say we want to make the
text not as large as well reduce menu
items font size for that to be the dev
than anybody ul then it would be the day
of the UL our eye and then the a so get
right down into the specific menu items
and that would be I think we reduce the
font size but do we know I keep the font
size sorry I will reduce the padding so
we just menu items padding I mean you
can reduce the font size that you want
I'll just shrink the padding down and
again we'll have what did we have we'll
put this in - maybe
spacing normal that's more or less
that's more so we will do small say
there we go and again that is not done
thing that I'll animate let's just see
so oh yeah it does so that's the
animation from full-sized downs like a
smaller menu the other one we've got to
do is this icon so that's the smaller
menu and then the larger menu so you can
see the we don't reduce the hamburger so
we might want to remove the padding on
the hamburger as well so the same as we
did with the item padding reduce menu
icon padding and this is just all what
you can start doing issue respond to you
know the class peanut it's all pretty
simple stuff as that would be the the
first day of then it was the image plus
div selection so its base of the div
that comes after the image and then we
reduced that padding to small as well
which I think will be enough I was that
not changed I just double check in fact
that doesn't change anything because we
only we already had small on there so
actually that one's redundant touch
already got the correct padding in the
first place so that's that that's the
reduced and the grown so I think now we
have all the CSS in place to do this
menu and also need to do is tie in the
JavaScript that will effectively add
that reduced style when we scroll and
when we click this it would add a class
to here or expanded to
this menu and that will tie in you know
there so this has been quite a I'd say
complex start really to the web design
because the top menu is typically the
most complicated thing to do anyway so
we've kind of jumped in at the deep end
and you just really see me doing this
raw so I know I've made this already but
I've pretty much just then remade it on
the fly and kind of work through and
you've seen just this is how I work
naturally this is actually how I build
this office through a kind of trial and
error and doing it step by step so as
all my videos as we go on will explain
more in depth but the initial starting
point is always a bit rough you have to
kind of just get going you have to be
chopped in at the deep end and and just
see how it's done observe how I build it
and then as we move on to these other
sections they'll come together really
easily you know that you'll find it very
easy and you'll see you know oh this is
a div and this is why the padding works
and this is how the floating works but
in order to get the you know the point
across and the starting point of view
well as menu this is kind of the most
complicated thing you'll do so the only
thing you can really take away from this
video is you're struggling is that this
is as hard as it gets
HTML and CSS don't get any harder this
is it this is this is all that's
involved so if you can build the start
menu this top menu you can build
everything else on a web site with ease
so hopefully it's been enough that you
can understand the flow I know it hasn't
been nice short and simple and
structured and seen this is exactly you
know how we do it and why we do it you
can too just being shown how I put
things together but I say as we progress
this will become a lot more structured
and you'll see how things are done and
why they're done a certain way and this
will all make more sense similar to the
the WPF video is the more you do the
more you'll understand why and then you
can probably come back to this video
when we've finished the whole website
and look at this one again and it'll
make a lot more sense as to why we did
things but like I say there's nothing
more to HTML and CSS than this and the
next few videos after the JavaScript one
on constructing all the content and the
contact pages and all the rest are
really basic and comparison to this so
hopefully this was useful you'll also
see you know you've got
menu then if anything goes wrong this
doesn't look right or something you
can't figure out then all you need to do
is go to your desktop create a folder
called whatever type in we just delete
this new folder type DNA web let it
start up and then just type new template
public modern one and press ENTER twice
and that will then create all the folder
structure all the content and you'll
have the the website here showing you
know everything working fully so this is
what we'll build up to but if this video
you know in the code here doesn't seem
to come together for you you can always
do that and then just inspect the
contents here and the ease you saw is
the sass all the styling you know it's
all in there for you so hopefully this
video is useful and liked in the next
video we'll do the JavaScript that'll
you know make this menu react and form
effectively or your final top menu you
can now use and then once we want to
reuse that in any webpage it's as simple
as then so this wasn't in and we deleted
this out of here so there's nothing in
you could then just tired Dola Dola
exclamation and then fabric dot top menu
standard dollar dollar and save and it
would inject the menu for you
automatically
so you've you haven't had to do anything
you also have to remember is to type in
the the shorthand and then save the file
and this is how it all kinda progress as
we make banners and contact pages and
certain layouts that standard you'll be
able to really quickly slap together the
website by just doing a bunch of these
live valuable includes to just dump in
really common components almost if you
will to the web and then just tweak your
actual content here to suit so any
questions just post them in video and
I'll get back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
