tutorials on WPF which is the framework
for making modern UI in Windows we've
got an example screenshot here of a UI
that we want to make this is actually a
real request from somebody and this is
how we want it to look we're going to
make this exact UI in WPF to give you an
introduction into just generally making
a WPF application making buttons labels
text boxes dropdowns the most common
items so we're going to use this as a
template of what we want to do so we'll
start with that we'll open up visual
studio we'll create a new project now I
want two WPF application with visual
c-sharp
we'll just call this WPF basics I will
create a WPF application which will give
you a assembly info an app config just
containing the framework version and apt
sam'l which if you right click on View
code you'll see it's got a code behind
file and if you double-click you'll see
this tiny bit of zamel that's XML class
file and here's the start up I would you
say main window and then this is the
main window so by default when you
create a WPF application this is the
window that will open so press f5 and
you'll see it compile and then just
generate a blank window so this is a
blank do be powerful and this is what
we're going to modify here this here's
your window and it's similar to HTML so
you start with an angle bracket then the
tie and then your attributes and then
you close the angle bracket and then
everything inside of that until you
reach the same name again but with a
forward slash before the name right here
everything inside of those two areas is
contained within the element so
everything
inside the window is between here and
here which is currently a grid you can
only have a single top-level element in
the window so it has to be a container
type element and what we do in WPF at
least what I do is I tend to type in
here and just watch this window here so
I can visibly see what I'm creating I
don't use this toolbar which you can do
and just go to these controls and drag
and drop them but I prefer to type in
here and I'll talk through how I think
this through whenever I'm making an
application so just resize the window
slightly we'll just zoom out for 100%
we'll hide this from here so let's take
a look at the screenshot so you've got
some buttons along here some properties
down here some checkboxes here so the
first thing to do when I look at
anything is I want to break this UI up
into there's really two main containers
that I use in WPF and you've got a stack
panel and a grid and a stack panel is an
element that if you put items inside of
it like this they'll just stack one
after the other and will sag is based on
what size you need to be so this label
will only be the site it needs to be and
then the box below will be right below
and that's that's a way of stacking
elements so just like a stack you can
stack them vertically you can stack them
horizontally if you need anything more
than a straight stack so like here we've
got two rows then you want a grid and
then a grid can have two columns and
then you can use a stack panel inside to
stack each section so whenever you need
to break this down you first start with
the container to break it down so you
can see in general the whole thing flows
down so we need to start with a stack
panel because we need to stack things
one on top of the other so we'll change
this grid the first element to a stack
panel
and I'll show you what I mean if I just
put a button in here
let's give it and I'll paste three of
them you can see they just stack one on
top of the other and they just take up
the room they need and no more so that's
a stackpanel a grid on the other hand
everything will appear see the grids
taking up the full possible space for
start with and because by default the
grids a single column single row all
three buttons of stacked on top each on
top of each other so all three buttons
are there you can't see the other two
behind so let's just start with the
stack panel and let's create this form
so you can see now we've got a stack
panel we want to start stacking down now
the first set of three buttons you could
use a stack panel here and stack
horizontally but let's show you what
happens when you do that so the stack
panel the main one is this outer
container the whole thing that's going
to contain everything and then we now
need an in a stack panel we're not going
to use the stack panel but we're going
to show you what happens when you do
these three buttons so we've got three
buttons there let's put an in a stack
panel and then inside that in a stack
panel stack these three buttons and then
inside this bit here you can type
orientation and let's change it
horizontal and you can see what's
happened the stack panel only takes up
the amount of space it needs so if this
was just the letter I the button had
only take up just enough space so the
static panels basically take up as much
space as needed and no more so you can
see when we look at the screenshot these
are three evenly divided buttons so what
we want here instead is a grid with
three equal spaced columns so let's go
ahead and change the stack panel here to
a grid get rid of orientation you can
see the grid is now
got a single column so all buttons are
stucked on top so inside the grid do
grid dot column definitions and then
inside the column definitions do column
definition so for the first column the
width and we'll use this Asterix the
star and this mean this is it like a
universal value so if we have three
columns which is as simple as pasting
three if they're all star because
there's three stars in total all of them
become 1/3 exactly one star of you see
so it's a you know a measurement it's
it's not a specific size it's a
measurement of the overall width so if
there's three stars then it's a third if
you put like two star then this one will
take up twice as much space as the ones
with one star so you can see that's
twice the width of those two so that's
exactly half and then those two take up
the remaining half between them so we've
got a call we're going to grid then
we've defined the grid columns here so
there's 3 columns 1 2 3 and they're all
equally spaced we then want to put 3
buttons inside of them which we've done
here so there's the grid there's the end
of the grid so everything inside is
within the grid so you can see these 3
buttons are within it and this is like a
special element inside the grid that
defines the column so it's not really a
like a button or a text box it's
defining how the grid behaves so we've
got a grid we've got three columns the
equally spaced we want them the name
apply reset and refresh so we'll do
apply reset
refresh and now you see that all in this
first column so to change the columns
you do grid column on the actual element
itself it's zero indexed which means it
starts at zero so the first one will
start at zero then we want to move that
one over to one and that one over to two
you can see now we've got three buttons
but you can also see there's no spacing
so the first thing we want is we don't
want them right against the edge of the
screen and that holds true for
everything we're going to put inside of
here
so firstly to get a border around here
like a padded border
let's wrap the whole thing so let's wrap
the entire stack panel in a border so
we'll literally wrap it around this
border element and then in the border
we'll set a new margin or padding
padding is technically the one we want
and we'll do ten you can see that's
moved everything inside so now you got
this border around now we need the
spacing between the buttons again
there's a slight annoyance with grids is
that there's currently no way to specify
I'd call this a cell in a grid so if
you've got multiple rows you know more
than one row then you'd have like a
table in Excel every single cell you
should be able to specify the padding
around them you can do it but it
involves a lot of work where you think
you'd just be able to type in here
things like cell dot padding is what
you'd expect so for now just for
quickness and for simplicity we'll
simply select this button which is the
first one I'll just add a margin and
then this for you can put four items in
which like top bottom left right if you
can't remember the order just put 10 in
the first one and you'll see so the
first one's left
get rid of that move the ten over so it
goes left top right bottom is the order
so we want one on the right
there so we'll put ten padding margin on
the right-hand side of the button and
then on the last button we'll do it on
the left side which was that one and
we'll get rid of the ten on the right
press f5 and take a look at that so I
can see we've got three evenly spaced
buttons now this one will be ever so
slightly larger because these two have
got the margin on them this hasn't
evolved for this purpose it's perfectly
fine so we've got those first three
buttons so already we've done this top
part so remember the the space around
it's been the border just here with the
padding then the stack panel is what
then is going to stack everything down
the first item inside the stack panel is
the grid which holds these three buttons
and you can see the indentation if you
get confused as to where things are and
you can also do comments inside of here
so like this bit here now this grid here
contains the buttons so to do a comment
it's a angle bracket exclamation and
then two dashes maybe press space it'll
also add the finishing part which is - -
and then an angle bracket and we'll just
both buttons this gives us a quick view
when you scrolling through this code of
where things are so this parts the
buttons now after the dred so the thing
below the buttons we need to have this
title so we'll use a text block you can
use a label or a text block a labels
very limited so there's not much you can
do with a label so I tend to just stick
with a text block and then value text
and it will be pulse properties
and then if you've got nothing inside of
the text block you can just do forward
slash and close the angle bracket and
that's like a shortcut instead of doing
closed bracket and then open one and
close it again straight after so instead
of having to open and close because
there's nothing inside here like the
stack panels got this inside that's why
you need a stack panel than a closing
panel the text blocks about everything
it needs right here there's no need for
this
open and close business you can delete
that and just do a shorthand version
which is as forward slash close you can
see we've got the pulse properties here
we want to just make that bold so it's
called font-weight:bold
and there's the bold and again we want a
bit of a spacing between them
this is got spacing above and below so
we'll do a margin and we want it zero
ten and you can see there's a short nd
if you only specify two properties the
first one is the left and right the
second one's the top and bottom so
that's a quicker way of doing if you've
got the same margin top and bottom you
can just do 0 and then 10 so that's now
got a spacing above and below we then
want another label so we'll use another
text block that just isn't old
so we'll just copy and paste this I'll
be called description get rid of the
bold and then we don't want this big gap
this is a bit too much of a gap so let's
just start by removing the margin
altogether and we'll put a comment here
again
description now below that we've got
this actual text entry field where the
user can type something and that's a
text box so same as everything else just
type the text box and then let's just
close that and you can see we've got a
text box now I'm going to run this so
we're going to press f5 and I'll show
you the onesie issue but something I
always change so you're clicking this
text box and look how compact there's no
space in between it so you put the
letter M it's really close to the top so
I think that just looks a bit too
squished in so we're going to add some
padding to give that a bit of breathing
room so padding goes on the inside
margins go on the outside so because we
want the space on the inside of the text
block will do padding and we'll give it
like five padding well maybe a bit
extreme let's just give two let's press
f5 you can see now we just got that a
little bit of extra space around the
writing so it's just not quite as
squashed in so it gives us that block
then we've got status and revision next
now because we've got two side by side
again remember if we use a stackpanel
they'll only take up the amount of space
they need which means these would be
squished over to the left so we need to
use a grid again here and it's just a
grid with two columns this time one
column two column and by the looks of it
this is about twice the width of this
one so we'll do a grid that's got a two
star and a single star so this is twice
the size of that and then inside of
those columns we'll just do a lot of
stack panel little stack this and this
and then this and this so you can see
whenever you're looking at anything
you're always just looking at really
making a choice between a grid and a
stack panel and every single thing
between those two you can make up the UI
hits it really is as simple as that you
define your layout and you just break it
down into stack panels and grids so I'll
start here we'll make a comment what
it's going to be which is status and
revision
we need a grid we need some columns
again so let's define the columns the
first one needs to be to star and the
second one one star and then inside of
there we want a text block and text box
similar to that in fact no sorry we want
it inside of a stackpanel don't we first
so these two stack this is going to be
the status that's the status it's going
to be in red column zero which you don't
need to specify by default it will be in
column zero I just like to explicitly
state where it is in case you move
things around copy and paste the whole
lot pull that revision move it to column
one you can see it's jumped over there
call it revision and again we need this
slight padding so we'll do a margin on
this status one and we'll do it on the
stack panel so margin:0 0 1002 put on
the right hand side and you can see
there now we've got the space between
you can also see the slightly gray
that's just to indicate that they are
read-only so the user can't type in them
so to make them read only in these text
blocks here you can actually use is
read-only and set it to true or you can
use is enabled and both will do the same
thing you won't be able to type in them
so do is read only true and we'll do
background and we'll set it to hash try
II we go nice and light so that's a
shorthand for
ee-ee-ee-ee which is red green and blue
and a hexadecimal value of between 0 and
255 so if you don't know what these
values are for colors just have a look
at hexadecimal color values it's fairly
simple 0 0 0 so this starts a black FFF
is white and everything in between is
colors so if we did F a red and no green
no blue you'd get red if you had no red
then green and no blue you get green no
red no green and blue you get blue you
get the jist FF for green and blue and
you get sy on red and green and you get
yellow so you get the gist
EEE is equal numbers of all is just
below white so it gives you this nice
gray will copy and paste that into the
one below and then we'll press f5 and
let's make sure these can't be tired Tim
so you can see we can click but you
can't type in them which is what we want
and this one we can so that's got as the
status and revision next one is part
number so that just goes below so this
is again really just carrying on the
stack panel it's just going down so
remember the indentation level where
stack panel here's your grid containing
the buttons you can minimize using this
minus here that collapses that grid so
you've got your buttons then you've got
your pulse properties then you've got
description then you've got this grid
again which contains a status and
revision so after that we just want very
much copy and paste this description
it's exactly the same as this just
carrying on
and it wants to be part number as that
and it wants to be read only again so
let's just copy and paste this read only
as that now we've got this title again
and then material and then a drop down
so it's basically like this title
description and then it's going to be a
drop down so we'll just copy and paste
this this part here because it's very
similar so we want click here takes us
to the tile and copy the title and the
description paste it below add a comment
going to be raw material and you can see
how easy this is to you know really
quickly make a UI especially when you
used to it like I am how quickly you can
just whizz through and create something
exactly the same cart is going to be
material and then we want to change this
from a text box to in this case this is
a drop-down so that'll be a combo box I
believe and then we'll leave that one
blank there's nothing in this at the
moment so we'll just leave that as is
and we'll add stuff when we come to here
where you can see they've got values so
now there's manufacturing info and
workcenters which is again the same as
raw materials and material so we'll copy
that bit
Manufacturing FL there's the info and
then work centers and now what you've
got here you've got a load of check
boxes so these can be ticked and again
you've got two columns of them so this
will be a grid with two columns and this
will be a stack panel again so that's
actually exactly the same as these
because this is a grid so we can go
ahead and copy this for quickness which
is this grid here copy the whole grid
paste and this is going to be a just
calling check boxes we've got the column
width we want to be equal so we just
remove that too so now we've got a grid
with two columns just delete what's
inside of it for now
in fact now we can actually leave part
of that column one and its column zero
but in terms of comment for reading
column one and two and now inside of
there instead of the text boxes we want
to put check boxes
so checkbox content is well now go see
we got the first one in we want a little
space between this and that because
we've got like a space here so we'll go
to the work centers here and add a
margin there we go so they've got this
world who want another one two three
four and to assembly plasma laser and
purchase and then same on this side so
copy and paste the check boxes got lathe
drill fold
roll and saw and there's the checkboxes
let's press f5 and just take a quick
look at this now see how it's coming
along so got the buttons you've got the
text boxes got the locked ones you've
got a combo box with nothing at the
moment
got some check boxes we can check and
you'll notice also when you change the
size of the form everything changes in
respect to you know the universal value
so this is always a third this is always
two times the width of this and this is
always half so everything scales nicely
it's not restricted to a fixed size now
we just continue this so again it's like
description and part number for length
of mass so we'll copy description it
wants to be outside that grid and we'll
copy part number for the read-only style
and then we'll change it from length and
mass
and then we want finish and this is a
drop-down again just the same as
material and then we'll put some values
in so we want to go to material just
here paste that this is finish and now
we want something inside this combo box
so we'll get rid of the shorthand
forward slash and we'll actually expand
into the combo box then in here we'll
just do combo box item just so we can
hard code we can hand type a value and
we know one of them which is painted and
we don't know any others without seeing
the you know the real list because this
is just a screenshot so let's just add
one other I'm not painted and then you
can see when you click the combo box in
here oops and you click in here or
rather when you click in here it shows
you the drop-down but when you're
outside there's nothing selected so by
default we're going to force this to
select the first item so in the combo
box here just type selected index and
make that zero and you'll see that's now
selected the first item in the list so
we press f5 and let's have a look
selected the first item and the
drop-down we've got two options
so now got an option where you can
select one or the other
we've then got this purchase information
again it's a drop-down so we'll just
copy and paste the previous one and the
purchase information we know the first
one was rubber so again just for
quickness we'll just type not rubber
until we get the list of what needs to
go in there that's as much as we know
and then really everything else here is
exactly the same again supply a name is
just the same as length so copy and
paste
you can see we're going off here now so
let's just scroll back up to the top and
then in the title he'll also put a title
into the window here main window
well it'll be bare basics and this
height which is the default height when
it opens will change to 800 make it that
a little bit longer
let's now we've got supplier name we
want supplier code now we got additional
info a note so that's just like pick an
e how to pick this one again
so there you go there's the entire form
so you press f5 and we open up the
screenshot and then we open up the form
you can see that we've mimicked the
whole form in a relatively short time we
can like move a margin here between
length and here too to get that we could
add a little bit of spacing like these
have got you can mess with that nice and
easily just add margins as you need to
we won't bother doing that because it's
not needed so I know we've gone through
that really quick but that was to show
you how quick you can build a UI when
you get used to WPF so we'll go over
these items in a little more detail so
as you mentioned when you're inside a
window you can only have one master item
so that items got to contain it's got to
be like a container ideally so that you
can put more things in so will borders
our container control it can have one
other thing inside of it but it's still
a container it's got another control
inside so the border we've used just to
add as the name sort of suggests our
border we've added a padding of 10 we
brought everything inside so if we
remove that padding it's the everything
else will be pushed right up against the
edge of the screen so the purpose of the
padding there border is to add that
padding around the whole thing inside of
the border and again you can base it on
where the indent is with another stack
panel which by default is vertical so
everything I'll stack down that goes
inside of it the first thing we place
inside of it is a grid that's got three
columns and contains the three buttons
which is inside the columns zero one and
two so that goes zero one two and then
below that so again because we're in a
stack panel it will go below you've got
the text block puls properties a text
block is just text not something the
user can type it's just text itself
we've told it what the text is we've
made the font bold and we give it a
margin below and above and then below
that we've added another text block
which is just text the user can see but
not type and then below that we've added
a text box which the user can actually
type into we've added some padding which
goes inside whereas margin if we add a
margin you'll see goes on the outside
they see that the margins gone outside
the control the padding's inside the
control so we add like a 20 padding
you'll see how big the the text box
itself will go so you've got a stack
panel which goes down or across if you
change the orientation you've got a grid
which can contain rows and columns and
you can set the specific sizes we've got
text blocks which is just text you've
got text boxes which is what you can
type in you've got these combo boxes
which is a you know combination it's a
list of items that you can select one
off you got checkboxes which a user can
be true or false you can be ticked or
not ticked and that's really all we've
got in this form that's that the whole
list of controls but it's enough to see
you know the basic controls the way it's
done like I say it's very similar to XML
or HTML who have done web design where
you have an open and close angle bracket
and then if you don't put a forward
slash there then everything is inside of
that until you get to the final part
where you then type the same name again
but with a forward slash and you can see
that throughout so you can see a
stackpanel here know forward slash so
everything inside is inside the stack
panel until we do forward slash stack
panel so and you can see it all indents
it for you as well so you think of it as
like a hierarchical tree as you're
stepping in so if stack panels further
forward than border it's inside the
border the grid is further forward than
the stack panel so it's inside the grid
the text box is the same level as the
grid so they're both inside the stack
panel now you go inside this grid the
buttons are inside the grid so you can
see it's easy to follow
and Visual Studio helps you with when
you type in a lot so it will point out
when you miss type things that you know
something's wrong it's you know not a
valid name or if you pull it would just
close it off it'll automatically out of
finishing so I'll just close this now
with a right angle bracket it
automatically adds the closing part for
me things like that so you'll find it
quite easy to type in and there's all
your controls if you're interested in
what other controls there are you can
use this toolbox here you can take a
glance at them and the reason I don't
use this is because as you'll see let's
say I grab a label or let's use
something with use let's grab a text
block and I drag and drop it into here
you can see now it's just gone somewhere
random it's down here it's just added it
and it's set all properties by default
and it's give it a default name it just
tends to add things that you don't need
and if you haven't got a stackpanel
if you've got a grid like here then it
can tend to do I don't know it'll do
this for us now but it sometimes
positions and that's going to keep
jumping there it will position things by
setting margins and it just makes it
really messy so I always type WPF
directly in code and just get familiar
with them you know how you're creating
these these UI is instead of just
dragging and dropping and trying to
position things just think you through
and you're always thinking either a
stack panel or a grid so if you're going
down or across and you're not trying to
fill a set size like these buttons want
to be all of the width but divide it
equally if it's just stacking down to an
unknown you know size just just stack
down until you've got as much as you
need then it's a stack panel if you want
to fill an area like the whole area or
split the area intersections of you know
specific proportions like two to one or
you know 1 to 3 here or what have you or
you know 1 to 1 then you want a grid
there's only two choices to make really
there's the odd occasion you want
something different but 99% of the time
you put your items inside a stack panel
or a grid and then within that year then
more stacked panels or grids until you
finally get to add in the actual
controls so look over this code you know
just pause the video and flick through
this this code here I'll scroll down you
can see the greener comments as we
mentioned they start with this part the
end with this part and then the comments
inside and then all these properties as
we go through the tutorials will we'll
speak more in depth about you know
specific properties you can change
backgrounds foreground you can have a
hover effects when you hover over you
know text boxes make them glow and you
can get really fancy so this is very
plain-looking UI and as we get more into
depth with WPF you'll see how much
control you have and how easy it is to
make really nice-looking UI so that's a
really quick overview of firstly
creating this UI now in order to do
anything with this let's say when you
type in this description and then press
apply we just want to display a message
box we want to read that value so in
order to do anything with any of these
controls you need to give them names so
that in the code so if you right click
on the window over here and view code
you can see this is the code to the main
window that we've made this is the code
behind class so in order to do anything
you know access the controls in here
they need a name so we want to name for
this apply button which is here you do X
colon name and then you type in apply
button
and now let's say when we click this
button so in order to do something when
it's clicked type in click press enter
and then it'll give you an option to do
new event handler press tab and it will
create that for you let's give it the
name apply button click and then if you
right click on this main window and go
view code you'll see is added this
function for us this is now linked in
with when we click this button so when
we click this apply button because it's
linked to this function it will run this
code and you'll also notice if you want
to access the button itself you can do
this dot and now you can see we can
access the eight the button apply button
or we want to access this description
text so let's click this text just here
X call on name we'll call this
description text go back to our code
behind plus and we'll just do message
box shell which is the really quick and
dirty way of showing something on the
screen you want some text input so just
to show you what that does first let's
just do hi press f5 and I'll see when
we'll click this get a message box that
says hi so now let's get the text out of
here
so really simple now instead of putting
hi do this dot description you can see
there you go description text is the
text box that we've got and you want the
text of that text box
so that will literally just get the text
of the text box and then we'll do a
string that says the description is and
then the value of the text box press f5
hollow world and then you click this
apply button and you get the description
as hello world so you can see we've
started to interact with this form so in
order to access you know these these
items you need to give them names so I
won't bore you and go through every
single one and name them but let's go
through one of each type so you know the
reset we'll give that a name will do
reset button and when we click that
button will clear off say these
checkboxes will make them all back to
not checked so we'll give each of these
checkboxes a name will do well checkbox
copy and paste
and then we'll call this assembly got
rid of that plasma laser purchase if you
wander now I'm doing that multiple
select hold the Alt key and then you can
select like you can like draw a square
around and then you can also say you
want it to add a word specifically to
every line here you can just drag a line
straight down while holding the alt and
you can type in hello and it will do it
on every line you can also use that to
delete so if you want to delete all the
check hold alt click and drag and press
delete so it's like a nice way of
selecting text that's in a specific line
fond wrong and sore so now when we click
this reset button so we want to add a
click we want to reset all of those
checkboxes so I'll do this dot weld
checked so the checked property of the
check box equals assembly plasma laser
purchase purchase and then we got lathe
drill falls roll so we're just setting
them all in one big dose of this equals
this equals IC puts that are all going
to equal the same thing roll ladies
drill Falls roll yep so so that's the
last one so every check property equals
false and that should check and of
course that's the wrong thing that's the
event think it's is checked yeah so
checked is an event that will fire when
it gets checked so if we want to do
something when something's checked we'll
go through that in a moment
so when we click the reset button we
want to set the checkbox to false for
everyone let's press f5 and check that
out
select a few click Weser you can see
it's got rid of the checks for us so now
what we're going to do is what happens
if you want to know when these are
checked then when you check any of these
we're going to add that text to save
this length box
so we're going to set the text of this
base to every time you click this add
the word to this box so let's go to here
to flick say the weld and now what we're
going to do is are the same event to
every checkbox you want the same action
to happen every time you click so we
don't need a you know an event for this
and this and this and this and then you
know write the code every single time
you need a single function so the
checkbox do checked which is similar to
click you can see this lining it means
an event when something happens press
ENTER and then tab like before and it's
made this wild checkbox checked I just
delete the word weld let's go to the
code behind and also delete the world
weld so now we've got this universal
function checkbox checked we're going to
copy and paste this to everyone so again
I hold alt drag down and paste you can
paste it to all of them so now when you
click any checkbox this function is
going to run we want to set this length
textbox so we'll name this length text
and then in this checkbox checked
function we want to set this dot length
text text and then instead of just
saying equals you want to add to it so
it's just a string like any other string
do plus equals to add to what's
currently in there and now we need to
get the name or in this case the content
we want this that's right in here so
whenever you click checked you'll notice
the function Pat is in this object
sender this object is the checkbox
itself so instead of being an object we
cast it by doing
a checkbox in parentheses and then the
word sender after then we wrap the whole
thing in parentheses so that's converted
it into a check box and then the check
box dot content which again can be
anything because it could be something
else we know it's a string so it's the
content and then to cast the content to
string it looks like it's automatically
doing it for us anyway so we don't need
to but if we had to you just cast it
this side so when you're casting things
you've got this parenthesis on the left
with the value that you cast you inside
so you can see here the sender has been
cast to a check box and then we've
wrapped it all inside this so that we
can then access the check box content
and then we could cast the content
itself here into a string but it looks
like it's not needed so I'll just delete
that string so now when we click a check
box it should get the current check box
that we checked get the contents and add
it to the length text so let's try that
now you see weld assembly fold lazer
purchase that's just again just an
example of showing you what things are
you can notice as well that when you're
unchecking it's not doing anything the
checked is when you check only you've
then also gotten getting unchecked yet
and then you'll have maybe changed the
b14
I'm not sure what it is off the top of
my head but there's also an event for
when a check box just changes you know
it can be checked or unchecked I'm
pretty sure there's one anyway so a
quick look
oops well anyway this pretty sure
there's one you can google it if not if
not just add the same event to checked
and unchecked there's nothing stopping
your doing
unchecked is checkbox checked and it
runs the same function on both if you
wanted to do it that way but I think
there is a universal event that does
both now you got this drop down here so
again let's say when we change this drop
down and select a new item we'll add it
to the note down here let's name this
note note text and then in this combo
box let's drop down if selection changed
that's the one we want let's delete that
select it I'm not sure what that is so
selection changed I'm sure I type that
in the first place so now when the
selection changes we want to add the
value to the note text so again we know
the sender is a check as a combo box and
we want to set the note text and this
time I'll set it to the value so we want
to cast the sender to a combo box and we
want to do selected value I believe is
what we'll get and again that I'll
convert it to a string automatically
will it nope okay let's cast it to a
string
I'll see if that works
so selections changed send Oh is there
some guessing the value is either not
the right type when able to cast object
of type combobox item to string okay so
by default this selected value is
combobox
item not a string directly so instead of
it being a string we'll do combo box
item and then from that item wrap that
all in parentheses again we can then do
content which will convert to a string
because the content is a string that
lovely big long messy looking statement
there that's how you get the value so if
you wanted to make that look a bit nicer
you could first get the combo box put it
in a variable like that you could then
do the value as a combo box item
like that and you can see it looks a bit
cleaner you can easily see what your
cast into and do the value content of
string so that you can do that if you
want to make it look a bit nicer plus f5
and we've got a object reference on set
to an instance okay looks like the note
text is null at the moment so this is
firing before the things been created so
instead of doing checking if this is
null you can do just this conditional
question mark here so then if it is null
I know you can't okay
let's just check its null at the top so
if this note text equals equals null
return because we can't set it yet so
this is obviously firing before the note
text has even been created so now there
we go it spins up we check this and
change and you can see it's now
selecting the value you'll notice on
startup it doesn't have a value and
that's because the selection change was
fired as we saw before this was created
so it's probably firing an order of
creation so if you want to set it to the
value when the form initially opens so
you want to find the value you can just
call this function or you can put this
inside of a function
and gun sender as a combo box yeah this
combo box okay so there's a few ways for
quickness again we'll call this function
and because we're using the sender here
we're going to pass in the finish drop
down into the function itself so you can
do it you can do it here in the
constructor and but you probably want to
do it and must be fun to remember this
on is loaded or something okay type
let's just drop into here see if there's
an option an event loaded there we go so
in the window itself we had an event
when it's loaded
that's when everything's been fully
loaded this event will then fire and
then we'll just call this initial value
to set there the value so we could just
rewrite this code but because we've got
the function already we'll just call the
function finish drop-down selection
changed and it needs the sender which in
this case we know it's meant to be the
finish drop-down and we're not using the
argument so we'll just pass null so that
will just call this function and pass
the sender as the finish drop-down so
that this code can find you know the
combo box so we press f5 now when the
window loads it will run this function
because it's filled in then when you
initially open so you've got the default
value and then this function Phi is aft
so now we're using an apply button to
read the description a reset button to
uncheck these you can type in any way we
know how to get the value from the apply
we set the value in like here when you
change the the value around we also do
it here or you check in they are
read-only so you know you can't type in
them and I think that's really
everything in this form in some basic
usage you know so you can generally
creates controls and mess with them and
do things when you click them or do
things when things get typed in them so
there's a thing let's do another one
that's when you type in supply a name
let's copy the exact same code and to
supply a coke wellness copy enter mass
because that's read-only so we'll just
mimic the code mimic the text that we
write let's go to supply a name let's
give that a name so we can access it in
code behind not that we need to bottle
might as well and then this time it's
going to be text changed event so when
the text is changed we want to set their
this mass so that needs a name mass text
go to the code behind and now every time
the supplier name text has changed we
want to do this dot mass text dot text
plus equals and then you'll see this
text event augs think in fact now let's
just cheat set it that always be the
exact same text so equals there stop
supplying in text text and you could use
instead of doing this we could actually
use the sender cast the sender to a text
box and get the value from it but
because we're only using this function
for this exact control we'll just access
the control itself here so now we just
set the mass text to equal the supplier
name text every time the text changes so
now we type in here
you can see it copies here has retiring
which is quite cool I think that's
really all we can do with these controls
in terms of you know basic usage for the
first video I think it's at least a go
to introduction in future videos will go
more into potentially styling these to
make them look nicer we might go into
view models although that gets fairly
complicated but really when you start
doing code like this you don't want to
be putting your logic your code in
effectively the UI there this is the UI
the main window and this is the code
behind this is just the code that really
should be to do with creating the UI and
we're starting to do you know logic
we're starting to make our program
inside here and that's sort of bad
practice you don't want your code inside
of the code behind class so the way we
would get rid of this is to make a view
model and it's quite a complicated thing
so again that's something for a future
video but it's something we'll have to
go over because it's something you want
to do very early on so we'll do view
models probably will do some styling and
we'll see where we go from there so
hopefully this was a good introduction
into WPF and it's enough to then allow
you to start playing with you know all
of these controls and just pressing
space and having a look at what options
you've got on them changing the values
let's change this like horizontal and
I'll turn everything that way and you
know just have a play around yourself
and see what changes and that's a good
way to to get a feel for what happens so
you can go into here and do a background
read and change the color to red you
know you just have a play and get a feel
for the the general UI and then we'll
carry on in the next videos
