actual force at their words server
application and so the actual website
they'll you know handle everything for
our main programs so in the last video
we did the I just jumped to it the
entity framework basics so we're pretty
much gonna clone this repository rename
it and then use that as our base so I
literally copy this from the YouTube
repository chop into the FATA word we've
got the source now got for Seto word set
a word call so we can chuck it in here
this will be pasetta upwards server or
hindu processor we got web doc server
and then in there we copy that name can
delete all the template vials and we'll
just literally open these first to make
sure there's nothing residual in there
that we want to change the entity
framework will changes to the Seto Dutch
word will log them for now it's just
ourselves I can change in the future all
right because the windows account pretty
sure that's fine as is yep I'll rename
the project to the same thing the
solution will move up to top level
rename this to that will edit the
solution way of British video code and
then it will be in this folder and that
project name then there's the default
name space I believe it picks up from so
that should be all we need for the
cloning of this I leave everything else
we can do once we open the project so
let's just open this solution now and it
should close that one down it should
open visual studio and we have basically
the
place we left off after the last video
but with facetted web server as the
namespace and project name ready to
start padding out this application so
I'll just right-click and go properties
here see the default namespace was
picked up by that change without dotnet
2.0 which is what we want the build has
all standard that's fine
all that's okay profile test it's just
the name of the profile we gave it in
the low end settings so we could call
this Castro I just like to be explicit
on what it does then we'll go port 5,000
that's fine that's all the settings okay
the routes got nothing in the controller
there's a base home control or quickly
change the one that bit was wrong there
will change anywhere we find that with
the new namespace seto word web server a
blue cross and just replace all the
namespaces and then we could do a quick
search for entity film basics to see if
there's any robots still in there now so
that should be all the namespaces
updated we have the contacts the
constructor the sample bit here which we
can leave in for the moment till we get
a feat grounded with entity framework
controller G to remove any unused
namespaces keep things clean I can stay
there IOC container it's fine and the
yes you can tell you it on the service
provider that's a home page is fine up
settings we've looked at that's fine for
now programs done and start up
so we've got a clean application let's
now just make sure this runs first it
should also create a database so we open
SQL management studio and we'll connect
to this machine when this spins up and
we hit the home page we should see yeah
get rid of test that was yeah that
shouldn't be the name of a database
thing that was the old ones entity
framework would have been the old one so
now it's spun up it should be created in
the database so when we finished press
f5 on there and you can see now we are
facetted upwards so we know we've got
that database and we've got the settings
so that's good for now we've got that
towards we've really done there is
cloned to the last project but we've
cleaned it all up and named it what we
want now before I forget again let me
just turn the present on to make this
font bigger for you guys there we go so
the first step to using basically
getting users added to this website so
that you can sign up if you will create
users manage users luckily this is
something where we can use the built-in
asp.net call services if you will so
they handle all of the HTTP context
their cookies in the web browser they
give you the ability to hash passwords
verify them lock accounts two-factor
authentication it's all done but it's
all open source so you can see also
recommend when we're doing something
like this and making use of an existing
thing even when he tests dotnet core
itself so spend on my Mac soft and that
code is one of the cleanest of any
people to still understand at least what
you're doing so don't just go and dump
commands and not understand because it
does quite a bit and there's a lot of
code that we don't need to do because
they have done it you know god while and
it's maintained and open-source so any
issues get found but will as we step
through this will I'll basically break
you down and show you the source code of
of what's happening so we understand
what the DP context does now that it's
basically like a database and then each
of these DB sets is like a table and
then the models inside the sets are like
there
the columns are the end of the
information about the tables the rows
and the types and things so in order to
add and typically it also try and keep
one one database contacts for your
application because that's like the
database so you don't want two databases
for most applications so the first step
to start including the and that was
called identity which is the thing that
handles users is to tweak this DB
contact so from a standard dbcontext
into an identity DB context and I have
to stop the web server to be able to
type that so it's an identity DB
contacts controlled off to bring up the
intellisense and include the namespace
and then it needs to know the tag you
see of user obviously the user is a row
in the database and it needs to know
information because everybody's
applications different users might have
emails and locations or specific things
to your application for now we have just
our our basic user so again we'll split
this up as it grows into correct
projects and things for now I'll just
chop this in the data and then we'll
ITIL organize this project as it grows
so in here we'll just do a class I'll
just call this application user and get
rid of the extra namespace get rid of
all that and then this will be ill
inherits an identity user control dot
and include the namespace the user
profile for our application the use of
data yes and profile so also doing is
literally making an instance of you will
you know inheriting from identity user
we're doing nothing special right now we
could do by simply adding information in
here but this just gives us the ability
of you to actually expand upon identity
user this is our custom class and that
is the type of user in this identities
and that's the identity of this context
now so now this identity contacts will
give the ability to
add asp.net rolls users all information
about that that needs to manage sign-in
data two-factor authentication it's all
baked into this now by doing this and
tell me this is a type of user it will
create a bunch of DB sets for us which I
don't really can just see by f12 in in
identity DB context because I even
further in and then you can see here now
it will create these because the DB sets
you'll now have a database table with
the user roles roles roles claims and
they've got some attributes here that
configure these with a specific table
name so they won't come out exactly as
that name look them up some like asp net
user roles but here you can see the
basically adding database tables for
that and then the rest of all this
gobiins and the dbcontext adds the
ability to manage that and do that and
again it's something we don't have to
actually make so by didn't ENT TB
context we're at in those database
tables so we do that step in theory if
we build this delete this database and
presuming this build successfully which
i'm pretty sure it should already has
maybe I'll just run the application and
then when there spins up they sure
create the date while it will create the
database still and should see those new
rows even though there's nothing in the
database will have to be initialized
with those I'll probably turn this on to
that so it's not harsh on the eyes right
so that's now created have we refresh
the databases and we go in this time you
can see here all the roles I was
mentioning all the database tables you
can go ahead and inspect them this is
now what the identity has created for us
so this is like the users as the part of
our application usually made and these
are all the defaults normalized emails
usernames the email and username itself
confirmation
two-factor authentication phone um these
are all baked in as mechanic defaults
rolls are when you start giving users
specific permissions or like grouping
them some people might be admins or
those might be developers the roles is
good for that these are all the logins
so they kept in the database based on
you know where they're coming from which
login provider so our own application or
two-factor authentication from Google
things like that claims we won't go into
right now it's basically similar to
roles in terms of you know what you need
them for it's all about grouping the
users together
and then user tokens we have as well so
we'll start making use of these but you
can see straight away the implication of
changing it to identity dbcontext sets
up the database with identity set it up
with something ready for the built in
identity services we're going to be
using to make you something needs to be
an identity dbcontext to have those
correct tables so we've done that a
little step so now we want to start
configuring and using this so we jump
back into our main code here we have the
dbcontext already which adds the
application dbcontext
as a basic you know as a context itself
nothing special about that we still
leave that in there and it configures as
a use SQL so in addition to that part of
the identity setup and process as I
mentioned as much you're on the website
and you log in you need the ability to
when you refresh the page not have to
log in again so part of what we do or
part of what asp.net does for us is
handle you know when a user logs it in
creating a website cookie and keeping
that cookie alive for a set period of
time and that will contain a special key
that'll appear in the database as a
login so if we were to now do services
dot add identity and then again it's
expecting a type of identity so that
identity will be the application user
and the ruble we don't have any specific
role for mugging intellisense at a
minute well I know that's why I show you
guys the intellisense let me just try
identity role see that I'll stop
complaining now so see we get int a
license back so similar to that we got
someone to the user the user also has
four roles that even though we don't
have any roles so we could create now a
specific roles and then you know
implement certain ones but we're using
the default identity role because we're
not making use of it so we're telling
this code to add identity which you'll
see what it does in a minute
under this application you attack
because that's the one we use in here
and just the default identity role baked
into the framework so we'll make notes
of all this so add identity adds cookies
as I mentioned or adds cookie based
authentication it also draws and I'll
I'll give you a link to this so you can
see it adds scoped classes for things
like user manager which we'll use to
create users delete users you know
literally manage users for the
assignment manager which as you expect
to be for signing in for the things like
password hashes to generate hashes of
passwords to them verify and so on so
I'll make that note there about that
fact
will also then provide a link and we'll
go and look at this now in in source
code I heard one more notes on this
actually is that basically once you sign
in as a cookie whenever you refresh a
webpage cookies based on that website
are always sent with the request by the
browser that's just the natural way web
sites work if there's a cookie which is
just a text file on the the user's
machine storing information that the
browser can create when you sign in to a
site it will create that cookie which is
like safe just a text file just got some
info in and it just gets
as part of it almost like a head or if
you will to the web request it comes in
as an actual cookie so information can
be passed back and forward automatically
so that cookie basically gets read by
this set up here the ad identity will
then automatically weed the cookie from
every request when it comes in before it
hits our controllers so before you ever
get to say this page there's this things
that go on before you ever build up to a
controller action and one of those from
doing this is something that then reads
the cookie decrypt it sieves of that key
is in the asp net logins list to
basically see if we have a valid login
already and if it is then it will
automatically automatically adds the
validated user from a cookie to http
contacts for user which we'll access in
like a controller here so you could say
context user and then identity and then
you got access to now you're at least
your username from the identity that
then you can use the user manager to get
information from that so this
automatically adds that you know once
you've signed in and you come back in
your controllers this would always be
already prefilled with a pre validated
user that does all the work for you so
you can relational just check HTTP
context start user for that information
so we will give a link to that so we go
to this first page this is just the
source code of asp net identity and then
an identity service collection
extensions and in here we should see our
identity which just calls the inner one
and if we keep scrolling down you'll get
to like line 59 here well you see this
is about effectively here that's what it
does so this is the whole thing and if
we take a look at what this is actually
doing one it's had an authentication
because there's multiple ways your
website can authenticate and alls it's
doing here for us is adding all the
default ones if you were say default
it's adding cookie authentication a
security stamp ballad
to which we'll talk about near the end
of the video setting up the path to
redirect to when people aren't
authorized which we can also override
and we will do setting the time that the
cookie expires so how long the user has
to sit on this page without refreshing
the page before they get signed out
which again we'll play with to show you
what's happening and then it adds
two-factor authentication scheme for the
same the basically sets are ready for
two-factor authentication in there we
don't make use of just yet but we will
that's all just one call of your what
entire thing is setting up
authentication and authentication to use
the built in identity set up which as we
mentioned basically uses cookies and a
security stamp and then it's ready to
use two-factor authentication so all
that will be you'll see that as we use
it'll make sense then this is just all
go pings well I say this just this one
here really is just the ability to make
use of this interface which is needed
inside of the way that this identity
works it pulls in the HTTP context from
within
Arius you wouldn't usually be able to
get to it so this lets you do that well
not always but let's the inner service
the identity service in asp.net core to
use it and then it adds all these scoped
things that will you'll see and you'll
be able to pull in so all these are in
the scope of a web request as for every
request gets them and you can see you've
got user bowel data password validator
hash lookup normalizer alright all the
you can see the main ones will make use
of ron howard like the user major sign
and manager roles manager maybe the
validator will get will use them all but
you'll see really all that call is doing
for the bulk of it as this yeah at it an
authentication and then the add all
these providers to so we can make use of
them in our actions nice and easy and
they're using again these are baked in
pre-existing managers that you can make
an ideal actually end up making me own
when asp.net one was out because it
wasn't quite good enough and that it was
a huge amount of work so now these are
luckily good enough and stable that we
can simply make use of them and then I
just return so there's that's it that's
all all it does and you can also you'll
notice you'll be able to run at us a
configure
so you configure command
or an action if you pass it in and it
simply just services.com figure and
passes in just the action that you pass
into here to get the option so if you
wanted to configure them at the same
time you can do it in an override so
that link will put in the source code
there and that gets us to step one and
then if we now do we've done the add
identity the next step is to do dart for
what is the next step add entity
framework stores and then you can see
it's asking for contacts that was
awfully application say obviously it
does the me bot application DB context
and then this method so close that off
there and this one again right so let me
think to explain this correctly we will
have would use quite some fiancÃ©e does
recess so adds I believe the user store
and role still think of the only two
from this context and again we've got
the source code open so we can double
check this but these two you haven't
seen in the last you know you didn't see
them here directly but the user store in
the role store or again class helper
classes they'll wrap the correct
database tables so wrap the the users
the roles the roles that you know your
appellees into a class and then make
them accessible for the sign-in manager
the user manager the role manager so
even these add the user managers here
but the user managers are expecting a
user store in a role store of where to
find those users so this bit adds adds
those stores to tell them to come from
obviously entity framework so we take a
look at that source code we should find
that extension method in here so there's
the other frameworks tools that we've
just done you see again this bubbles
down and this looks a bit complicated
because this is all kind of generic
stuff that just does look messy and
confusing but if you simply just scroll
and look at this you can kind of
gathered that each space is trying to
find existing info from it so it's
trying to get an identity dbcontext
which we are so that'll be given and
then everything else not which you won't
be to just make generic user stores for
us otherwise it will try and get the
user store based on the types and bubble
down to ultimately simply calling these
two functions so you don't need to
really understand all of this generic
stuff and what's going on because again
this is used internally you just simply
need to understand at least that the
principle of what's happening and you
can see that in essence no matter what
happens it always boils down to adding a
user store in a role store or adding a
user store and it's based on the types
so because we've passed in the user and
role here these are the types that it
would be so by calling hard entity
framework stores we would then be able
to get the services so if we did say in
this part you could do IOC dot and do an
expose provider yet ioc container dot
provider don't get service and then you
could do a high user store of
application user and get the use of
store that way and that should be
available you know in the anywhere in
the code because it's injected here and
then you can do whatever you wanted with
that user store so you'll see bar use a
store and again we wouldn't do this
because this is handled by the the user
manager we're just showing your wallet
doors and then you've got the action
here to create users delete users do all
your user functions but you don't end up
using the user store directly instead
you use the user manager so you do to
use a manager of application user
and now the user story notes a manager
has more functions and it's all built up
to handle you know a lot more but that's
all that's doing that that identity film
which to us is adding the user store and
the role store from this context laughs
are consumed on I'm too yeah consumed
Godspell you shouldn't yes by the user
manager and rot manager that's doesn't a
simple one and then we'll put this link
in so you can see just at least that's
that's all it's doing it looks very
generic eBook all it does is finds baked
in typed like this and if you pass in
this and it's an existing one it uses
that instead and then passes it
ultimately in the constructor of a user
store in a role store so we'll pass that
in and I think there's one more step
that I wish yet default providers over
so again another thing that's needed is
if at we can pop spaces in this to make
the comments look a bit nicer adds a
provider generates unique keys and
package for things like forgot password
link phone number variation codes and so
on so again as part of all the future
manager and password stuff and and
anywhere that you generate like when you
forget your password you generate you a
unique key that then usually emails you
the key click the forgot password link
and you can create a new one so this
little thing here is responsible for
making those unique keys in a way that's
believed safe and unpredictable so again
it's a simple thing you could just do a
new GUI for everything but asp.net core
is baked in those providers then get
used by you know these user manager and
so that should be all we need to do in
theory if we would remove the comments
both with Dawn as that so we've only
done three things we've added run as
well let me just stop that without the
identity we've added the stores that the
identity needs and we've added tokens
the identity need so all we've done is
added the identity and then added two
things that it needs and then we just
walk out with comments because obviously
comments are good and then you can go
back and read and understand exactly
what the implications are doing a lot so
we've got good enough for there I'll put
notes here or to do so I don't forget
we'll come back to them change login
I'll change cookie timeout
so we'll do those two things we'll come
back to those two things and then we
also mustn't forget in the configure
method which is the adjure required
services and then the Conservatives
needed a point at which the set up once
all the services have been added so set
up identity and this is just a fuse or
user authentication there we go and
basically there's only ever one
authentication call now no matter what
type of authentication you use so this
is the one that's adding the
authentication and its identity
authentication that you only ever have
to call this so it would change the way
that we identified users you know the
sign in the process you still just do
the user authentication because they
should all implement the same thing that
then gets called via this call so that
is really for the most part everything
we need to do to set up and be betting
outer to do what we want with users
believe it or not so now we can create
users on our website we can authorize
them we can reject them we can redirect
them we can send passwords as as all
sorts we can do and you might know
ability of it with it being that simple
of in a sense that we've only really
made three calls and now we can do that
but that's kind of the beauty of using
this you know using something that
exists but in a way that now we
understand enough and you can always dig
into it in source code is
benefits so I wouldn't just add those
three start using it and do it blindly
and when we do or create user you can
then search github for you know the
source code to that however look
yourself at what it's doing so you
understand that I'd definitely recommend
that so we won't delve into that in this
video cuz it'll go on too long but I'd
certainly look at all the calls that we
make from now on going into those and
have a look at yourself we'll cover them
more in future videos but it's
beneficial so I guess the first thing we
want to do is create a user so we can
see the user being created so again we
mentioned in the last video we do
constructor injection just naturally
pull in a scoped scoped service based on
effectively this class when it's in a
constructor its scoped into this
whenever this is created it's part of
that scope that's how the scope works so
we want now as we mentioned before a
user manager so control dot to get the
the pop-up if you will and we have the
application application user here and
this will be the user manager put it on
a new line and also have the which we
don't use just yet but we we will sign
in manager of application user and that
is sign-in manager and then we just do
protect deed and we can copy this could
have just typed it quicker than copying
but never mind and that's we am user
manager tected sign-in manager and this
is the manager for handling users quite
simple manager for handling signing in
and out for our users
user gasps creation of the variation
deletion whilst do we do with the user
manager version deletion roles searching
okay yeah so there's our protected
members that will inject through the
services which will automatically get
filled here just like the other one dead
and then we'll set them up to be the
user manager and the sign and manager
and then we can just double check that
that works so we spun off the
application now which you'll find that
these get injected and the reason they
get injected is because as we saw in the
source code the add identity injects a
user major so as a spins up the user
manager is now the asp net user manager
and the silent manager as you'd expect
is signing manager so we have them in
jackets so now we're ready to do what we
want with the users and as I mentioned
they have been injected due to the fact
that the add identity adds the scope
classes as we saw in this link I think
I'll close that as well so we have that
ready we've injected into there so it's
now time to actually do something so
let's go here and do a public task of
because we'll have to await the creation
of user I option results which is any
kind of result just call it create user
async so just a normal call could we do
root so it can be found and we do root
create and again we'll move this into a
call will add the facetted word core and
these routes will be embedded in there
so we know where to call them from for
now we'll just return contents user was
created what I say and we'll have
text/html has your time and because it's
a task with a minute we'll just do tasks
from result and new content okay let's
just do we turn content and for now
because we're not a weight in fact let's
just do a little trick I weight tasks
top the lasers oh wait oh yeah they sink
I wait task doc delay zero I just do
that so we don't have to do anything
here so all will do for now is check
that this create route is plugged in you
can simply type in localhost forward
slash create and we hit here and then we
should just return text that says the
user was created such as making sure our
general MBC routine is working so hollow
world old slash create you see we hit
there we return and it says use was
created so we know at least now we're
hitting that function so in here let's
just create a user and obviously you
wouldn't just create a user lap we're
gonna do here you'd actually have a
sign-up form to your website which we
will do but again for now I just want to
show it actually doing the work
so we'll do successful which is the
result and it's awaiting the user
manager we have and it couldn't be any
simpler really you create a user you're
passing the type of user which is our
class that we already made and you can
do user name or have ours angel six
email or have as my email that's all we
need then we could say if successful
dart succeeded that sort of really is
not successful that's result so we got a
result from this call if it's exceeded
will return the user was created
otherwise we'll return that user really
fails which you should do everyone at a
second time because you should
automatically detect that the user
wasn't there the one other thing we
often need is the pass
which you don't cut in into the into
this class because you should never have
passwords in in-memory objects they
should never hit the memory that she'd
always be passed through parameters down
to the point where they used and then
hashed so that's why you see their
password passed as a a secondary thing
and here was a safe password and then
we'll break here and we'll run this and
we'll see what happens so that's the
normal parts burn off we refresh this
create you can see we've run it in this
from fast we have a result and you can
see all the errors we got three of us
one is password good cries non
alphanumeric password requires digit
password requires uppercase so you might
be saying well wherever all these come
from how are we getting password
validation things going on the answer to
that is quite simple in fact we should
have run that fully and made sure that
that shows password create user tration
failed just to you know check that you
fail you also works not just that so
there you go use equation failed we
don't want the same why couldn't care
for this demo we'd send the results you
could output them I'm not going to so
where did that password validation come
from well if you noticed here I started
mentioning you do all this lock so you
open this link that we had open and you
search for password validator look what
we get we get a default password
validator so we were to then search the
source code for password validator and
you could find you could bubble down to
trying to find it in here this might be
the right one and you can look at what
it does by default so this is the
default validates this is the bog
standard off-the-shelf password
validates that gets added you can see
here is where it does the it doesn't
have them if night adds the errors so by
default we have these options and the
options are coming from the manager
options so all we need to do is replace
the default options with our own so to
do that you can do it directly in the
identity as we saw in that override we
have this options here that we can
specify but I like to keep this bit all
done in one place so let us change here
change password policy and obviously
will revoke these in the future ones but
we do that you do services dot configure
standard configure and we want to do
identity options and then we'll be given
the options then we can go ahead and
change them so make it really weak
passwords possible for now and we do
options dot password required digits as
false options got password darts
required length let's say five and by
the way never do this in production this
is obviously just to show you what's
possible we buy a lower case for at
least require a lower case for quite
some some text at least the quite upper
case will remove and finally will remove
the requirement for alphanumeric as in
something other than a letter and a
number
so that'll make it stupidly insecure but
now if we run this code and run create
we should actually be able to create
that user so if we refresh this page
user was created how good so we didn't
break point into that book really the
only other option was we were successful
it just tells us that anyway so what I
should mean now is in our users table
right-click and select on one thousand
we should actually see that user and we
do I don't know there's nothing as it's
interesting I also not sure that few
seems about weird let's just making you
query do it cells select all from SP and
that users there we go that was just a
way of view I'm not sure why select top
100 shows like it maybe I clicked the
wrong thing last time so it works that
time so you can see here we have the ID
which has been generated by that
kokom provider potentially if not then
it is simply part of the identity that
we always use goods for the IDS we've
never failed in access we've got a
concurrency stamp which is used by the
database of two people or two calls or
two threads try to edit the user at the
same time before the Edit the use of the
public and currency stamp then they do
an edit then they try and commit every
time I commit happens as concurrent
system changes so at the point of commit
it's it's a standard database thing you
can look up on Google and it's called
concurrency you know database
concurrency jacking so basically it just
simply ensures that this this line of
the database can't be edited by two
things at once
by use of a concurrency stamp so it can
figure out you know who was first to try
and commit the email is what we were
given it's not being confirmed by
default lockouts enabled by default so
they tried multiple times we can lock
the user out and there's all policies
there you know failure of login five
times lock them out for five minutes
that type of behavior that's baked into
the asp.net identity that we're using
normalized email is simply as it states
it takes our email and normalizes it so
if we want to do comparisons we want to
find the user based on email and we type
in con tapped I and you know I miss the
upper case lower case dot then trying to
do a search for that in an SQL query for
this the email wouldn't work so instead
of having to cast our code to certain
states upper case lower case and hood
comparisons for quickness at the time of
editing the email it creates a
normalized which is just upper cased
version of our email so that when we try
to find a usable that email we can
simply compare it via application we
know that we should find it same for the
username the password is a hash of the
password we entered which wishes
password the phone number is indented or
confirmed
two-factor authentication has enabled
the usernames there and then the
security stamp so I was going to talk
about this at the end but we might as
well talk about this a little bit now so
the security stamp basically changes
every time anything related to the
security of this account changes so if
your username changes the stamp will
change your email changes the
sample change the linked two-factor
authentication anything that is revolved
around a successful login anything that
would change the details of a successful
login then the security stamp changes
now what happens when you you log into
the website as you'll see is you then
get a cookie which stores a unique ID of
your successful login and that cookie
will last however long it should last
which by default is 30 minutes so every
30 minutes the cookie will disappear and
it will naturally be authenticate or
even if you are stayed and the security
stamp will always be checked for
authenticity I'll be tan so every time
you get a login it will be checked and
again there's a default time out on when
the security stamp will be refreshed
which we can change and if this changes
it will have simply invalidate any
logged in user so if we were to say
update our email address in our code and
we say update email address we should
then forcefully tell asp.net to update
the security stamp as well but by
default little update automatically once
every 30 minutes but we want if we were
ever want to force that action to
instantly refresh sheet we can call
update Security stamp so that enables
things like say you have multiple app
sign in to your application
and they get given a unique key that
that's why when you log into something
on your phone you don't have to keep
logging in again it simply knows it's on
your phone and that's due to a key but
then say you go and edit your username
online you want your users to be kicked
out from the phones to real authentic 8
to make sure you know it's still valid
user so that's what the secured some
doors will see that an action I'll pop
and do it that in a separate video
just so we can you know spend a little
bit of time looking at it but that's
what the security stunt does and like I
say we could mess with that but I think
that's enough for now
so we're now created the user and it's
created the user in the database so now
if we were to and we can also look at
the error here if we were to then track
create the same user again with the same
details we should get another error and
there you go
the duplicate username which is again
built into the settings that doesn't
allow that for obvious reasons because
that is the key so we're not gonna mess
with that but you can see that we could
easily dump out the error messages to
the user and handle them specifically so
we know that's now working we have the
ability to create a user which you would
naturally just link up to your login
form or rather your signup form and then
you could inspect the result the errors
to output specific errors to users but
for now we'll do that so we'll just say
it's our single user for now so then you
might say what's the one how do we sign
in and - what's the use of signing in if
you can't restrict access in the first
place
so to make something private as as
simple as making a public whatever you
want to make you know you just you
normal action wherever you're going on
your website we'll just call this
private and we will return content this
is a private area welcome and then
presumably well no it definitely they
can only ever get to here if they signed
in which means we should have access to
what we mentioned before or the HTTP
context what user so we can then use
your identity and name and I'd like to
pull out the name let's make that text
HTML and then we return that so now to
make this whole thing private you can
use authorize control dot to include the
right tag and now this this private
thing here we also do a route so it's
easier to access and we just see private
this canal will be accessed by
authorized personnel by logged in users
and specifically by you know the roles
if you will so if you override then you
can specify you know specific policies
and things and there's you'll notice
here the specific roles so you can also
lock down not only just by simply
Authority but specific Authority as well
you can do it per option or you could do
it on the whole controller so your
entire every action inside that control
naturally authorized so I just again
start without cladding for testing we
can access the private page and this'll
actually crash with I presume this will
crash because identity or user is gonna
be null so and that that's perfectly
valid to leave like that because they
shouldn't be able to access that page
without being private so this'll also in
fact asthma bother crashing which is
interesting I would have thought that
would have crushed so what do we get
identity user as their identities there
and it's something not ok so by default
it creates all these things they simply
no doubt so that's something to bear in
mind as well of you you know you check
in that so that will quite happily now
proceed and we're not logged in and it's
saying welcome nobody effectively so
then what happens if we now lock this
area out and run so now what should
happen is the identity service that we
set up in here should figure out that
user is not allowed and it should then
redirect us to the login page which
again if we open this link just to
quickly show you that that link comes
from here where we do the add cookie for
the application schema and the account
login is where we expect to go so this
login path means when when they are
unauthorized where do you send them and
it sends them to forward slash account
for slash login so we know hit up this
private you can then see that's exactly
what it's done it's redirected us to
account login it's also passed in it a
query oil same where they come from and
% to F is just ill encoding for forward
slash so we effectively come from for
it's less private so that's where we
should in theory in our action redirect
to there so we can then handle that for
one I don't like account login so let's
just change that here now a little to do
so change login oil and to change the
logon era again its services but this
time you don't do configure by default
the other special one specific for
configure application cookie
so we'll do options again and then here
we were options got the login path and
again this hard-coded bit here I
wouldn't be doing this this would come
from a core class so anyway we're doing
routes to certain places in the code
like this hard coded we won't do that in
future this is just for this video nor
would we do it here these would all be
coming directly from actual boots in a
class so that you know our entire
application and all of our windows and
iPhone and Android apps can all make use
of that exact same bunch of expected
URLs so for now we'll just change it to
redirect to or slash login and if we run
that we should get the login page you
know we do write in the login so let's
also make a login part here so we know
now this is a private area that works
that now is redirecting so we can't get
this area anymore without logging in so
now let's do a probably async task
action result login and we can also make
use of if I remember what it was when we
closed it this we turn now so we just
pass in string return ill and it
shouldn't be case sensitive and that
should then be given by effectively the
it will automatically be pulled out by
NBC from the query string so we should
then get this piece of information of
where to go to and then now here log in
is where you typically present your
login page for the user to type the
username and password then they click a
form to submit that back to the website
here's my credentials and then you get
to the real call that then does the
latter login and redirects so again for
now we'll just for simplicity and to
show you the actual the code in action
when we hit login
we're just automatically going to sign
the user into a specific account with
the right username and password so we
will do that with using again the this
time the sign-in manager so
sounding mind you got sign-in so you
could do a sign-in by that but the
typical way to do it because after the
user would have provided that it would
be to you know password signing so then
we have the password side and we have an
override Walkabout the username angel
six will do the password that we know is
password persistent means the based on
the cookies so once they close the
browser out do you want them to be able
to you know the cookies to stay created
at that point or you want the cookie to
be you know removed as soon as they
close the web page so typically that
banks and things you don't ever want
them to be we can just finish your
closure site
others it would be really annoying if
you're browsing say Facebook can you
close it and went back on and you
instantly have to real aughh in and so
it all depends on preference I'm gonna
say persistent for now because we'll
show you not doing that you can also say
lock out fail at counting and lockout on
failure as in they won't instantly lock
out it will actually indicate the amount
of tries before it should lock out so
it's a little bit inconsistent with
description it's that'll add to the
count of how many attempts you can sign
in before you lock out which is that
database table we saw so it's just lock
out walkouts enabled lockout ended in
fact no it looks like it's a direct lock
out so I thought that handled it baked
in with access failed account we could
prove that after we can try that in fact
we could try that right now as the first
attempt let's first fail with the wrong
password
let's awake that and let's just return
content testing just because I really
want to see if this is to behavior so
I'm explaining it correctly and then
obviously the route would be the login
so we can either hit login up directly
that's gonna complain that we're not
called async due to my coding Convention
style so if we run this now and we hit
the login page it should attempt to
login with the wrong password and
obviously fail and then let's see what
our database has to say about that so we
do for a slash login
and now we refresh this access failed
count one lockout enabled one lockout
end so we don't have a lockout which is
correct so we hit again and again let's
see we have three attempts I just hit
this off a dozen times and there you can
see finally don't know how many times I
probably four or five it's now finally
locked us out and now with the lockout
ends at 9:53 at 9:35 rather so you can
see that's how I thought he acted so
that's why that's slightly inconsistent
if you are so even though this you
saying lockout on failure it simply
means that adds to the attempted failed
logins and again you can change that
value in the time and there the options
if you like I believe it's just in the
in here and the main application cookies
so you got the lock logout path return
if not we can find it and again you can
just find it fairly easily access denied
path the Isis isn't than that one which
is easy enough to find we can find in
the next video and and show you a change
in the amount of successful logins so on
here we don't really care or just are
false we might now have to tweak the
database just so we can actually log
back in so update SP users another thing
to never do online databases but this is
a demo so fine updates users set block
out and keep calls nor where well in
fact we don't have anything else in the
database to update all of them
so now we are magically not locked out
so this time we're sounding with the
right password and we can get the result
so far there's also equals sign use it
in with the valid credentials and photo
login page for testing oh I just noticed
I didn't even do a correct thing there
traffic area no
picking the owner to return to go
successfully logged in
that would be the same thing as
successful and then we do we would do in
fact we did do that in one line return
will be direct and we can pass in the
oil so what we actually do is if string
that is more empty return oil question
mark then we'd redirect to option and we
do name of the index action or the home
we call it the index action in fact you
wouldn't definitely do that you because
it's not necessarily the name it would
be the route itself but again right now
we don't have a route so I'll just do
that for now and that is it otherwise
we'd be direct to the given return ale
so what's that complaining about tab
conditional agree not because there was
no emplacement aversion between a
redirect to action so doing two
different results okay so just break
that out into an if statement string is
no empty return redirect to action
otherwise we return every direct we hop
now return I'll go to home otherwise go
to the eternal
and then we would never hit here well we
wouldn't we failed so at this point it
would be failed to login which again we
could test so let's test with the
invalid password and run this and the
result should now be that we fail the
login and we just simply say fail of
logging and you can inspect the results
so we can see this in action so if we do
login the result just has failed and it
gives us no real reason we simply failed
logging and and the reason for that is
also for security that simply if you
fail to login you shouldn't tell them
information like the password is wrong
your username was wrong
you should literally just say you know
you failed for security purposes what
you can do though is inspect and check
with the sign-in manager or the user
manager if the user has locked out too
then at least give them that information
so they don't keep trying that you know
you've got to wait five minutes or
something but that's why you get no real
info there so we should now see failed
to login which we do so we correct that
password now two password one or two
password
and then we try to login now we should
see we successfully logged in and we
been redirected to hello world so we
know we're logged in because we've gone
to the home page for one so now if we
went to primary three should be able to
login well we should automatically be
logged in well private area welcome
angel SEC so now it knows we're logged
in so let's press f12 we're on the
storage tab which is cookies and you can
see we have here cookies for this web
page you have the name of the cookie
which is asp net core application
application o idents the application you
can see we've also got this time of how
long this cookie will last which the
browser is about responsible for
deleting or creating sexy was created
just and it expires in two weeks from
now so that's the default behavior as
14-day cookie expiration which i think
is pretty insane I would not expect
somebody to not log into a web site for
two weeks and when they come back it's
still valid and then this value is the
value that will bubble down in the web
site to be in the actual information of
that user's login so if we now look at
the asp.net user's login we're not
seeing it that it's a cookie one so it's
done based on cookies I would have
thought though the simple can't find any
access in there now I am surprised
because I believe oh no I wrote my own
nuts what I'm thinking of when I did
authentication in the previous one I
actually made a persistent database
login so this cookie is handled in
memory of this running web site so I
believe of we start the website that
cookie will get lost because he's in the
memory of the actual web server he notes
kept in memory to the application so it
doesn't bother right you know it's not
persistent to a database which will
probably do what we'll definitely do
later so now I tried to private the
should control shift R so this is
persisting somewhere it's not actually
interesting I'll I'll figure that out
unless somebody wants to comment in the
comments on that
where this where this is then
authenticating in you know how this is
effectively authenticating what it might
be doing as boiling down what we should
really do is decrypt this this password
this cookie data or just look at the
source code of what this cookie data
contains and boil it back to where it's
authenticating what it might be doing is
boiling straight back down to this
security stamp and validating that way
and it simply matches that security
stamp so let's just test that theory
let's just mess with it so update SP not
users which would make sense because
they've changed this since I did it in
SP net1 so this is like a fresh project
so things have changed but this is a
good learning curve from yourself as
well and a good proving ground of what's
really happening
so we'll update security stamp set of
school something equals and then we need
a new GUI at least just so it looks you
know familiar in some way and you
shouldn't really directly edit obviously
the database like this to see just for
me I'm curious to what's happening so
that will be without the curly braces
let's do that I know it's lowercase book
I don't really care here I've only got
one user so let's just update tomorrow
I'm refresh no we have a new security
stamp that doesn't met match and I've
hacked it directly so maybe not so let's
at least see how we decrypt this cookie
okay so I've just done quite a bit
digging into the cookie stuff to try and
find out where it couldn't like where
it's been stored directly and it let me
down quite a big rabbit hole so I want
to do a video specifically on you know
you want to understand where that cookie
is stored exactly I basically went
through all the source code on github
for the cookie management and it boils
down to a few major places where the the
cookie authentication that's had lead in
the start of class inside at the adult
an add identity adds a cookie
Authenticator
that then tries to get
what's called the I think it was a data
secure data provider and a time data
format and those effectively do protect
an on protect on the cookie they can be
configured to store on the file system
but my main curiosity was where it's
actually stored right now it definitely
isn't stored it well I say it's not in
the database
I can't seeds in the database I do SQL
Server profiler and it doesn't get any
hits so I'm pretty sure it's not in the
database
I also did a file watcher on the C Drive
just as a quick interest and there was
no activity on the C Drive specific to
that either
so all have been thought it was handled
by memory but then I published and run
it in memory and closed and killed a
fresh new memory and there definitely is
also not handled by memory so I got so
far with the the dig in and I think
what's happened is it's it's stored in
the file system but in a protected area
with the file system it's actually
calling like a Windows protected storage
type thing so we can't access it or see
it directly or monitor its activity and
that's big deep within the dotnet core
source code so I got so far down into it
and then thought I've been doing it for
probably 40 minutes now and I'm like now
we'll do we'll do a separate video on
exactly we're not necessarily where the
cookie is stored because that's stored
in the browser if we just open this and
you can see there's no cookie we go to
log in then we'll have a cookie so
there's no mystery here I found that
this is basically handled by a chunking
cookie manager or something that
basically takes the the claims principle
of the user chunks it up so it's nice
and small and provides that and then
like I said this time date format
decrypt that information so there's no
mystery as to where this cookie years
it's more about I want to know on the
server side when we see effectively we
refresh that or we go to private where
this is is coming from where this where
are we here so we're we're
authenticating with the cookie
authentication Handler and where it's
actually
in the stored information just curiosity
that says we don't need to do it but now
I'm really curious because you know I
don't have all the answers there
so we'll do a cookie authentication
video separately to really dig into that
for now I just quickly added a a log out
to the home control to show you how to
sign out so if we change that to say
call it log out so it matches this is
how you log out just sign out and this
will also remove the cookie so that's
how it's done
but like say I want to dig deeper right
into the core of this to find out where
we are so probably a good thing to also
add to the log in is to first sign out
sign out any previous sessions so they
go to log in page or sign out any
previous so if we were to then spin that
up and then you can do your own test
maybe somebody knows this answer and
they can comment in the video as to
primarily like say when once the cookies
created on this page so now we're signed
in we're on the server side is that you
know necessarily being validated against
what where's that stored credential if
you will like if we want to now clear it
instantly and you should be able to back
track it through the this call but like
I said spend 40 minutes digging into
code and got right down to knowing that
it's stored in the data like a protected
data provider but then I never got I
just got bored of digging to be honest
with doing such a long video in the
first place so that's that's one for
another day but again I'd love to see
comments I'd expect it to be in the
database originally which it wasn't so
that's what started there in an old
process but now at least if we do say
log out you'll see that that will now
clear the cookie so we've got those page
you so let's just wrap up the few bits
left in this video the cookie that you
could see was expiring in 14 days by
default so let's just finish this last
to do here and let's change the cookie
timeout so in fact that will be in there
alter application cookie in film and you
can actually store the keys to the
cookie in here is the other thing with
data protection provider so we can the
bit I'm talking about to dig more into
if we'd specified this explicitly and we
overrode a data protection provider
potential just making you one run pretty
sure we're after certain oh that's a
static class so you can do it create so
we could do they provide up create test
and you specify stuff in there I guess
Maps my overloads yeah there's plenty
available loads of what to do there so
we could create like an in-memory one or
one that stores keys on the filesystem
and that's fine then we could see the
keys of the cookies being created and
then we'd be able to clear cookies
that's what we'll start in the next
video but the main thing is we're the
default one ends up going is what I'm
mainly after and I'm pretty sure simply
enough on the file system but just in a
location I can't monitor and I've also
hunted for so again anyone that knows
that let me know or be curious to change
the cookie time out simply option stop
expires timespan and we'll do x fund off
from seconds let's make our cookie
expire every 15 seconds of an activity
change it to expire in 15 seconds I can
even do yeah through 15 seconds so if we
spin that up now we will have a cookie
that should expire if we don't hit the
cookie up within 15 seconds so we have I
don't really got one right now by
default there's no cookie so we then go
into login and we have a cookie now you
can see it's expiring in 15 seconds from
the created date if we refresh you can
see it updates 38
forty-eight so it's every time we
refreshing the page it's updating the
cookie if we were to now sit and let
that go past 48 seconds so if we were to
do what does go past 48 which it now has
if we were to refresh here now it should
have been expired which it yeah so now
it's expired basically so now we won't
deprive it we should hit other what
because we auto-login an effect which
should be redirected to login when we
hit private now and you can see we're
now at the login so if we were then to
do private again you see the private
page expires and it hits the private
page so we're not repented gating so the
cookie is persisting you can see there
36 seconds now it's updated to 45 and
then if we wait for it to go past the 45
that's how the cookie expires so that's
how you naturally get signed out to web
sites from inactivity it's this you know
the cookie expiring so I think that's
covered everything that we were after
let's just wait for this to timeout go
to 53 and then refresh so now we can
just do a refresh and you can see then
we hit the login page which we then just
Auto log back in so that was the the
starters to effectively creating asp.net
server application for faceted word and
we've got at least the ability to start
logging in users creating users and
we've done some diving into what's what
the only Mike said that the lack of
knowledge right now that we will address
is purely about this one key point of
once the cookies been created in that
new piece of informations there how
asp.net is authenticating against that
like not necessarily how we know that
it's it's keeping track of that users
logged in and monitoring the
you know that the users security token
and things haven't changed but it's more
about where is it physically stored on
this machine that's running the server
and we haven't got to the bottom of that
yet so that's not super critical because
we know the process we know how to sign
them out sign them in to more of a
curiosity thing so that will do for that
video the next one will either carry on
with this maybe create some actual HTML
UI at least for some some basic sign up
so we are actually typing in a username
and you can go to register you know
create a user and then we might jump
back to the Fassett our word application
and have it so that we can create it
from that application actually call this
website push it live to a server and
start hitting it up test to register
users on register users you know all
that kind of good stuff so it should
start getting interesting any questions
or comments again as usual let me know
and I'll get back to you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
