get back to making the Isetta word
desktop application WPF application we
built enough of this web server now that
we can actually log in so that's what
we're going to do in this video so we
want to now just tidy up this login call
so that we can actually access the real
credentials from the client so we'll
start there in the API controller and
then in the login call we want to pass
in first our client is going to pass
some data he'll do from body so we can
pass a jason serialize string with the
credentials in once a login credentials
API model we'll call it and we'll make a
new model this will go in core so we'll
have to add existing project gift angel
6 that's a word sauce core and then
we'll add core into the server project
core will also need if we add manage
nougat packages browse it we'll need the
DNA doc framework because we'll be
making you to the web requests so go
ahead and install that as I'll do these
updates while we're here apparently
there's updates and others not clear
that off updates update all of those
while we're here that's it so now we
have the core project in there we'll
make a new folder in core and call API
models and then here we'll make this new
model name this
and this will be the potentials for a an
API
hey guys I am a log into the server and
you see it's open back and then we'll
have this is just a plus it's gonna get
serious to passing some data so we're
passing a username and the password and
I'll do will add that to do we have a
spellchecker file ID username to the
ignored words so we have logging
potential APR model we don't want the
namespace B that and now we should have
a model we can use ctrl dots I would
reference tips that a would call we
don't even have yet and then there we go
so now and here we'll call this login
credentials and we can do this to do so
get the users information and check if
it's correct so now first thing we want
to do is make sure we have a username
which you can't log in without that so
if the login credentials nullable so it
can be not if the username is not or the
login credentials username string dot is
no white space then do that and before
we do that let's make an extension
method of this is normal whitespace you
don't have to do string dot is normal
white space and then this so can flip
the logic around in fact I'll add that
to DNA framework after so ignore that
one for now but I will move that out so
basically we have no user name or the
user names blank then
we want to return our message to user so
we're also going to change this action I
up from results first you want to be
acing because we're going to be doing
some awaiting and we'll add a task and
then the stead of returning an action
result we're not actually we turn the
direct thing that we want to return so
will me in another model because every
API call throughout the whole
application is going to return a
specific thing it's gonna be you know a
result from an API call so we want an
API result of ul and API response and
that in itself converse a bit succeeded
or not and if it's failed what's the
error message there the kind of default
things we want in every single request
throughout the whole API so for that
we're making new API model and we'll
call it API response and in the API
response we'll just have a generic class
and then the response floor or Web API
calls made we've got the constructors
fine on some public properties we'll
have one or two mentions successful so
whether it's successful or not and then
we'll have an error message and to be
honest this successful can simply be if
the error message is not yeah so there's
no error indicates if the API call was
successful the error message for a
failed API call and then we'll need the
actual you know the cost and data to
each response so that will be the teeth
the thing we pass in and we'll just call
that response the API response object so
that's you'll see how this is used in a
minute that's kind of the main response
were used for all of them
change the namespace to just call and
none of this can be returning an API
response and this time we wanted to
return we have a little login
credentials API which is passed in we
also want the login credentials response
or the login response so we can have
login we can either do a response
because it's an API response but it's
not really response it's a result from a
login request so we'll call this login
results API model and all the API models
in API model so we know what you know
that they are expected as an API model
the result of a successful login request
via API got the constructor and then in
this we've sort weren't really the the
token public string token which is the
Jason bear a token we made in the last
one the authentication token used to
stay authentic gated throughout future
requests but what I know we also want in
our for set a word application the WPF
application as once we've logged in we
want the want to get the users details
for put in the settings page so the
first name last name user name and email
so Chuck goes into the response we don't
have to make a subsequent requests for
information will not as well return it
in the same statement and then also
we'll have to actually add these to the
the user because the user doesn't have
any first or last name yet that's nice
and easy to do whereas plus a username I
know technically they know the username
because the user so again but it's still
good practice to return directly from
the server that it's this is the
information
in case we because in future we
will actually allow user name and email
login and will resolve either one back
to the username so we will need to you
know pass this in the users email users
email so I think that's enough for a
result that we want to send back so this
one that'll be basically a task so we
can await something and it's gonna beat
in an API response that contains a
response object of type login result API
model when you return in an object
directly it automatically gets casted to
an object result which then gets
converted based on as we mentioned in
the previous videos if they request
Jason and we support Jason it returns a
JSON object of the request that they
want to accept XML and we've allowed XML
in the startup I believe
here we add XML support then it would
you know serialize to XML so by
returning the object directly we're not
saying it's a certain format we allow
the the input and output for matters to
you know do what they want so that I'll
return this JSON for our you know our
version so if they fail to login this is
how we done return its we return a new a
new API response so new API response of
login result API model and then here we
just have to set the error message
because the successful is based on if we
haven't have a message or not so this
will be invalid username or password and
this is something that I also don't like
doing that we need to fix surely to do
localize or strings so that's it sitting
there that's error message so we just
returned that means we don't need those
brackets that will check for basically
the username being valid IAP not the
username you emailed that we actually
have a username so the next case is to
positive the user credentials are
potentials are correct so we'll try and
get the user first so I'll get the user
via the user manager which we don't have
right now so if we go to the home and we
mentioned this before with dependency
injection we just copy the constructor
and we'll do the same thing we'll do a
constructor injector here so we'll just
do C tall dump that in there wrap that
in region default constructor and then
do I have comments on the home one up in
the neck nope I didn't comment them so
it's just a little bit of comment in
here the identity sign-in manager the
identity user manager I think that's it
and copy them over control dot omni's to
use identity so we can get them and
we'll also pinch the whole protected
members so this is just injecting the
same stuff so we can access these things
inside the API response to you know get
user information because we use the
identity to to get user information just
fix this I'm in the login once we login
in sync because it's now an asynchronous
response right so finally we want to now
get the user from the username so to do
that we can now use the user manager and
find by which one is it find by name so
with the right now and I've set a word
application we say fan by email we login
by email so we could actually provide
for well we could rename that to
username or email and we can just simply
do some smart
tapped in if it's gotten at in we're
gonna presume an email first we could
just blindly go try and find by email
and try and found by username but we'll
do a lot of it it's smart
so if it's an email and then we could
also refuse to how apt symbols in
usernames be short and then we can
easily differentiate between emails and
usernames then we can say if login
credentials docked username or email doc
contains or rather not even though bar
as email equals that then usually calls
and here we can then do is email
question mark
wait user dot fine by email and it can
be login credentials username or email
otherwise it is let's get some more wine
for now we use it up fine by name in
fact we won't keep that online we'll
jump back down so it's basically if it's
an email got the user cool got the user
details line by email fine by username
so that one will get the user details
from the database and return the
application user then we can check did
we find the user and also we can just
rip this out for the minute into a
variable invalid error message
the message when we fail to login and we
don't want to give them any information
about what he failed because that gives
people who are trying to you know hack
into accounts a clue if they if we say
the username doesn't exist and they know
it's not a valid username so you don't
tend to give information out either so
did we find a user if the user or rather
didn't because you always want to invert
the logic to return their statements as
soon as possible
so let's relax lebih if we fail to find
a user then we're going to return the
same thing so we're going to return this
and we could also make this a standard
error response to be honest and just do
that the error response for a failed
login there we go so now we can do if it
fails their return every response saves
a little bit of repeating and then we
fail here because there's no username we
return the error message what else have
we got to validate now we're going to
validate the actual passwords correct so
have we got here
we have a user let's validate password
yet if the password is valid and that
will be the user money pure again and
check password async then we pass and
the user we've got because it needs that
and we can pass in the login credentials
password and that will simply check if
the users password is valid and then the
password was wrong I'm sure you can
guess by now what's going to happen
there then we will return the error
message
so that's a failed login with the
password so we get here we get here we
are Valley on the user pass the correct
login details so for that then yeah
we'll do get username which is you
forgot username then I think that's it
at that point now the claims come in we
create a new ID we do the same stuff we
do sign-in a token we've got all that
and the only difference is now what we
return so instead of just returning the
original okay statement with a token
still want to return the token but we
need to return a new API response the
login results and then from that we can
now set the response equals new login
response and then here we can set the
token and then we can also now include
these actual details so the first name
is and we don't have it yet because
you'll see the user doesn't have first
or last name anything so let's go and
correct that let's go to the application
user and we'll just do public properties
public string first name and because
this is used in the DB context this will
get added to the database and also into
the identity system because it's an
identity user that's the users first
name users last name so we are going to
crop these to it we can now get them
here
and then we'll just simply say past
Berkeley user details of the token email
we already have and what was the last
one username well for their github as
well they pass all that back and this
we've actually got a set but that should
now be the only thing we need to do on
the server side we will have to clear
our database because we just made a new
database effectively by editing this
because we have application dbcontext
here and because there is well not
because it doesn't show in here it shows
here so because we use an identity DB
contact our application user this
becomes a DB set which means it becomes
a table and the database as we know and
the identity user becomes the asp net
user table so because we've altered the
part of the database sets the DB sets
we're gonna have to delete the database
and then recreate it you don't have to
actually in production you'd migrate the
database book we're just going to delete
it so we open up the SQL server go to
databases for set a word we're going to
leet the database that's gone and then
if you remember when we made this we did
an index here that simply took the
homepage of this and sure the database
gets created and then it adds settings
so presuming I haven't made any typos
here this should build and run and then
we should get a database so let's see
what happens here so let's spawn up the
website here and we've hit here so right
now we go to in here and refresh
databases there's no facet a word we
step over this should unsure and
hopefully create I am caught any
exceptions if there is an exception but
hopefully it's not gonna be creating a
database and then stepping over there we
go so you can actually see in the output
log here
it's weighted around here and then it
got bump and created a database its
output all the info so if we now go to
the SQL Server and refresh databases you
can see we got four SATA word and tables
the asp net users now if we do a new
query and select all from asp net users
you can see now if you can see down here
is a bit small on this bit but in zoom
in know this first and last name here
what we added all the others are default
as part of the identity user anyway but
we've added these two fields first and
last name so that's as easy as it is to
add users there's no user in there so we
just or if we like this finish first so
this is also going to inject the
settings of default settings just we
were showing how to do something just on
that but now what we need to add it is
the create command which was just create
so by default we're just creating a
default user here so now when we make
the application use when they create we
now want to set a first name so set us
to loop last name I'll pass and then
we'll obviously allowed to angel six and
Malpass to the spell checker actually as
well I don't like warnings and hours ago
six and HTML that's showing there so I'm
adding obviously words to be ignored by
the dictionary so these purple lines
don't appear so we close when we open
they should go now so we pronounced use
create to create a single default user
the next step we'll do in the next video
is actually make the register function
so the user can create an account from
the WPF application so they can
effectively sign up as well as sign in
and then this would be replaced but for
now this is the static creation so we
just spent on the website again and
actually make the user so make this
default user so we can log in so that's
all spin up the page we've checked all
this now it's fine
and we now go to four slash create you
can see we hit here it creates the user
like that before
should have succeeded good tiles is
exceeded and then we check the database
now you can see we now have the user and
we've got our first and last name set so
that's it for the server I believe so if
we were to keep this server running I
don't think there's anything else we
need to do here also need to now do is
hit up this login request here so I'll
put a breakpoint in there and let's now
go to the Fassett a word application
let's just spin this up a make sure
everything works first as normal you
know as it did before so we'll get to
here you must have a breakpoint in from
the last time and for setter words here
so we have the the application that we
haven't worked on in three months so
that's not be fun let's get rid of this
I don't like the hew ID debugging thing
tools customized nope always get that
one wrong tools options zamel debugging
general and disabled you are debugging
that drives me nuts
so we spin this up and by default we
just went to this page and then clicking
and get back so let's just change this
back to normal so to do that we go to
the facetted word application it has
been a while since I've been in here
I've got to figure out my way around
application view model change the first
page back to login and then well
obviously once we've logged in and
stored the details and saved it when the
application starts then we would read
that information whether we've already
signed in and direct to the correct page
but for now we'll just go straight to
the login and we'll hide the side menu
and then we'll run this and make sure it
works basically
and so now we're back at the sign and
the sign I might have to fake it just
spins and then goes to there and then
the settings oh settings are broken
since I last looked and so they're there
so it looks like the animation summits
failing like this animation because once
we run it it's there so this is what we
put in as dummy information which
funnily offers practical ISM of the
right information so this will change to
our username which is angel sips and
this will be the real name without the
date bought let's just fix that
animation where were animations where
did we put them animation framework
elements fade in fade out wow I can't
remember this it's been a while
slide and slide out I think we're in the
wrong place here unless the attached
properties isn't attached properties
framework element animations there we go
animate base property right so it's not
fading in on first load so somebody with
this first load so we're getting already
loaded first load on first load did it
do oh yeah we have this delay think you
don't we wait for the delay for some
elements to get laid out and do the
animation first load value so first time
it comes in it won't be loaded so that
beam all come through here it would add
a flag - already loaded next time it
comes and then it would find that the if
it's already loaded false which would be
the first case then it set the first
load value here ah but the delay is
gonna cause this to be the original
value Oh
so we need to reload I think we need to
reload that after the delay again that's
what's happening try got the first load
button so refresh the first load value
okay so it change since the five
millisecond delay so I think that's what
the issue is
let's try running again fake a lot him
for now yeah there we are so that's back
to working again so we want to set these
off the ones we've logged in that's the
end of your way we'll know right now and
we hopefully want to change the little
login so the log in is the login view
model which is here so right now we got
this fake login so let's just remove
that then we want to where do we start
you want to call the server and attempt
to log in with credentials so we'll have
a result and that will be a wait DNA dot
web requests compact event we just do
web request control dot using DNA this
is what we made on one of the other
videos post async so we're gonna post to
the server that we just made and we're
gonna be expecting a reply back of an
API response of a login result of API
model and we'll obfuscate that in
obfuscated will abstract that out to an
API manager after we run just directly
call web request will we'll make use of
an API manager but again for now keep it
simple until we've built it up
so we have the post we want the ale
again for now will font them in here but
we do want to do move all ills and API
routes to static what and core but for
now we'll just hard type it just for you
no getting past this point um bore this
video with just making there you know a
static class for now so this will be API
login and this is matching the web
server api lock then again this will be
abstracted so that will basically both
use the same variable so we will have to
do this and this would become the host
name you know the server the wherever we
want to go so anyway that's that we make
the login request of that oil and what
else does it not the details so this
will be what it's expecting which is the
new login credentials API model will
fill out in a minute and then afterwards
it wants that's it no one serialize we
keep participating by default so if we
could to do that it should request to
the server with no info so we've cut in
username or email equals where is I
think this is the actual oh we're in the
view model so it's the actual email that
gone to the email box
the password is if we go down to here we
can Nick how we get it from here and
paste that in so that go straight
through straight in and doesn't get
really stored anywhere so that's the
safest way to do that and that should
fire off a request to the server and
then once we're back we'd want to
actually check if we have details so for
now let's just return so nothing happens
and hit here and then we we've got the
server running still so if we f5 this
now
we should check at least we pass the
details in check or we log in and if we
log in with an invalid data
so right now
we passed nothing we got no email no
password it should hit a breakpoint on
the server the remote server could not
be resolved localhost helps have you
spell like that localhost try that one
again
so login with no details we hit this off
it goes there we go and so we've now hit
the server the server has got login
details and correctly we have nothing so
it shouldn't basically figure out that
an invalid response and return the
response so we now get a result and our
result is raw server responses there
there Jason
and this deserialized server responds
here's an error message that we want so
we can display that error message next
so after here we will do a result
firstly of the results nothing because
it could be nothing
we'll have them all and won't go and
then figure out a message I think so the
result is no finalist keep it clean the
result is not then no let's do it this
way it's back shelters null for result
dot server responses no for the result
dot server response not successful is
not successful
so basically if there's any kind of
failure if there was no response bad
data or a successful respond or a
response with a success OSS response
with a failed or a response with an
error message so basically if there's
any failure then we'll have a message
which for now is nothing
if we got no oh well have we got a
response from the server so the results
which could be naught dot server
response isn't equal to null then
certain message to service response so
this is if we have the result that we do
have so the server response has an error
message so what's happened to that if we
don't so that means basically that the
server response is null which means the
server response is null and that doesn't
matter so basically the whole result
isn't all then in fact note the result
could be yeah so the result the result
might not be no but the server sponsors
definitely not so in this case get the
dealing with the only option we have is
to basically get the default result oh
yeah there's a point the results no we
need to just reply an unknown so if
result equals null if we have no results
at all in fact that can just be an else
that can be the fallback so result isn't
equal to norm and then the fallback
message could be up here so this could
be B to do localized strings failed but
what else can it be unknown ever sending
server ah ah do not say unknown error
from server response from server core I
don't know wolf change that message or
anything that's fine that's basically
there everything's gone wrong we have no
information because the result was
simply not something I should never
really happen but you know we can handle
that so that would be
else down here in fact that else
wouldn't matter because we've already
got the message so the only thing
happens here then if it's not null set
message to standard HT HT TP server
response details so this would be the
message equals failed to communicate the
server status code passing some
information we've got the status code
and then when passing the results
message as well the status description
we could also handle what's wrong with
that result isn't able to know our house
every so we've got that message there's
the other case is if we have this could
be null because it's still here as well
as that beam also as a result let's do
another check I'm beginning wish I did
this separately in individual ones so if
the if we have a result but deserialize
failed so I'll save results isn't people
to know or rather I'll set question mark
result dot row response and that is
string doc is no white space so if it's
not so we basically have a raw serve
response but yet we don't have a serve
response and deserialization failed so
in that case we can set error message
message equals unexpected response from
server and then you pass the response
and that's good enough so that's going
to just dump out the Jason in case the
DC realization fails Ducey realize
what's add into the cause vs spellcheck
and so finally we're down to now here if
we have a result but no server its
pompous details at all then we simply
have to fall down to display in the
status code so this one part can be set
like that so all that was doing is
figuring out which message to display so
we have four states we have one over
everything is nought and we got this
default message too if we did get a
response but we had absolutely no
details from the server so you know the
server didn't reply with any kind of
JSON object no body no nothing then we
would get into here every did reply with
some Johson but our DC realization
failed inside here then we get to here
so there's four states of you know
what's gone wrong it's not as it's left
and the reason I wanted to group all
them so into a single display ever call
and then we turn so in that case we'd do
the await IFC UI Joe message new message
box view model tightly cause logging
failed and again to do localized strings
they'll have to do that students I'm
going to start grabbing map and the
message is the message so that should be
yet to be showed if we fail which we'll
try now we should display the error
message to the user on you know
effectively a failed login so nothing in
will get a reply I'll hit up this will
come back so we have a result we have a
response from the server so we display
the error message and invalid username
password there we go
if we were to obviously have all their
issues then these are the ones that
thrilled we can test them I'm not going
to bother the fairly obvious we'll test
them at another point but basically we
could return well we could test one but
to be honest this might crash don't even
know if we tried to just say settings
design model let's just purposely fail a
DC realization I think I made the DNA
framework just throw in that instance
for now and not you know not return
nought so yeah I just crashed but
because I don't have exceptions on it
didn't catch so right now
this in DNA framework will crash if it
fails to deserialize whereas instead all
updated in future to potentially just
return null with an error message or
some kind of status so for now that's
good enough we have a login attempt then
an aromatic if something went wrong so
if not if we have a result here and a
response and it's effectively successful
if we got here means with logged in yeah
it means we successfully logged in so
now in fact that's kind of a good enough
message anyway so this is now where we
want to put the real data this is the
settings page so we'll have we got dummy
data here so this can now be replaced
with the result or user data equals the
results dot server response and then
it's the response inside of that which
is that specific info for that now is
the user data we pass back and server
this can be the name which is in fact
its first name and last name then the
user name is the user data dot user name
fake password the same and email as user
data dot email such should be real info
set and then the set of page should work
so we try and log in now and actually
successfully log in
so we passed some real info so let's try
logging in with the username first
password and this should go to here
which it has so I'll hang on what's
going on I didn't want to edit I just
wanted to step over
let's just stop it something's gone
weird there to restart that get to that
restart that and we'll obviously handle
all the this isn't the final call handle
you know this is just to show you we
love to handle things like when there's
no internet when it's failed the owners
from the app crashing so you know this
technically would right now but we're
not gonna that's not the final thing so
password we hit that up we hit our
server and there we go so now we have
login credentials we have the username
and password so we get through we have
that if it's an email which you should
be which it shouldn't be rather which is
correct it tries to get the username by
name the user has been found so that's
good it's valid password it's gonna
check if that's a valid password which
it is so basically all the checks have
passed we get this we pass back all the
info user name first name last name
everything that comes back we now get
that response which has got all the info
in and we set up the settings page
hopefully and go to the chat page so if
we go to settings now you can see we
actually have the real day to the the
username and everything we signed in
with logout just moves back to this page
from helix we haven't stored that info
which is fine let's not let's try to
login with an email and hit that up
comes through is emails true find user
by email and its founders again so would
we turn and I was just hit a breakpoint
doesn't come back
we now go settings and we've logged in
again with username or email so that's
really the the login side don't we have
obviously got to still do clean up bits
and
we're going to store this token still so
the server for one less server once it's
done and it's got the token and it
creates it here as I mentioned in the
last video we need some way to
invalidate the token and effectively an
extra step in between simply this
automatically validating that B token
and instead we want to also confirm it's
still in memory and the user hasn't
revoked the token so got to do that on
the server side and on this client side
now we've got the token in the user data
we need to commit that to you know
memory of your we need to store that's
when the application opens
it's remembered we've logged in so for
that we're gonna do entity framework and
we'll do a you know an entity framework
in the WPF application so we've got it
in the Isetta word application already
the server because we're using it this
is you know what we're already doing but
in the word application now we'll have
it so it runs on entity framework and
we'll probably run on an SQL local
database so that it's something we can
install with our installer and then it's
a you know a physical flat file on the
system so it's easier than setting up
you know you don't want the end you just
having to create SQL Server databases
that's just not what you knew so we'll
have a seamless local database entry so
hopefully this video with useful and
we're back into WPF word application
that peseta word application if you want
to support what I'm doing you want more
videos like this I've got a patreon page
set up that the link will be in the
description so any supports greatly
appreciated and as always any comments
questions or anything else you can
simply leave comments in the video below
and I always get back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
