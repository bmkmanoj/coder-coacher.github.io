the page animation finish off the page
animation where we slide between pages
so the login page will slide out and the
register page will slide in for example
whereas right now we just have the
secondary page sliding in and the first
page just disappearing so what we're
going to do in this video I keep seeing
this pop up every now and then basically
zamel doesn't really like Generic see if
the work hard at getting it to accept
them and I keep seeing this hovering off
whenever we're using anything that
involves our attached properties because
they are generic attached properties
that we made so let's just fix this
first you can see the issue here says it
violates the constraints of parent so we
just go to and practically use the
shortcut ctrl T which is easier that
beta touch property and there it is it's
complaining about this because we are
constraining it to a generic type and
that's perfectly valid but the problem
is sam'l is no good at handling generic
so it just doesn't like this part here
so let's just delete that part and
you'll see the issue we then get which
is only really a small one which is that
this instance now doesn't have that on
value change because it's just an
instance of whatever the parent passes
in which will always be a base of such
property because it passes itself in so
we know it's going to be this because
we're going to abide by that rule anyway
so let's just copy that delete it from
there and then we'll just fix those
small issues by simply ctrl click on the
instance and paste the type entity back
now for study that let's just do
instance as that
I will not in instant our love and the
same here
object locators definitely working now
because it's changed to object
references not certain instance an
object mm-hmm
well the only way that could happen is
if this instance is not which I'm
guessing somewhere behind scenes that
WPF is making this content not be a
current page so maybe it's not which I
think it will be by default so at some
point this is going to be not so it's
just had a question mark here and then
that should fix the build a shoe with
such properties
nobody let's cover to that build issue
we have another one here cannot read
page properties because it's not in the
tree with window is root which it is so
again I think this is just an issue with
it dynamically doing a value converter
to a page into a frame again I think WPF
is are struggling so we can tweak this
the way we do this contents looking over
Rd fit design time so at least we get
rid of that error so we'll do it you
need to chain you to a date context so
that we could do it design time data
context of nothing to fix the error
which that should actually fix the error
oh it will when we finish this so let's
move all this into a data context and
then simply bind this to the binding and
so what we've done now is shifted the
data context of the frame to be the page
and we've simply bound to that so we
could move the converter out into here
but to be honest there's no real need of
this work so let's just run the
application now and see if that still
works yeah so that sort of fixed the few
design time visibles real seen and the
only downside there's you don't see a
page in the main window frame by that's
fine we can see the page if we actually
open up the page so just go to you know
login page or enter the actual login
page you know you can see it there so I
think it's just that wdf isn't quite as
as capable of handling you know the
complicated situations with very Natick
to see door but design time so that
fixes the design time issues we were
having
the one thing we've also got to do of
just thought let me just check what we
did with base a touch property them
were we calling no I think that's okay
yes it should be good there so now let's
just fix the login view model change you
back to quickly navigate into the
register page and let's see of this so
this still works so the next issue we've
mentioned is this navigation page up
here the navigation frame or navigation
bar whatever you want to call it and we
don't want that worry and a handle our
navigation in the view models so we need
to get rid of this this bar at the top
that will be done in the frame where we
are here I need a name there I think
it's called navigation UI something
navigation UI visibility hidden and that
will well should get rid of the bar
which it does but you'll also see we've
if you press alt on the keyboard and
press left you'll see we navigate him
back so you can navigate the navigation
still there so it's not required to
complete fix so we need to clear the
navigation history every time we
navigate to keep it as a in a non
navigation so because I'm valves code
behind to clear the frames navigation
service every time things change we'll
just use an attached property so in the
attached properties let's just copy say
bottom attached properties copy and
paste we'll call this one no frame
history I want to get rid of the frame
history the no frame has to be a touch
property for
creating the frame but never shows
navigation and keeps the navigation has
very empty
remember to pass in the plus itself and
it's going to be a thrill which is fine
all override the Han value changed and
we first need to get the frame that we
attach to so that would be our frame
equals sender house frame we might as
well do this so we don't have to attach
that as well so change the navigation UI
navigation UI visibility equals hidden
hide navigation bar now we also need to
clear history whenever we navigate so
safely a history on navigate that will
just do hook into the event handler for
when it navigates here's navigated so
when it's finished I'll just add an
event handler right here it's gonna be
nice and short
so we then want to do sender here will
be same as this cool you've got to
sender an event so the sender is going
to be a frame again so Khafre sender to
a frame and then we'll say navigation
service dot remove back entry which
removes the last navigated history so
basically whenever you navigate you
clear that one that you navigated to
from the history so this just simply
constantly keeps the navigation history
empty and that's it that's our attach
property so we should be able to now
attach that to here
like laughs I think yep and now if we
run and we navigate and we press Alton
back Alton left rather you can see
there's no history we could also
temporarily just comment out this line
so that we can see the bar to see that
there's no history say see we've
navigated but there's no no history
there so that's 50 frame so now we want
to in order to navigate and animate two
things at once we're going to have to
have two frames because we need to
animate this out while the next one's
animating in we don't want to wait for
it to animate out and then change to the
next one so we need two frames to do
that also the other issue is we can't
bind the content directly to the frame
because that's a current page and the
binding and more importantly the value
converter is synchronous so you can't
you can't sort of a wait for the
previous frame to finish and move to the
next frame or set the other frame but
actually we're not going to wait for the
next free we're going to set you know
set another frame and then move on but
either way I think because we want to
keep it clean we want to just be able to
bind a control to the current page and
have it simply you know navigate to that
page and animate the previous one out I
think we'll turn this into a user
control so let's go and go into controls
are the new user control and let's call
it another page host or something
let's change the name space here
remove the controls word press f7 remove
the controls from the name space clear
all the unused stuff coming up this
there's also a new way of phones to wrap
things in a region so instead of typing
median constructor and then going down
here in Henry Jian what you can now do
is simply select the line below all the
things you want and the line above press
ctrl K and then with control still
pressed you press s and that's for
command surround it shows this pop-up
them tap down twice and press ENTER for
region and now type the name of the
region constructor I've only just
learned that I can't thing whereas party
Debra spotted it being done I think it
was when I was looking for a short
cooked for wrapping something and I read
that you can press ctrl s and it wasn't
actually for wrapping regions it was for
something else like one of these and as
a spotted region in the name so of all
the years I've been doing it this is the
first time I realized you can do a lot
of shortcut to wrap regions so you can
remember it it's ctrl K and then S which
is command surround by because it's
around some code so that's the
constructor then in this control we want
to just have a grid spine so you want to
overlay each other just want to have two
frames one with an image the old page
and another one with the name wellness
also add the local node frame history
dot value was true copy and paste swap
one called new frame a new page so we
just have two frames and then whenever
the current page changes we will update
the new page and just before that we'll
check of the
new pages already got a value from
before you navigate away set it to the
old one and animate the page out so if
we now try to use the page host so we
change this to well called page host on
that grid you no longer need that will
keep the data context the same and
content is now not what we want
certainly the background transparency
ideas so the issue up now is we're not a
frame so the content won't work well I
think it would work we just simply
replace the content you know wouldn't do
so you know can't create instance so we
want to have like a property like this
called current page and to do that this
is a dependency property so we go back
to the page there's another shortcut
again dependency properties are almost
identical to attach properties it's just
a different way to register them and
unfortunately they're also just as messy
so if we do again there's a short of
this type prop and you'll see these
little dots with a square around them
this is like a code snippet this is a
helper that inserts you know predefined
codes like prop 8 and tap twice it
inserts a dependency prop an attached
property the one we've done previously
and then you'll see from that prop DP
which stands for properties display
dependency property so type in prop DP
and then tap twice
that'll insert a value you can see it's
highlighted here in blue which means
it's ready to type and replace all the
instances so we can define the type well
the current page needs to be a base page
and see the issue we've got here is the
base page is currently generic so we
need to go and fix that so let's just
presume we'll fix that in a moment and
while we're still in this the gray means
there's something else to change as well
so while you're in the sort of dynamic
creation mode blue is where you
currently are which we've now changed
and you can see it's changed base page
well it will change this into you in
this image here when
tab and now it's also moved over to the
next thing which is the proxy name to
change and it's going to change here
where the red dots are and here and here
and you can see this is actually a name
that includes property at the end but
it's smart enough to you know change the
name only at this point in creation so
we create the name now call it forum
page and press Enter many kids these
change this to current page property
that's the current page this control dot
it doesn't know where that is
dependency property type of base page
we've got to fix and then here's the
other thing you need to fix the type of
owner's loss it's saying a dependency
property has to be attached to you know
a dependency object which in this case
is our page itself we want this property
to be on this page this page host so in
the type of owner class paste page host
this will change this is the default
value right now which is an integer self
and it doesn't really fix that so we'll
change that to a UI property metadata
and in that I think we can pass in an
event I will call back for some when the
property changes because we want to know
when the current page changes then we'll
update the frames manually so this can
be current page drastically changed
control dots and then editor to generate
the method for us let's just move this
out and tidy this up a little bit so
region property changed events
called when the see quorum page file has
changed and then we'll implement that in
a moment comment less and you can see my
again this editor compact I talked about
previously as complaining because this
can be instead of doing the curly
brackets you can do a shorthand version
like that
and then remove the keyword return and
then the same here and also a quicker
way of doing that as select anywhere
where it's read control dot and enter
and you will get these warning jets I'm
going to commit this on the next video
this helper editor config file or maybe
do a short video on it so you can tweak
it as you like and it sort of forces
these these hints to make the code
shorter every well all places you can do
things easier it sort of shows an editor
to force you into doing it as a standard
it's just something I made up and
applied so that we always keep our code
as clean as possible so a dependency
property consists of this register call
which is very similar we take a look at
the data platform proxy that we made
dependency property don't register
attached there's a name a type an owner
and a UI property and here it's exactly
the same so we have a name a type an
owner and a property the only difference
is that you call register not register
attached and then the back in thing here
there was a value which we did get value
set value with the keywords getting set
before we simply get replaced by doing a
public property which causes it to have
functions called get current page and
set current page anyway so this is very
very similar to an attached property but
this is the way you do a dependency
property and again I don't like this
because now you've got to define two
things I also don't like this it's
hard and I don't get why the code
snippet isn't smart enough to do this
but instead of having a string that says
current page then we go and change this
to current page - this is now never
going to work it's not updated so change
this also delete the string and type
name of current page and that'll simply
convert this to a string but now I've
really named this it's going to rename
there as well so it's never going to
break so that's all the dependency
property is again I'll probably go over
this more in another video maybe on just
dependency properties but really a
dependency property is just about
getting a public property to be settable
inside of a saml so we can now do say in
in this window this will now start
working when we compile we can you know
we can actually set it as if it's a
value a property on a control inside of
sam'l so this is just a property as
simple as that we tell it to fire this
current page property change when this
gets get they're set to a different
value so we can even do that in code
like in here we could just say current
page equals menu login page and by
you're setting this here we'll get this
fired here so it's like you know like
podium value inside the setter but you
can't put a value inside the setter
directly here because of how dependency
properties work it wouldn't work that
way so you have to use this sort of
syntax to turn this into a property that
can be accessed in sam'l and in code
behind so we've got the property there
let's change this from a normal comment
again I don't get why the code behind
doesn't do a proper comment registers
current age as a dependency property so
there's our dependency property let's
the space bear let's wrap this control
KS region and we'll call it dependency
it would spell along the pen and see
properties have to really think that
word out so we've got the dependency
graph to the current page and it's going
to be a base page which we've got to fix
at the moment and then when it changes
we'll come back to that in a minute so
let's go and just fix this base page
because this could be of any page it'll
be a login page it could be any kind of
page so let's just go to the base page
first and take a look at the issue so
we're passing in a view model prior F
primarily so we can have this view model
here so that any page can do just you
know this dot view model and get access
to its view model which is handy and
also when we set it to set the data
context so that's the reason we pass in
the view model here but everything else
about the page and what we care about is
the animation in this case has nothing
to do with generics so it doesn't need
to be generic so what we'll do is strip
out the generic part and create a
separate base class so that we can at
least access the animation of the base
page so let's create one above just call
it base page there's going to be a
regular page
a based page for all pages to gain based
on canal aqui so same comment a base
page with added few models support this
one is going to become this is now going
and have it from the standard base page
the non-generic and then we can just
move so that's a go to steaks at the VM
public properties we can move everything
except the view model so let's select
all those cut everything in the public
proxies except the view model and let's
paste it in there select around KS
region of those properties so all's
we're doing is moving off you know what
was in this class down into the base
class which we're overriding anyway so
we're not losing any functionality we're
simply moving everything we can into
this non-genetic class so that we can
use this as a standard variable without
knowing anything about a view model such
as a public property done constructor
sets up these two things which are in
generic so let's just copy that
constructor delete that out of this one
make sure we call the base which I think
it does by default anyway but I like to
explicitly call the base constructor so
it's obvious that we're also going to
call this constructor paste the entire
constructor again and this time delete
the opposite side deliver view model
path and now we want to move the
function so let's just carry on and
that'll fix itself it's now the
animation that's nothing to do with view
models so that can all come with us so
let's just cut that entire region and
paste it here
and that's all fine
and now I think that's it so we've now
got a base page that we can access the
animations with and we've got a base
page that can pass in a view model that
then simply adds the ability to have the
view model set and that's all that
addition does so now this shows here
which is what we want we've got a
current page and then we've got this
that will implement so we put a
breakpoint here and let's compile and I
think they should just compile fine now
yes that's compiled successfully so we
press f5 to run it all runs fine we've
now got to I think I lost my breakpoint
but we put a breakpoint here let's rerun
that we should hit this breakpoint
there we go so we're getting fired with
this dependency property which is now
telling us to go into the login page so
at this stage now all that's left to do
is to first we want to get hold of the
old a new page that's in Lezama here so
that's all the new page so we want to do
var new page equals we know the sender
is ourselves so page host in fact
there's kind of no point in sender
because it gives ourself simply going to
be old a new page so it's not all that
bit once you get the old page content in
terms of before we change the new page
what we're now going to class as the old
pages content it's going to be the new
page oh we do actually need to do let's
go back we do need to this because we're
in a static method so we do need to use
the sender to get hold of ourselves so
send that as page host dot new page
let's get the new page first and the old
page so these are the frames I in fact
we should probably call it that
new page frame on page frame sender is
not called Samuel is called D in this
case and say get the frames now we've
got the frames you want to get the old
content which will be the current pages
content so store the current page
content as the old age so our old page
content equals new page frame content
that then we now want to first clear the
contents of this page because we've
stored it here we now on to empty out
this new page to move it into the old
page so remove comment page from new
page frame I will simply do that by
setting the content to no then we'll now
move the previous page into the old page
frame so we've got the old page frame
dot contents now equals the old page
content which was originally the new
thing so all's we've learnt a stage as
we've shot the contents of whatever zone
a new page frame and move that into the
old page frame which is simply stacked
on top of each other
so visibly we shouldn't notice anything
it's just that whatever is currently set
to this pages content will now be in
this pages content and that's what this
is doing so now we've moved say in this
case if we're on the login page and we
go to the register page this will be the
login page becomes the old content the
new frame becomes nothing the old frame
is now the login page and then we want
to animate that page out so we need to
say animate out previous page so we have
old page content isn't people to know
or if all page content is base page
first because we know it is but we have
to cast it and call that old page if it
is that and the old page doesn't it well
we don't need to do the null check value
then simply do oh yeah we do actually
because are going to do a task so if it
is a base page and every thousand people
to know which nope we won't need that
when you think about the logic because
if it's null then it won't be a base
page doesn't know what it has to this to
fail so all you need to do is check of
the base the old content is a base page
effectively that will mean that it
doesn't know otherwise it wouldn't be a
base page so we know we've got a base
page now as we know we had a previous
page in that case we can then animate
this out so old page contents on the old
page now as it says the old page content
does a base page so that we can access
the animate function to animate out and
that will animate out the old page
notice we're getting a warning here this
is chalmers recall in an asynchronous
method those ends where they think so we
know that but we're not awaiting it
which we don't want to anyway because we
don't want to wait for that to animate
out before we start animating in the
next page so to get rid of that warning
we simply tell it to your a task control
dot define the name space fast run you
get rid of the brackets and pass it the
actual task to run and because that now
is designed to not error out when your
talent and Rong's it's explicitly saying
run the task it's obvious we're not
awaiting it gets rid of that warning for
us so even though they both return in a
way to both task
Visual Studio won't complain if you tell
it to run the task because it's a you
know an explicit declaration that we
know we're running a task and we're not
awaiting it so that will then just
animate out the old page and instantly
carry on to here
and then all we need to do is now set
the new page content so now we just do
new page frame contents equals whatever
the new value is passed into this
property changed and that should be it
so we press f5 we should see the login
page appear which we do so let's just
first step through and you can see
what's happening so on first load the
current property has changed via which
you can't see in the call stack was
obviously changed by the we go through
it step by step you have this page host
we bound the current page to binding and
the data context of that is this so
we've bound to the view model locator
which finds the application view model
and the current page which if we go to
application view model you can see here
so it's getting this current page as a
login that gets passed into current page
then the current page of here is a
dependency property because we made you
know we created it here and every time
that gets changed which it just did it
calls into this current page property
changed which is where we are so that's
how we got to here first the value is a
new value in concedes login page
so we first got the new page and the old
page frames from this page so we've now
got hold of these two frames the old
content right now I'm guessing should be
null which it is because there is no
page at the when you first created this
this hasn't been set to anything so it's
not so there's no content we clear the
previous content which is not any way
but doesn't matter then we move the
previous page content into the ology
still no but that's not issue so both
pages are still null VAR now with an
animate out the previous page if he
doesn't know and if it's a base page
which in this case it's and also this
won't ever run
and then finally we set the current page
the new page to the login page that's
the first run we click again and let's
just disable this you can see the
animation of it works first so we click
this and what should happen is this
should slide out because this line of
code here will run and the next page
should slide straight in which it didn't
do so let's see why
restart well then need to restart that
book oh yeah directly so there's the
first run so we click this so we know
that all works get the old page which is
the login page we expect set the new
page to know which is just not updating
I think in the intellisense here but it
will go to know the old page is no get
set to the new one so again these
contents because they're on the UI
thread they need at least one cycle to
update so the intellisense are saying
that these are still the old values but
we know they're not because we've seen
the other page on a may 10 get the old
page and we do tell it to animate out so
let's go to the animate out and hit here
so we are hitting the animate out
and we are telling it to try to make out
I've just seen it interesting thing to
see down here we have got both pages
there's the text underneath for the
other page so if we've got that other
page let's take a loop art our base page
constructor make sure it's not creating
another page just shouldn't do so base
page we're creating a login page it's
fine
we run that so when we hit this we
should only create a register page the
login page should never get recreated
let's create a register page you can see
down here that's fine and then we hit
that so we haven't recreated the login
page yet a login page is there and I
suspect it's animating in again so hmm
why do we go I worry so in the base page
I wonder it's getting reloaded because
we're changing the content one of its
firing nestled low with the I bet it
does actually put a breakpoint here I've
got a suspicion that by moving the page
the login page to the content of another
frame it's going to reinitialize because
it's been set as a content it's got to
now reinitialize that page to its new
host so I think by doing this line here
we are filing after we've come out of
this call
we're going to fire this a loaded event
again and then it's animating in which
it makes sense so we create the login
page and then we add it and it's been
loaded which is what we expect the first
time around but let's click it again so
create the register page we've set
things up so we've now loaded one page
not sure which one that says register
page yep and I bet that's yep so the
login page is getting the loaded called
a second time so what we're going to
have to do is we're gonna have to
animate out in this loaded call because
it's been loaded but we've already told
it to animate out and we know we hit
that because we've got here and so we
still need this function because that
should be called in other instances when
you can animate out but in this instance
where we are moving content the no point
in doing this we need a different way of
handling that situation so let's create
a new public boolean short animated out
just like to indicate if this page
should animate out on a load and useful
for when we are moving the page to
another frame so should our mate out all
we need to do is set that to true and
then move change this logic so all page
should animate out it was true and will
comment let's animate out previous page
when the loaded event fires right so
let's call dual moving frames
so we set this flag to say okay animate
out and now in this loaded event we now
don't need that break point and this
loaded event we can say if should
animate out oh eight animate out out
animate in so here we are set up to
animate out some load and make out
otherwise I'll make on the page so now
the logic changes slightly we tell it
that that's true and then as soon as we
actually this function it fires the
loaded event and then the loaded event
will now know that we expect to load out
and it should animate out so there's a
nice little example of some debugging
for you there and how we figured out the
you know what was going on and they just
really investigating suspicions and
putting breakpoints and places and you
know tracking things through
so as you animate in so let's click and
hopefully this should now slide out in
the next page slide in alright as nice
that worked either it was subtle because
that's a sign off to the other ones that
sign in that's all it does right now
Miles's run that again and that looks
really nice things a little bit slow
maybe let's just speed up the base page
default animation speed to say half that
so it's twice as fast
and that's nice so that's a nice speed
we can then also add miles or link
that's button in on the register page
but I don't think we've got a register
view model so let's just make that now
view model your models open core I'll
give you model copy and paste Oh Anna
we didn't rename this class here just go
ahead and rename that to the same name
and then up to login view model change
this to register so this is the copy
class remember not their original the
view model for a register page college
to screen base view model email login as
running turns up to register is running
well obviously are more in your
potential analysis we can't really
finish these view models until we've
done the website so we know exactly what
we need to actually do log in command
register command struck to register view
model
now register will be the one that takes
in these need to swap around register
command logging for months simply going
to navigate to the other page so it'll
be a login and this will be and as you
step the login async will now become the
register attempts to register a new user
register is running away to blah blah
blah so you can simply do that for now
and this will be a little login take
these for the login page current page is
login and that should do that's just a
basic copy and paste of the login view
model just renamed and swapped around so
they are functions do the opposite way
around
you name the class file to the same name
as the class then I think the register
page needs binding to it as well
yeah so I need to buy next to the
register view model now we have one go
to the code-behind
we will get rid of all these unused ones
and change this to the register
and what you're complaining about
we don't have different base classes
base page register view model register
page yeah I think this just needs
building yep so that's now built it's
now got a register view model this is
linked to when you click this button it
should be the little login so we need to
link this button to the login commands
to go to the login page so command
binding login command register needs to
change the register command and it's
busy except to the register is running
and the element is the page yep so
that's all I think going to work
there's a sign-in page swipes over to
the register page register should spin
for five seconds and then just go away
with you that register is running
command and then this should take us
back to the sign-in page which it does
so there we go another never-ending
cycle between the two pages all right
let's now take it one step further so
this is this is effectively now complete
and we should be able to resize this to
maximum and it animates all the way out
which it does and yes so now we want to
we're trying to get this application as
complete as possible
so that by the time we come to the web
server when we have to stop this and
move to the web server and then we come
back to this this is really as complete
as can be that we just have to link it
in with the server so now this is a
full-blown login page we haven't done a
logic to actually login because we need
the web server but now the animation and
the page swaps complete and going back
and forth between those pages is
complete and this is ready to accept the
function and the same as this is ready
to accept the functions so this is all
fully complete we should now start up
the application and sign-in mode you can
swap between two we can log in once
we've already logged in we'll then store
information in a configuration file or
you know a secret location or somewhere
we'll store the details about the login
so that when you first open up instead
of going to this page you could check if
the users already signed in and
instantly take them to the you know the
application but we'll do that in another
video so this is now complete on these
two pages so we shouldn't have to come
back to these two pages so now we're
going to add let's at least add a dummy
so when you click the login button
it waits for say one second and then
we'll go to the chat page which we
haven't really done anything with yet
but we'll also slide the menu in so
let's go to the close all these windows
know a lot loads open
and the chat page of blanks let's just
add something to that so just add a
textblock
text Harlow Fassett oh I can't see
anything it's up there in black so let's
make these again this is purely
temporary so let's just make anything
for now horizontal and simplistic
alignments and font size font large just
literally put a bit text in there so we
can see something that'll do for the
chat page so we have the login view
model when we log in currently we'd be
late five seconds
let's leave this in as a hint for later
on of how we get the password and email
change the stood delay for one second
and now go to chat page so we'll
probably add I think we'll add later not
right now slowly in the next video
instead of doing IOC dot what we'll do
is I'll get for getting the application
view model but instead of doing current
page and setting that we probably want
to go to page function in here so that
when you change pages in fact imagine I
think now if I go to page application
page chart because one thing we don't
want to do explicitly everywhere we'll
go into pages like we go to the chat
page now we want to show the side menu
but then if you go to the chat page in
the register page you don't also want
them to current pages chat page and then
side menu visible is true we don't want
to do that twice so that's how a
function called go to page let's change
this to a private sector so you can't
just manually tell it to go to a page
you have to use this function make us
hopefully
and navigate to the specified page page
page to go to and then in here we just
set the current page equals page and now
go side menu or not if page equals
equals and pan out Shack of the only one
or in this case show that we call it
side menu visible equals true only of
the page is chat that's like a little
helper and I think we do that somewhere
else this is probably going to complain
that we're trying to set a private value
yet so now in the log in async instead
of doing current pages log in change
that to go to page login and there's one
other place here go to page register
snowgirl that will help the function go
to page and then when we tell it to now
go to the chat page the side menu should
be visible so we should be able to click
login
let's check this we didn't break any
conversed yeah so now we click login
after one second this should slide out
in the side menu should slide in and the
chat page should slide in this way I
think oh that's nice so that looks
really cool now in fact I just like the
plain text there coming out the finished
application right there
so we'll get in far now that's all done
I'll probably style the side menu in a
short little video just on you know
scroll bar styling or something make a
nice scroll bar in a video shortly so
that's got us now the login and register
page fully done and a little nice way to
you see the application actually working
now you can imagine you've logged in
your click and everything start floating
in and we got all this animation
happening
is really adding to the you know the
professionalism and keeping the app
really modern so I think next will style
the scroll bar we will probably move
this up to here so that the setting
figure then we can collapse us out the
way maybe make a collapsible menu that
these icons go down there and shorten
out and then we'll make finally make
this main chat screen here which is
going to be a huge amount of work but
that will be coming up very shortly now
so again hopefully this video was useful
any comments anything you're not sure of
anything didn't understand do just post
a comment and I always get back to
everybody and I can even do video
follow-ups to explain things in more
detail again hopefully this was useful
