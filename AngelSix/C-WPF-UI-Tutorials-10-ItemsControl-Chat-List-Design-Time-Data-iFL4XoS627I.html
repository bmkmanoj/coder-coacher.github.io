bar the buttons to go between I chat
users picture settings
I made that here so we just press that
five to run you'll see we made this nice
little bar so in this video we're going
to make this chat listed beside so it's
going to be a way of making another
custom control in fact I'm not sure
whether we've made a custom control yet
yeah we made a side menu control so
we've made a custom control in the last
video we're going to make another one
for a chat list item here and then
another one for the list that holds all
of those as well so again it's nice and
simple
we'll just right click on the controls
folder make a new one inside called shut
and then we'll just make a new user
control and we'll call this shot list
item control and based on some feedback
from you guys have turned on to dark
mode so it's not all bright white I've
also made this font larger still so
might be still want even bigger font so
let me know what you think about the
size hopefully this is a got the right
size now we're just going to change the
name space that visual studio does by
default which is to include all the
folder names which we don't want so we
just remove those get rid of all the
unused stuff and there's a chat list
item control so this is going to be for
an individual item like this one so
first you want the eye let's set their
size up to something realistic so the
height will be about I don't know 66
that's about right zoom in a little bit
so the background have the grit we'll
start with the foreground white color if
you'd like and then we want as always we
want to figure out whether we want stack
panels or grids so in this case we've
got a little red line which will
indicate a new message
then we've got the profile picture and
we got some text so initially the
overall container we're going to do a
grid with this being whatever size it
needs to be this being whatever size it
needs to be and then this to fill the
rest so that we go this way across so
it's a single column so a single row or
three columns so we want to do grid
column definitions column definition
first one is auto next one's Auto and
third one is fill the remainder also
commonly so this is new message
indicator bar something like that
this one is profile picture and this one
is main content
I know the first thing nice and easy
let's do the message new message
indicator bar so background for now
we'll just do red whip we'll do five
it's already in column zero and there
you go there's the the red indicator bar
comment that again and we'll do the
profile picture next so profile picture
is going to be a boarder with a corner
radius and then a border around the
outside of that to give me the padding
so on the outer border first it's going
to be in column one which is the second
column and we're on the padding which
will do say eight and then inside that
will sort of mean the thing that's going
to be the background color so we'll have
the background will be for now we'll
just use the blue color will change this
as we go the corner radius wants to be
basically you need to be fifty percent
of the width or the height so in fact my
personal deal will make the width equal
to the height again so that will be the
binding actual high relative sources
relative source self and that'll force
it to be a permanent square and then can
see we know what a square that's colored
and all we need to do with that is
corner radius you could do we know this
is going to be sixty could reset it
there so basically you need a corner
radius of 30 and it will go all the way
around
doesn't hurt to go bigger like sixty so
all's we'll do to make it always round
is find this again basically bind it to
the actual height again so that you're
going to get a corner radius that's
twice as large as it needs to be or WPF
by default
the officer doesn't go any further so it
stays perfectly round and in fact inside
that border then we now need the text
block with some text let's say L M as
the are lamp it will make it vertically
Center horizontally Center will make the
foreground the white color and the front
sighs wants to be I think large is going
to be too big yet so we need a new font
size
let's press that twelve on font size
large to jump to the fonts zamel we've
got small large regular so them in order
of size I think well I've run in between
small and regular call it average
resting on the best of names but it'll
do change that to original see that
looks about right
LS that's a nice size I think what fun
wants to be a bit secular try and
regular there we go sup sir it's pretty
similar so profile picture padding
background unless is initials and then
will override Destry once we get the
actual data from the web server on we've
got profile pictures which is a long way
away
we'll then come back to this and make
this like lazy load the picture and
overlay this so by default until the
picture loads you'll see this but for
now that's all we'll see anyway and
that's the circle thing you done profile
picture and now we want to do the main
content so this is now this text so what
we want to do is I guess we'll of a
stack panel for the two texts and we'll
just float that vertically Center so
that whatever size we make it I'll just
stay central so I think we want to start
with a stack panel vertical align Center
get some text in there make sure it's in
the right column yep that's the back on
so this font family needs to be thicker
I think we both want to be that
this is the name this as message this
new track app is all awesome so I can
see I'll finish this one first
possibly the first Asato opposite oh
yeah set the blue no word blue whatever
we called it would blue
oh yeah and this wants to be slightly
lighter we need to come up with a better
name for these colors as well because
they're not really very descriptive at
the moment so that's okay just a faded
gray now you see the issue here when it
gets to the end it's not finishing it
just like the woods going away and cut
enough to do that nicer you can add text
wrapping it exfolia text wrapping no not
text wrapping text rude rule what we
call it creamy so on character ellipsis
and you'll see that it finishes with the
dot dot we'll put that on both I really
also want a better parting at the edge
here we've got the padding from the
board the thing they're already of eight
so we'll put eight this side as well so
let's just add adding a mate there Gil
wrap this a stop panel and a border to
get the padding
move the column to the right place
we don't want padding all around we just
want it on the right so left top right
bottom oh yeah that looks not far often
to be honest that was easy
so there's our chat list item control
will tweak things and finish this off in
a minute but now we want to make a list
control that can see that or we want to
just quickly take a look at that let's
go to the main window in the side menu
control let's just build the project
first make sure it's all okay that we
haven't screwed anything up yeah that's
fine so in here the locals shut left
item control is just going to grow
inside the mouse just force that the
height of 60 for the moment Oh
so something like that plus f5 let's see
what it looks like and now that looks
really nice compare that to what we had
so this is larger but
that's pretty close in fact it's almost
pixel perfect
so summarize that now we need to put
this in our list and we also will do the
hover effect and that afterwards so we
get rid of the chat list item control
now what we're going to do is make
another control as is taken nowhere near
as long as ability or I thought it was
going to be a really long video cut less
control now for lists generally of any
kind you've got a lot of options well
young got a lot of options you've got a
items control which is your lowest level
virtualizing collection so basically
anything way but you know a list of
things your lowest levels your items
control which doesn't add scrolling
technically both teachers wrap it in a
scroll viewer and you've got scrolling
you go one up from that and you've got
something called a list box and our list
boxes inherited from an items control
and as the ability to I believe select
items and then up from that's a list
view which has a few more things so
we're going to stick at the lowest level
because we're going to add all our own
selection mechanisms and styling and
everything else so we just want to pure
fundamental basic collection to host
these chat items so just clean up the
name space again as usual
that's that and we will have in here
start the on the background there's big
white background really zoomed in as
well and then in here as we mentioned
we'll need it to be inside a scrollview
er otherwise it won't scroll with it
being a basic items control
well the scroll bars to only appear when
we need them and then there we want an
items control and the items are screen
full item template so the things that
are going to be inside of it which is a
data template is going to be the chat
list item controls so it's basically a
just an items control that has a load of
chat list items now in order to see that
here visually we're going to use data
binding when you use view models so we
need to actually start making some view
models for this so the new folder called
shaft then let's add a new class we'll
call this chat we'll start with a chat
list item view model so the model for
each of these and again you can change
this as you go so you don't need to
overthink it just add what we need right
now so we've got a view model for each
chat list item in the over view chat
list it's going to be a base view model
and it's public
and we're going to have a we need a name
for this we need the initials for here
we need the message here start with that
and message initialize initials we'll
need we'll need this color as well
because we're going to make this color
up we're going to make it random so the
other thing to bear in mind is while I
mentioned before these view models are
going to be moved out to the WPF project
as it grows so these are going to be
like a universal class so even though
these are going to be bound to views you
can't put anything in here that's
relevant to WPF so like this is going to
turn into a brush for call this
background but we can go ahead and put a
solid brush I think this solid follow
brush or something so you don't want to
do this you don't want to start
including WPF namespaces or objects like
this because this is not going to just
work for WPF this can be moved on to
Android and iOS and all your other
platforms so in order to get a color
we're going to keep it as a basic color
so profile picture red green blue and
just a string and then what we're going
to do in WPF is convert that with a
value converter to then the WPF brush so
never put anything in your view models
that relate to an actual UI like you
know WPF and I mentioned before as well
we actually did it here where we passed
in the window which is not usually what
you do is it but like we mentioned this
view model is actually specific for WPF
so that was the exception there but in
general you view models should have no
link to WPF and that's why when we move
into another project which I think we'll
probably do in the next video into a
core project it doesn't even know about
WPF then you won't be able to make that
mistake anyway and so profile picture
this is the RGB values in hex for the
background color on the profile picture
example FF OFS for red and blue mixed
and I'll do for now again don't
overthink these just you know make them
and go from there then we'll jump back
one we'll go back to this so you can see
here I've just typed this obviously this
is no good because we need to data bind
so each of these items is going to be
data bound to a chat list item view
model so we need to then say change this
content now so this a line would have to
be fine in two initials which is the
name we've just given the this view
model so it's this and then you can see
here now it's disappeared so it's okay
doing it visually and then binding but
then you've lost your value and then as
a little trick you could do here do
fallback value and you can put a line
back in so you could then visually see
what the issue with fallback value as
it's there in case this fails or there's
no value I think is if this fails and
then there's a no target no value as
well when there is no value or the issue
I don't want with fallback value is that
if whatever reason this did fail the
users going to end up seeing what you
write here in the live application so
you
want to do that so the way we get around
this is we're going to get this bound so
there the list is going to bind these
controls so these are going to get the
data they need but in the design and now
what we'll get out here we can
explicitly we could actually set a data
context here and we want to make what
we'll call a design model which is
basically just the this view model just
pre-populated with this you know design
time data summit for us to look at when
we're designing they'll call us design
models
I'll just call it design for now and
then we'll go check list item view model
so we'll add another class cut list
items design models clear up the
namespaces how much visual studio
wouldn't do that this is a public class
the design time data for a list item
view model and this is actually going to
inherit from a chat list item new model
and all we're going to do is create a
constructor so ctor double tab so press
the tab key twice lota matically create
this wrap this in a region comment so
then when we create a new version of
this we want to fill in the initials
equals LM and name equals loop message
equals let's just is awesome
profile as it called profile picture RGB
equals and then we want the this college
is basically for Seto blue so we'll
we'll use that as an example for now
which is in in Styles colors and while
we're here actually we've got the blue
brush we want a in fact if we've got a
light blue brush as well which was for
this but then this is even lighter so
we've got a very light blue and the very
light blue I've written down from
Photoshop somewhere is DC f6f B that's a
very light blue so we're going to knit
this blue color for our RGB value here
and that's it so now we want to be able
to make use of this design model at
design time so in here visually to get
you know this information back so the
same as the text here is going to be
binding to name and the text here is
going to bind to a message so you can
see this all disappeared we will data
bind but we need to date the bind to an
instance so if we just do
on that this is a basic singleton so
what a singleton is is when you get a
single instance of an object so
literally means a single you know a
single version and this is a kind of a
singleton so it will just be a public
static because we want a single absolute
statics a single instance in itself a
single instance of this called instance
and for that we'll just return and I'll
go back and show you that this is a
property so just a getter that we've I
think we've covered properties amount to
a video specifically on properties
actually and but we've used properties
we obviously use them in there hopefully
all the view models it's just a getter
to get the property counts at it and
it's going to return a new chat list
item design model so basically it's only
ever going to return or complain about
our oh yeah this is my up I've added a
new things as well but complains at me
if I don't use the style that I expect
to use so this is virtual error this is
my I've got an additive config file that
again I'll probably explain that gives
me warnings like this because I don't
want to do this style of properties
anymore so we'll cover that anyway now
so this is a perfectly valid now this
basically gets you know a new chat list
item which is actually wrong in this way
because it's not singleton but it does
the job basically going to get a new
design model it's good enough what we
want but instead of doing a getter like
this things exactly the same thing but
there's a new way of doing it in c-sharp
seven I think it is now and basically
you replace the outer brackets and the
would get every to get only you just get
rid of all that and you do equals
greater than same as we do for most and
I would get rid of those of the back as
well and get rid the return statement
and then this now is the exact same
thing just a shortened version of a
property so if you hover over you can
see you've got a getter you've got to
get a property
so if you wanted to do a getter this is
like it you know quick way of doing it
as to just do greater than equals and
then what you want it to be you don't
have to write the angle brackets and get
so I a single instance of the design
model and like I say I'm I'm not really
thinking it through too much I think
every time you call this you might get a
new instance bought for this is only
used for design time so if you wanted a
true singleton then you would make well
I'm not going to bother going and I'll
do Singleton's in a separate video
but basically just think of this as you
can see what it's doing you gain a new a
new design model it might not be
guineans you know a single instance but
good enough what we want so if we bind
to this instance now we'll basically
just get a new a new copy of this class
which is what we want that's the point
of what we want at the moment so chat
list item design model instance is what
we want to bind to so I think you do X
traffic chat list item design model dot
instance maybe not child maybe just each
building
yeah just nearly building so you can see
we've got all the properties back but
the issue here is we've bound the data
context like cards this is actually
bound in runtime as well so we ran this
application with this containing the
item it's still there this is actual
data in the application then if we run
the application that data is there which
is not what we want this is purely for
us visually to design so this shouldn't
show here this is you know our design
time data so all you do for making it
into showing purely for us designing is
that's what this D is if you've ever
wondered what this deep namespace here
expression blend as a tool that
Microsoft made for designing zamel and
so the names basically naturally just
give the letter D and then they've got
some code in the background that
basically tells runtime to ignore
anything that starts with D so like this
design height even though we tell it to
be this size here as you saw when we
adding it to this list if we don't
explicitly tell it the height then it
just ignores as a design time so when
you use D colon as a prefix it's only
ever for this visual appearance here and
when you run the application it's no
longer there so the same for this data
context it's here right now for us
visually but we don't want it at runtime
so we just prefix it with the letter D :
and now it still shows here and it'll
still show here so we build just to get
rid of that but then the difference is
now well actually it doesn't show that
because this is more room timing so if
we run now you'll see that it's gone you
know it's not there which is what we
want so we can now visually design here
with some content that we add in a
design model which we can tell just
don't change to say a a nothing just
have to build to get that to updates
it's a code file and then you'll see it
updates here so we can now you know
style and mess with this UI without
worrying about the user seen you know
our dummy data if you will that we're
using just for visual design so we call
this design model we
kindly made an instance here I've called
it single things I'm used to doing that
I'll do a video on properties and
probably do Singleton's as well at the
same video but just think of this right
now as you just get a single and just a
copy of this class so it's got to be
static as well so that we can bind
directly to it here so that's all what's
doing we're allowing us to this is a
create and copy of itself but in the
static you know a single version of it
and then here's where we fill it with
the data we want and then we're going to
do the same thing now for so we're quite
happy with that for the moment back and
that can be done for now we'll move on
to this chat list which is now going to
host a list of those items so again we
want a view model for that so we'll just
copy and paste the chat list item view
model a new feature in c-sharp as well
I've copied the class you can see down
here it's got just a name as copy and up
here it's just a copy
a quick way now instead of renaming the
file then we name in the class we just
rename the class and then you see this
lightbulb here click there and you can
see now we've got the option to rename
file to the same name as the class so it
says copy right now there and it's the
wrong name chat list item new model we
click this and it goes ahead and renamed
it to chat let's view model for
ourselves like a nice feature you can
copy and paste a class rename the class
in code and having renamed the file for
you nice and easy so a few model for the
chat list the well the overview shot
list
and then this is just going to have one
thing right now which is just a list of
chat list items new models
I've got items and that's it then
this chat list again will be bound by
the parent whenever we come to do that
so it will be bound to this view model
but again we want to design here
visually and see this list so let's copy
and paste the design model of the
previous one do the same again rename
the class click the lightbulb rename the
file this is now a Chuck list view model
the design time data for a chart view
model single Turner's same class know
this class and then in the constructor
which is now called this and again i'm
not sure what i'm doing here i'm holding
ctrl and clicking and that pre-selects a
name ctrl C to copy
hold keep control pressed again click
somewhere else ctrl V to paste so it's
like a really quick way if you want to
copy and paste a class to somewhere hold
ctrl click class control C click say
here control V and I've still got
control pressed anyway I just leave your
finger on control press control B and
then click here control V here control V
so that's like a when you see me copying
and pasting things faster I'm doing it
so now in this design time data for the
chat list design model so on the items
to be a new
oh hell on two big names face a new list
and the list wants to contain a new chat
list item view model yep and then in
here we want to now set the name - Luke
initials - alum message to let Tyler
writing the same message just go to it
done I've done this it would have an
easier time I don't mind in fact put it
copy and pasted whole things and the
reason you see me using : @ commas here
instead of columns is because we created
a new class but then directly at the
same time as creating a new class we
open my curly brackets and this is like
a way of setting the properties on the
class in one big line so if we were to
do say create the new new + this way and
then you do a dot name equals some name
that'd be a semicolon but you can see
again the style I've made now this code
editors saying you can simplify it so
it's actually telling us we can change
the way this is instant ated to instead
of creating the class called a and then
doing a dot name as this a dot message
is this a dot profiles and repeating
yourself for this a dot you can just
basically get rid of the n3 open up
curly brackets move that inside and then
you have to change these two colum
comments and set of columns and you get
rid of the a dot and then you put your
Col on at the end there so again a
different syntax that you'll get used to
the more you see it but facilitation
wondered why I'm putting commas here not
colons it's because if you look closely
I'm creating a new
but then I'm actually opening it up like
a function without the parentheses so we
have a lot of parentheses you can have
them we don't need them and then instead
of basically creating a class like I'm
finishing I'm directly opening it up and
then creating stuff inside so this is
like it an in-line way of making the the
items so there's that's how I made them
if you struggling to understand what's
going on there it's exactly the same as
doing items equals a new list of items
items don't add new chat list item of
your model and then enough to break that
out as well so far item equals new chat
list item and then you have to do copy
and paste all this and then again I want
to put item in front of all these click
here hold the Alt key and drag down and
this is where you can select you know an
area so hold the alt there and drag down
and now you can paste into there and put
a duster than everything gets that text
so created a new item and then in the
items itself you ask the item so and
again ignore the studies as my editor
telling me I can do it better so this is
exactly the same as this but you can see
here we've had to create new items then
create a new item for each item one
about then we're going to set that item
off then we're going to add it where is
this way with the items is created here
just the same as it is here but then
we've wrapped this item inside and then
as well as that we've wrapped that in
the properties of the item inside itself
again so this creates a new list and
then the side that'll sdcard this item
and inside the item it sets up these
properties so it's like a cascading way
of doing exactly this so this is more
likely what you'll see on maybe books
and other videos and things it's kind of
again gained a bit old now so this is
how you used to do it and you can still
do it this way but it's kind of there's
no need this is like a cleaner way so
this item was called
I don't know some really long boring
name and then you're sat in this
property interview a second 50
properties you can see what's happening
you end up with this and then of your
setting which we will be we're going to
be doing one two three four five six
like seven of these times up by seven
you can see what you're going to start
getting yeah really horrible you know
repeating code so might not look much
doing it this way at the moment but
obviously the more you add like now
we've made one going to make two three
or do three four now we're already you
can see that stays nice and clean it's
really easy to see and you can just get
straight to your data
so hopefully that made sense kind of
went off on a tangent a bit there so
you're going to fill on a bit more of
this dummy day to this design time data
so a do is healing your outcomes and
then this is like a yellowy I don't know
well just come up with some random call
us for now no idea what call that's
going to be but doesn't matter for now
for now
and then you serve as well so I'm going
to have to do for now
again this color was just of a and of a
kind of green color say don't know oh
five better blue in it that will do for
the moment that's three design time data
so you've made an instance of it there
again so now in the chat less control we
can do the same design time only data
context that's going to be static and
it's going to be Cutlass design models
or instance and I think again if we
build that should be all we need and we
should see three items hopefully helps
if you buying the items control to the
items so I think is I can sauce roughly
got a bat with bound to the instance of
this chat list design model but that
instance obviously has its this Cutlass
V model we're going to bind to the items
of this so the items control is going to
have them we bind to items where there
we go how doesn't quietly right yeah
let's run it and see something's not
quite looking at but actually we're not
going to see that it's designed time
only
see if we change this to shut less
control run this I'm saying it doesn't
only what I think they is both we
haven't set the size and I'm thinking
we've set the color that all the text is
there we can see it but the hi it's
wrong so as we mentioned the catalyst
item control this is design time height
only so we want to actually set the
height so we want to define the control
as a set height of 60 in runtime and
that should we compile this you should
see there we go that's the height right
so that looks better now so there's that
so now we just want to change these
colors to match the color we've got so
to do that we need a new value converter
and we need to go to the control again
let's control zoom the same and rather
we put the color somewhere around here
where are there this background color
wants to now be bound let's to the
profile lower your profile picture
RGB but that's just a string so we need
to now convinced that shown any
converter and that's going to be local
and without boolean to visibility
converter so let's just go and copy that
and creating your converter copy/paste
open up string RGB to brush converter
click the little light bulb rename the
file copy that name paste it into this
type
convertor that takes in an RGB string
such as ffff and convert it to a guest
rush so don't come up parameter value
analyst is really easy so return a solid
color brush which is what we want and
there it's going to be a new thing is
called a brush converter yep making new
brush converter and convert it from and
this will need to be string and let's
string starts for the hash because all
RGB colors start with a hash or a pound
as you Americans watching called and
then the value we passed in so that will
convert to you know hash and then
basically all look like that which is
like a standard for RGB colors but we
don't want to bother keep passing in the
the hash all the time and that's all the
rest of converting a string of RGB to a
brush thankfully because Microsoft made
this brush converter for us so now we
just make the configure to this and
again dot instant players or something
just need building out I can't remember
what we did with this I let see the
instance or you just maybe do that
I answer nearly building again so then
we got the blue so let's just check that
worked let's edit the design time data
so ffo also just bright red build and
there you go so that's now converting
our string to the color so that should
mean oh there you go so that's now using
the blue the ready color and the green
that I made up off the top of my head
and the run this I think I left it as a
permanent data context so we can see it
yep that's looking nice now I think the
last thing here let's copy and paste a
few more so you can check the scroll
works so we go to the design data for it
and let's just copy and paste this and
let's run that and see what that looks
like now you see we know just about
start to gain the scrollbar and
obviously now let's scroll bar will
style I'll make that another video
though this doesn't look very nice we'll
make it like a nice faded just a blue
bar that only shows when you're
scrolling or when you hover and we need
these to have hover effect as well so
let's just do that now so I don't have
to change it pop the valve we have to
change this up a little bit that's
number one
because we need a hover effect and right
now it's a user control we're just a
grid in and we want to hover effect on
the grid so even though you can do that
I think the simpler thing is instead of
having this grid here let's have a just
a Content controls to basic you know
some content and we'll move the design
time binding on for that then we are
that will do for that and then we're
going to move this into a style of
that's just inside this control there is
still user control dot styles not style
dot resources and then we want a new
style so the key I'll just call it
content style because it's only
available inside this control anyway the
target type what the I'll do not with
the stacked on top of the typed style
target tie is we're going to be styling
this content control now which purely
holds the content and then inside that
style we want property is can wait and
then set the value on to control
templates at the star we've type as
again content control so all that boils
down to just being able to paste that
grid back in it's messed up our tabs
there we go that's all the grid pasted
in and then we need to add this content
style to now the content itself here so
style statically service content style
oh yeah that worked so that should have
updated maybe buddhic need to build
there we go so now we've got asthma
zoomed off now we got this exactly the
same of you will so it still just looks
the same but what we've done now is move
the grid into a style and then made the
single content control as part of the
control and styled it with that and then
the binding here but what we've gained
now because we're inside a control
template which is what we needed we can
now add we hide the grid after this we
can now copy and paste the same styles
and say buttons for mouse over style
triggers or wasn't mouse enter and leave
now we go so these type of control
template triggers so when the mouse goes
over change it to this color and you can
run a storyboard now straight from the
control template so basically just copy
this trigger that we did before for a
hover effect on one of the buttons paste
it here
your very description
and when you hover over this we want
this is what I want to use that very
light blue we made and when you've done
you want to go back to the foreground
light color which is there you don't get
in Tallaght sense for static resources
inside of control templates for some
reason so it doesn't pop up with the
name so I'll just copy and paste it yep
so have a blue go light target name
border I'll add something we need to
name it same with your target name
border so it's not border in our case
it's going to be this entire grid so
flawless container copy that and then
make sure we're style in the container
I think we just run that now we should
have hover effects over the color
animation blah-dee-blah
is not valid for property - oh I know
what I've done got the love copy and
paste I pasted the brush and an
animation as a colon up brush so just
get rid of the word brush and there we
go a nice little hover effect on hover
in between them so that's mostly done
will quickly bind this red thing to
another property just so we can make it
look visually more appealing I like our
visual studio keep swapping me windows
around every time I close so we have I'm
not used to the text being this huge
it's really hard to navigate so
background red I said background words
fine width is their visibility collapsed
or ah now that I think we want this bar
to come over it we don't want us to push
out because then these will be out of
line so if we add this you know
collapsed or visible then you can see
this moves over so we actually want to
get rid of this bar and this is going to
combine into two but now we're just
going to shift this to the first column
this to this second column of your well
yeah it should have worked
oh yeah it has worked we just now need
to make sure this is horizontally to the
left so this is basically the profile
picture in the bar stacked on top of
each other if you will and then this
looks a bit six make up three
so now if we hadn't showed this red bar
it basically just cuts into the padding
so it's on the same lining we won't sort
of offset this they'll keep it central
and in fact we can probably he'll
examine thin willing to go with four or
a four looks too thin still now let's
just write actually so four looks good
so now we want to basically just hide
that when we have a boolean property so
we need to go to the chat list item view
model allows another property here
public boolean new content available
through if there are unread messages in
this chat so we want to bind to new
content available as the visibility so
then we binding that converts it is
fully into visibility converter so now
by default they should all disappear
because a boolean by default is false
and we haven't set any up know oh I know
why because our boolean to visibility
converter is by default back to front so
we added the converse of parameter
option to flip it around just basically
state anything you want in there we
should probably change us as well to be
a bit more obvious the boolean to
visibility by defaulted and make it
visible so go to all hidden and now if
we go to the design mode young model my
brains a bit slow as you can see it's
5:58 in the morning so how about three
hours sleep hence why I'm a little bit
slower this morning new content
available is through so we're going to
flag this first message
as new there we go
so I always like how we can do a
Photoshop file and then make it
practically identical really easily with
WPF so we've got the red bar that's now
bound to a property as well we've got
the hover effects now let's go one step
further this is a selected chap so this
is like you know the aptitude chat let's
make a selected chat stay that color so
it looks again just right and then I
think that menus done by the scroll bar
so that's looking quite good and then we
can actually bind to click events and
things as we need and so let's add one
more property to this item
whoops were pressed I feel Evan told you
is too early and you probably forgot
that set now what we're doing
oh yeah it's selected if selectively
gets true of this item is currently
selected and we'll make the parnell one
selected and now we'll bind this to it
somehow
you can do it in here copy and place the
trigger property trigger
data trigger - maybe I can't remember
search the data trigger and I will done
this and we're finding template append
text maybe that'll work
give that go so
buying into is selected I don't know
those are where they've been the view
model it's not actually on the templated
parent I don't think that's a work but
let's see a property targeting container
dealer
he cannot be known
a Babar I wonder ed it's just that funky
background targets that harmless is very
light blue
okay I don't think that's a work so I
think I've done the binding wrong but
let's see
background needs to be a brush
and it works oh yeah well I still owe
again it worked but yeah my mouse keeps
appearing over the exact same spot let
me leave the mouse up here so you see
what's happening is it's set there now
so the panel is highlighted but as soon
as go over then this event trigger here
is is overriding this one so let's see
if we can just move that above as like
kind of a priority maybe or whether we
need to do something to prevent as Mouse
leave from overriding that property yeah
so we need to do something to prevent
this when it done to prevent this event
trigger overriding this value so we
could either do two colors which we
don't really want you know overlay
another color on hover actually it's not
bad idea because we might want the
background to be different than the
selected color let's do that so we've
got the container right now which we're
covering here and then this background
will change to for calling background
because then we can have a background
highlighted one color but when you're
Harvey you still get a hover effect so
we have this is a container which is
going to get the background of whatever
color will wrap this and that will wrap
the entire thing in a border with the
name container which will get the color
of the mouse hover which way around we
want it want the mouse hover to go over
the top don't we so now all the way
around this will be the background which
will get the color of selected and then
there we go
so now the background which is here that
you can see if we set the background
color to red notice you can't see
because the containers got a color so we
got rid of the container color you can
see there so by default and move the
background color off here to there I'll
leave the container empty and then what
we need to do is just tweak the tainer
when you let go instead of being light
to basically go to transparent so that
it disappears so I think that should
work now it's one way again around the
issue anyway there's poor now Oh cannot
resolve all references and background
color we haven't set the color so
because there is no color backgrounds
nothing is no it can't set the
background color so we just need to
explicitly set the background here to
transparent so that it's got a color so
that it can change the color of the
container otherwise there's no color to
set there we go finally so now we've got
selected and you've also got a hover so
we could change those to calls around
every wanted in fact doing you just see
it slightly you do get a visual effect
even though it's technically the same
thing so I think that's a that's a good
way of doing the chat so far we've now
bound the selected the new message all
the details will fix the scroll bar in
another video and then as we go as we
progress and we get data coming into
here we'll have maybe like three
ellipses appearing here that you can
click in a menu slides out over the
message with options to like you know
delete or reply or ill did the message
options whatever we want to do with the
message and then I think we've got this
will do next as well the you know the
main chat bubble screen and about this
will be a huge thing here that's nice
on a human little tax box here I can
tell you from past experience there's
going to be so much involved in this one
control you wouldn't believe how much is
going to go into this so this is what we
going to be like three videos long to
get this right message box so probably
do these bubbles first cuz that'll be
easier and this box up here but
hopefully this video has been useful
again
and hopefully the text has been big
enough this time let me know what you
think about the size of the font and I
hope you enjoyed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
