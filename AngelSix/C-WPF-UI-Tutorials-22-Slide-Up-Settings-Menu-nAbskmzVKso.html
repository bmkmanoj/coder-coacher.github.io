settings page I've decided something a
lot they definitely keep working on the
same area here so we're going to go and
do the settings I am done much time to
prepare this so I've done a quick
Photoshop file showing something similar
to what I'm thinking we're going to do
so just quickly mock this up 10 minutes
ago give us some idea of what we're
going to try and do with some UI I'm
going to have this
I think sliding up from the bottom and
then the close button will slide it away
or potentially slide it out so it comes
up one way it goes out another I'm not
sure we'll we'll play with that when we
get there this is the just the general
idea what I'm thinking the last big
profile picture when you hover over you
got sort of these dots at the top corner
that indicate that you can edit the you
know edit the profile picture these will
all be read-only but then when you hover
again you'll get the stuff you're
clicking this and will either change
this to a text box or like with the
password we expand to show two text
boxes and then you can enter them so
again we'll we'll do this as we go and
really pre plan this out much so we'll
just go ahead and try and do that now in
the last few videos well it was a recent
comment but it was from an older video
guy called marker the watches the videos
notice that have you guys Program Files
can you go to visual studio so Microsoft
Visual Studio not the ones with the
numbers just a normal visual studio and
2017 and the version you've got and then
common 7 IDE and then where was it
and thank you look I've got the file
opens could double after file open it is
comment have an idea because yeah item
templates was the next one well so IDE
then I some templates seashore code then
your this is your language numbers this
might be different view here not on an
english machine I think that's the
language number and then class and then
your value gets this class CS and I'm
not sure others classed obvious template
as I just Alex use the class so this is
the file that gets pulled in when you
create a new class and you'll notice in
all my videos we go ahead and create a
new class I've never done this before so
we'll see how this work from pretty sure
this is what's going to happen when
you're creating your class you get these
namespaces which I always delete I just
delete them all because I don't like any
namespaces and then I also add the word
public every time and they all try to
comment so what we might do is tweak the
class to come pre done this way if
you're basically removing those fit in
public there and probably even having
because 99 times out of 10 we want to
constructor and there's no real there's
very few times into downside to not have
the constructor that means they also
then type this and then I think this and
I call this default constructor that's
every single time I make a class so
think of we got this as the template of
the class it saved me a lot of time so
this is going to be really cool this
works and again credits tomorrow for
finding us out so I'm just going to head
you can actually easily this template
file basically punch the class so
instead of actually editing class I'm
going to copy
oops copy/paste and call this
Luc's class then I'm gonna add it Luke's
class instead and then alls I'm going to
do then will not go in a new window I'll
get there in a minute
whoa I will look in closed class and
then in this template will change us to
use Luke's class and save that and of
course that is if you want to edit this
file because it's under admin privileges
Visual Studio code does not like running
as admin so you can't our PS code hold
ctrl shift and enter and then click yes
I'm pretty sure it complains when it
tries to run as admin let's just close
this down code run as admin yes okay so
actually doesn't mind on this machine I
think it's when I'm on Linux it really
doesn't like loneliness admin so we have
to run Visual Studio code as admin which
are basically held ctrl and shift and
press Enter when I opened it or you can
right click on the shortcut and run as
admin because these files are in off the
Program Files so now when I save the
file that's saved ok now if I edit and
then you lose the ability to drag and
drop now onto this so let's just do open
Luke's class so now I don't want any of
them using this at all so just get rid
of left I'm just wondering where the
space comes in here because there's no
space left in here but we don't want to
space anything so we have this class so
then we'll do what basically as long as
we have safe item root name then we can
just copy this whole thing
so that was safe I can move name I
believe it was and laughs I would have
thought now and I'm also getting I'll
likely have to well I don't know come
out after closing me up in Visual Studio
it might be read at the time so let's
just see now that add a new class and
now so close Visual Studio
okay so now it's reopened let's go ahead
and add a class hopefully fingers
crossed this will work
oh it's still not working so let's just
go back to here
maybe default name maybe just didn't
like this help I'm noe up project item
class we've also missed this fit here so
that oh that's the default name of the
class file I'm guessing even though it
says class one so let's change that back
I'm guessing it's the project item so
let's delete that and create one more as
I mentioned I've not done this before
some just playing around and seeing what
works but you can clearly see that is
the class file there we go
oh that's nice so now it's made a new
class we forgot to add the comments to
top of here which we also wanted sad
that was talked in and now we have
that's really cool so now whenever I'm
making the new class that's going to
save me a load of time and just typing
all those default things and you know
they'll open to do every single time I
make a class
so there we go we now get a class with a
default constructor inside a region with
comments on both and none of the
namespaces that's really cool so that
will now work stacking closed so back to
the settings menu now so as we mentioned
a mock this up and we're just going to
go ahead and start making this so I
guess this wants to be a user control
the settings page and it's kind of a
page about the chat page and login page
but it's not really going to be a page
where navigating off to it's kind of a a
slide up and it's not really a control I
guess well it is it's still a control so
we'll just call it a settings control
class and we go to do the same for our
guest issues of control as well to edit
the default template because when I
create these mind you the only thing I'm
doing now is changing the namespace
which would come potentially do change
the namespace from being the folders
name is place to be in the root we'll
look at light turn all the time
so Tunes namespace out get all these
make sure everything compiles okay just
a load of errors
what's going on with Visual Studio Soto
already contains a definition for word
help yep
I completely out and including the name
of their control such as control control
does not exist that their so yeah this
is also something I want to fix in the
those default files because that's
really annoying every time we have to do
that it's and most of times I forget how
you forget to remove the our I took that
wrong so we'll definitely look at that
also I just noticed my screen isn't set
to slightly larger there we go so we now
have this settings control what we want
to start working with so let's work by
this side by side it might might be a
bit small but let's try and tab for that
so this is what we want
I just didn't sprint that actually and
tweak this lets border down let's run
across so the first thing we want is a
white background as the white background
then we have again think of it as stuck
pattern or grid so this we want to be
title wants to take up what it needs and
then this wants to take up the rest so
it's going to be a grid initially so
we've got a grid here and we now want to
problems into that grid out so two rows
and the second one is to take up all the
remaining height so this will then
become the setting sky or an electron
will be their main content so inside the
settings title now we've got an arrow
over here and then this will take up the
rest a really again I think a grid with
a single columns fine and we'll simply
have this one Center and this one left
the line and then we'll basically lay
over the top of each other so this is
our grid for inside the row definition
stuff let's run well now be a grid and
the arrow is font or some arrow so it
won't an icon bottom and so icon button
content equals and then definitely have
that yeah font all charm will go and get
at the moment take any for now I don't
see the arrow anywhere why is that
so as we almost set the font let's set
the size come on up here where are you
why aren't we getting this button
anywhere oh yes so the we still have
that issue really and we didn't fix the
icon button
I thought we fixed that a while ago in
the videos so the issue we had with the
while I guess they're just test what I'm
thinking first yeah so for some reason
well I know the reason why we bound the
button style right so we banned the
button cell the width to the height
whereas there is no height then
obviously it's an infinitive infinity
height and the width becomes infinity so
I thought we fixed that in a previous
video so I guess from now we simply set
the height and because we want less
space in any way I'm gonna was work
around it with a height but we'll
definitely to come back and and fix this
layout issue with the button if it's
inside something that doesn't have a
height in the near future
and we also now need to change the see
if just changing the foreground color
works and let's go and get this font or
some thing for left arrow let's do a low
left so font awesome cheat sheet arrow
and then we could have this arrow in a
circle or will he choose the one that I
did on this Photoshop file which is this
one again we can play with that but that
should do for now I forgot yeah just
copy that so now we can do our left and
there's the arrow and as we mentioned
this wants to be left aligned now that's
over there we also want it to be I'm
thinking let's do a padding still margin
on the bottom of 10 it's not making any
difference
oh yeah it is we're not seeing it so
let's I know it's going to be about 20
this will be 40 again we'll play with
the sizes after
should already be a working button then
we want the settings which is again very
similar but the setting is going to have
a font awesome text and in fact we can
do that in one text for annually so I
think if we do a text block you can do a
run for the font family font Oh awesome
and the text yet text equals one husband
cog and foreground not a word orange
there we go font size will have large
there we go again we mentioned we wanted
this font to be centered and I think
vertically as well same with this we
actually want to vertically send for
this so they've closed on the same line
regardless of size and then we've done
this time we've done a text block that's
got inner runs so that's the first run
which is simply a cog icon and then this
will be settings text that's the header
so we've managed to do that single
control and now we simply we move the
font family
and the text is now settings like a
bi'ness and we should bind this
eventually as well to view models and
localization so that this can be changed
forever for languages so we're on farm
family ones changing to an and regular
now we have that settings menu we'll
come back to doing the rest of them in
let's just get this sliding off and in
so we can start visually seeing it so
for do that we will want to go to the
main window because this is going to
overlay everything else and then in the
window resource similar to where the
over layers of the border drop shadow
window border mean they'll corner when
did we put the overlay things I didn't
overlay here so similar to this we will
then put our settings page to do that we
want to local settings control on the
same thing grid column span equals to
that now takes all that up how does that
in black Symbian levels it's going to
set over the dimmed actually no it's not
going to set over the games going to sit
just under the dimmed for fun on decks
of nine and that's all we had in the
other control sorts of build make sure
that's built and then what we want to do
is now apply an animation to this which
is a slide up animation which I think we
potentially have so we'll move this out
the way from now we'll go back to full
screen
I think in animations slide over from
left slide in from bottom so that slides
up so we should have slide in from
bottom animation and now we need to bind
this to something so we're going to bind
this to a new property that will create
which is nothing is menu visible then go
to the code-behind go to the window view
model and this will be a I don't really
like it being in the window view model
because this is in the top level it's
not in a call so nothing can change it
so what did we do for dimmable I guess
we did nothing you have an application
view model yes the application view
model so we'll have a property here to
get an set but all we'll do is find it
to what we do one of two things would
leave the bandit here and I'd like to
duplicate the passage down that simply
then calls IOC Chetan and that will do
that's easy
so settings menu visible just so that
our window binding can be nice and
simple like let's just a single line
instead of changing the source the
binding then what we'll do here is in
the gap there we'll simply return IOC
dot
Corder IOC I only call when we've got la
you'll need to type call for some reason
it's one thing is to and because the
application view model is in call as
well why do we keep up it into tight
core something's really annoying here
maybe it's just because it hasn't
finished typing the line the side menu
visible we'll go to that and we'll
create the real view model here and this
will be stuff in the menu visible and by
default it's false which we don't need
to specify by default so if the settings
menu should be filled and get is leave
lakenya
so now why do we need call this is
really strange why it's not finding now
it is just intellisense is completely
messed up I thought so we just restart
visual studio quickly
okay let's fix that issue true if we
should have a dim though so true if we
should show the settings menu so this
was passing through as a getter and
setter and this is simply the value so
what I'm also going to do because
application view model is in core anyway
extract method refactoring error
okay visual Studios likes to crash a lot
this morning it's doing it every time
anyway so in the IFC we had the shortcut
for the UI we add a shortcut to the
application view model as well because
of think all its forms part of the base
of all the application I will just call
this litigation nothing we need to
application view model we know what it
is with applications so then that allows
us now to change this which is probably
used in a few places to your application
in fact I'll show you doing it manually
out prints tell you know find replace
all so you can see all these places
we're using it well in fact I will just
do the fire replace off so you see all
those places we know it says that and we
simply change it to say application now
if not you can do this manually just
change the get application view model
into this application yes I'm sure
and now we have a much nicer clean way
of just accessing the application view
model as IOC to application so all we've
done is bound down this settings menu
visible to them set their underline the
applications view model which is in core
so that should now bind to that value
and it will slide off when it's set to
true so all we need to do now is quickly
set it to true
I think we've used every button in here
at the minute to do something so I think
the send button is already bound to do
let's have a look I got send command so
the moment we show a message box which
we did with the last video so let's just
comment aloud for now and simply do i oh
see that application not settings menu
visible equals true to share the
settings menu and i should run that and
see if it works
and a project without failure because I
unloaded the word application one when
it wasn't compiling I need to reset this
as the startup project step 5
this machine's slow this morning really
slow okay stuck oh oh okay so we are
calling a the finally place all actually
we placed this call as well but one call
we didn't want to replace let's change
that back to application view model
otherwise it is an infinite loop calling
itself there we go so now clicking send
should hopefully oh and we've also got
the the settings page right now is over
the top of everything so we can't click
and I think to be honest or okay setting
this for every animation pedaling is
really an issue with the animation yep
okay lost all the settings
yeah I second all that for the moment of
a clean and build or pizza so what we
did with the we added a what did we add
the fade in property we changed the
default to inside the fade in to
basically make it invisible when it was
finished on the fade out here so I think
we want to do a similar thing on all the
animations you make it once it's out the
way there's no real need for it to be
taking off click space because it's not
meant to be visible so on all sort of
fade outs inside the framework element
animations it sort of wait for it to be
and the only reason you do not want to
do this I guess is if this is going to
affect the layout so that's if I guess
if keep margin because if you want to
keep the margin and you're trying to
keep the height or the width or whatever
it is that you're doing in in the actual
UI but for now
so we could say sort of if if not keep
margin do that's code for now let's just
let's try how it works with collapsing
everything make make elements invisible
sets of slide out there slide them from
bottoms down fade out already does it
slide them from right so the slide is
fine the slide out wants to go collapse
which is completely off the UI so that
you can click through and then we'll
jump back to the login page to test this
as well to make sure we haven't broken
it in doing this so that's all the
animations now set to completely hide
when they're out of the way so hopefully
now
we'll have the button back there we go
and then when we click we're expecting
that settings page to slide off or not
so let's figure out why letters so
firstly we have the main window the
settings page should be bound to
settings menu visible which should be in
here settings menu visible oh god I know
what I'm doing here this is a boolean
value and we found our hats right
settings menu visible so oh I also know
what we've done here so we can't do what
I was thinking there because well that
should have actually worked saying that
but what we've done is we've set the
underline a skip to the end
so when we changed it with the command
button for the same command we change
the IOC application settings model and
not this model and this is higher up but
because this geta
gets from here really Hadi Weaver should
have been smart enough to detect that
and fire this event because it's bound
to it so I'm guessing Fadi Weaver's
failed in this instance maybe it's
because it's a cross project dependency
so let's jump back to the second idea
which is simply get rid of that and
change the source to the application
view model which I know we've done again
somewhere else I think we use the view
model locator or something in value
converters
and sure we use this thing that we
started making so let's see where this
is used as you've right here on the same
page just below it so we're going to do
the same thing here we're going to have
a view model locator and we're going to
get the application page and so you just
want less source shutting off the nut
set so we should just be able to change
this to finding of settings visible menu
and the source no that's not right
either oh yeah this you just have to do
them application view model dot I think
I should compile
all right see if that works
there we got carded didn't work so
that's not dark when it should be
there's no arrow there buzzing let's
just use a foreground color messing up
in some way and that also didn't fade
off like slide off I'm sure that just
appeared so that's probably due to the
collapse state that we changed so that's
not working even though intellisense a
little messed up on it again so let's
open the settings control first and make
sure the text is explicitly set to very
dark as quickly see if that fixes the
issue with the color so let's fix that
issue next issue is why the aloes
disappeared and it has actually
disappeared so the cog icon gonna turn
on the COG icon the back button it's
just nowhere to be seen
okay it's not inheriting the height now
for some reason oh it's weird so I think
good WPF is just a bit messed up this
morning it seems to be very buggy on
what it's doing okay let's set an
explicit hide for now let's see if
that's it I think is to style the icon
button style needs some work it's that
buying into the height that's messing
things up there we go and that's the
wrong on anyway that's not the one I
wanted I wanted the other style
I want the one with the icon that just
grows how's it text icon no did we call
it icon bought an icon grow button let's
change that style to icon grow button
that's that icon fixed we need a lot
more padding here anyway this has got
nowhere near enough padding I guess I
don't know your margin for the
background windchill so we need to put
this in a border to get padding and I'll
do say 20 move the whole border in it's
actually updating and I move the
background to there I think 20 will be
fine so let's go back to I'm pretty sure
this collapse thing is what's broken the
animation so thing is really when you
slide in because it's collapsed when you
slide in we start the animation we add
all the stuff we begin and we make it
visible so actually now that should work
because it's visible but just to check
let's do
let's make that there and the issue is
then clicking won't work so I'll have to
really quickly just add something to the
main page so that we can actually open
open this well while it's not overlaying
or can we just disable we just change
get tested bezel a little maybe bind hit
test visible to when it should be shown
and that might be an alternate option
there we go so that's still silent
actually that wasn't the underlying
issue and now we can't cut in there
anyway so we have an issue with the
slide up so we're not used with you
slide up because we used it in the
counselor nope too late we used it in
the attach menu pop up so that just is
that only not working on the settings
page let's see so this thing oh yeah so
we broke something the excess was
working and yet I've reverted the change
back on I haven't here so let's revert
that back and let's just hide this a
moment
and let's see if it has the collapse
that's causing that issue what is going
on with this I'm not trusting Visual
Studio right now I think something's
really glitchy because everything I'm
doing that should not be visible and now
it's still visible because because the
animations changed it that's why I just
remove a moment okay so yeah that now
works doing that so we do need the we
can't do what we thought we could do and
simply make it invisible in order for
the animation to work so what we're
gonna have to do instead if that is an
issue we don't want to actually do with
it the other menu then because we fix
this in the other menu let's take a
quick look at attachment control I can't
remember what we did on there or
vertical menu no and attachment pop up
because I know we have this issue with
it when it was fully down but actually
no I thought we did that slide in from
bottom so we really use the slide in
from bottom property on mesh menu enough
I thought that's what we did was to
completely collapse afterwards maybe we
just did it in a different place
slide them from bottom property so slide
it out no hmm so why we did this I know
we fixed it somewhere where did we fix
it there's no point when I solve it
twice when I know we've already done
this somewhere sage on the chat page so
when this was you can remember when
we're doing this click button here and
it was sliding up and down oh I know
what we did we didn't fix it we simply
placed it behind with the Zed index and
then this was placed above where the
hires at it looks in here of three so we
had this issue with the attachment
button but all's we did to fix that was
set these as that indexes so we have the
same issue here but I think we can solve
this now by so let's first remove the
framework element animations let's make
sure we've removed it from all places
the collapse thing that we added so go
ahead and remove those back out again
which is that break the layout money
where the hidden would work actually
doing all this someone where they're
simply making it invisible because right
now the opacity fades I think actually
that might work so just making it
invisible might fix the issue
we'll see slide out the bottom and then
settings control main window
and let's see if hidden has a hit
testability okay so that I'm not
convinced there again that's billable
codes so does this network so that works
and yet this one still doesn't but
that's fixed the issue by simply setting
it to hidden in the animation so doing
hidden allows clicking through so we've
added that to the slide fade to bottom
I've redone it back in here change that
one so basically all of the the
animating out to the fading out any of
the outs we thought we've waited for the
animation to finish and then we've made
it hidden so that we can you know click
through and that's now fixed one
animation but it's not fixed the page
animation so it could be that the height
is not set so slide on fade-out to right
now look slide and fade in from bottom
let's take a break here and let's see
what's happening so when we click this
one let's see the height has not given
the actual height is 125 click here the
height is not given the actual height is
correct so we are telling it to animate
up
we're telling it to not keep the margin
and just fade them so do we tell the
other one to keep the margin it's not
the difference
no so it's nothing to do with that so we
have a thickness from exactly the same
thing
so I'm 125 or - 125 and it animates fine
unless one point three all the way or
animate let's just quickly add so don't
uh keep closing this to double check in
to see lets buying this black button to
an action to actually close the settings
page so for that we'll need a settings
view model now we'll come back to the
animation and fix the animation in a
minute so we've got the application view
model let's copy and paste that call the
settings view model rename the file and
then we will have in here we want
command we don't have any properties
right now we just want a command and
this will be at close command then here
we create the commands
just a real a command to an action
called clothes which will make closer to
settings menu and then here we simply
call I'll see the application after
settings menu visible across Falls not
saw we're really doing right now for
closing we could have confirmation of
things are you in the middle of editing
you want to you're closing this might
warn you with IOC UI and then when we
add a new one that will be confirmed
message we can sort of confirm if the
user wants to do that but for now we'll
simply close the side menu look sorry
closed up settings menu lots of settings
menu view model this thing is not bound
which is add the title for that as well
for now we're just going to bind the
button now
so the command wants to be binding was
it setting close command and the holes
we need to do then for now is to bind we
could define this directly to the
actually yet we also need it's going to
be a singleton read to add it to I of C
in order to find it so in here we've got
the application there's only going to be
a single instance of the settings so
we're going to do settings view model
and then this is bound in here and we'll
just make a single instance of the
settings of your model as well and I
think actually we don't need this
because it's it can figure that out from
what you're passing in so there's no
need to explicitly state it twice so we
now got a settings view model we've got
a quick way of accessing it with
settings we're bound to close command
and because there's only a single
instance we could bind the settings
control itself so we can simply set
their data context here to the where's
that view model locator thing again for
something that I don't really like doing
what's okay for this instance we can set
the data context here and this wouldn't
work for we'll probably end up changing
there some certain but for now we're
just cooked in here or come back and
clean this off because this won't allow
us to design time binding Mollywood but
we'd have to then have one binding and
code behind and one binding enzyme also
will probably change this to the view
model okay to afterwards but just for
quickness or simply set there the data
context here so I think that's all we
need to get a second me to close with
that button so this must contain this
one tie oh okay I guess you do need to
I don't think you just explicitly quote
that because it should figure it out
from what you're passing in but let's
see if that fixes that
okay let's click this that still works
like this we don't get animation but
they should close so at least now we can
open and close the menu I'm just going
to figure out why this is working with
that animation and this isn't working
with that animation I don't know why we
just did that line into the Sun page
when we have a Settings button here was
there bound it to I'll just quickly
revine that as well doesn't make much
difference but lets us keep the the send
button to show a dialog I have C dot UI
dot so keep that showing the message box
for now that's just buying a side menu
this settings cog we have nothing bound
at the moment she's fine but we will
bind the command we need a command now
that myself this is a side menu this is
really and we'll put a command I think
in the application or what about the
settings view model itself
we simply have an open command that's
what we'll do
now we have an open command on the
settings view model American simply buy
into that open command using the same
view model locator thing so we do the
binding on the Settings button the
command equals buying into application
view model under settings view model dot
open command and that should be all we
need
we should now be able to open it with
the actual Settings button so that
should go back to show in a pop-up which
it does see animate and this is now not
working so that doesn't work do we get
two
we actually get to the settings view
model how long on the view model located
doesn't have a set into model yet I
don't think that's why now it should
work there we go so now the settings
won't actually open the settings menu
this closes nulls we just need to fix
now this animation plus let's figure
that out let's go to the it's in the
main window I believe in a minute and
see we can just at least fix this wpx
everything seems out of sync in a minute
as well so if you got things like as
where it's constantly telling you those
issues when digit isn't this it's just
all over the place that is what WPF does
sometimes so build cleaning solution
close Visual Studio go to your actual
project which for me is in get angel 6
for set a word source and then in here
the one above I've got show all hidden
files I'm going to delete this dot VF
file folder rather go into word I'm
going to delete the bin the object I'm
going to call do the same delete the bin
and the object and then go
back off and open the project not like a
complete clean of everything now
hopefully this will fix the the issue so
we build now everything should build
fine now we open main window hopefully
under anymore of this intellisense issue
going on with showing errors where there
aren't errors so it was fixed all that
now the settings page is hidden like it
should do and there's no more squiggly
line errors let's get back to the
settings page first let's just double
check that I haven't fixed it
it rarely does but maybe something was
totally out of sync now so that's not
fixed it um let's also slow down this
animation because I'm not 100% convinced
that it's simply animating that fast and
the screen isn't updating so slide in
from bottom and the issue we have here
with there the slide and we can't
actually change the default value via
this binding so we're so just buying in
whether it does or not in future we want
to also have the ability to pass in
different times animate slide in from
bottom property let's just change this
on the slide in okay it's at three
seconds and light just be a hundred
percent sure it's not animating in so
this should take three seconds to
animate in and then goes out so does
this now so this is definitely just
fading in so let's just do one thing
here let's because all we do is animate
when we slide in from the bottom
we simply animate the margin and we set
it to these values and we're not keeping
the thing so it's basically zero zero
zero and the bottom margin changes so
let's just do that manually let's just
remove that for a moment
and that should be showing now there's
that and now let's just set the margin
manual you can't see what happens so set
it to minus 50 minus 500 you can see
what's happening this isn't actually
changing we've got a negative margin yet
this thing isn't moving so this is
because of where it is I'm guessing you
know something to the layout so clearly
this this should be moving down but it
simply isn't so we're inside a grid we
have the top one the bottom one is
negative something is causing this to
not move so we had a 500 here okay so
the keep margin in this case we want to
be cruel we go to recap the margin then
it's forcing it down so that's the issue
there and again it kind of boils down to
we need multiple so sliding from bottom
hmm how do we name this because what
we're going to do is make another one so
animate slide in from bottom property
because we want to change this to true
we need to pass it either pass in more
details which we cannot Omni a touch
property because this is a animate so
it's just an attached property so we
need another attached property then it
get messy so the quickest way to do this
from the simplest way is to simply make
another animate from bottom just copy
the whole thing is so small and paste
and I'll call this animate from bottom I
just put the word marching in there
copy and paste up to their notes keeps
the margin and the other thing we could
do is simply change this to default to
keep margin but we use an elsewhere and
we've SAP it by default for a reason so
so let's change these to true to keep
the margin and then also need to do is
change the one that uses the margin so
we go to the settings page and add word
margin there I think now this should
should work because we've seen it
visibly doing it by altering the margins
ourselves so this should still work and
now this should hopefully there we go so
now we have a slide up finally so
there's the settings menu slid off and
gone away and we also have the main area
to do so I'm going to do this in another
video I'm going to stop the video and
then you know do this whole thing in one
go because this is more UI design now
we've done the the view model work and
the functional code and bound it to
actually get started with a control with
a slide off with the basic header so it
gives you a nice starting point and now
we can just add the content inside the
warming our will just quickly tweak
though ISM I'm not quite I think that
borders a little bit too big doesn't
kind of fit in with the padding it you
know everywhere else in the application
and got a little bit too much there so
it's just quickly too exact and just
reduce that to maybe fifteen
there we go it was nicer and then yes
the next video will will fill this out
now and get some some content in there
let's took a little bit longer you know
planning out alls we should really have
to do a slider control but as you can
see there was a few things that had to
be devolved and figured out so hopefully
was a I've done this more of a bit more
you know an unplanned as I mentioned at
the start pattern on Flandre video of
just me developing it from start without
any kind of pre thought so I had no idea
of what was going to do how I was going
to do it I didn't even give it five
minutes thought but then at least you've
seen again how how I'm thinking it
through and how I'm doing it in the
issues you can hit and how you fix them
so you know I want to leave all the
stuff in the video so you see everything
and hopefully again learn from that next
video is basic UI so we're just doing
the - I will maximize us now you know
we'll be making this all the nice UI so
again any comments let me know otherwise
next video should follow shortly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
