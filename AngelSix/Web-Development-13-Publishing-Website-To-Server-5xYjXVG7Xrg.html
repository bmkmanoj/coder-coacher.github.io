web website the angel six out we've been
making and basically published this and
and get live so in order to do that I
haven't bothered doing videos on
finishing up the or the pages of the
website simply because it's the same
process of what I've shown unlike the
home page and the other pages there's
nothing new you're gonna learn that but
the source codes available you know if
you need to so this is just the DNA
fabric one template so if you were to
start a new folder and type in DNA web
and then new template fabric modern one
as normal it'll create this this
effective website so we've done this and
all the other videos nothing special
here so we're gonna go into the source
folder and just type DNA web to start
the DNA web and you know I'm sure that
here so you can see and then this will
spin up the current website so you can
see this is the I reload this the
website we're working on which is my new
website you got all the animation stuff
the scroll stuff you got the YouTube
page so it's got everything done now
every page kind of done so I'll leave
you to browse over that once this goes
live that's the website and then it will
also open up the vs code folder so the
difference now from taking it from a
standard website of your welder a flat
web root output with HTML we now want to
turn this into an asp.net core website
so there's a few steps to that so the
first thing is we have in the source DNA
config we output we have a static folder
sorry for assets that gets copied to web
root assets this will change and we will
copy to two places so I'll do that in a
minute
but the key here is in order to copy to
two places we also have to update the
sass
compact file a mate in the SAS world
that outputs directly to Webroot assets
and instead if we just go up a folder
from SAS then go into the assets folder
this is the one that's getting cloned
via this assets here so simply changing
this from going up twice and directly
into Webroot but we just change it to go
into the assets folder directly that
will have the same effect as now it will
copy the same stuff over so we still get
the CSS but the difference is now
instead of it going directly into
Webroot assets and CSS it goes into the
source assets CSS and then because this
is a monitored static folders and type
folder gets copied down to the web
bridge assets folder so that's how
that's working that's that little step
done every time you change the DNA
configure it readers the whole websites
that's a fairly big change that's kind
of why that's happening so the next
phase is to let's just add a title and
the faff icon or just no just a Miss and
I'll just quickly chop those into the
design so I've already got an icon if
you want to put a 5 icon on your website
which is the icon that appears at the
top here on our website just make an ICO
file with ICO effects nice and easy to
use plenty er you know too tall or
something out to do that and then you
make an icon I've called my favicon dot
ICO and in your header below title or
wherever as long as it's in the head you
then provide a link just like you do
with CSS and this time the the Rao is
shortcut space icon and the type is
image for starship X - your icon so this
is just pointing to that icon file we
save that when we refresh now you can
see we get the far back on it's changed
its title into a variable so let's just
do website title and then copy that into
well we don't need to copy that actually
just type okay
copy and paste one of the valuables for
this website title and let's call this
angle six three your mind save the
variables save the header website
reloads we have to title now so we got
the title I don't bother with you know
page headers on my website it's just a
small portfolio we style website so I've
just got the same title which is fine so
the first thing that we really need to
do is to actually make any asp.net core
website so I want mine in web Brutes the
static web and I'm gonna make one called
server root which is the asp.net server
this is just my convention you can use
whatever you like in here I'm just gonna
type CMD to open up a new command window
and I'm just gonna make a new net cor
ASP website you can use Visual Studio
for this if you want I just tend to do
this quickly cuz it's an easy way to get
started so just don't let a new MVC and
enter and that'll make a new MVC website
and give you all the stuff then I'm
gonna clean off we're gonna generate
these controllers in DNA web so Dilek
controllers delete models object is
temporary all of the web route is gonna
come from our again DNA web so that goes
as well the home page all of these pages
will generate so we'll who won't need
that or that we will generate a shared
layout and of view imports and a few
start and then specific pages for every
page of this entire folding it generated
stuck and go app settings can go bundle
can go and we're basically left with
these things here so if we then rename
this to whatever you want surfer it's
fine for now but you can rename your
project as well if you like and just
open this off this should find those
three files in the folder and then it
should work as a website will have no
pages right now but it should compile
which is the important part so we have
properties launch settings get created
when we open up the project and now you
can see it's made of properties folder
which is fine when the properties we
don't want is so will delete the is will
then delete the inner profile of is
and when we name this thing to Castro
because actually on the line technology
that's been used and then this changes
to Kestrel to launch its that's the
website up and running going to here
control RG to remove or use namespaces I
get rid of the palmera page from my
small site as you know just let it crash
if there's an area there shouldn't be
any program same again control are you
move on use namespaces save and close up
settings fine so that's it that's nice
nice clean website now control shift
feature build so we have a buildable
blank website so now what we need to do
is reject the the pages into well that
we need to do two things one is we need
to make a controller and then two ways
we need to make the actual pages to be
seen so we want them to output into this
server root location for all the pages
to work as well we need to see all of
the assets so we'll go to the DNA config
the top-level one for a comma at the end
up here copy paste and more also there
now podesta server root which is our
obviously there so we just made and www
root test the folder that's used for
asp.net core and then inter assets now
we save that now we get the whole thing
rebuilding and we have a double W up now
with assets and then you've got your
content inside what I have noticed they
open as you can see something's on
loading there's only so many image using
partial it's a book I've just added to
DNA web that if a foal doesn't exist
like the destination folder assets
doesn't exist then it seems to miss
files as foes you need to do in DNA web
if something's missing just type
generate and get it regenerate and then
this time you'll see now the all the
fonts are there now all the images are
there everything's there
that's just a little bug it might be
fixed by the time you know you're
watching this video but if you find that
as missing assets just generates a
second time
and once there structures there
it's fine so that gives us the route
file back now we need the controller's
folder as you mentioned so inside the
modern HTML modern one or whatever
you're you know whatever your files are
I'm gonna make a new folder call it
server and in here you're gonna learn
something new because we're now gonna
make a new file called home controller
dot DNA CS they're not dhtml DNA cs and
we can also generate c-sharp code in DNA
web so this is for the purpose of being
able to make service if you go to file
preferences settings and just add file
associations like this so you get the
intellisense for c-sharp and HTML then
that will give you a c-sharp here so in
order to now make this file it's as
simple as it's already created so I'm
presuming well actually already have an
output in world of bin unless it's not
made anything yet
did it make anything save so it made in
server home controller saw so yes it
went straight to source HTML modern one
server no no where did the output what
was I missing web routes home controller
that set that's where it should be so
it's gone like where all the other files
go it's gone output to web root and
we've now got the cs file that's got
nothing in that's not where we want it
though we don't want it in web root to
be Scott this is a static site not a
server so there's a trick to do output
only to certain locations so the first
thing we want to do is set an output
element and we'll go up from and this
location is relative to the DNA configs
output so by default we're saying the
output path is web root so when you're
specifying a path here for the output
not for includes but for outputs this is
already presuming it's going to output
to the web root folder like it's based
on the relative output path
so if we were in Webroot which is here
we've got your up one folder into server
root you can see there then we want to
fold the call control as a nun home
controller so now we're safer we should
find our get control us and a home
controller so we now have the home
controller lock so it's a simple now as
making a standard controller like you
would in Visual Studio and you could
copy and paste this from the blank
asp.net MVC template we made by know
this off by heart anyway so it's just
you need to include the asp net call NB
c-- namespace we'll give it a name space
just called server root doesn't really
matter and then we'll have a root on the
whole controller of top level and then
action so what this means is this plus
here i'll should write the class
furthest home controller control this
class now a because this is in the
controller's baldwin's and haven't from
a controller if you type website name
forward slash then something whatever
the thing after the forward slash is
becomes the action and the action is
basically the methods inside of this
property so i action result index for
example the index homepage you could do
this and then return view and now by
default if attacked forward slash home
or 4/4 other index it would then find
index so this is a special case one
where we don't want index specifically
we want to make another route just for
this one that is purely top-level so
this means to be this is basically
acting like the default page when you
just go to the website name itself it'll
he'll come into here we can shorten this
into this style so it's it's still a
function yes still a method but it just
looks slightly different because this
shorthand way of doing that but it keeps
it clean and short and then we just copy
and paste that and rename to say about
now what will happen if we type forward
slash and then
by otters the name it all then look for
an action because we've told it's the
action variable called about so it's
gonna find this view and then it's going
to return and I'm sure that's in the
other NBC videos the way that all then
work is it will look inside of here and
then it will look for a views folder
that doesn't exist yet and then it'll
look inside a home folder because the
name of the controllers home and then
I'll look for uh something called about
so if we just quickly Chuck in all the
other pages into here so we are be about
we have the blog we have the contact I'm
just looking at these here about blog
contact index we've got SolidWorks
and then YouTube I think that's it's
that's the three if we were to save that
file now we have a controllers a home
and it's all in there generated for us
what's left in that's the home
controller done yeah nothing else oh no
I can think of so now if we went to the
actual project here you can see it's
automatically found it's now got a home
controller and now and try and find that
view so we want to generate for every
page we have so we've got the about page
right now we have a default output when
you know Expensify one it'll then go to
the output folder with the same name
that's out DN a web works so it's going
go to web root about dot HTML that's the
automatic naming convention so instead
of we want to output to two locations
which is what we want to do now we have
to specify the output so the first
output will make basically the same as
that make changes nothing now that's
kind of stating this is what happens by
default just gonna output the web root
because it's relative and it's gonna
have their name about and it's gonna add
the extension dot HTML because there
isn't an extension so that isn't
actually just nothing's changed sort of
thing but now we've defined an output so
what we can now do is copy and paste and
make another output and this time
remember on web root so we'll go up a
folder into server root make a folder
called views then home
and then about CS HTML and the
difference here now is we can have if we
put a colon and then a name can be
anything sauce a server this now is a
profile so this output has now linked
into a profile so what we can do because
CS HTML files if we delete that first
and show you and save will now have a
views home and we got the about but the
issue with this about page in the
asp.net page is it worked by using that
layout so in views we should have a
shared folder and a layout and that
contains the head of the FATA and then
this just contain the content so because
we've got the header already included in
here and the footer at the very bottom
we need to remove them but only from the
server generated files so to do that we
basically tell this it's a profile
called server and then there's a little
trick in DNA web for the header that we
only want to include it in in outputs
that don't have a profile so anything
that simply doesn't have a colon and a
name if you put call on an exclamation
like a not in programming it's basically
saying only include the header if it
doesn't have an explanation mark and
something after it so if we do that for
the header and the footer and this is
all explained on DNA web to I oh by the
way this is just DNA web stuff now if we
go to the views in the about will see we
have no header or footer we've just got
the content which is what we want so now
we've managed to keep the exact same
page so we've only written the HTML
wants I mean just by setting up the set
up like this which we can now copy and
paste or every one so we just go to blog
and paste rename this to blog rename
that one to blog go to the bottom and
make sure the footers also excluded and
we do this for everyone will then have
the server generated files as well from
the same you know the exact same HTML
files which is what we want so we're not
having to keep two extra
copies and try and maintain two
different versions of code this is all
you know the point of DNA where you only
have to do it once and you can make use
of the exact same code for multiple
situations one for a static website and
then one for the actual real website of
reload the server so I'll do two the
index and SolidWorks and then YouTube
last one and then all we've really done
here the whole thing we've done at this
point is like I say we've just generated
thee the blank server like a really easy
server asp.net core server we've deleted
basically this would go there to go
let's go let's go let's go let's get all
that and be deleted this is all
generated stuff this is when you compile
the actual site if you will this is now
generated by the DNA web this is copied
over from static folder and this is
generated so all this is now a generated
website from our DNA web code so we've
got two two instances so now if we run
this it's now found the views it's found
the web root it's found everything we
need so this is running a real web
server if you will now the actual
asp.net core website that has not found
what it once let's take a look at here
assets images although a little flat
let's double check we have what we want
to rid of the root assets images based
on a partial copy again as I mentioned
so we just do a generate and I'll fix
that bug it's just quite - something to
do with when the folders don't exist
I don't think professional make it work
or maybe it has run generate again I'm
basically added that the kind of stuff
that folders quickly to get this feature
in right
that seems to work oh I know what the
other issue is now we don't have
complete we haven't on the layout so we
only got the header off what vignettes
that's the other side we need to do but
this is up and running it's found the
page if we went to like forward slash
SolidWorks say they'll find the
SolidWorks page and I'll click the home
page by mistake go to SolidWorks you can
see it's got the SolidWorks page here
we're just missing the header and photo
stuff so if we now add those and again
like I say if you make a default asp.net
core website you see there you have
those in the view but like say I know
the Molotov me ad so I'm just gonna make
them myself anyway so let's get this now
in here we made server made a home
controller so the other thing we need to
do is make a layout dot be HTML it's
kind of important and we'll also have
then an output for this and this is a
server only output so we only need one
and this will go to server root huge
shared layout docked CS HTML and while
this target with server as well so it's
in the server profile then we will want
to include the what we need the header
and the footer and then render body so
we'll basically be doing what this index
would have well what all the pages
typically do which we excluded the
header do I need to include the top menu
actually include header footer what is
the top menu oh yeah they're top menu
yeah so we should have to include had a
top menu photo I believe no these
include taught me is actually a mistake
here we include top menu twice just
notice that we have in the header and go
on the others right
the header we include the top menu or am
I just gave myself confused here the top
menu is there no that's right we've got
to include the header then the top menu
and then the contents oh I know why we
don't need to that because we already
include the top menu and excludes the
top menu we've only excluded the header
in the FATA so what we'll need to do is
take the header the variables in the
header and paste them into layout if you
want to include variables but because
this is inside a folder it's inside a
server folder and the valuables is above
I need to step up a folder seeing for
the header this time we're going to
exclude it and then we'll put the area
speed on that call specific code in
which is this is a razor condition all
the render body and then include the
photo and also we're doing here
we've saved that presuming that works
and we got output will have views shared
layout all that's done is generated a
layout file which has got them off a
minute it's got the header our header
then it's got the render body in there
and then it's got the photo so that's
again that's just asp.net MVC that's how
it works if we were to create a new
folder called test site and we just
write the DNA web sign at dinner web CMD
and as we did at the start you just went
dotnet a new MVC then you'll see that it
generates the views folder and it
generates a shared and in the layout it
generates it's kind of a weird
and layout it generates its header with
all its stuff in and then just the
render body which is where you paid you
stand your specific view page use these
things get injected into here and then
there's the footer so that's basically
all we've done we've used our header
we've dumped our header in via you know
this so we inject our header then just
put the render body than our footer and
then we need the variables because they
had to make use of variables so if we
were to exclude that then it can't find
things like website title in fact that's
the only variable we use that or that's
all we've done and then we've told it to
output to where we need it to so that's
the layout done with the layout we have
then the view imports and view start a
believer left so again and we look to
the default output you got these two
files and if you open them up the
default is telling it which layout page
to use so we want to use the layout page
we've just made so we need to copy that
if you will then make a new file called
new imports paste that in go over to the
my own name that correctly dhtml go to
the layout copy this and also I think
that's not the right way around that
view start as you start not view imports
so that's where you start then this will
be called shared it's not in the shared
folders and top folder and it's also
yeah underscore you start just that page
created select all that make the other
one which is um for stock the HTML and
that will be view imports and then we'll
just take the standard view imports
we're not using anything so we'll just
at least put the tag helper in there so
all's will have an hour's is the blank
bit save that and now we can delete that
test one
done with we'll go into here and now we
have the two pages let's double check
them yeah that's fine that's fine so we
go back to visual studio you can see now
we've auto-generated all of the folders
that we originally deleted we're now off
the layout there's got our header and
footer we've got the imports we've got
the layout and we've got each page with
the specific content so we've
effectively taken a static website and
moved or whether generated the specific
pieces of asp.net core razor pages and
controllers that we need for the website
in order to make it functional so now we
press f5
we should get effectively the same
website but now running in I can
actually expand that core website so
we've got the tile we've got the icon
we've got everything here looks like
it's loading got the blog yeah got
so it works YouTube dull seems to be
working so that's the that's the server
now ready for publishing there's one
other thing that I'd do and that is for
my website to have some downloads in the
SolidWorks page that point to specific
files so if I show you those if I go to
the SolidWorks page I have like download
batch process which is a put into a nail
and that's in variables so we have
variables download here now the thing is
we don't want to have to this variable
exists in DNA web we don't want to have
to copy and paste this oil into our
asp.net core website too much you know
the expected oil so we're going to
generate another controller and we'll
just call it download controller dot DNA
CS in here we'll do the same as this for
the most part copy and paste that paste
in will call this download controller
then we have we need to include the
valuables because we want to use them so
we just went to
like this once a Knicks that part paste
that in and it goes up two barrels
that's fine so now we can make use of
variables in here this will be the root
letter P default we don't care about
that we're going to set the root on each
action in here delete those call us
download controller and the root now
this is where we need the variable so
what we need in this root is basically
this is tell me you know what part of
the website would hit this requested
action so what you would type typically
is you know this and you'd have to
potentially copy and paste or you'd
maintain two copies of one thing say to
how this in your static front-end web
development usually and then you'd have
this back-end asp.net course I wave also
having this oil and then have you
changed it in one place and it didn't
change in the other you become out to
sink so by instead of doing that we can
now make use of DNA web and inject a
variable in the standard way so two
dollars and then the name of the
variable so we could do this once a
batch process will do first Aziz and we
took the ill batch process head and save
if we now look in here we're going to
download controller anything ejected our
actual ill so now it will point to when
we look for the download file it will
point to one so we'll call this
appropriate let's call it download batch
process and instead of returning a
beautiful route in a file and again here
this is the file name so if you want
intellisense you could do it in here you
know you can learn in visual studio and
then just simply apply it to your DNA
web page or you can even open up in you
know in here but basically you type can
file you can see you get the
intellisense so what we want is the path
to the file the content type but also
the file download name otherwise it
would be this has been the name the the
final parts would be no extension so we
want to return a file and we want it to
have the path to the file like the real
path which is in here so assets and then
there'll be a folder called file so i
just go to
download put files in go to source
assets paste them in I'll have files
they should appear in here now sometimes
we have to regenerate when we've added
files oh there we go it's in the middle
of doing it so oh yes just a bit slow so
we now have files and we've got the
files in here want so it's this is it
file I want to present so that would be
assets forward slash files for his life
batch process that's it like so then the
type would be application for a slash X
touch lip - compressed I believe and
then the name would be whatever you want
the download name to appear so we'd call
it by protest Ozzy and that's what we'd
want here so we were to remember you're
not meant to edit this file and
generated one we're just showing in
there go back to the the DNA CS file and
we pasted that in now you can see
there's our file so we could extract
this to a variable and use it in the
variables but I don't make use of this
anywhere else it's only ever used here
so I can leave that in as a you know
this can just be static because we don't
actually use it anywhere else but I
guess good practice would be you would
move this to a DNA variable and then
this would become you know the variable
name in here and that's how you do but
I'm not making use of that you know
these links anywhere else so for now
it's fine being there so that well while
I was to download the file so if I copy
and pasted that three times did the
other two links batch process guide and
what's the little solid work files I
believe then these change to batch
process doc PDF I think the file was
yeah and then SolidWorks files dot zip
the one thing we need to change on these
is the name at the end start be batch
process PDF
SolidWorks files that's it and this
would be application PDF for a PDF file
these would be new names download budget
process guide download side work files
every to save that now and then run then
reload that yes and run the website now
if we point to forward slash download
for its life budget process you should
save the file itself hopefully that has
the sonic photos download both left
batch process and there you can see is
now served the batch process zip file we
can try the budget process guide was it
quite precious - guide like that and it
serves a PDF so then if we go to the
SolidWorks page now our links that we
have in here like this one you're
clicking it in that work so it's a
functional work inside so you can go
through the whole side and this is what
I do and double check that any download
links actually work so there's a
download link and you can see that opens
up and gives us a file getting started
guide gives us a file that's all working
so it's how I've generated a file server
if you will so this is now a
nice-looking link download budget
process and it'll actually point to the
real file and assets which is there so
this site is now fully complete this is
ready for publishing so that's what
we're gonna do next so that's the site
done who can happily close that off save
that latch of saving a solution file
it's fine close that off close that off
a think for now I think we're done with
that I think we've done with DNA web
it's just clean things up close that
right so we're now done we've got the
generated output and we now want to
publish this site so the first thing we
need to do is to generate that website
now in a publishable format ready for
actually distrib
to a server so in your server root type
in CMD to open up a command line and
then in here type in dotnet publish the
runtime data is it's gonna run in my
case on a Windows 64 server so I'm win -
x64 could be x86 I believe or X 30 or
November which you can have Linux Linux
arm you can have alone exec 64 believe
all these are the dotnet call publish
runtimes so you can look for those
runtime IDs we're going to run on a
Windows 64 machine so it's window that
executes all configuration so instead of
it being in debug mode he wants it to be
in release mode and then - - outbox
almost all there we call the folder
publish compress end when you'll see
this or generator published folder here
in a minute
and there's the publish folder that's
now gone so what we have in this
published folder all this stuff here and
like all this and this and this and all
these AP is all the dll's that's
effectively the dotnet core framework so
this is all self-contained and and
runnable Weatherholt anything this is
effectively a package like a portable
package if you will you could put this
on a normal Windows 10 machine with
nothing installed or even a Windows 8
machine or you know whatever and in
order to now run your website you just
go to the name of the website which is
server routes and it's made in Exe so we
double click that Exe now it'll spin up
a command line I'll tell you now
listening on localhost call on 5,000 so
if we browse to that now and we type in
localhost 5,000 you should see this will
load our page just like we've had before
and everything's in here so we have the
whole website the download should still
work so we have all the download links
everything work so this is now running
and effectively the last step it seems
fairly small there's quite a lot of
steps involved but the last step in
essence is to simply put this on another
machine a server running in the cloud
and have it run this Exe
and then expose that port through the
internet to your domain name but we'll
do that whole set up and show you how it
goes so the first step doing that really
is to now buy a domain name so I've
signed in to my domain provider epic
domains and you buy a domain so just
search for you know buying a domain it's
nice and easy and then purchase one and
then you'll get some management anyway
you can manage your domains and then
here I'm managing angel 6 and then in
this specific website there's a you're
looking for this option manage DNS
basically so you manage the DNS of your
newly created website and you'll have a
bunch of records and these interface is
a little different but in essence you're
looking for aliens see names a bunch of
stuff like this if you've just bought
your domain I just personally delete all
the records so there's nothing in and
then I make a new record and it's down
here on effects domain so you click Add
and then you select the type and you
want an a record the hostess star and
you want it to point to the IP address
of your your surf at the place where you
going to host your website from so you
could host it from your own machine if
you want and if you wanted to do that
just go to Google type in what's my IP
and it will give you the IP T or you'll
route to your local network and you can
put that in here if you want once you've
got that point into the domain your
servers IP address which we'll go
through in a minute when we set up a
server you click Add then you'll add
another one a name and then stir the
star this time you got at and you point
it to the same IP and then what you'll
end up with those two records like this
that point to the domain they show you
the server so now when you go to angel 6
com
it will resolve so if we went to a
command line and to test that and we
tapped in pink angel 6 comm you can see
we have the matching IP address so now
all that's happened here is you've
brought the domain name and when they
type angel 6 comm it resolves some looks
for a website when you typed into the
browser of course it looks for a website
on port 80 or 443 that's on this IP
address
so that's step one Don that's kind of
your domain name set up so I log out to
that now and I'll log in to where I'm
gonna host mine or where I do host mine
is AWS from Amazon so as multiple places
you can host and all you really need is
somewhere where you can get a Windows
server that you can access you can
remote into and set up and play with iis
and stuff so the one I'm gonna use is
AWS so if you go to aws.amazon.com then
in the top you can either create an AWS
account or you can go my account which
i've got one and an AWS management
console so create an account if you
don't have one and then go to the
console and then sign in and then once
you're signed and you'll you'll come to
a page looking similar to this you click
services ec2 is what we want so we'll go
to ec2 then we'll go to instances and
this is server instances and you can see
I've got my server already running and
that's the IP address that I've got
that's what now preach to this server
but if you want to make one you click
Launch instance and then you'll be
presented with this page of multiple
options then you can select server 2016
base server with container server now
there's so many options so you can pick
one where they we need SQL Server then
you can go with you know one with SQL
Server it's all depends on what you want
it's basically a machine hosted in there
the cloud would have you will for you
all of these I believe come with iis as
a standard cuz the Windows Server so you
can really pick any option you want they
all come at a certain cost and you can
simply Google for you know if you're not
using this provider maybe you're using
Azure or somebody else the all other
pricing tier and it's based on how much
the usage is so how many times people
visit your sites how much you know CPU
usage that's a safe bet
I go with typically it's probably
windows so 2016 with SQL Server web so
click select C and then you've got these
options again more options and it's all
based on power and those descriptions
how many calls you've got how much
memory the machines got whether it's
optimized whether it's good for a
network performance what you really want
so you can scroll down again I typically
are with a moderates MDOT for Lodge so
you click that click Next or review and
launch to be honest from there we view
and launch then you can simply click
Launch at this point and that'll spin up
your your server once you've done that
you end up with this server here like
you know you'll end up with a server on
here that says running and you'll also
end up with the key thing you've got to
do is one you'll take the IP address and
you'll put it into the the domain
management's the DNS what we did a
minute ago I'd recommend to first click
elastic IPS and allocate you know making
you address basically so you just
allocate and you address your by one I
think it's a couple of dollars a month
or something and then you'd assign it to
you click actions and allocate address
and then you find this instance a start
an elastic IP is basically a static IP
so that means once you set this this
won't change otherwise by default this
could change it's unlikely but it could
but then you're cited go down and you'd
have to do like a no IP dynamic update
client or something to fix that issue
but to keep it simple I'd make sure your
IP is static you know so whatever
service you're using if it's AWS then
just make an elastic IP set your IP
address and your domain name so now this
points to this server the other
important thing is now we have this
you'll see down here the instance when
you click on it you have a security
group and you've got inbound rules so if
we click inbound rules or even better we
can go to security groups down here
click the group that we've created and
look at inbound at the bottom so you can
see these are all the firewall rules in
terms of not the firewall on the Windows
Server itself but the firewalls because
we're in this kind of set of this cloud
set up this network security group
handles what's allowed into your server
so the rules want to add our minimum you
want the port 80 open so that you can
access their website
click Edit on the inbound rules you
click add a rule and then in the
drop-down you've got some obvious ones
who got HTTP you click Add it adds port
8t and allows everybody through I've
already got that up there though so that
doesn't matter
you'd then add port 443 which is here
which is HTTPS but I don't think there's
a rule for HTTP HTTPS a click and it
opened 4 4 3 so that allows you to have
the website exposed on 4 for 3 as well
and then it all depends on what other
services you're using so I'm using other
things obviously so that's why there's
other things in here but in essence you
need to make sure you've got open port
80 and port 443 so that you can actually
you know expose websites from this
server and you'll also notice we have
port 3 3 8 9 open and this is something
you should do when suni who set up your
server now what you should not allow is
this is remote desktop so I can now go
and type remote desktop connection and
then spin up this and type angel 6 calm
and right now you could do this you went
by the video but and the videos aren't
you can't but this is how it's been up
by default you can now click enter and
anybody can try and remote into my
machine if you will my AWS server and
then just keep guessing passwords and
trying to you know hack into the account
of your well so what you should do
instead if you've already added RDP if
not then you want to add it you need to
get into the machine so you have to add
RDP and then it set this all off which
what you want to do but instead of
having the RDP on a set you know allow
everywhere if you will you want it on a
specific IP so what you can do in here
is change you from custom to my IP and
then that'll just be the same thing so
you can delete the second one so then
this is now going to block it to
specifically my IP M so nobody else can
remote in so only this machine in this
network I'm on can now try and remote
into my server and that's a protection
you will need because people will try
and get into your site so that's mainly
for the RDP you don't do it for the
so the website otherwise you know nobody
can access your website other than you
so that's opening the ports that's all
that done and now what you can do is as
I mentioned you can actually connect to
this server so if you it depends on your
setup again by AWS tends to use public
and private keys that you would have
been requested during the creation of
your server it would have asked you to
generating you public and private key
pair and that's how you log in so I
won't do that on screen because
obviously the security issue but it's
part of the simple setup process then
you click connect and then it would tell
you you can either download remote file
or instead you can just go into the
Start menu tap remote desktop connection
and it opens up this remote desktop
connection for you and then if you say
got your private key on this machine you
click get password upload the private
key and it'll generate your password and
then the default user name is
administrator on these so you click
connect to angel 6 comm or you know your
website if it's not set up as
administrator you click more choices use
a different account and now you type in
administrator if you spell it right and
then you're putting your long secure
password and at that point you'll remote
into the machine so with this done I'll
just log out of this and I'll have to
obviously blur all the private info on
all these pages but hopefully that's
enough knowledge that you can do this
and repeat this yourself as I mentioned
there's so many ways of where you can
buy a domain where you can host a server
so I can't really cover every known
Avenue but the basic principle is you
need a Windows machine that you can
remote desktop into so you can connect
to a is and set up stuff and then you
want the IP to that machine to be public
and static and then when you buy the
domain you want the to a records one
star and the other that's at and that
both point to this IP address so now
naturally when you try and resolve that
IP call that domain angel six com
it will point to the server and then the
server has the inbound rules set up to
allow RTP and port 80 and port 4 for 3
to 4 the website so that's all that
don't I'll just log out to that
and now we can Remote Desktop into this
machine so now we're remoted into angel
6 comm my actual server if you will
so again if your setup this with AWS you
should pretty much see this exact thing
then you should have by default I is
installed so you can open the Start menu
entire pie is and hopefully you've got a
is installed if not just install it just
Google how to install is but if you've
installed Windows server money it's like
Windows Server you should almost
definitely have is it's that I'll give
you basically a server with nothing in
you'll have no no website or anything
yet
which is fine first step open up your
internet on that machine go to Microsoft
com4 slash net forward slash download
for slash all go to the ladies for the
town isn't the previous alright now it's
two point 0.5 scroll down to Windows and
I'm on a windows 64-bit machine which
I'm pretty sure everybody will be so you
want to install the 64-bit asp.net core
runtime installer so click to download
that save that runtime package and
install and then also just as
importantly make sure you download this
server hosting installer and this is
what allows I I asked to host asp.net
core websites so install both of those
once you've installed those right click
on your server in is click stop and then
once it's stopped right click and click
start and that will basically allow the
server hosting to integrate into is
properly the next is to also make sure
this machine itself we go to the
firewall you go to the Windows Firewall
and again I won't for security reasons
but go to inbound rules and then click
Add rule and then allow ports TCP UDP
and allow port ATM for for 3 to be
inbound so that allows websites to you
know come into your machine and now we
just need to create a place to host the
website so for now I'll give you an
example on the desktop you'll see
websites and this folder now is where we
will open off
and then we'll take this will copy our
published folder here the exact publish
folder copy this paste it into the
Windows Server this is now going to copy
over so I'll just pause the video well
this copies over and then resume just
before it finishes okay while we're
waiting for this to finish copying over
let yours copy over but I'm gonna make
the presumption that this is done and I
can kind of show you what to start doing
in the web server in the is manager so
perfuming that's all done and that's
over in your is manager right click on
sites and click add a website and site
name now I'm gonna call this angel 6 I'm
not going to release directly to the
contained your six sites I'm gonna call
it end or six dev the physical path now
you browse and your point to the actual
website and the publish folder whatever
you want to call it that's the one we
just copied over that's still copying
but that's the one you point it to that
you want to HTTP bound delete all that
fine if you were to leave this blank it
will always default to any website no
matter what you don't mean it as so
whether your domains angel six or rusty
calm or anything it doesn't really
matter where every points to this would
happily serve if you want this to only
ever reply if the domain it's coming
from is your actual domain name then you
tap in here which is what I recommend so
we typically this was my main site at a
page or six comm and I'd add this then
we'll add another binding afterwards to
also then be www-what a lot of people
miss off and that's why sometimes web
sites don't work with or without the WW
in front and so we'll do because this
though is not going to be just angel
search com we want it to be a
development site will do a few things
one is we'll first log back into our
domain provider so let me just do that
now and we're back in the management
domain of angel six calm now because I
want to type in dev dot Angel six calm
I want to add a cname you can see I've
got C names here for other things so
I've got one already I needed to see
named dev dev and then he's putting into
ass so what to do for that is click Add
change the type from A to C name the
host would be the short you know the
thing before dot in your yeah
angel six calm so this would be dev
Diagnostics calm I'm for you so you can
just do act and that basically refers to
the IP address that we've already got
set up with the name ah
so it basically points to the same thing
it does nothing but now angel six calm
and dev angel six calm we'll both cling
to that server so you want to see name
the prefix and then you know that bit
there it's that's that bit done so now
I'll just go back to the server and in
here we'll type dev angel six calm and
that's the only one we need we don't
need dev and www because obviously it's
not the one time you do need both is
like say when it's your actual main
domain so if you want angel six calm to
point to this website you'd have to add
the angel six calm and then you'd also
have tried the www.h or six calm
afterwards but because we're going to
dev specifically this exact title dev
branch calm we just add it once start
website immediately and then we click OK
sparing to port 80 so HTTP at the minute
and so we just want to let this finish
now which it's got about a minute left
it reckons so as soon as this bits
finished we'll we'll click start and
then this side should effectively it
should work
straight away and then obviously if we
were going to do HTTP which we're not
right now then we just bind it without
another binding and click HTTP same
setup just change that to HTTPS and bind
to that as well and then on till you'd
have to install your SSL certificate
which is fairly you know beyond this
video simply publishing to a server for
now but we will do that in future with
the peseta word server so 60 seconds
left one thing we like to do as well
because we are pointing this
that's websites this folder either this
folder itself the actual shouldn't
double-click that I won't open the list
on either this folder itself or the
published folder or the websites fallout
the host folder real we need to add
security to it so that I is the is use
of the thing that's hosting this website
can actually access the website but I'm
not gonna do that yet I want to show you
the area yet that you might get if you
forget this step and then you know you
know that that makes sense that the
reason it's got that issue is because
you forgot to do a certain step so there
should be done 10 seconds any second now
last bit of JavaScript and this took a
while because I was copying a hundred
and sixty Meg installer file as well as
the website so that's why it's taking a
little while that's now apparently done
f5 to refresh we see nothing there we go
so we've got the publish folder we got
the website first thing you can do is on
the machine before we put into is is to
make sure you installed those server
hosting and the ASP asp.net runtimes as
double click the exe on this machine and
it should successfully run and then you
can also check your website's copied
over correctly by then going to though
you know the website on this server and
actually trying to access that website
just to make sure that the copies worked
that everything's moved over that
effectively the site is good before we
move it why is because if you get an
issue you want to know if it's either
IAS or the website so this stage is
important to check your published copied
files over make sure that they're
working there's the website up and
running so that's cool so we're happy
that the the publish folder is a valid
asp.net core website so we'll leave that
for now we'll come back to the security
in a minute we've set this all off we
click OK now it's created in your six
dev now if we go to application pool you
can see it's made in your six dev what
you do want to change though is you
double click the runtime is not managed
because it's dotnet core so
click this runtime change it to no
manage code click ok and then there's
now your website so is the angel six dev
we click bindings and you'll see the one
we just made so this is where you then
add your additional if you wanted to add
HTTP actually do it here if you wanted
to add the www dot if it was the host
one like this you'd add it now or if you
added the one without you dad you know
the one with whichever way around you'd
add your multiple bindings then you can
now click browse and you can click this
browse button and it will actually
browse to the adapter in your sitcom
which should now be this site we should
get an error though of I think 500 they
go so this is working because this is
this points to the server's IP address
on your sitcom so devs pointing to it
the reason you get this 500 over though
there's many reasons you get it but the
reason we've got it here from a fresh
install and a fresh build is that I is
and specifically the application pool
identity this user those trainers you
know that is run in this website doesn't
have permission to access this folder so
either right-click on the published or
what I'm recommend itself is right-click
on your top level websites that is will
host go to security go to edit add and
then in here type I is underscore I you
SRS and press ok and that's the use of
that user is basically this application
pool identity and then I allow it to
have full control of the websites folder
because that's what this you know
identity should be doing and click OK
and now you don't always have to restart
the website so if we simply went to the
website and clicked here it should now
hopefully spin up taking its time which
is good which means it's likely spinning
up the website itself and there's the
saxes is now dead dangerous XCOM so we
try this on our actual machine you know
like come out of the server and go on to
a normal computer now
and type def dangerous XCOM you can see
there we go we know of a live site this
is now my site live and ready to go so I
can go to SolidWorks let's make sure the
downloads work there we go yep and
there's the files so it looks like now
the website is fully functional so
that's the whole real the whole setup of
how you do this and then say we now
wanted to I was happy with this website
and I want it to go live I can go to my
main website angel 6 then you click the
basic settings and then you just simply
change the physical path to point to
this folder and that would redirect the
website to this folder which is what
I'll do after this video so the website
does go live but that's that's in
essence how you take a static HTML page
rather way through to owning a domain
name having a server running and hosting
the whole website so this is now a fully
published and running website as I
mentioned that there are a lot of
variations in this whole process there's
so many ways you can host it there's so
many people you can use this thus
firewalls as you know there's all kinds
of situations
I'll help everyone as much as possible
if they use alternate you know things
that they don't use AWS or you know they
want to do it a different way I can
certainly try and help but hopefully
this video has been detailed enough to
follow through you know the set
procedure of taking static pages to an
asp.net core website then publish into a
folder that's then a runnable website
but then the intention to basically host
that publish folder on a server linked
in with the domain name and then
ultimately chucking it in is so this is
like I said we've we've done a lot in
one video there and there's a lot of
variation so there's likely gonna be a
lot of questions but hopefully it was
useful again if you like what I'm doing
I do have a patreon page
patreon.com/lenguin
you know so if you want to support what
I'm doing it be quietly appreciated and
as usual any comments or questions
simply leave them in the video and I'll
get back to you but hopefully this was a
useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
