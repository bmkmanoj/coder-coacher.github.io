the changing of pages and the
application so one of the main things is
now people are developing different
applications or they're simply following
that along and we want to see how when
we click these and other page loads and
how we go about you know kind of doing
that that's what this video is going to
cover before we get started with all
sort of few comments about people
mentioning the updates to the window
resize are now using the DPI scale
variable which is this thing is in
system got windows so basically in the
presentation called WPF but you need
dotnet framework for point six point two
so in your project properties you should
have a target framework of four point
six point two at least if not and it's a
simple case of googling for install.net
framework four point six point two and
make sure you're on Visual Studio 2017
as well so if you're getting any issues
with you know the window resize are not
finding that variable that's all you
need to do there moving on to this chat
list them to start in the chat list item
control and we'll start by adding first
a binding for when you actually click to
do something so we'll go to the
top-level border which is hosting the
whole content will add to the border
here some input binding or not there we
go order that input bindings another
like a mouth binding where a mouse
action of the left click and the command
will bind to open message none
now opportunity to add this open message
command so for that we go to item shop
item list that list item it will be the
chat list item view model then in here
we will have now protected region these
off now we'll make a public ID command
and with all that open message command
open the linked message thread make a
constructor which seems to have lost my
custom constructor I've updated Visual
Studio that's why so we did actually add
it the the seat or command previously so
this will automatically other region and
a default and comments and everything
and that's been lost since the updates
have to re-add that the next video and
then create commands be a relay command
at before open message
so this is all standard stuff about just
creating a command so if you unfamiliar
about what we're doing here in terms of
simply making a command this is all
covered in previous videos and then in
here now we should get a we put
breakpoint iam run we should hit this
command when we click any item so that
gets us the first step of the way which
is to simply handle this click command
so now we click here we want to
basically load this chat which were in
this chat here the chat list item view
model so this chat is awesome you click
if we've hovered over the message you
can see we've now got this is the
details about the message you know the
whole message thread so we don't have it
in here now but when we bind it to a
real server we'd have like it you know a
a message thread ID which is the ID to
the you know the whole thread of
messages not just this one
so that'll get added in future book for
whatever you need to do now you know
you've got that item and we want to now
go to go to the page you know the chat
page but load specifically something to
do with this so start with the IOC
application go to page as normal time to
go to the chat page as normal and now he
want to override you want to be able to
pass in and playing you to be a chat
message list view model and then there
will have the items and will be a new
list and in here so we're just making
dummy data obviously here because we
don't have a real server for the MINIX
but we're just going to populate this
with say the message to this equals the
message of this so you know the message
of this acting the first item will equal
this message to the actual the real
message in this list so at least it's in
some way relevant let's populate these
with again any information we have sent
time we can do in a date time now send
the name
ProPublica RGB will do that string so we
will do it on red or are you be reading
the little purple send a name look Clem
by me sure that's send by me copy-paste
a few of these in so next one is not
sent by me and the message is a AC
message just make it slightly different
this one will be read and just run all
come from power now copy and paste that
again and then copy and paste a whole
lot so there's got some dummy data but
with the messages sent by us will will
match the messages we received just so
we can visibly see you know the messages
relating in some way to the page we
clicked this now is complaining because
obviously we don't have a view model so
we need to now pass in a base view model
into here that we then want to pass into
the page now you can see here the go to
page all we're doing a simple accepting
the current page of the view model which
is correct us what we want to do you
know you want to stick with the view
model binding so if we're going to do
that in order to now pass in a few model
we need another property so we'll need a
base view model let's be the current a
view model yes the view model we used
for the front page when just a just told
us when the
boom please changes so also bring note
here this is not a live to great view
model and at attack of the third page
and just simply use to set review model
on the front page of the time it changes
so it's a big note that basically we set
this then we change the page and then
wherever we bound the page changes in
the page host we know that we can read
the expected view model so in order to
do that we don't want to force this go
to page to user view model ever so let's
do know let's also add the program for
the view model in normal and and
complete the new page so we need to set
the current view model first otherwise
the page or change before and it will
never get updated then we'll update the
current page and because we will be
going from effectively inside of chat as
we are clicking through the page that
click into the chat messages we're still
in the chat page so this is constantly
the same page if you will it's not
updating so will forcefully fire a
change page event in case the view
models changed and we simply want to
react to the view model changing and not
just the current page so we will do on
property changed and manually fire off
you know Nevada to say that the property
has changed so that will cause any you
know view model by means to update
so I guess is the go-to page what's next
and we will now need to go to page host
I guess or come next so in page host we
are I didn't show it that and main page
main window page show so in the main
window the page host we bind to that
I've got a blank data context I think I
was to fix a bug before so we've got the
current page being bound right now to
the application view model current page
so we need to pass in now or need to do
two things we need the view model as
well for this page host because now it
needs to handle a view model and we'll
probably yeah we'll see for a start with
that so let's change the or rather let's
add to the page host so in dependency
properties let's add another dependency
property this time it will be a base
view model and we call current age be
Malter you know match there the naming
we've done on the other one that's that
type then we'll have current page view
model properties update them register
current page view model too
bass that's fine that's fine needs to be
dated current page view model we don't
really care of the view models changed
so make a blank new one there so this is
just another this is dependency property
now of type base view model called
current page view model that we can now
bind to so we go back here let's change
this binding so let's just delete that
and start again
cuz you dope on the data context stuff
anymore we want the current page now
have the same by an input directly so as
application view model dot from page and
the source is static local new model
located up insulins that's it and I
think I said thing that's all we need
there and it would copy and paste that
again and now we could have current page
view model that we can do the same thing
that this time from page view model on
the application view model so now we've
got two bindings hopefully that will
bind to the page host so when we get to
inside here we should now be able to
capture and the the page value actually
we can even build
so now we've got nothing there
so we'll fix that in a minute and no
event firing so I think what it is is
because this is a dependency property of
itself even though we changed the
application view model to tell it that
the current page is changed which will
then change the binding of this so this
will get changed our dependency property
here that fires the event is only firing
on if the value is changed while chat
page to chat page is interchange so we
want to simply due north at North alas
and then there we go get to this coerce
value callback so making new co s value
callback so it needs a object basically
so we then passed two nulls and this
this now becomes a coerced one which
means it gets fired whenever the value
changes even if it's the same value we
have to change this to object to be if
the value and need to return an object
because the point of coerce is to
actually you know tweak the value as
needed so the bottom of this will simply
return value I think I should be okay
now there yeah so this should fire now
regardless of if the chat page at the
same this Y dot new value so let's get
let's get the values here now so we
don't need to use the you know the event
that was passed in because we've got the
dependency object so we can simply get
the dependency properties so get from
values so far current page equals D dot
and get value and then you pass in the
dependency property current page
property from page
new model is same with VMO and then
finally here we can set the new page the
current page so let's see it first if we
now get this event by of to get the
event current pages no view models no
okay
and now when we click we get an event
current page is still no you might have
still not so we're actually getting
nothing right now
so the binding is and some way messed up
and I know why I think the binding is
the current page not converting it
anymore so this is current page is now
application page not a base page as also
I'm thinking about that change that from
no - well Nationals phone I was going to
change the default value of each thing
and value out there so change the note
the default value for the default value
of the type of property and they're just
so it's it's a bit more correct and now
it's expecting a type thereof
application page as well so it just
changes the type of this dependence
across the application page because
that's what it is and in fact then we'll
probably have to update these the value
said there we go so now we've got chat
now we're going to know that's now going
to try and set the contact to an enum
just knock rushing but oh yeah so that's
now an enum so we need to reconvert that
to a page now is that chat we still
don't have a view model though so
there's still something going on with a
view model and did we not set the view
model yet and we set the view model so
let's see if we did set the view model
and click go to page
come view model which is there so we
have a view model current page view
model is it so it's there and so there
must be something going on with the
binding for this current page view model
now let's go to page host and not the
page host is the main window isn't it so
current page view model current a view
model okay that should be bound
perfectly fine application view model
current page view model current page
view model so there should be no issues
there
such should rty that is not getting it
current page view model okay let's just
say just make it a chat let's view model
by default and that should then pull in
that so either way the first run should
have the value so current paid for your
model property something is going wrong
here current page view model ah we never
change the type there that's why I hate
dependency properties too many of the
same value repeated so that should now
fix that
and we've got no and then we click get
the value in OLAP sets and now we've got
the value that's correct so let's just
remove that test I did where I stuck it
to a default value from where where did
I do that there's that can go and
imagine where were we
so we have
we have a page that we need to fix the
converter we have a go-to page now that
fires every time and sets a few model
and we do have they say this this
function is being called every time and
we also get the view model that's passed
in so if we click that we've now got the
view model and the page we also need to
do is is use those values um right so
where to start we've got those two
values let's fix this so now this will
be you need to take the current page we
need to do the new application page
value converter convert and the value is
front page and I think what we'll change
this from a value converter now but for
now let's just pass it in parameter it
was going to be current page few models
so this won't stay as a value converter
in a minute but I'm just using it to
test that should at least then go to the
convert function get a page and simply
do what it originally did and then the
parameter will now be the view model
that we can then pass in so we go out
that back that's now loading but the
data is the same so let's just take a
quick look at the normal is it chat
message number area chat message list
control Oh data context is set instead
of design data context that's because we
have no data to show until now and now
we're generating some so by default no
page is loaded and then we click and
page is loaded but we still don't have
any items so step up further this is so
we know it was
so another data context is in the chat
message list control so where do we use
that we have the chat message less
control being used here so do we just
need to do the data context people to
binding because this chat page already
has their the list nope right so I guess
the first thing is to check we actually
have items in the list which is in Ohio
we know a passive view model I would
that was where we've got two so we get
into here another chat page we need to
pass in a view model so again like all
of the pages we have a base page and the
base page simply by default I think if
not we'll do it so by default it creates
in UVM so instead of a new VM or first
changes up to iOS you get VM and that
was simply now check if there's any
static values any static view models
that we've bound to IOC it will use that
if not this get will simply create a new
instance of that so it's exactly the
same this just means if we were to then
do is see bind or ioc kernel bind and
bind a view model like we do with the
application view model so
or like UI manager Randy we do it there
we are so in the biome view model these
these static ones would get found
so we bound the settings page to a
settings view model it will use the same
instance every time now but then in
addition to this we want to pass in base
page as a user control so we now want to
have a base view model which can be over
in which means the view model which is a
VM which is here and we want in base
page we can't do it in a generic now
let's leave it out there
so base page just does that then we'll
simply have the specific pages
overriding or shall we do in here now
we'll do in here so we put our back in
base view model now what I'm doing here
because we don't know the type yet or
yeah we do going back and forth here so
VM area so we want to be able to pass in
a view model optionally and then we will
now around that someplace to do it the
specific glue model to use if any so now
be passing a view mol so then if your
model isn't if you know your model to
equals the lowercase P mold so be very
careful whether open also there so we'll
probably rename that to specific view
model so we don't get confused so the
specific view models passed in we set
the view mode to that version
otherwise we create a default one so now
we can pass into the base page a
specific view model then we'll bubble
back up to a chat page and in here we
will have shaft messy so let's queue
model specific view model I will pass
that into the base so now we can pass in
a specific view model to the chat page
and so we want to do that and wherever
we do that if I can remember it's the
value converter isn't in the convert so
now finally here we should be able to
pass in a view model so now we want to
pass in the parameter as a shot merciful
if screen mode and that as we'll simply
return null of it isn't that type anyway
so the parameter was a different type it
would simply be no so now everyone I
think the chat page should be bound to
that view model base page what's the
problem
base page cannot have a name attribute
values are without default constructor
act so we also need we can't do the we
can do this let me just need to be novel
hopefully nope okay so we're gonna have
to do to two constructors because WPF
doesn't like UI with without inaudible
constructor so we simply keep the
original and we make an overloaded one
so make sense
we simply up to two ways to initialize
now have two complaining about now it's
cool we're not using to move that out
the way then so critics Clause not
defined so it's not using it now it
needs it
those page cannot have a name attribute
the value implants without a default
constructor can be used as items within
a resource dictionary I think this is oh
I know why it's the underlying base page
calendar is what the issue is the the
generic base page has for the same thing
so we need two constructors that one is
just the constructor as is which then
simply does that otherwise the specific
one does the logic again so constructor
with specific view model so now we
should have the two so you just have to
be careful with user controls that they
like to have that you probably need a
way to simply instant ate there the view
for this design time so we run this we
should now have a chat page that loads
and default is nothing but if we click
here hopefully still not we should have
that bound now so I'm sure that will be
bound well that does go to here to
convert the chat page I'm sure we'll get
here and this will have the property I'm
sure of it so parameter now is no
because we don't have one at first but
we click here we have the parameters
chat message less view model so we step
in step into that a specific view model
didn't do the nor the view model oops
helps we do the logic right
mister else sir is getting reset so
specific review model gets set there
otherwise it doesn't get set and well
it's not third time lucky about
twentieth time lucky we should now see
the specific few models load there we go
so you can see now so this chat chat app
is awesome here which shows here and
then we put those two receives and
repeated it and two receives we've got a
scroll issue here it should scroll to
the bottom we're also missing a scroll
bar so that's for another video but now
you can see if I click say the new
server it loads the new serve result and
also clicking the same one loads the
animation is not right there that looks
like this page is going out and coming
in just quickly check out unload page
it's a call and pages base page page
animation unload page animation animate
out slide and fade out to left fading to
the rack so a typo there so now the page
should swipe out that way there we go so
now the previous page slides this way in
the other page slides in Mikey did
before so now that the animation we've
also got an entire page loading though
so we don't want the entire page reloads
I mean that you might want to so this is
now loading new pages so we could add
say if it was a second item load the
login page to kinda show you now the
logic so it's just close all these
windows and start fresh so we have the
chat message item chat message list item
view model
on earth or to use on another shop
catalyst item you model in the open
message so here you could simply say so
now if if I'm just run this up and see
visually if name is Jessie then we'll do
so if your name and you shouldn't
compare strings like this and it's being
lazy should use string dot equals four
simply return and we would say I have
seen a platoon of go to page login page
so if we click Jessie we'll go to login
page and the others will load the chat
page so you can see that it's loading
pages so there's loading pages click
Jessie and it loads the login page they
can go back in so anything with Jessie
so that one or that one will take us to
the login page so this is now loading
different pages based on you know
clicking these items and also based on
the content in those items so that's the
I guess the main point of what we wanted
in this video was how we load these so
we'll go one step further there's now
the scroll issue we need to fix and the
scroll bar is run out to scroll to the
bottom we also want some animation going
on so that message is fading they don't
just glyph like this but all that again
I'll do in a separate video I'll try and
split them up and do in other videos but
the one thing I least do now is if
you're in the chat page you don't want
the whole chat page to be recreated
every time you clicking like this so I
know that's an animation but still the
whole page itself has been recreated and
this is a heavy page you don't want this
to be recreating so let's have a little
bit more logic that checks if the and
also that we need to fix
so that's another note to fix that that
is not hidden by default anymore so
something else is slightly tweaked with
the animation we'll fix that in the next
video we'll do a better cleaner so yeah
we'll do some logic those states if the
page is the same what the view models
different simply load the reload the
view model you know set the view model
so we'll do that in the go to page so we
go to the go to page in here view model
is there then we will want you want to
set the current page view model anyway
but if the the current page equals the
page will about to go to thing this is
where I will do it then drift updated
view model otherwise with caviar and do
what we're going to do that will then
want to be well if the page doesn't
change the side menu visibility won't
change either so we don't need to worry
about that but there so if the current
page is the same then just update a view
model so for that now we want to do
access is the wrong place to do it
because we are just updating you know we
do is set in that it's in the page host
the thing that's actually going to be
doing the change over of pages so in
here in the current page property
changed
we got the current page got the view
model then we get the frames we
basically move the current page to the
old page and we animate that out then we
set the new page so the logic is going
to change now that if we have the same
view model so same as what we just did
if only what if front page hasn't
changed
just update the view model so if current
page equals and the current page needs
to be application page to the top is so
if the current page equals the I guess
the actual current page the value past n
rather then you know the new one that's
about to be set then just from data view
model and return the value otherwise
this will carry on and do the whole
animation and change content and stuff
but basically of the if the current
pages change we need to update the
frames view model so in that case we
need to move that above the we also need
the content so it's basically new framed
up content so we want now on it update
the new frames of content is and also
the content should be so if the current
page is the same and new frame of
content is a get set to a base page so
is base page page otherwise we don't
have a base page in the first place
doesn't matter the page is the same we
need to actually you'll create a page in
the first place so if the page is the
same like a chat page and we also have
the page now we update the page use of
view model and this is where I'll have
another issue because the base page it
doesn't have a view model it's the
generic base page let me just collapse
those so we can see a bit easier
so the base page doesn't have a view
model we put the view model in here so
we need to tweak that a little bit now
because we need this view model from the
generic base page to go into the
non-generic and class so you have to
change your VM to objects got no other
choice we simply don't know what it is
we'll call this view model objects so as
not to break other things and mmm do we
want that logic in there again so we
also want to move them this so there's
no private member there now move this
view model VM into this class this
changes two objects as well and now we
have the same thing it's just there's no
longer a specific tab it's an object so
now we want to get back that specific
type so we have nice intelligence again
so in that case we can now go to the
generic public properties here and we
just make another one we basically we
create the one we had which is VM and
called view model and now they get it is
the view model object casts to VM
because we know it has that anyway and
the setter set the view model objects to
the value the view model but let's get
the same so here with this page okay so
the view model associated a
photographer's page so now we
access that the view model from the base
class simply as an object and then all
we do when we set a specific type is in
generic classes we simply then cast the
view model to that known time because we
know it's going to be that type but now
we get the benefit of being able to
change the page in the page host here
now so now we can get the view model
object at least to set it so now the
view model object equals and finally the
view model itself which is their current
page view model I think right so let's
put a breakpoint there to make sure we
hit it the first load this would be
nothing so they shouldn't hit because
there is no Molly might hit but we not
there we go so nothing to hit but now we
click this it detected that the current
page is chat and we're trying to go to
charts it's the same and we also already
have the page created chat page and
right now the view model of that page is
I'm guessing no so well I'll be the data
contacts front on the page so data
context it's not know but the items and
also there's no items so now we update
it with the past m1 which should have
the six items so now we see the message
but now when we click all the pages
because you now just the messages load
we don't reload the whole page but we've
also got no animation there but again
well we'll we add animation but now we
have two things so we have when we're
clicking here we're simply finding that
the active pages is the chat and we'll
be loading and re-injecting and not
reloading the full page simply updating
the view model so this will work with
any page now that you want to pass in a
view model you just have to specify in
the value converter which will change
again I'll split that up into it I'll do
a quick video clean up after this one
you just have to pass in this to each
page now of the type that you expecting
to to pass in
and then when you do the the changing of
the page so if we do go to page like
here where we know specifically want to
go to a page we simply pass in the view
model so the chart and then the specific
view mat wuts all we have to do so you
can download any page you want with go
to page and if you want to pass in a
specific view model you simply do that
now and then just make sure that the
value converter also passes in you know
the same view model so the register page
is by default bound to a register view
model so you would pass in in this case
parameter as register view model the
login would be parameter as login view
model then you go to that page
constructor and you do the same thing
you'd have multiple constructors so with
that that off and then that's going to
be the constructor with specific view
model and then here you would have again
view model it's a big view model and you
pass it down to the base and that's how
you would now create your pages you know
to pass in specific view models so the
same for the register page and go to the
register page code behind and you would
pass in register page with register view
model and then I think on this the map
your way to even on their parts the
simplest way because you have to
redefine constructors when you make a
higher class otherwise you can't pass
the value in so that's that's the surety
she'll get it but that's
that's not a lot of work and then in
this logic you simply then pass it in so
now we could pass in a view model to you
know the login view model whenever we
want to go to that page and pre fill it
with specifics so we went to we might as
well do that to show again go into here
so now instead of just going to a login
page from Jessie we will go to a login
page that's got the email or the email
prefilled out to Jessie at hello world
calm and now we click on the Jesse icon
it should take you back to the login
page will pre-fill it with that email so
we now have whatever data objects that
log in to chat list view model oops why
is it chalice view model go to page and
where is the cool stuff on monocle stuck
at base page VM your model given all
objects login view model get remember
the class type logging able to chat last
few model why is it trying to cast to
chat last few model we have readin that
somewhere we've got a binding it was
specifically expecting a certain title
so getting over this it's the view model
it's a login view model base page so the
base page is currently that okay so I
think what we're doing here is because
we are setting the view model in fact
why would it we go to page we come
through
I'm guessing it's when we set it here
yes it's not what we set it there so now
it's when we change the current page so
it's not when we change the current page
so in the page host then on hand we hit
here so current page login is that which
it isn't so we should why is that same
we our current pages login the value
we're not already on the login page of
strange okay so something's it's saying
we are on oh so that isn't the real
value this check is wrong then this
current page will getting the value of
the binding which has already been
updated so we can't use this binding we
need to use and the real frame so we
need to flip this around so first let's
check we have a page then if we do we
need to check the pages ah yeah this can
be a bit awkward we don't have any we
could do with previous page we'd have to
update this too okay so in order to
detect that first or correctly we might
as well now improve this application
value converter thing so this is no
longer going to be a converter this will
simply go away this will be calm
application page helpers it's going to
be a static class we will rename the
class the file to the same name of the
class and converts the application rate
to an actual view pace of the
description still the same we now just
have public static and we want a base
page we want to pass in an application
page and that is it so we get the page
but we also expect a view model so we
need to pass in the base or in this case
a VM M view model is not or is rather
default of the M we should stop
correcting form so the converse is going
to pass in VM and now we switch on the
page and we've already have the V model
of the expected type so we're going to I
can't do that anyway so
well the cap we can simply still cast it
it's just that would kind of double cast
in there so at any point in VM there no
there isn't
so remove that that just becomes object
that's the view model what you know so
fix a application page and a view model
if any and creates the desired page get
rid of that and you'll see why I'm doing
all this in a moment so that does
nothing different we now just have a way
to call convert directly on application
page so let's fix all the broken parts
for that first so now we have this we
will simply comment out the moment and
come back to
this application page new base page bla
bla bla that now will change is to
simply forum page convert and we don't
have in any blue model so we want to
rename that now to convert or rather
name divert run through to page or to
base page so it's you know it did a base
page or specific type I know we use it
twice at least and then this part here
will become current page dot to base
page and we pass in the current view
model so that's just simply changed it
from a value converter to a helper
function so now we just need to figure
out what the current page is so we can
either do that by storing it on the base
page you know of a link in a base page
to a an enum or what's better is to
simply cast the opposite way so now we
want to help her on the reverse side so
we want a public static confirmation
page ah this is from base page or rather
this will be called on the application
page anyway so that'll be two location
page and we expect this past end to be a
base page at still page and this will be
convert a base page to the specific
application page that is for that type
of page so it's kind of a reverse role
that we take in you know a base page or
rather can't really do a switch on the
base page well I think it can but I
can't think of the syntax on it
case page and that page is chat page
something that's under the C sharp 7
statement now that we might built it is
so we'll drop that down to EPS so for
now if pages chat page return chat a
page is a login page
it's a login page is register page this
is kind of creaking that a link between
the enums
and the expected return types so we get
here we want to alert developer convert
or find application page that matches
and the base page now I can't do that so
application page or in this case at with
default application page so now we can
call to application page on the new
frame so it is a base page enter page
then we can do two application page if
that equals the front page that we want
to go to then we update the view model
so we know it matches them and we know
we're setting a view model to the
correct type so now if we have this page
they load if we now go to Jessie should
load the home page with Jessie's email
and there we go then I'll log in then I
think we have a logout in the settings
page as well that'll take us to a clean
view model with no email we have a chat
that'll then take us to a specific one
so hopefully this has now got enough
information to show you how to load
different pages from menus and also to
passing specific view models in the next
video we'll clean up all this all these
little issues that are like the hover on
here and the scroll bar missing and
we'll do some fade in animations but
hopefully now this has been a one of
those videos everybody's been waiting
for it should be useful on how to do
page navigation and again we'll probably
clean this up more as time goes on but
that's now our our base structure of
navigating between the application
loading just view models of the page is
the same and loading specific pages with
predefined info any comments again I'll
leave them in the video and I'll get
back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
