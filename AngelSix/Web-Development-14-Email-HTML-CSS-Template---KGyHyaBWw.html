register function of the peseta world
server and we can now register accounts
next step we need to do is be able to
verify the email addresses so what we
need to do first is make a well we don't
have to but what we're gonna do is make
a nice HTML style email to send out to
the users so we're gonna make something
like this and just whip this off in
Photoshop so we can design something
like this so obviously what we're gonna
do here is make HTML CSS web page if you
will that's going to then get sent via
email as a HTML email so to make this in
normal web using normal CSS is actually
super easy there's no issue whatsoever
to do this however what you will find
and it's kind of disappointing is that
when you make HTML for emails you're
going back to the 1990s and I mean that
literally there's almost no support for
anything in email HTML universally so if
you want to write an email that will
look very similar to this across all
email clients then you're extremely
limited and the way you actually design
the HTML and CSS becomes messy and quite
you know cumbersome because you can
imagine that's what it was like
designing emails no 28 years ago so
we're gonna start with this but it's
kind of a disclaimer that the CSS and
HTML were using for this specific HTML
email page is very very specific to
emails only and that we would obviously
make it a lot nicer and a lot cleaner if
it was just a website so this is what
we're gonna be working off we want to
make a web page looking like this so
we'll use DNA web because we can't so
we'll call this a email I've got plenty
videos on using DNA web not you can just
type the HTML directly there's gonna be
nothing special being done here with DNA
I'm just using it as a
um just a tool basically to make it
easier for us to work with so we've
typed in DNA web we've got DNA web
installed from DNA web to i/o and then
you just go into the folder and type DNA
web here and it starts off now it
started off run at our new template DNA
up blank let's just get it a blank
template going it opens up this visual
studio code window if you have the code
window and then it also opens up the
page we're just gonna invert that from
the moment just to prevent your eyes
from burning we'll change that back
after so now we have a standard DNA web
set up again you're free to ignore this
there's also videos on how to use DNA
web but ultimately now what we have is a
header footer and an index with the h1
and the ultimate output is simply this
bit of HTML code here zoom in on this a
little bit so there's nothing nothing
special we do with DNA web so you don't
want to use DNA web you can follow along
still just remember that basically all
we have is a header an index and a photo
they get combined into a single file and
that's all we're really working with and
we also have the added benefit of having
this automatic refresh page so we just
changed us to header two and save we get
the refresh so we can work kind of live
so that's all we using DNA web for for
the most part in here so the first thing
we'll do is we have a style page we'll
make or style.css rather we'll make
another one called reset dark at CSS and
in here we'll do some basic reset so
similar to how we do resets in normal
web design we want to reset stuff that's
specific to 1990s HTML type things so
you don't need to really necessarily
understand this I kind of talked through
it loosely but what we'll do on the body
of the email so when you're viewing an
email the body will remove all margin
and padding just to be sure so fix that
margin
pardon and what this is aiming at doing
is making a you know a universal
universally stable and similar UI based
on all browsers and all email client so
they look the same that's all the resets
doing the next up will do the image so
reviews and images and again some
standard things that happen are you
sometimes get a blue border so we'll
just remove the border thickness on
color then you can images by default
also size strangely on you know some
clients so we'll set the height to auto
which will then simply mean the width of
the images what them dictates the height
there it'll stay in the same aspect
ratio will also set in case the used
inline will do a line height of 100% so
it's simply treated the same you know
removes any kind of padding every choose
down line so this line height so in line
works and then we don't want any outline
because again you sometimes get an
outline property these are all really
old things like I say that yeah you
won't see these days but trust me they
do happen in emails so we have outline
what else we've got text decoration
sometimes if you use an image inside of
an anchor so no or yeah basically an
image inside an anchor so we'll get rid
of text decoration and that's
specifically usually like an underline
or again at a border looking thing which
almost exclusively an underline that's
the image then we've got as I mentioned
when you use an image inside of an
anchor then you want to remove the
border explicitly there again because
sometimes it doesn't honor the fact that
you've told it here again some old
clients do that so just remove border
again and then what we're gonna be doing
in the main design the only real way we
can design an email HTML template
exclusively and while is through the use
of tables so that's how we're gonna make
the design so again the first thing we
want to do
stabilize their the tables and normalize
their the way out of them as much as
possible so the best thing to do is
remove any border that might get added
some spacing and remove the padding and
this is just aimed at making it so it
acts more like dips if you're welcome
that you simply place them in and
there's no kind of extra spacing and
then I think that's really it
one other thing we'll do is for headers
just this is not really specific to
emails this is kind of what I doing
almost all web design is there H so
another isn't in here let's just remove
the margin off headers because I like to
use padding around content elements to
keep padding equal and then the margin
that's typically set on headers always
throws the kind of the clinical
precision of the padding all out so this
is not really not specific but certainly
what I class as a reset so that's the
reset done and not like sales I'll do is
reset everything to being usable copy
and paste reset so we've added it to
thee to the page there so that we've got
the style sheet and now in here we press
controlling you I haven't refreshed
every I'm saved just save that and the
shouldn't see we first there yup so now
right included you've got the reset in
the style they just got compiled so we
have that now in and ready to make use
of so so we go into the main content
here now and let's just start with some
table design and because I mentioned
it's it's only for emails and it's very
old but you know I see anything we can
use so the first thing we do is trip a
table in and then something that most
people don't use is the tea body they
kind of forget about that which is the
body of the
the table I'm just trying to fix these
tabs that's one thing that drives me a
little bit nuts with BS code it seems to
put four tabs in by default you have to
remove them save and reopen the file let
me just go to structure up in a minute
and then explain so we do that and save
you can see we now got tests and it's
right at the top corner do style equals
background register kind of see seeks
its top corner right up there and I mean
it's not full width it's why we have a
table you can you can't really think of
them as dips but there's only thing no
no other way to kind of explain tables
very well tables are all what you'd
expect a classic table from rows and
columns so you'd have you know so many
rows so many columns but the way the
style and layout in HTML is a bit awful
so you've got the mean table inside that
you've got the body which is just always
should be there but is massively
excluded for the most part it's just a
design then when people forgotten never
used so most browsers don't use it but
really you should put a tee body inside
that then you put rows so if you have
multiple rows you do it like that
you know row row row row and then this
is the columns inside the row so we're
going rows like this going down but then
inside here we've got columns this would
be what we say you'll see should have
four rows now and then what you can do
inside of the rows has had multiple
columns so now you get multiple columns
going you can see because we have the
reset in here we have nice clean styles
if we were to remove the reset you can
see that look at the default in this
browser specifically you've got some
margin around the table you've got some
cell padding you've got some difference
in spacing between three cells so that's
what the resets doing it's kind of
bringing that back in line to be almost
like dips that you simply expect rows to
be down coms be across them to be no
excess padding at all so that's kind of
what we've achieved there and as I
mentioned you can think of them as
tables with rows and yet the rows
contain the columns that's how they have
to be so it's table rail column and then
however many columns you want and then
the next
and there's a lot of quirks with tables
I don't know how much it's worth going
into though to be honest because this
really is just a we're just doing an
email template and you'll almost never
use this code in this style and this
information outside of email templates
is so specific to email templates I
don't want to go crazy deep dive into
tables because also the other thing with
making a an email template is it's not
necessarily like you have the knowledge
and you remember it you simply end up
googling a lot or trial of ways and
trying to multiple browsers to find out
what simply works best and then going
there you go this is what works so it's
not really a case of Education in the
classic sense it's more about simply
this is what works so use this kind of
layout and in emails tables are the only
universally viable thing that make sense
and work there's other quirks that we'll
go into as we go that everything has to
be inline CSS so you can't technically
have styles that we've got now but we'll
solve that at the end so you can tell
like classes with content in I will say
this is the container if you then put
this into email clients some of them
won't work because they don't even work
with you know basically expect
everything to be inline but we'll use a
tool at the end of this to inline
everything what we've done so we'll
design it now in a modern environment if
you will and then we will inline
everything at the end so let's just get
started so you've got a table a row or
column and we've got tests in there so
I'm gonna try and structure this
so the first top-level container fills
an entire email viewport so when you
have an email this table we want to
stretch out and as you've seen right now
it doesn't so let's go to a style in
here and it will just put some styling
in for the container itself and then
while I'm let's set up some
variables first that will make use of so
we'll pull in we're using SAS table so
we can specify some variables we want
the green background of the image which
all got written down
it is o d9e 73 and that's the background
color of obviously this background we
then want the the white background here
the content background the text
background for the text at the bottom
background here the bottom text color
there and I think that's it so we'll
specify all those so we'll have content
background color and then it's easy for
you guys to customize as well if you
wanted I'll just be white text color is
good black bottom background color as
fbb d1 yeah I think it's gonna show me
the color done something wrong there
I'll put a hash on white there we go
yep and what else is that bottom text
color and is 83-b - oh so that's the
colors in this body tax you want so
that's you call us for fonts again fonts
or another thing you can't really use in
most email clients but we will try so
what we're gonna do is kind of a double
fallback we're gonna do a default font
which I'll just say a son's sorry which
is just the rounded font and then we'll
also have a web font that we'll try and
use and I'm gonna make use of quicksand
which will we'll put in after and we
have then font sizes from some standard
font sizes all do font size normal for
kind of the text and that will do
without quite big because this is I'm
not much content so on to fairly large
font size and then font size Lord will
do twice the size for kind of the the
header nothing up is about proportional
also set the line height so even though
we have really got any line height here
I always like to set a line height for
about 1.4 and that what that means is
the distance between two lines I'll
increase by 40% so oh you've got a
standard line here it's a slightly
spaced out and it looks typical and
looks better totally optional but that's
what that is lots of them Chuck in a
base size for spacing similar to the DNA
grid of you use DNA where before and I'm
just gonna copy and paste all these
sizes from deep well from DNA web and
slightly tweaked so we just have a bunch
of spacings that we can make use of for
keeping puttings
in proportion and sense so it all based
off of a size and then if you want to
increase this the whole you know size of
year your design will increase
proportionally and equally and so just a
bunch of sizes that a percentage of the
base size so small normal tiny should
really go there tiny small or two bills
that could be called smaller but I'll
leave it for tiny for now tiny small
normal large larger huge man I use them
all but we've got them they're available
that's some variables so let's now get
back to what we were doing
first we'll just set up the the text so
as you can see there will now do that's
serif font by the wave you act like
inspect and go to it computed or they
don't know how its computed styles
browser styles there we go and we should
have in here font family then you can
see that serif by default so again we
don't want
I don't like serif font so we'll change
this to from family and use the variable
default font family and save unless you
changed us our son so if now which is
round and plain stuff that included
and the what the trip I'm gonna do here
is some emails remove the body so when
you send an email then it includes the
header and the head and the body some
emails completely remove that and you
only left with this part so the trick
I'm gonna use to also try and apply the
web specific font is to apply the
standard fallback to the body which
should be on it and then inside the
actual container that we're gonna do the
top-level thing that's gonna host
everything I'm gonna put the web
specific font name in there which won't
exist right now what we will add it so
web font if supported which like so
unfortunately most on but the ones that
are then look nice so that will be web
font family if we save that nothing will
change just in fact it has changed and
somehow it's even picked up the font
others don't even know that's picked it
up unless that is in some way tried to
oh I know why it's picked off okay
because my systems got quicksand
installed this physical windows machines
got quicksand and font installed so
you're actually seen quicksand but
obviously this wouldn't work on a
machine without it installed but we will
you know try and support that so at the
container which is the top table as the
top most table inside the body that's
the point to this so we set the web font
again will reset margins and padding
just to be sure because you will be
surprised that if you set it at one
level and you go one more level deep
into a table again email specific HTML
tends to ignore and Riyad padding and
margin so these are the things I know
work from literally testing and an
experience and this is again I keep
reiterating this is not how you
typically have to do CSS this is a very
specific way of having to do it to make
it work for emails so the other thing we
want to do is let's just rip a
background and so you can see in fact we
can put the background cover in any way
because we'll be you
so we have background color and that
would be the background color valuable
save that you can see it's there so the
other thing launches to fill all
available space so for that we'd have
the width is a hundred percent and let's
just force that in case again anything
tries to override it we really want this
to be filling you know everything that's
available for high team that's 100% fill
you won't filled out because there's no
content so we could explicitly try and
do things but the way emails work
because they should only be the size
there's no such thing as a viewport or
such in the email body you can't tell it
to be a hundred percent height of your
email that's visible that's just
something that won't work in emails so
100 percent simply is there to make sure
it's got content but really that doesn't
really do much it just expands as
content put in but as we fill the email
out that's fine we can make something
that forces it to a certain size or adds
padding so that's kind of the size dog
we've got the thumb family we can also
do a fallback in here which we probably
should do of default font family in fact
we should just do that on both so that
in the body on the container we set the
font or to be honest I don't even know
whether the body would have any effect
but there's no harm leaving it in to try
and force this font to work when it's in
an email and so we first set that and
then that'll get used and if that failed
or wasn't available it fall back to this
so it kind of forcefully tries to get
that to work what else do we want we
want to set the font size off to the
variable we've done so that font size is
standardized
I don't do font normal and that means
this TD should have now a bigger font
which it does I set that line height up
again this is optional it's just
something I like to do so if we have any
multiple lines the tend to look a lot
nicer make sure we use the variable
I don't think that will affect the AC is
slightly affects their padding top and
bottom which is fine and then one last
thing I know we want to try and do is
for Microsoft and WebKit did not adjust
our font so don't adjust our font size
for us and that would be Ms text size
adjust and force that's 100% and then
change that to WebKit also so that
should be a kind of standard container
now we've got it's a table but is now
100% width no extra padding and margin
trying to apply our font our size and
our color and to not adjust the font so
again it's all really boilerplate stuff
to try and just force it into a standard
layout that we shouldn't have to do in
anything but web so we have that now so
now I want to do something useful so the
first thing we want to do if we look at
the picture here I guess is to start the
way I'm visualizing this is we'd have
this is your email body the green all
around and then we'd have the container
which is obviously what we just spoke
about the whole thing then we'll have a
wrapper that limits to the width of an
email which is typically 600 pixels and
then inside of that would be this actual
content so it's kind of like the grid
layout without the container on the
outside the wrapper keeps it to this set
size if you will and then the content
goes inside of that wrapper so it stays
Center so the first thing we want to do
is get the content centered so it's
fairly easy funnily enough one of the
things that are easy in tables is to
align Center so we have the row then we
have the the main thing key is this is
the centered or rather this centers and
limits width to recommended size so
first thing we want to do for this align
equals Center Save and tada
we've got Center taxed already so that
does the alignment and then we'll add a
class
called wrapper and then we'll apply all
of our styles inside there and the
wrapper now and as mentioned this is the
style for the inner content now ready so
have a wrapper and this wraps contents
to email width and again if you read up
on emails the recommend widths about 600
pixels which is super small but we're
going to make ours responsive so in
theory our email can be opened up on any
size screen we're not really gonna
impose a limit which is you know or work
for us so first thing want to do with
the this specific TV which is really the
top layer wrapper is we're going to turn
it to display as a block and you
wouldn't usually do this because this
then kind of throws off anything else in
the table because in this design we've
got one this is the only thing we're
gonna have in this table it kind of
won't affect anything else because we're
just gonna put everything inside of here
so we can make use of that fact that
were inside of a single row that we're
only an era of a single row of that we
can just force it to block and the
reason I thought it to block is to make
sure the padding works so we will have
what way up there are some padding so
we've got a lot of spacing larger person
padding and save that and you can see
now we've already got some padding
around the the content which is good and
now we really need to start putting
stuff inside to see anything so inside
of here in order to then do anything
else so now we need like an a medium you
know we need this image then we need
these two lines and then we need this
white so going down
we need rows so what we need now is
another table so we've got a table
inside of the column and again once
you've done a table you have to do a tea
body
and then inside there
we will first pop the active comment in
the section so we can remember it so
this is start of wrapped content and
then we'll have here a row and this is
why cell vs covers a bit annoying
sometimes of the way to lines things
it's not great at aligning so to do an
image we'll have a row with a single
column and in the column would then up
the image and the source will be set up
assets images logo and then I'll have to
go and grab this logo you know this one
so I've made it in advance what we just
we took that in we have a single rail
and we save that and then you should see
you just got a failed image it's let me
just go and grab that image and place it
in this folder so we have desktop email
source so we go to desktop email source
this folder created and then what I'll
do in here is make a folder called
assets and make a folder called images
which is the path fish master guide and
then paste the images in and as you can
see nothing happens right now and that's
because we haven't set up DNA web to
copy the output to the the output folder
here so we've got no output so to do
that we just open the DNA config in the
top level here and we want to put in
some static folders that will basically
take the content and clone it so this is
again DNA web specific but also
ultimately doing is output in a folder
where you H tml is called assets images
and then the images go in there setups
from static folders that's an array
and in here we'll have an item as the
source to assets and the short beam
within the source folder and we're about
this folder here so assets and the
destination value is we go up a folder
from source into web root and then into
assets and that should be it so if we
pull up the log first here and save and
also go into assets here as we say
you'll see this whole thing will be sped
up now start a new server and then the
image is there and it will jump back to
this folder you can see it's now been
copied over so if you're not using DNA
web just literally make a folder called
whatever you're on top just called it
assets now we've got the image in there
that's what we've got let's see if we
need to do any styling on that now so
let's just mark let's rock first again
keep track this row would be top image
the only thing that's a looking at this
is we want a bit more padding and what
I'm thinking and doing for every item is
this is the padding around here of the
actual the wrapper so the whole email
but then as we put something below the
image so we put another image below you
can see there's no padding as such so we
want to I think will do on the content
because that's the only thing I like the
padding it sorry on the column and we'll
add some call it content I can say and
all the content item will be as a style
that will choke some extra padding
around so let's just make a Content item
and this is just general item with
cutting and this is just to keep padding
consistent between atoms again so just
do padding space in large say
so if then we get the extra padding and
I think that's it to be honest I don't
think we need any more style in there so
that's the image done fairly painless
and now we'll move on to the white bars
so we want to make these white bars so
again the only thing we can do is the
rows and columns so this will be the
page behind one we'll call it because
they're meant to act like you know the
metal out pieces of paper behind so TR
TD and then we don't need anything in
there the only thing I think we might
need is I know we will for styling so in
order to get fun enough one of the
things that is difficult to do in email
hTML is to just simply specify what
would typically be in here a div that's
say 80% with 90 percent width and set
height you can't do that with tables
they don't honor Heights you have to
mess with borders and all kinds of
things so in order to just get this line
yes baseline this is the way of a fan
that works almost universally everywhere
so I don't expect you to understand this
bit here or even bother to to be honest
because this is just a kind of copy and
paste this statement and then tweak the
CSS and this will get you a solid just a
block of color and a set height in the
set width that you want and the trick to
doing that that I found that works best
is to embed the table inside just so
it's got something inside to force it to
actually be of some size and not be of
nothing so that's your standard table
here where nothing special whatsoever
it's inside a tables column already so
this is like the content if you will and
also doing inside of all of that it's
chucking a non-breaking space that
stands for us that means a space
physical character like that space but
what usually happens if you just put a
space like that then this gets ignored
and removed so a non-breaking space as
forcefully always going to be shown as a
space inside the contents are we saved
that you can see it's there so
that's you you're for space now your mat
work in this brow is great we did this
instead you can see it's gone see
there's no space so a non-breaking space
force is the actual space to always be
rendered if you will so we're using this
space to simply tell the email clients
that you have to render this you're
gonna have to now make content of some
height then the trick is we're gonna
make the line height 0 and the font is
zero so there's nothing there and then
set the border I think we'll set so it's
basically a little trick to getting a
simple set height block which seems
ridiculous how complicated it is but
again this is email HTML so we'll call
it page behind one this we will sort out
after so let's start with page behind
one in fact we might as well do one and
two at the same time and it's going to
be exactly the same so it's just copy
and paste that twice because you like
two lines the only thing that changes
the width that's what the page ground
want to save that page behind want to
here and then we'll get this going so
first thing I mentioned solid blocks of
color first thing we want to do is
remove any white space which is the
thing we just put in the space we want
to get rid of that so we'll do font size
zero line height this is email say even
you can see magically now it's gone
again because we've told it to be no
pixels high we set the 1:1 pixel and the
line height 1 pixel easy we did what you
can't see that it's tiny and what we
have you can see the slight alteration
in size so there it is there we go to 1
you're seeing if you watch this line
closely here I'm changing from Norton
save
it does slightly change so we've now
controlled the height to be effectively
nothing so we've we've got back to a
piece of content now that's nothing but
the email clients after on them and
render because there's actual content in
there so then what we're gonna do we're
gonna step inside the table TR so table
T body TR TD to get to this element here
so we'll just do table t body TR TD and
that's all we're doing we're getting
down to the content itself to style so
the wide spaced content so we're gonna
then make use of this column that has to
now be rendered there's currently no
width no height and we're gonna force
stop on it so again I mentioned clone
this in because it gets reallied inside
a table and then now we'll set the width
to well we don't need to set the width
because they'll be changes just set the
width temporarily a minute to 100% just
written see it save that so far and
you'll see nothing changes we have no
height so the way we're going to force a
height which works because again how it
won't work believe it or not in you know
email I keep saying this you won't
believe that the stupidness and the lack
of support in email HTML it drives you
nuts sometimes but this is what it is
the way we're gonna do this is to make a
solid bar of color using the border
because it has to want to borders that's
one of the things it's got it actually
doing so I'll just rock a border on the
top we'll just make it the tiny space in
size we had solid and then the content
micron for what we want so basically
it's like saying border top is 4 pixels
solid white save that and we can see we
have nothing right now which is
interesting I know the other thing we're
gonna do is change the we should do that
at the top I guess we'll do display as
inline-block because again the thing
that this the reason we can change the
explai is because we have a table with a
single row single column like we did
above we can trick and say display this
as an inline block so that it honors
borders and the size of borders but if
he did that and did multiple columns or
rows things that go wrong but because
we're only using the inner table with
one our element we can do that so we
change this to inline block I believe
that should get as a line not quite yet
okay let's keep going
in fact that's just to turn pixels now
something that's going on now all's it
is I've used the wrong color it's not
content background color it was or was
it content back uncle no no just content
background color white I thought that
use the wrong color save yeah because
it's that okay let's keep going anyway
we have what I'll so we've got to clear
padding again because that will get me a
d-10 every TD okay so we'll do padding:0
we're also will let's reset the margins
so margin-left:auto margin-right:auto to
kind of Center even though I don't think
that's all we needed
and put the margin the bottom
something's not right and pretty sure it
should be in now Saul investigates in a
minute took some margin bombs and no so
what am I missing here something's out
something's not quite right because this
should not be working I believe it's
let's investigate this so we have a TD
it's there the tables there this is in
so the table width is not set
the table itself should be we haven't
set a size so we we set the s what's
going on so we set the width of here
that in a column sets in a column will
take up all width so we do that there we
don't need columns I don't believe this
will have spacing below white bar so
that's the this padding here between the
lines
that's all in so it's now sized but we
have no width of this this part he
hasn't a width because that's the bit we
need to size we've got the rail we need
to set the rows width so to do that
we'll just set them both say two with
ninety percent for now and we still have
no more why has that not been honored oh
because we'll have to set it on the TV
so that will be the TV you can't set the
width of the rail we have two sets of a
column so width and this is what I mean
about email design being so annoying and
I'm still doing it now for not the TV
it's the it's this table we want to set
not this TV when we loop to the tables
the thing with no width there we go
finally so still not right
but we've now rock content so let's
investigate a little bit further oh it
is right actually what we've got here is
tables will only size to fill what space
they need right now
so the wrapper we haven't explicitly we
haven't finished for one but we haven't
told this table to be any set size so if
we really wanted to we could tell this
table here to be width 100% to fill the
content which you know we don't want
right now but that's the that's where
we're now getting we've got so far
so let's tweak these values first so we
have the page behind one and twos let's
just do page behind
one table width and then we'll do that's
the smaller one let's do 75% say copy
and paste I'm paid behind - we'll do 90%
save that and then you can see there
last thing we need to do is send to the
TD I think probably words we tripped on
- we'll probably see there we go start
now centers them again ignore the size
right now with you know the bits being
in let's just jump back and add some
more content now so we have the two bars
we have the image and now we want some
actual the main page the physical page
content so again the same thing gravity
our TD will want to line that Center
just the same as you want all the stock
to say sent to stay central class
waltrip on it we'll call it page content
and we'll style that in a minute so
inside the rail like before because
you've got multiple bits of things you
want in there so we've got that this one
this one this one this one will choke
another table in so that we can send to
this and then just have we can style
this table or white like a page and then
have a table inside of it to fill that
content so inside here all the table
give it a class and we'll send to the
text inside Center and also do a style
that with text-align:center and then
we've got tea body table row again in
table D again and then we've have some
content in here this would be vary by
email so we'll go back up and comment
this just again keep the the order so
this is page content this then is the
page content itself going in which
style that's the column and this is the
main table table containing page
contents so that we can style the page
itself or effectively this white and
then I'll stop inside and then we'll
have this one now as header this row
copy and paste and we'll have basically
just the text doesn't it now so we'll
Chuck the text and we don't want a
header we can just do text directly in
finance or say hi Luke save that you can
see we're starting to get somewhere we
haven't styled the colors yet but we've
got that in there we want some padding
between these two so that's just
chocolate content item class on things
and this is where that class becoming
useful now if you took the class on both
things you know gotta know why you'll
see I'll stop equally spacing things out
to making it look right so we'll have
more text which we could just chalk
inside one thing
well because I'm gonna make use of this
content item to separate them out to put
the right padding in I'm gonna separate
these two thanks for creating and I've
count with us and then I'm gonna
forcefully break line to force on a new
line to continue please verify your
email with us I think that's it save
that yes you can see now other than
women style text alignment
it's looking similar to this so I'll
come back to the button because that's
gonna be a pain to do so right now we
have a structure of page contents cuts
in a table so we need to style page
content and a text center so tech
centers nice and easy to do alright just
chopping here dot txt Center and just do
text-align:center save that
Center alarm text so that's really solve
that bit and now we want to style the
page content and also we finish styling
the wrapper but we'll style the page
content at the same time so the page
content is nice and easy page content
different a background of content
background color and there we queue up
snow right oh yeah so still got my
applied style on here disable that now
so that's the style we've got the
content background color and add some
padding to inside that you know this
padding want the extra padding so this
will be spacing or do spacing huge on
the left and right I believe that is so
a top and bottom and then through
spacing normal and left and right so
want more spacing top and bottom than we
do left and right so it just tends to
look nicer I think oh we can even them
out makes no major difference actually I
prefer keeping it even and it keeps it
even all the way around our little man's
decided to no longer be centered to your
TD align equals center get back in there
there we go so actually we're not far
off already we've come quite a long way
in a quick amount of time they're
chucking content in so let's just take a
look before we keep going ah I know I
was in the middle of doing done the body
container I'm happy with wrapper I was
in the middle of we haven't finished yet
so we did block we did the padding where
else do we want
I don't think we didn't need anything
actually nothing has actually that's all
we need on there so that's the rapid on
content item the general thing
tech centers fine the two page behind
blocks are now okay I think I'm happy
with that so I think actually we're up
to date there page content yeah that's
all there is so that's not bad so let's
move on to the fun part and again this
is similar to this block line here
creating a button in CSS is very easy
typically creating a button in email if
you just simply Google email HTML CSS
button they'll see there's hundreds and
hundreds of people trying to do it
different ways and ones that have come
out the most popular the way I have come
up with each I don't think is actually
the same as anybody else this is very
close but it's the same principle as
what I've done here the same tricks I've
used so what we want to do is hopefully
make that where's the image gone we want
to make this button so and we also want
a bun to be clickable everywhere around
so let's just chalk it in and I'll
explain as I go and again this is I
wouldn't deviate from this style unless
you already know what you're doing
because this is a well proven and tested
style I've done so the usual
we'll make the row with the column in
commenters button and put some padding
around it which is fine that's all
normal stuff then inside here we will
choking on the table with the usual trip
I'm gonna call this one button on a
style and will style this up so again
like every other table a body a row TV I
had two specials for your code make it
so bad it aligning things there we go
and then here now finally a button meter
a link to go to somewhere so we'll just
go right now to my website and make it
target equals blind cannot they really
need that again we'll chuck it in and
we'll say verify your email so verify
your email so we were to just save that
now you can see we get basically at an
anchor a normal clickable link so
there's that now what we want to do is
sty
specifically we've got the padding
already from the content item and the
line Center so we were to move that
you'd see you lose your padding so we've
added padding around at first
we've Center lined it horizontally and
then we just made a table with a single
row single column and a single link and
a class of button so now we'll style
that button so this is just going to be
a style called button I know one thing I
forgot actually we never styled the
header
I'm just style this header we never use
the font size we've got which was font
size large Oh in fact it's the same size
anyway you just build a check that yeah
so you just happened to be the font size
larger chair whilst the font size but
that's the large header text right so
button back to where we were so inside
the button the thing we're gonna be
styling ultimately is this this is the
main thing you can style to add padding
to as I mentioned in the last one the
column so it's just jump straight into
the the column style
let's do background color equals button
background color save that there you go
we've got the background color
I'll still border-radius give it the
roundedness which surprisingly does work
it's been working for many many many
years which with all the things that
don't work you'd think border-radius
wouldn't so they can see now we've got
the rounded border looks fairly simple
so far now what we need to do to add the
padding because better man this column
and border is on the column it's not on
the link so if we were to Pat out or
doesn't then go work anyway in the style
just chuck some paddy not oh there you
go
you can see now you can click the link
but everything else around it is not
clickable and also this won't work when
you send an email anyway so even though
you see it visibly here what you see
here won't necessarily work when you
send it as an email so keep that in mind
as well just because it looks like that
kind of works it doesn't always so in
order to make the button itself
clickable so everywhere you click inside
it's clickable we need to jump into the
the
link itself and style that link and put
the padding on that link it basically
that's what we need to do so we've got
the button link we want to duplicate
this because what we're going to do is
add padding inside here and it's going
to expand out and we want to double up
on our our ability and emails for this
to work so some email clients honor this
some email clients honor this someone
are both so by putting it in both first
just duplicating the style we end up
with the same style so if we change this
collar say to read oops don't link up
for work you'll see there you've got red
and you've also got behind the tab so
it's kind of just a double verification
for email clients so that some basically
more than whichever work on one or the
other than that work on both so I think
that makes any sense
set the text color that's still wrong so
I'll be color button text color say
you've add the padding and now which
does work on anchors so padding one will
have this time we will have spacing
spacing normal top and bottom and a lot
more spacing on the left and right
because I think that just looks better
on the button yeah that's that and we'll
have no one in the line so text
decoration I believe it s gets rid of
that underline and then I don't think we
need display:inline-block to seem sure
to be working but I'm just chalk that in
oh this display:inline-block allows the
padding of the content item to work
properly so that's allowed that and they
can see the button itself is clickable
all around so we've made a button that
works an email now that looks like a
button with its rounded and collared so
that there's not far off now a complete
visual that we wanted and so the other
thing left is to chop that word for Seto
by word icon in and then we're not far
off similar and then we'll get around to
testing
if it works so this is kind of a
universal button style you can make
yourself and tweak as you need as I jump
back into here we've got the button now
hover over and collapse that so we have
the page content now it will come out of
the page content because the page
contents is white block and we want to
put the actual image outside of that now
so this would be just the same as all
the others I'm sure you see it right now
a rail column and you used to fish refer
to your code never formatting my code
correctly as well this is the text logo
and just like the other one it's just an
image with a source set to assets images
text logo I think I pulled it Save there
we go that appears
it's let's now fix this plus equals text
although we'll go and we'll also send to
that that's there and now text logo
really just needs a bunch of padding so
we will go to the bottom text logo and
we will then have some padding which
will be top and bottom in fact in a new
differently on here to make it look
right because what we've got is the pad
in there but this hasn't got padding
around cuz its style so we're gonna
tweak and we'll do specifically the
padding top or chop some huge spacing in
twice so it's got double melt to
compensate for the complete lack of any
and the bottom will do spacing larger
and I wouldn't usually have to do this
kind of almost hawkish way of double
padding but because we're in an email
and because I can't pad this block in
order to maintain all the other styles I
can't have to just add it to the
previous one so there's the email
and now if we were to look at this in a
responsive manner I can just open the
tools and drag this you can see that it
will simply resize to whatever so that's
now a responsive email template
hopefully so I could go into detail the
reason I'm not going
overly in detail as I mentioned with the
styles and necessarily the layout is
because honestly this is only ever going
to be used in email templates and the
exact way that I've done it is really a
way that I've simply tried and tested
and you have to mess around and try very
specific ways of doing things to see
what email clients support
there's no point mechanic going into
that other than explaining that
obviously it's a table or row or column
and that I'm aligning things and I'm
explaining why I'm doing things but
beyond that explanation you really don't
need it you can you can take this
template and mess with it yourself and
then see what works for you but I'd
highly recommend sticking to a very
similar formula for adding padding and
adding spacing and things and embedding
tables inside of columns in order to
change the widths and things like that
so that's the email template done and
we've done it in DNA web which also
means we have a nice clean thing that we
can use sass and variables and
everything and ultimately we get an
output here that's raw HTML so what's
boiled down to now is we have an output
file here which is the actual generated
HTML as I mentioned this won't work in
an email client or it might work in
someone on others but what they
typically don't like is this they don't
like linked style sheets so new email
clients do old ones just simply don't so
we want to inline the CSS or rather we
want to chuck the style in the body
first and then we want to inline all the
CSS so instead of it being a class it
will then be a style directly on every
element so to be like here style equals
and then all the elements inside the
container class would be directly
chucked in here and that's called inline
or yeah CSS inlining and we can use a
tool to do that for us we don't
selves so what we're gonna do now in
order to inline this text and make it
usable we will take this HTML output the
web root HTML we will then delete those
two links Chuck a style body here to
chuck it in here then we'll go to the
outputted asset CSS and go to the
outputted CSS copy the reset one copy
the style one and then that's
effectively now the same thing we just
move the style from links to embedded in
the body that's step one
select all that text and copy it and now
what you want to do is open the website
in liner CM and this is the one I use
and it's from campaign monitor and also
do is paste that text in you can see
it's all in here right now and your
tables got no Styles you click make
inline and then you'll see now all the
styles that are applied in the style
sheets are now directly on all the
elements and this is basically to allow
it to be friendly for emails so now
you've got that output you can copy that
and that's now ready for being sent as
an email as a test so I'll make a
document here paste it in I'll just save
this to desktop so we'll save it called
say email tests txt just to test this
and this is in desktop email email test
txt this is what we now want to send us
a HTML email and verify it works so to
do that now we'll just think I'm happy
with this I can't see me I went to edit
this that's generated out but I'll just
come do that for now so I've got that
copied in I'm quite confident of you
know proven and tried this out that that
should be okay this is what we're
expecting it to look like and now we
will make a project to make use of that
so in the email in here I might as well
just chalk in
email send tester now just do
command-line dotnet new console then
we'll just send it in a console up I'm
not really bothered about doing anything
fancy for this so we have that in there
we can now open the email tester and now
we go to program we'll just quickly
write a really quick and easy our
username it calls no reply for cert over
comm var password equals some password
and you can do this however now this is
just basically we have the content we're
ready to send and we will send it
properly in the next video through the
server this is just a quick way of just
sending a test message so new mail
message no reply assertive comm is where
it's coming from
it's going go to contact angle six to me
because I want the message want to see
what it's like message subject equals
test word or rather verify your account
will say just a little bit more like
what it's meant to be the body now wants
to be the actual file we just created so
I'll just do file read all text and in
here I put an apt symbol so we can pop
forward slashes at once go to the text
file itself here hold shift and right
click copy as path and then just paste
the path in and that will now read all
the content into a message body set the
s body HTML is true we want it to be a
HTML email then we've got the SMTP
client so I'm going to use my office 365
account to send
an email so you can follow this if you
have a Microsoft Office 365 email you
can just change this this and this to
your actual emails you know your email
username and password you'll be able to
send this as a test this is a new SMTP
client client doc credentials equals new
network credentials and that will be the
username password made and then we have
the host for specifically office 365 as
you guessed it
SMTP office 365 comm the court is 5 8 6
but TLS I believe that as well can't
remember which were waiting but on a lot
support then the SSL for office emails
is enabled and then finally send the
email and that's it
that shouldn't have send an email
officer that's passwords wrong cuz it's
live on a video but now if we run this I
will basically set the right password
hide it off-screen and then run and
you'll see that this will run and send
an email so now you can see this my
emails opened up and here's the new
email I've just got so I'll click this
email and you can see here now I've got
the email the font has remained I
believe it looks slightly messed up so
I'll tweet this the image is obviously
won't work was the reality for that many
we'll change that to an absolute but
here's the email most of it's all good
and working like say those pictures
won't work so we'll chop them up to get
or somewhere where we'll put the email -
they'll have to be an obviously an
absolute deal to find the the paths this
button should work though so I will take
a quick look at that now and figure out
why not okay so I just pause the video
and figure it out the issue there's one
line basically and here that stopped the
border working on the button
that I forgot in order for the anchor to
obey padded in early male clients it
needs an actual border
so I mimics the border radius and color
but I only also needed to actually set
an actual border so like is in a one
pixel solid border to force the padding
to work so I'll just change that one
line there to get that to work and now
in the emails there's the old one and
there's the new one and you can see
basically the the padding is back on the
bottom so that's that done the only
reason this email is showing the font
right now is because it's actually on my
machine I've already got it installed so
the one thing we also need to do is
include in the header this is how easy
is just go to google fonts google.com
and type in whatever font you want so
I'll use quick sound click the plus
button click down here and then you can
copy this link hate drop here just take
that and plunk it in the head and
basically then this name now quicksand
is available and our original style that
set the font is quicksand would now work
if the client machine didn't have the
font and also the email allows it to
download so this is really the only step
to try and enable web fonts when it's
not a machine so that's all there is to
that the button now works so there's
nothing left to do they're really just
generate the file and then obviously
you'd resend the email which we've
verified works now so that's all there
is to doing the email side there what
I'll do is push this source code to get
hobb now and then just tweak the asset
locations to be absolute assets that
really work and one sent one final email
that shows the the images and then we're
all good to go so I'll just pause this
upload this code to github and then
point these to the github images for now
so they work and you can see them so you
can see now I've just pushed this actual
code were working on up to get so now
it's in email HTML template and then
here's the source code now that I've
moved it to so we go to the source
working in assets and images and then
it's these files you want so we click
there's a content we can do that as view
image will show it yeah so we can use
this direct or absolute ill here and
we'll just make use of that so we go to
here and we'll change this now from
small to this absolute I'll I'll do the
same for the bottom one here and it will
be text logo such that done we have
where are we I need to just spin up I'll
stop DNA web one second I just been do
you know web backup and it's gonna
reopen that's fine
so we've now generated the new index dot
HTM so run this through once more so get
the head to ml file
remove the two CSS links have some style
here go to the CSS reset copy and paste
that in style copy and paste that in
select it all copy it and then go to CSS
and liner paste it in make it inline
copy it all and I'll chop it into the
the new email where are we just put it
in email template templates web root
nope
email sender I don't know because it was
a template file I made on my desktop so
I'll just recreate the file save it on
the desktop a minute just a text file
female hawk txt I'll just reopen the
email sender now and now I'll just run
to send the new text as we've done in
the video just so you can see we'll just
open up the email sender I'll fix this
password to be again the the real
password and then run this and then show
you the output of the email
it's the third sent and you can see now
that he's the new email with the actual
images him so we have the first one
where we've got padding mistakes second
one where we know what the padding and
the final one where I've actually linked
to real images in github so there's the
final email that works and shows the
font and we can also view this you know
we don't get rounded borders that's
because this is Windows Mail so if I
just log in to my actual outlook online
client you'll see that we'll have the
rounded buttons and you can see here in
the actual online browser version we got
the rounded buttons you can also see
that even though that one fails in mail
it shows up perfectly fine in Outlook
online and this is where I'm saying that
you won't always necessarily see an
issue and one but you have to be testing
it you know across multiple different
browsers and styles to make sure it
works everywhere so I'm happy with this
