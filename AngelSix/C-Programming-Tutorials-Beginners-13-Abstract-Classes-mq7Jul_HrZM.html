to describe a concept a partial
implementation or something that's not
completely known but as powerful known
aspects so good examples of car the
intimated the presumption that all cars
with Drive using a gas pedal
they'll all off the same radio and same
handbrake or each car will have a
different way to move the seats and
windows will calculate their speed
differently based on the wheel size next
we'll need to implement two versions of
the abstract class so we're going to
take a budget car in a sports car
they'll both automatically inherit the
implemented methods of the abstract
class so we don't need to be easily done
next they lead to implement their own
version of the abstract methods to move
their seats and windows and calculate
their speed
the sports car will have electric seats
and windows and the budget coral of
manual adjustment the sports car has
bigger wheels and a larger engine so
travels faster the green methods are the
methods that the abstract class
influence and identical for all classes
the black methods are obstruct
unimplemented methods in the abstract
class that get implemented in blue in
each cluster inherit from the abstract
class so a unique to each class okay so
let's make this actual abstract class
and budget car and sports card to see
how this thing really comes together so
just started a new console application
and in here we're just going to do it
all in one class for now keep it simple
so let's start by making a substrate
class so you make a class as you always
would like this a class car and there's
your your class and just simply prepend
it with abstract so now an abstract
class cannot be created so if we went in
here now and Ed draw a equals new car
you're going to find that you can't do
this because it's abstract so that's the
point of abstract issues it's not fully
defined so you can't create an instance
of it because there's unknown aspects
so we now have an abstract class called
car and as we mentioned we're going to
make the presumption that all cars have
the radio turned on the same way so I'll
just make a function so probably void to
radio on and then we'll just what we'll
do for this is just simply console the
right line for everything and we'll
simply say turn the radio on and there's
a function now in an abstract class or
in any class really you might want to
allow the classes that then subclass
this to override and make new versions
of this function so by default as we
mentioned all of the classes that
inherit from car will get this function
by defaults they won't have to implement
it but then they might want to
specifically say upgrade the radio and
then they want to turn it on differently
so in order to allow this to be changed
in future classes the pre thermos with
the word virtual and you'll see this
once we finish the lesson you'll see how
we do that so virtual allows say a
public class or G car which implements
car - now do override radio on and then
here we can either call the original
function or we can completely replace it
with our own function and do something
different so I'll come to that in a
minute
but that is that's right allows you to
do so then whoever calls the you know
the function you can call the the
specific one so we've got the radio on
and we'll quickly wrap this in a region
four and public methods keep things
clean and then we'll even comment so an
abstract definition of a car of any kind
turn the car radio on and then we said
also the handbrake will be released the
same way for all vehicles so again we'll
make the public virtual function boys
says handbrake off so or what's rather
release handbrake makes more sense
attempts to release the cars and brake
and then in order to do that we need a
property so let's just make a properties
region and here we'll put a public
boolean handbrake released and by
default the cars going on the handbrake
on so it doesn't released so then in
order to release the handbrake for all
cars that were saying by default it's
the same we would then do handbrake
released it was real simple as that and
then we would mention that we managed to
do that
so we now the radio on and the released
handbrake functions implemented and the
last one we said was in order to drive
which is to press the gas pedal and
drive so again a public virtual void of
a drive function those on the gas to
drive the car and then here now and
again remember this is all demo good I
don't typically like to do demos this
way wait so you know a fake thing that
isn't really in programming but this is
just a really good way to explain
abstract classes then I'll show you some
real world examples again of where it's
actually use but this is a
a good way to explain the concept so the
point of this as these three functions
are going to be the same for all cars
and then yes we can't override them with
virtual to make them specific but at
least it's you know if it's not
implemented its class that this car will
have the same you know way of doing that
so same for like a handbrake you you
release them the same in every car and
then when you get to luxury cars you
might have an electronic can brake so it
kind of follow suit but it's easier to
grasp this way so for the drive in order
to drive we first need to release the
handbrake
so we'll say release um break the fish
can't drive if you have brakes on before
you can but your burn your brakes out
and then we'll do a check with if the
handbrake is released then we'll be
driving so we can then go on the gas so
let's say press the gas pedal otherwise
if the handbrake didn't release then
we'll say cannot move and brake jammed
and that's how we'd then drive the car
so we've got the three functions that
were in green on the presentation at the
start so these are the three functions
now that will copy to every car that
implements this class so they won't have
to redo these functions these on that
work so that's them out the way then in
order for the certain things now that
we're going to say we simply don't know
we can't make a presumption that all
cars act a certain way or have a certain
thing so one of those things is we're
going to say the wheel size we we can't
make a presumption because every cars
got different wheels but so we're just
literally going to leave that as an
unknown but we do know a car has wheels
so this is where we're talking about an
abstract class is that it's a known
thing so we know that the handbrake is
released or it's not released and we
know we can turn the radio on and off
and we can drive and we know a car has
wheels both
unlike being able to turn a radio on or
off by default or release a handbrake by
default we're going to say that the
wheels we simply don't know but we know
for a fact it has to exist so this is
where you define an abstract property in
this case so this is going to be a
property that we know what all cars need
but we don't know anything about it we
don't know the value we don't implement
it so you define it just like a normal
variable or a normal property in this
case and we'll call it wheel diameter
and it's going to be an inches and it's
going to be a gutter only so the cars
wheel diameter now that's a normal
property now if we do instead abstract
here this means now that this any class
that implements car is now going to have
to override not override but actually
create this integer so it's forcing a
class to implement a wheel diameter so
we then make model and go ahead and
start making a public class budget car
and you'll see now at the same budget
car does not implement inherit abstract
methods member wheel diameter inches so
you can click on there you can click
control and dot and then you can press
ENTER to implement abstract class and
you can see it's forcing us to implement
the wheel diameter inches so in this
case we'll return at say 16 so this is a
way that if we now make an instance of a
car we you know it we create a subclass
of car then we're going to be forced to
implement the wheel size and that's kind
of and then one of the points of an
abstract class is to sort of force
anything that wants to implement it they
can be forced to implement specific
things so it's we implement in the base
class you know in this base abstract
class things we know about that we want
functions off and these can be anything
but then the might just be a few small
things that we don't know about so
instead of having to copy the logic all
the time and redo a load of logic in
every class
so you can simply define something
that's known but we don't have the value
for and then you can make use of that
inside of functions without having to
you know have the explicit value so
it'll come clear it as we you know
finish more things often here so we're
going to have add another few things so
we will have in order to calculate the
the speed originally in the slide we had
it so that each car was going to
calculate its own speed but really we
can calculate the speed of the car by
simply having the wheel diameter given
to us and everything else is the same
so unlike the slide where we had
calculate speed is an abstract we've
changed up the wheel diameter has been
an abstract and we're now going to
implement a calculate speed function
that's going to return a float I'll call
this calculate speed in miles per hour
and this one isn't virtual because we
don't want the calling plaster you know
this budget car and sports got to be
able to replace this function because
this is a known mathematical function so
we don't make it virtual so therefore it
can't be over in so it's just a regular
class function like any other so to
calculate the speed well one if the
handbrake isn't released then the speed
is going to be zero because we're not
moving and that's the presumption was
made because the drive won't drive until
the handbrake is released so if there's
no handbrake or hand brakes on we are
not moving otherwise we then want to
first get an order to calculate miles
per hour we've got the wheel which is in
inches so this is nothing to do with
abstract classes we listed some
mathematical equations so I'll kind of
skip over it fairly fast what we want to
first get inches per revolution so
basically how far distance wise along
the road we will travel
for every rotation of the wheel so it's
a fairly simple math equation for anyone
that knows any kind of math and that is
just the diameter of a circle which is
pi times the diameter so this will
convert say a 16-inch wheel into like a
48 inch flat surface roughly so you'll
travel 48 inches every time they're
16-inch wheels done one full revolution
that's the first part of the calculation
now you want to get the integral travel
per minute so if not inches per
revolution so now you want to know how
far you'll travel in a minute so in
order to do that you get the inches per
Rev you know inter times and you need to
know at this case what the gearbox is
outputting in order to because the
gearbox spins the wheel so the engine
spins which then goes through the
gearbox and then to a ratio it comes out
and moves the wheels after it's gone
through a differential book the basics
are we need to know the output speed the
revs per minute of the gearbox so let's
just also make a quick function here
called public float gearbox out for
Speed Graphic a minute and again don't
worry this is not really specific to
abstract classes but we'll fill it in so
we get some functionality so just can
say my gearbox is spinning the wheels a
thousand revs a minute so then if we
turns up by gearbox output speed will
now know how many inches are minute the
cars traveling based on the wheel size
and the gearbox which is now going to
stay fixed this cars going to drive with
the engine and the gearbox spinning at
the exact same revs all the time just
for this demo so the final phase there
is to simply convert it to miles per
hour and to do that you just want inches
per minute into inches per hour so times
60 so they got inches per hour now you
just want to convert inches tomatoes
which is by tans knit by a small number
of I think it's one two three four zeros
in five seven eight to eight
kind of sad that I know that number as
well and I think I was right so that
should convert inches per hour into
miles per hour so once we've got that we
return the miles per hour and that's how
a function we can call so we've now got
some functions we've implemented we've
got the radio arm they've released
handbrake the drive they can all be
overridden with new functions then we've
got standard methods that are based of
the gearbox speed and the speed the car
traveling so that for them in there and
then the other two things we said in the
slide the abstract parts of the car the
things we don't know anything about one
is this wheel diameter which is a
property and the other two are going to
be functions they're going methods and
that's 1/2 wind the window down and to
to move the seat forward so again just
like create a normal method which would
say be public void lined window down
that's how you create a normal method to
make it abstract like everything else
just put the word abstract in front and
now you should see that you don't want
to implement an abstract so because you
don't know anything about it you don't
implement the method is employed
semicolon so now this is an unknown
method we can certainly call the method
inside of this class but the actual
implementation of what that does is not
known and it doesn't need to be so it
can't because you can't create an
instance of an abstract class it doesn't
matter that this could call it in here
so you could say in here why I'm doing
the damage but this class has no idea
what winder and down does but it doesn't
stop it effectively calling it at this
point in time because whenever radio on
is called it can't be cause and call it
has to be called from say budget car so
therefore you can add a logic into your
abstract class but make use of unknown
information so again that's all I'll try
and point out some good real-world
examples after this F of Y truthful so
this will lines the
windows down and it's not implemented
yet and then we'll also have the
abstract void move sit forward it's
falling forward room there we go so
these two now you'll see here need to be
implemented so click budget car control
dot and enter you can see now it's
implemented these three things so now
any car that we create again as the
diagram shows we now need to implement
these three things for it to become a
full car that we can make yourself so we
don't make any presumptions of how a
seat moves forward in any car so we then
have to implement it Kerr car so in here
again we'll just do console dot write
line moved seat forward using hand lever
and then the wine window down console
dot right on line round window down
slowly using a wide definitely called
the manual lever so this is a budget car
implemented so now in fear we can do for
budget car equals new budget car we can
create a budget car so now we have an
instance of budget car and then we want
to make use of that so we will have say
or the console dot write line project
car and then we'll put some like
underlined type of head of there and
then we'll create the instance of the
budget car and other than plus eight do
stuff a car will pass in budget car so
that we
can you know do this exact same thing
for the sports car afterwards and then
in this function do stop the budget car
we're not going to pass in budget car
when I pass in the abstract class
because that's all we need to know the
abstract class contains all the the
known you know that it contains the
methods and we can now call them it's
just that you can't create an instance
of car so by passing in an abstract car
we can make use of this function for any
kind of car and still call the method
there specific to like budget car so in
here we're just going to say and then I
move the seat forward put the radio on
line the windows down and drive and then
we will log out the speed the car should
be driving up so we will say driving act
whatever miles per hour with something
inch rims so then in here we will be
driving a car dot calculate speed in
miles per hour and car dot wheel
diameter inches so basically I'll put
some information about the car once
we've done that we'll simply wait for
the console doesn't close and if we run
this now we should see that we've moved
the seat forward the radios on with
round the windows down and we drive so
you can see move C forward using handle
either turned on radio one window down
slowly using winder successfully release
the handbrake press the gas pedal and
we're driving at forty seven point five
nine miles an hour with sixteen inch
rims so there's one card on and also you
have to do to get all the methods of
calculating speed and you know tuning
radio is on we haven't had to redo that
in the budget car we'll just have to
specify the specifics the things that
are specific to the budget car that are
different per car so now we've got that
one we can make them public class sports
car
click control dot and enter wheel
diameter this one's going to have big 22
inch rims move seat forward we will have
moose it forward using button nice and
easy
when window down fast with electric
motor
that's all that's different that's all
about to do now to make a sports car so
in here we can copy the budget car
output and do a sports car output and
then this will be sports car equals new
sports car and this car will do stuff to
the sports car and then I will see the
output of that we should see all the
standard stuff like turn the radio on is
the same and it's come from effectively
the base car and we have moves afford
using button we're driving at 65 miles
an hour because the wheels are bigger
but in essence all the other stuff is
the same so we've managed to get and
we'll also do a custom new line so that
we have some space between there so
we've got two different cars that were
just up to implement you know the
specific functions and then they've
gained all of the properties like the
handbrake release the methods and
everything else from the base class and
then they just have to implement
specifics that offer the abstract class
so the one other example here will say
we'll make a broken budget car
so we'll do a public class and write the
title I'll just copy the budget car once
more paste it and we'll call this one
broken budget car and we got all the
same stuff which is fine so that's
that's okay we don't need to do anything
about that or rather let's just simply
and have it a budget car
we don't need to do that at all so we've
got a budget car we're going to make
another version of it that's now broken
so for that we're going to override and
this is why we made the other functions
virtual we're going to say in this case
the release handbrake we're going to
make this our own function in this
broken version because we made the
function virtual here which means we've
got an implementation so we don't need
to implement it but there's an option
that we can you know it's not like an
abstract where we have to implement you
know you've got to make an instance of
this because nothing exists a virtual
map that exists but you can simply make
a different version of your light by
overriding so in the budget broken car
we're going to override the handbrake
I'm simply going to say a handbrake
religious force we're never going to
release the handbrake so handbrake is
always on then we're going to do
console.writeline exclamation for this
an error and very failed to release and
then we're going to see what impact that
has now so in the budget car when it
changes to a broken budget car and we're
going to run that thing as you now we've
moved it forward returned the ready one
round the window down and says he a
handbrake failed to release and now
cannot move handbrake jammed driving at
60 miles an hour grabbing at naught
miles now with 16 inch rims so
effectively we have implemented a budget
car that now doesn't release the
handbrake but when we sell it to drive
which we haven't told it how to drive
you it's pick that up from the abstract
class its figured out that you know it
can't move because the Hambridge jump
that's free light line so that's really
the the abstract class here as car that
implements things that are the same for
every car like you know calculating
speed but then it needs to know specific
information about the master classes or
the classes that implement the object
class so that's all good and true that's
how it's physically done and in essence
you just stick the keyword abstract
before what you want to be abstract and
that makes it abstract so I guess one of
the questions might be you know why
would use an abstract class say instead
of an interface why not just make all
cars have an interface with wheel
diameter handbrake released
radio on all this that the other the key
thing with an interface is you can't
implement anything in an interface so if
you make an interface then you can't
make any instance you know you can't
define these functions and interfaces is
not a definition so you wouldn't use an
interface because we want to explicitly
define these you know these methods the
known pieces of information that we want
to implement so that's why you wouldn't
use an interface so the next question
might be well why wouldn't you just make
a you know base class why'd you need
abstract all of you delete the word
abstract now you've got to then define
you can do abstract inside because it
must be contained in an abstract class
so you'd have to remove abstract from
here which now means you have to define
wheel diameter which by default is zero
so that's not going to break anything
and then you'll come down and these
functions of them abstract again so you
definitely abstract you'd have to make
versions of those methods and now you
could create an instance of a wheel car
a wheel car you could create an instance
of car which is you know no longer
abstract and you could attempt to you
know do things with it where there's the
wheel diameter zero so it's not really
valid the car can have zero diameter
wheels and also when you come to say
making new version of the car so vided
public new car implements car or public
plus at help you can see now I get no
warning I get no prompt to even do
anything so now the the person
implementing a car might say it's all
cool I've now got a car
I'm going to go and figure out well
what's on the car let's have a look this
again all the class properties are
getting a load of stuff it's like well
what do I even do what's you know the
mat start typing and try and find out so
I probably could override and see what
they can do or they might have to then
create a constructor and do follow look
there's wheel diameter so they're going
to have to figure out you know how to do
things it's not the same so you're
giving no indication to the implementing
class of anything that's expected you
know you're not forcing a behavior onto
being implemented all right you can also
then just go and happily create a new
instance as we mentioned of car which is
not really valid because it's a it's a
partial definition it's got partial
unknowns in it and so the reason why you
wouldn't use a base class is basically
because this functions that you want to
force onto the implementing class so
you're expecting them you know you
fought in these things that you need to
know explicitly on the class so it
simply would not work without that in
there so we just run back in time to and
the class's abstract you know forcing
these answer if we didn't implement a
wheel size and we were trying to make a
new instance of the car it literally
will not compile it's a very forceful
way to make sure anything implement in a
car it's going to implement what you
need it to and you're expected things
and the second reason for an abstract
classes also to make sure you can't
create an instance of car because it's
again it's partially unknown so it's not
that you can't use a base class you can
do everything with a base class that you
can with an abstract it's simply that an
abstract is a more appropriate way of
defining what you expect this class to
be you know on what information you need
from it and that's how you create an
abstract class then how you'd implement
the abstract classes and how things are
different on them with some output and
I'll just go ahead and open a few things
that are again real-world examples where
we are actually using them in some code
so
go ahead and open those now and we'll
take a look so the only real example I
could find because we don't use them
that often is this base of that property
in the cassette or word application
we're building and here I make an
abstract class for base attached
property we don't do any abstract
properties or methods because there's
nothing we explicitly need from a class
that subclasses this it's it's more that
we add all of this logic into the class
we define you know a value itself the
attached property we do all of the
complicated stuff and the key thing here
then in the abstract classes that we
simply make some virtual functions or in
this case oh yeah virtual functions and
it's when the value changes I'm going to
value updates and by default we make
them in nothing
so the nothing happens when the value
changes which is perfectly valid but you
typically expect to override one of
these two things so we could make them
both abstract and force both of them to
be implemented but then you'd often have
one of these blank so in this instance
we make two virtual methods in the
abstract class and that's all that has
to be done by then classes that
implement this so or the inherit all of
this code and they can simply now
implement the base attached property so
an example of where this is then use we
scroll up and look at references we have
as a bad way of doing it let's do where
are we here so say auto scroll to bottom
property and implement the base attached
property and we passing this also a
generic so we pass in ourselves and then
we override like we saw in the example
this on value change so when the value
changes we do something specific and
that's all we care about so now in order
to create an attached properties we have
to do is override this abstract base
class and that whole thing will link up
and work and whenever the value of that
attached property changes
we override the method to them do
something specific so it allows us to
make very small and clean attach
properties by using this abstract base
class and again if we didn't make it
abstract that would mean that somebody
could try and you know create a base
attach a property which you know
wouldn't really work because it's it's
not designed that way
so this is an actual working example of
what we use and the reason we've chosen
this over say again the two definitions
are why would you choose an abstract
class instead of an interface or a base
class why you wouldn't choose an
interface because you couldn't define
all of this data and you wouldn't use a
base class because we do not want the
base attached a property to be instant'
a table of you will you don't want to
instantiate a new class because this
isn't by definition complete it's not
going to do anything it's just generic
so you know you attach this what's it
expected to do nothing's been defined
there's no behavior in the on value
change draw dated which is the point of
it so you don't want to instant ate it
and those functions that we want
implemented which we're not forcing with
abstract here because the user can
choose between one of two or they can
simply do things on both but we could
have quite easily made these two
abstract but again there's no need we've
made them virtual so they can be
overridden so an abstract class doesn't
need to have abstract content inside of
it by doing a you know class like this
the main benefit is they simply cannot
create a new instance of base attach
property and again that effectively
defines the expected usage of this class
you're telling the developer that every
try and creating a new instance that's
that's not the right way you're doing
things you you haven't made this class
for that reason you've made this class
purely as a base class and you're
forcing that by putting abstract there
and then on base classes that are
abstract that the developer then knows
to look for you know overridden methods
so if I was going to then implement an
abstract class like this one and violin
did probably
Class A and it was a beta packed
property of a and a boolean and I know
it's an abstract class angle n just
simply tough a keyword override and see
what I've got and these are object
because every class as an object so that
vitam two strings are all built in and I
can quite clearly see now these are two
things I can implement on that base
class so it's kind of again what
developers are expected to do have you
implement an abstract class the first
thing you'll do is you might be forced
to implement in things and then you know
about them and then the second data type
the word override and have a look at
that what makes you know what can I do
with this and these are the two variants
that you can do this is the only two
things you can really change about the
class so therefore that's that's kind of
the the intended purpose of this
abstract class and it's been given via
either forcefully having to implement
abstract things or in the override
keyword so that insurer really is is
what abstract classes are and what they
used for again you don't use them more
impact this was the only real example I
could even find and where I've used them
recently but they do have a purpose
again they can they can certainly be
done you can do everything without
abstract it's not a requirement it's
simply more of a defined intent to you
know force the correct usage of a class
that you're making so hopefully that's
been I guess the best way I can explain
an abstract class because they are you
know fairly specific and the simple but
also they've got the the key purposes
and like one is that they shouldn't be
created on their own they're not
designed to be used as is and the second
is to force any class to implement the
base class to correctly set up
instantiate and you know work correctly
with that class so again any questions
and if you don't clear just simply leave
a comment but hopefully this was useful
and yeah that's it
