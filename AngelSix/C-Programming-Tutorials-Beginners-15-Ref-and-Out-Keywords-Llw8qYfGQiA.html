a basic sub C sharp and understanding
what references are and outs are in
terms of when you pass in something into
a function with a ref or an out and the
difference I was going to do a video on
the Wix installer for making an
installer but after spending 52 minutes
during the video we had a power cut and
I lost everything and I don't have time
this week unfortunately to redo
something that large so apologies for
the short video this week I'm just very
busy with work at the minute and like
say I got super early to do this video I
got off at like half past five to do it
spend now we're doing it and right at
the end we had a power cut so about to
resort to making another quick video so
this will be a basics of c-sharp and
lacks a on the ref and the out variables
which is still going to be useful for
people so let's get into that we'll just
create a console app it doesn't really
matter what application you create and
it will create a new in this case just a
dotnet core console application and we
will run this just to make sure
everything still works and I think this
computer's a little bit slow since it's
just had its power cut maybe it's trying
to recover hopefully there's no damage
to the hard drive
there we go it's a little bit faster now
let's do console doc okay something
that's gone wrong here maybe just drive
east or first
there we go we're at console dot read
line that they were just so it stayed
open and then just press f5 to run this
let's make sure just everything still
works like I say they're the computers
on a bit of a go slow at the minute
since its crash so again apologies for
that but not much I could do about that
right so there's our application so
hello world to go a nice console so
we've done videos on functions variables
basics of you know see shorty you know
how to do things so let's say we had VAR
add my numbers equals add numbers and
then we'll make some variables for it a
equals five Ravi equals seven and you
pass them into a function to like a B
and you'd get the result is add my
numbers and then we make that function
so private int add numbers int a and B
or so it doesn't like this similar for a
second and this would return first lost
second and then it complaining about now
oh yes static was reckon so ah we could
then do console.writeline
the result of a plus a plus b is and
then add my numbers it's a really bad
variable name let's rename that to
resolve it and this should output the
result of 5 plus 7
whydo after the read line let's move
that read line to the bottom
and I've also changed keyboards so I
keep hitting the wrong keys at the
minute it's there we go she got the
result of five of seven and twelve which
is fine so that's a basic you know a
method a function that we pass variables
into and we get a result
but the situations where you want to
alter the variables herself so maybe you
you have a variables result and you want
it to actually be set here so instead of
doing that you would want to do say a B
and result and then this is expected to
have a result and then instead of
returning you'd actually say we result
equals first plus second and if we put a
breakpoint in there when we run okay no
longer got a return value when we run
this you'll see that the result doesn't
need twelve here we've passed in and
then we come out and the result of zero
outside of here
so you've got the result is is nothing
doesn't been set so this might confuse
some people at you know new inter to
programming and thinking well I've give
it the result and it's set the result so
why is it not changed and the answer
lies in the fact that when you're
passing things around in c-sharp that
you pass them certain things pass as as
references which by that we mean a
reference to the actual object itself so
we passed in results it would be the
actual object by default on some things
such as classes and then other things go
as copies so all things like integers
strings all basic stuff boolean as
characters they always go as a copy so
even though when you go into here you
pass these in this function can in no
way manipulate these values these are
simply copies when they go in so in
order to change that default behavior
have you fought keyword ref before the
value it will get passed in as a
reference but the function also needs to
know that it's expecting a reference so
you put the same thing in the function
and now by doing this at the front of
each
if we run it again you'll see that it's
now it's edited this actual value so we
put a breakpoint here where we did
before you can see that result is 12 and
when we come out this new result is 12
it's edited this exact instance so it's
sent of effectively a direct this value
straight in not as a copy
it hasn't cloned it and copied it in and
that's the point of Wrath and that's you
use it wherever you want that kind of
behavior where you expect the actual
value to be edited there's one other
than out exactly the same as ref but the
only difference without is if the value
decided to well as jump back as a give
its reference it simply means you're
giving it a reference to that object but
you're in no way expecting it to always
be changed so it might decide that's not
going to do that so this function might
just simply do nothing
might be a blank function and it's quite
happy being a blank function and then
result doesn't change if we change this
to out we're basically making a
statement that we are expecting that
this value is always going to be set and
that's typically used with when you
don't set the value either so if you had
say an INT result you define you declare
it or rather you define and we don't
declare it so you define a variable here
in two puts never been set it's it's on
set it's undefined all right I never
remember to I'm probably found
undeclared whichever you haven't
basically give it a value so you'd
usually use out when you expecting it to
always be set and a good example of that
is like if you're expecting to attempt
to convert a value and you're expecting
the result to be say true or false
so you matter a boolean that you're
expecting to be if is that true or false
so you might say this might be is a is
larger and this should basically then
say return in if first is greater than
second or rather not return
set the result of whether the first is
greater than the second but if if this
decided
never bother setting it like here then
we couldn't be guaranteed that the
result has actually changed so we can't
be guaranteed that this is definitely
true or false it could still be on set
or it could still be if we we're reusing
the same valuable it's set to true in
the last mod and we do is a larger than
B and then it simply goes I'm not going
to bother sat in it it could be like you
know if first has less than three or
just not going to do anything otherwise
we're gonna set the result and then it's
going to complain that the out parameter
result must be assigned to you you've
got to assign it because that's the
point about so like Raph it's still a
reference but it's also explicitly
stating that this function must set it
so once we've called this function and
it's passing us out we can be guaranteed
that this function has changed our value
so it doesn't matter what the default
value is going in it will always be you
know set so that's the point about where
you'll see things like that I believe is
like int tryparse
maybe yeah and it yields exactly that so
in dr. oz II which you fail and we could
do out into result and that would then
this result would guaranteed to be
always set so I think I've tapped result
too many times except it doesn't look
spelt correctly anymore
so if we did say boolean results equals
true and we passed it in as an out to
the try pass which we know will fail
then integer oh yes so if the result is
the end of you itself in this case so we
said we've got this variable result as
one and we try to pass it the entry pass
will always have to set the value so
even though the result is one and we
know this will fail because II isn't a
number so result right now is one even
though that failed its reset result to
zero so it can be guaranteed that it's
it's set that value and also try pass
will have return false so we know
the result even though it's zero isn't
the correct value so that's all there is
to refs and out that the basically you
pass in a direct link to the object
itself not a copy and then where that
changes where it's it's slightly
different it's basically just in the
default of what's being passed in so as
I mentioned certain things get passed in
automatically as a reference if you will
and one of those is a class so if we
made a new class so a class a value and
we then did a class equals new a class
and then we passed in a and a class and
we're basically wanting odd numbers is
not the right name anymore but doesn't
matter we will change first to that
second value to the class itself and
then here we're gonna say second dot a
value equals first change out to an int
so now we're doing the same thing as
before don't need the output anymore
where we're passing in two variables
like we did at the start but this time
it's an integer within a class and then
inside of here the class hasn't passed
as a reference or an out and we're
setting a value so if we step over the
code this time what we'll see us around
our class has a value of zero and we're
passing in five we're going to here it's
gonna set the value with a class in turn
allowed to five and when we come out a
class value is five so what's happened
there is the class has actually been
passed as a reference by default so you
don't make a copy of the class when you
pass it around
so unlike strings and integers and
things classes will naturally be
reference e so that's what you have to
also bear in mind that if you're
expecting too
in a class like this and for this to not
really set the real clastic in your
thinking it's a copy that's not the
default behavior
so that's thus again a change in simply
the default state if you want to get a
class you know a copy of a class which
is not what I recommend then you can do
I can't even thinks I'll never do it
there's a clone which is actually not
appearing on here but I'm sure there's
like a you know a member wise clone but
again it's not typically what you do so
a quick look you can do basically like a
a light copy of a class or you can do
like a deep copy where you're copying
are links so you get copy if you were
doing like a soft copy
let's do manually say you do a copy and
the way you copy the class is make a new
class and then inside the class you copy
a value equals a class dot a value and
you know you copy each value
individually and you pass in a copy but
then if the inner value was a class you
know a different class then this would
still be a reference so you've got sort
of a light copy and then a deep copy you
know and it depends how far you want to
go down coffee in the references but for
that reason alone I rarely in fact
almost I don't think I've ever ever copy
a plus as well as there's the very odd
occasion where our clone classes bought
thus again not not really recommend you
just simply the way you work with your
code is you you expect it to be you know
that way of you're passing a class in
you are going to expect that the
function can edit the class you know you
can change the values directly inside
the class so again this bit might be
obvious but just to show you if you
passed in a value of a class so that
would now be an integer then what do you
think would happen here if we do second
equals first
we passed an a value on the class and
see if you guess right so the value of
the class is zero it should get set to
five and the value of the class is still
zero so all that's happened there might
be obvious to some of you might have
expected that to be a reference
yourselves but that is an integer so
we've basically made a copy of that
integer so that's really all there is to
reference and outs if you have any other
questions or it didn't make sense let me
know again just sorry about the short
video this week but unfortunately I just
had power cost and didn't have time for
you know do any more I'll try again
another video after that we can but
again I am very busy but I'll try and
get up early tomorrow and we do there
the Installer video but hopefully this
videos still been useful to some of you
so let me know your thoughts in the
