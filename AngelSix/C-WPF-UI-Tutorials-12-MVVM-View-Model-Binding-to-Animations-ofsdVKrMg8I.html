the code into its own core project and
we also added dependency injection so we
could start doing some IOC code anywhere
in the project so right now we have the
application that loads you've got a side
menu and now we can access the view
models from anywhere in the application
I think now we're going to go back and
clean up a few things get them ready for
being final so one of the things we can
do is we're going to move the side menu
out this salmon you want to collapse out
the way in instances like this the
sign-in page you shouldn't need this
menu will sort out this button being
somewhere else I think up here maybe
four settings but basically this is when
you logged into the application so this
shouldn't be here right now so we're
going to basically get that out of the
way and again as the same when we change
pages we have this animation we haven't
finished changing pages yet but you see
the animation and we also want this to
like slide out the way and slide back in
and we also need to stay within binding
with view models so we want to do
binding on this side menu and we also
want it to animate so this side menu
right now is just a control or custom
control and we want to animate it off
the screen or on the screen based on a
property so we'll start by adding that
property to the app view model
application view model and we're going
to add an extra setting here a boolean
of side side menu visible and by default
we'll have it as false
so true if the side menu should be shown
that's our view modeled on now we want
to bind to this side menu visible now
because within an animation it's not
like we're just going to bind to
visibility or bind to width and use a
value converter we're actually trying to
play a storyboard to animate out and
animate in we've done that once before
in the text style for the spinner so
when the login buttons busy spins that
was done with a data trigger but that's
in sam'l so I'm going to show you a
different way of doing that as well as
been able to then do more advanced
things in code behind so again the only
thing you want in code behind in your
WPF project is always just pure UI codes
as much as possible it shouldn't really
have any other code behind in the UI it
should all be in your other project
should you know your core project or
your view models that's where your logic
should be but this is purely for UI so
what we want there's a new attached
property here that we'll use to animate
something so we want to first because
we're going to have say a default value
of false which by default is then it is
the default value of boolean in this
case if we then make a attach property
that starts false so we want to start
with this hidden we're not going to get
the we're not going to get the property
changed event firing so right now we
have a value property where if we move
this down so it's easier to see we have
this metadata on the property for any
attached property and we have a property
change callback and then on that
callback is when we'd then you know
animate but the problem is this will get
fired if we use a boolean which we will
be using and the value is already false
so we instead of just having a value
changed we need one that happens all the
time when the value is set even if it's
the same value so then we can override
this call and we have coerce value so
default value will just set as default
of this is called property and then
we've still got the property changed and
now we also want to add a new coerced
value call back and coerce is just
usually used to convert a value you know
tweak the value hence the would coerce
value we're going to just use this as
sort of a pass-through that we know that
our value is trying to be set so think
of this as more you know what value what
date it as a value changed it's it's you
set a boolean to true and then you set
it to true again this property change
wouldn't fire whereas because we're
using a coerced value it's always called
regardless of whether it's changed owner
so this works ideal for our animation
event because we want it to fire even at
the very start when we're first loading
up and nothing technically changed
because we still need to set the
animation to hide the side menu so we
created coerce call back for call us on
value of gated or on value property
updated and it's slightly different than
the property changed so we can copy and
paste this it's close enough
call back when the property has changed
even if it is the same value property
updated and you still get the dependency
object but now you just get an object of
the value so we don't actually get you
know the value itself and then from MA
we want to slide this out the way
as the wrong with terraria doesn't it
also needs to return the value because
the point as it takes on a value and
then tweaks it and returns it so now we
want to just fire that's will be value
won't fire a new event on value updated
which will also need to add and value
updated here and then we just return the
original value because we're not going
to change it so now we have these two
calls we will have an updated event as
well so even when the value is the same
be an object be a value updated at the
sender and the value says the event
value updated and we also have an
override abble event method here
and there's our call that we can now
override as well so that's just added to
the base attached property the ability
to listen out for your values changing
or in this case values being set even
when they haven't changed so now we need
to create a new touch property let's add
here plus I will call it framework
elements animation
attached properties as a big one name so
we're going to work on any framework
element which is pretty much any UI
element and it's going to be four
animations and then also there attached
properties so clean up the namespaces in
fact that plus doesn't need to exist
we're going to now make classes so
because this animator is going to have
multiple animations we'll make a base
class first so that we can use what we
need from this so I'll call this animate
base property and we'll need to know the
parent class in this case because we're
going to implement custom attached
properties it's going to be in the base
attached property like normal of
whatever parent we passed in and it's
all your going to be a boolean because
we're going to just simply animate based
on a true or false property all the time
for this we need to also tell it the
parents are still following within the
same expected style just like the base
attached property does and here so it's
got to follow that same thing so we need
to new at the end as well
I'm not so k so this is a purely it's
almost like a superclass of the base
attack proc deals we've really done as
kept abstract bubbled or forced it to
always be a boolean value but we can
still pass in any parent so this is just
a base class to run any animation method
when a boolean is set to true and a
reverse animation and set to false so
there will making you one of this way it
swipes over to the left when it's false
to hide the menu and swipes back to the
right to show so that we're going to use
this base one afterwards so now we've
got the base we're going to override the
value updated so whenever the value
changes at all and in this we want to
first make sure with our framework
elements because that's what we're
expecting in this is it should be
attached to framework elements so we can
now do if it's not sender is a framework
element will call the variable element
so if it isn't a framework element
simply return otherwise we've now got a
variable called element of type
framework element so we know it's been
attached to you know a UI element and
then from that I guess we want to we
still want to make sure the value is
changed because if somebody sets the
side menu true
and then they set it to true again you
don't want the side menu to slide in
twice so we're on the sender don't get
value value property so basically get
the current value of you know this
because this doesn't pass them the
original value this is this is what it's
going to be set to
afterwards but we need what you
currently is so this is like jacking of
exchanged so if that equals the same
value then you want to return
so don't fire
if the volume doesn't change and you
might be thinking right now well you
just said we need to fire whenever it
changes even if it's the same value
that's true but only in the case when
it's the first load so if we set it to
false so we attach a property to this
here and set it to false by default the
only time we wanted to fire regardless
is at the very start the first load so
we can hide this menu after that if
somebody sets it to false again it's
already hidden we don't want to
reanimate it in so we need this value
updated to run so that we always get
fired but only for the reason of it
being fired when it first loads up
that's the only point so as well as this
check don't fire the values the same we
also need to keep track of whether this
is the very first time this animation
properties been run which would be
basically when it loads up so we need a
new for a region here a boolean called
first load fire yeah
first load and it's true by default flag
indicating this as the first time this
property has been loaded so now we can
say well don't fire with values the same
but it's also got to be not the first
run so basically because the first time
that is run or the values different if
you invert that logic then we'll carry
on so the first time it runs will always
hit here regardless of the value because
it's never been run before so that will
happen for us automatically also if it's
the first run what you'll find is if we
attach something to here now attached
properties evaluate before the elements
even loaded so they get a chance to you
know alter the element and do what they
need before it loads the problem for us
is that we want to animate this out
the screen we need to know the width it
currently is in order to animate it that
far out while at the point when the
touch properties are first run the
element isn't loaded so therefore the
width is nothing it's not being
calculated yet so we could force a
calculation on the width but instead a
simpler way is if it's the first time
it's loaded then what we'll do is wait
for the element to load and then run the
action otherwise any other time after
that we know the elements been loaded
we're fine we just call whatever action
we need to call so first thing I need to
do is say if it's the first load so say
on first load and we want to basically
hook into the elements unloading event
and unhook automatically so I want like
a single fire so create a single for
self on who cabal event for the elements
loaded event so basically a fire wants
event so a little trick to do that
only the rooted event and left which is
what the loaded event handler is or
unload is from static - nope so
technically it's been assigned and then
we'll actually make the unloaded
something so in this case we'll create
the event and then hook into the loaded
event of the element so element dot all
loaded plus equals unloaded and the
reason we set this to null and not
straight set it to this and I'll show
you why if I just do this is because in
order to make something be able to
unhook itself like this we can now say
right we've unloaded to the element this
will get fired now this event here is
fired we want to unhook ourselves so you
do element loaded - equals unloaded and
you want to you know unhook ourselves
so basically that's functional only ever
run once and you can see the issue use
of a non assign local variable so you
try to make this valuable and you're
defining it here this is the definition
of the variable but inside the
definition of itself is trying to unhook
itself so this confuses Visual Studio
and the compiler so simple trick to that
assign ignore and then right after
assigning to value now inside here we
can now technically on hook it because
it's happy that it's been assigned
even those Nords been assigned so you
can unhook it but by the time this ever
gets to here we've already assigned it
the actual event so this is this whole
thing here basically I don't know if
I've done any kind of pattern that other
people have done I just made this up
years ago of a way of doing like a
single you know an event that'll fire
once and unhook itself so you don't have
to worry about it you know beam on
hooped afterwards so I don't know
whether anybody else has ever done this
but this is the way I do it
so all this here just creates a single
event that is this event here or
effectively now whatever's here so this
will run if it's the first load it will
hook into the element wait for it to
load and then run the code and the code
once have run is was just call it do
action which is basically whatever we
want you know this is an abstract class
so this is just for an animation when we
override this class then this is the
function that actually does something so
this will be do option or really do
animations the better name because
that's what we now want to do we want to
do an animation
it needs the elements giving the value
so it knows what it is and that's really
it so do desired animation we'll make
that a protected virtual void do
animation framework elements and the
value
the animation method is fired and there
are changes the element will new value
so that's if it's the first load and
once we have done the animation we also
then need to make sure we're no longer
in first load so first load equals false
so now we've run once the next time it
gets changed for one it'll then never
fire again until the value does change
because now that's false and then
secondly when we get to this if
statement this won't fire so anytime
it's the second time around simply call
the do animation in fact we also need to
should we just copied that do the
animation and make sure we're no longer
in first load in fact saying that now
that's a silly thing to do if we've
already got to the if statement then we
you know we're not in first loads that
sir I put must think so there's the base
function I mean just common this
actually we don't need comment this
because the it's an override method
which is commented in the base
so first load is set so hopefully you
understand what's going on now so this
will get fired whenever the value set on
here the first time an attached property
and it'll also get fired whenever the
value changes we only want to run when
the value changes unless it's the first
time and I'm the very first load this
will get fired before the elements
loaded all the time that's a guaranteed
thing so we then wait for the element to
be loaded
unhook so we only have a fire once and
then we basically do whatever we want to
do when it's loaded
so all this what will help her class
does is really this he just waits for
the element to load it's the first load
and then
simply does something when the value
changes so all this is doing is
performing this unknown action when the
value changes from true or false that's
it but the difference is if it's the
very first time it simply waits for the
element to load so that we've got you
know we need to use the element size for
animation so that's all that's doing so
now we've got the base we can go ahead
and create the actual animation so let's
make an another public class we'll call
it animates slide in left or slide slide
in from left property and that's going
to override the animate base property of
itself this animate a framework element
it makes a framework element sliding it
in from the left on show and flying out
to the right out to the left on hide and
the only thing we want to do now is
override the do animation of you know
what we actually want to do on the
animation so in this case if the value
so if showmenu basically have the values
true concept animate in so the animation
will need to be created as well and so
about storyboard animations page
animations we're going to need copy and
paste this class we need framework
element animations we name the class and
in the file rather help us to animate
framework elements in specific ways we
want slide and fade in from right as
fine we also need to add another slide
element in from the right the element to
animate this is now a framework elements
that's just a copy and paste of the page
animations we're just now tweaking them
for elements which is very similar
create the storyboard slide from right
element window width is now going to be
the elements actual width fading is the
same and what's the same that's it
that's that's converting from a page
animation to an element animation and
same for this one an element the
elements framework elements window width
is actual width and that's it so we've
got now a copy of the page animation
class just with these two functions well
slave slide and fade in from right with
the page sliding this way we want to
slide and fade in from the left so we
need to copy and paste this and we need
to tweak it to go the other way so slide
them fade in from left slide and fade in
from left I don't think exists knows we
need to make that now in the storyboard
helped us and it was called add slide
from left to go move out the way
add slide from right so we copy and
paste this in the storyboard helpers
add the slide from left animation to the
storyboard a distance to the left to
start from
I've actually wrong from the note
everything add slide from add slide from
right the distance to the right to start
from oh yeah that's right so this is the
left to start from add slide from left I
create a new animation from left right
so just invert these in that case that
becomes a minus that becomes a plus so
you animate from the left then you start
at your negative left you know over here
and you animate to zero so you slide in
so that's it and add slide to left we no
need to do add slide to right when we
want to slide out so again copy and
paste that add the slide to write
animation the story with a blah blah
blah the distance to the right to start
from and so in this case slide to the
left the distance to the right to start
from that's wrong the distance to the
left to end that because we're going to
the left so this will be add slide
right actually other than we need that
desperate is messing so I'll add it
anyway
add the slide to left animation the
distance to the right any confused here
I'd slide to left animation I'd like to
write animation the distance to the
sliding to the right that way oh yeah
for when we slide in add slide to right
so that's B the distance to the right
and right there we go I was confusing so
slide to right means you start heading
out the way on the left and move in so
that looks right add slide to left so
going in so add slide to right this is
well depends how we I don't then we're
going to use this one so to keep it the
same we're starting at this place and
sliding out is that what we do with
everyone
oh yeah so we always start at zero and
slide it away from zero so add slide to
right
and slide from left I think the name in
slightly off here will sort the naming
out another time let's just do the
function so add slide to right will
simply invert these I should be all the
functions we need so back to the the
slide and fade in from left that's when
the menus coming out we're now slide
from left so we come out to the width of
the element and yes that should start at
- oh yeah so we started from end at zero
oh that was right them so we start out
the way and we slide into and we start
this far out of the way so it's
completely out the way we slide into
zero and we also fade in so the same as
the page animation it's just that we're
sliding in from the left hand side so
animate in here back at the attached
property so if we want to how to make
the side menu end then we can now await
the element because it's an extension
method of elements and we've got the
name space right yup so going to do
await let's make this an async
aliment dot slide and fade in from left
and we've got the animations seconds
which will default to a third of a
second and do that for now otherwise
animate out so now we need slide and
fade out to left yeah I think that's it
slide and fade out to left this also
needs a default time three point three
seconds slide and fade in slide and fade
out slam fade it in
so in from right in from left out to
left we also want to out to right just a
for completeness lies nomination out to
the right add slide to right and that's
it so go and use that boots they're
ready so that's now the attach property
so if we attach this property to the
side menu now and we give it a value of
false the base class should fire this
because the value is updated to false
from being nothing will pass through all
these checks because it's the first load
so then we'll get into this first load
we'll wait for the element to load and
then we'll call this do animation which
will then fire this so let's start with
that and let's at least see if that
works or in fact let's compile first so
don't quite a bit of code there let's
make sure it compiles so compiles fine
so that's at access property to a side
menu so to do that we just do a local
prolyl on animate slide them from left
of a you equals false compile how it's
cool and just seeing it actually
automatically call it that but this just
animate it out let's see if that works
again
they sit animate out so I'm guessing now
if we run this it's going to work and
they see so that's led out so we've got
a few issues I can see now actually got
quite a few issues so issue one notice
this bottom corners now got a sharp
point I'll have to fix that issue to the
grid hasn't shifted over even though
it's all the way I think I know why that
one is an issue for we actually see this
thing slide out when you first open
which we don't want to see if this is
the initial state to be hidden we don't
want to every time somebody opens the
app to see the menu slide out so let's
fix those issues first I'll start with
the easy one so so this is really if
it's the first load we don't want to
animate so all we need to do to fix that
is change the time so the animation of
here is point three seconds so let's do
first load if it's the first load do it
in no seconds otherwise how to make the
same answer nice simple fix so basically
this is the first initial animation on
the you know the very first load
basically set to the end point
straightaway circuit in no time to
animate so it just instantly goes to off
the screen so let's run that and we
should basically see no there we go so
we didn't see that animation at all now
let's fix I guess this grid well no
let's fix this corner thing first now
we've got this shot edge one now let's
fix the slide in let's get that sorted
so why do we start with that this is in
a column of 300 width so chains up to
auto to start with and let's set the
width of this control to 300 see if that
makes a difference
nope so that must mean this element is
still even though we've moved the margin
over oh I know why I just clicked in
what we were doing we go into these
animations I think it's in the
storyboard animation these slide
functions so every one of them so we're
going to slide from the right we'll go
in from we're going from off the screen
on the right hand side and sliding from
the right to the left and so well really
is from right to know yet sliding from
the right to where it is but you can see
what I did here I basically animated the
left margin to the opposite of the right
margin so as the element was sliding in
from this side it was keeping the the
size of the actual element the same so
it wouldn't like squash and and move in
which is okay but we need to add an
override so keep margin we'll call it
and we'll set that by default to true
for give us a parameter name whether to
keep the elements at the same width
during animation and this will then be
keep margin question mark offsets
otherwise you know
and then we'll have to sort of copy this
for everyone it's got the same issue on
everyone that were what's happening is
when we're sliding this menu and I don't
know how to build them yeah I should do
when we slide this menu out this way
what we're doing is we're making the
left margin negative so this menu slides
over but we'll making the right margin
positives our slide out this way back up
to here so this is basically just a big
right hand margin from the animation
that's you know been padded out if we
remove that this thing should shrink in
so we're going to add this property by
default so we don't screw up the page
animations add this to all of them just
going to add the note to all of them
first and that's just the fade ins
there's only a few so I've added the
note now let's add the actual property
ah
that's the properties I did and now we
want to do the same code for the
negative mullet the inverse Mulligan so
slide from right change the slide from
left rather we change the right arm
margin slide to left so from where we
are out to the left
so negative left check probably want to
keep the right margin slide to right so
from where we are out for left margin
and that's it
so that's been added to the slide
animations we then need to change slide
and fade in from left we need to add it
to here as well so keep margin by
default we'll have true copy that same
comment again so keep margin keep
merging
and we simply pass that into the
function there and I was wrong with that
Oh dis elevation ratio we need to
specify that it's keep margin so same
here
with the comments
once more
and that's all those functions so
finally now when we call the actual
slide and fade them from left in this
instance we don't want to keep the
margin so keep margin is going to be
false
so basically animates out the way and
the margin simply means that the element
will disappear hopefully so let's run
this now and we should see that the
login page takes up the entire screen
yeah there we go let's just temporarily
animate that so we can at least see it
animate so changes to 0.34 now just for
a quick visual so we should see the
after the page is going to load in at
the same time so yeah you don't really
get to see that so let's ignore that for
the moment for we can see that that's
fits the the margin issue so I think the
last issue now is the this cut here so
I'm trying to think well this would be
well there's two theory bound that Emily
yes that's already bound so that's fine
right well let's first get change the
login view model I mean let's get
something so we can click and and see
this thing that I'm eating so at least
we've got some repeatable clicks so just
use this register async which at the
moment when you click that veggies to
text at the bottom runs us code so when
we click this text here it basically
loads the register page let's just
hijack that a moment let's just return
from there and we want to get the
application view model from the
dependency injection and change the side
menu visible so basically toggle it from
being whatever it currently is hide or
show so now when we click that link we
should see the side menu slide in and
out and we actually then we should also
see this compress up or not so yes our
menu visible oh and on our works we
bound her helps if you actually bind the
control we just set it to false so this
we need to bind the same as we've done
here to basically the application view
model not current page run side menu
visible and that should
on out of left the value converter on
get rid of that
all right so now we know like changes it
should animate n which we now missed
clicking let that remove that breakpoint
there we go
so you can see now it animates in and
out just noticed yet another issue so if
you look right here on the edge down
this edge you'll see the other menus
animating into the padding so let's slow
down that animation so you can see that
where is the animation there so let's
change that to 20 seconds nice and slow
so you can see what I mean
so see here now so it's overlapping the
edge of the window so let's just fix
that I think that's an easy fix I think
what we've done is used padding instead
of margin in this case so yeah so the
main padding of the hole around here so
we change this to zero so you can see so
this you know the main padding here the
reason we added this padding was for
adding the drop shadow to the window
we've done padding we should just do
margin and the difference then is it's
not you know just pushing the control
then it's telling them that their actual
available space is less so I think I
should fix that
minor issue there
there we go so now there's nothing
overlapping the edge there that's that
bit fixed just change the speed back
and so all that's really left is to fix
this and what you can see is actually
there's the corner and as you're going
out I think it's taking the corner where
it's almost I think then you can see
down here watch a little white things
appear down here so that tiny bit of why
there it's actually stretched to the
background so yes definitely
the content is is stretching out it's
not clipping inside of its container so
I think all's we need to do for that is
the thing that contains the when are we
can't be bounds the things that contains
the page you would go the page contents
so this border that holds you know all
of the content here I think we just want
to add clips to bones so true and that
will force any content basically
anything we we put in the window then
which is this stuff here no it doesn't
keep it yeah just so this stuff here the
actual content is now going to have to
stay clipped inside of the container
which is the thing that's got the
rounded edge so I think that should fix
the clip in hopefully oh yeah so there
you go that's gone now so there's no a
nice side menu that's actually animating
in and animating out based on just a
view models property to say when we want
to show or hide that menu which is
exactly what we want that's sort of the
point of view model is we now have an
app view model that
defines the state of our application we
can set the current page to a page to
change the page we can now just set the
simple boolean value anywhere in code
whether we want the menu to hide or show
and now through the binding I'll enter
the attack property we now let us a nice
animation and you can click it really
fast and it doesn't you know nothing
breaks it just works as you should
so there's a side menu completely sorted
now from by default it's out of the way
for the sign-in page which is what we
want then when we finally go through and
you know Sign In
which I've just realised we need to
press an enter to start that button off
as well
once we're signed in we can then simply
you know bring this menu in and then
slide in the the chat page so I'd say
that's now done in terms of at least the
side menus out the way and slides then
again we still going to style this
scroll bar obviously to suit and I think
next will probably fix this login page
finish the animation because right now
when you animate between pages so if I
go to the login view model comment this
out a moment so we can see the register
page when we animates the register page
firstly the sign-in page simply
disappears then the register page slides
in we want the first page to slide out
while this is sliding in so we need to
fix that we also have this navigation
bar at the top which doesn't confine to
our view model and it's also in the way
of our you know expandable drag here
it's too close to the edge to to drag so
it's our application view model still
thinks we're on the login page and we
could be on either so I think all will
do for now is remove this navigation
property and remove the bar and we
obviously we handle navigation then
however we want an our own application
so I think we'll probably fix that in
the next video so that the sign-in page
register page and the side menu are
fully done
and then we can add some dummy code that
just simply signs in well maybe do a
pop-up dialog that can say you know
incorrect password if we enter one and
then we'll make a default dummy password
in code so at least we can get to the
sign-in part click login then the side
menu can slide out the Chapman you can
load in you know get the thing actually
functioning fully so I think that's it
for that video I think it's been long
enough and hopefully we understood all
that again it's just another way of
using the attached properties to then
run some custom code of you well in this
case starting animation what we could
have done anything with that but that's
one way of now adding an animation to
any framework elements so you should now
be able to attach this not this attached
property to any framework element at all
and set it to true or false have it
animating in and out based on whatever
value you decide to bind to so we could
have touched this to something else
anywhere in the application as well
doesn't even have to be here so let's go
to say where's the login page pages
login page let's attach it to this
button no idea of us our work simply
attach it to the button exactly how this
and run and we should see that this
login button isn't there when we open
there we go on we animate in login
button animates n as well and animates
out so you can literally attach this to
now any literally any element you wants
you can interact you to be easy
connected to this you could detach it to
any UI element at all in the application
and get this effect you know the thing
we've made this animation so hopefully
that's made you realize how useful sort
of that attack property is so we can say
attach it to this password box
let's see the password box works as well
what you should do because we're just
simply messing with the margins click
the Run button and there you go see it's
fading then you can see that it's a it's
not clipped within the bounds here so
you see the password box sliding out but
again to fix that we should have to just
I think I need some stackpanel
click the down screw I think that'd be
enough and there you go so again just an
attached property that now works with
our custom animation so just check up on
done all the temporary code I'll leave
the better code in that animates on this
button just so you can play with it
yourself and again I'll put the link to
the source code in the video anything
you don't understand in video is if
things are confusing to you again I just
do these the way I you know naturally
come up with them at the time if you
don't understand anything feel free to
just comment and I'll definitely get
back to you I can even do follow-up
videos for you no tricky problems or go
in a bit more deeper into explanation so
don't feel like you don't understand it
you just you've got nowhere to go simply
comment and I'll get back to you and you
know help you understand it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
