connect power to the socket here so plug
that in and then you can flick the
switch ready and the next thing you'll
need is your computer cable
so either DisplayPort or HDMI whatever's
getting go into your monitor and then
you will want to find your graphics card
which is the slot here and I've taken
out one of these little stops that's a
HDMI we're going to use DisplayPort here
and simply clicking a DisplayPort cable
and then plug the other end into your
monitor and you also need a keyboard and
mouse so again all the USB is here the
top ones are standard so that's why the
black so USB to the blue are typically
USB 3 and you can have 3.1 as well so
for keyboard and mice just go ahead and
use your standard socket up here and
just plug in your keyboard and your
mouse and then we can go ahead and try
booting up the machine so we've got a
computer built got all the power cable
the monitor the mouse and keyboard
plugged in the next step is to use
another computer or use a friend's
computer and to download Windows or you
can potentially buy a CD from a store of
here you want to go that way if you
install the CD into your computer but
the modern way in the easy way is to
simply download Windows and put it onto
a USB stick so you'll need a USB thumb
drive and then in Google type in Windows
10 download and the top link should be
this download Windows 10 disk image and
now we want to download this
installation media tool save that and
then once it's downloaded open the tool
and you want to accept the license and
then we don't want to upgrade this
computer we want to create a USB Drive
for installing on a new computer I'm
going to change this from USD UK exam in
the UK and then click Next this will
warn you about which Edition you've
selected to make sure it's the same as
the one that you intend to purchase a
license for so I'm fine just windows 10
is ok USB flash drive I want to create
all can simply download it to an ISO for
later but I'm happy to just use a USB
flash drive right now
so now go ahead and plug in your USB
flash drive into your computer into you
know this computer that we're
downloading it on not your computer
you've just build and then there's the
USB drive which is F Drive now refresh
the list it's now found the F Drive so
that's the one we want to use and now it
will be downloading windows 10 I'm
guessing at the moment so this progress
will take a little while I've got really
fast internet so it shouldn't take too
long but I'll just fast forward this
part of the video
and now it says it's done so we click
this F Drive you can see here all the
setup files so now we can safely eject
that USB you right click and so now we
can safely remove that USB stick so we
close that down and remove the USB stick
and then we'll plug it into the computer
we want to install it on and we'll go
from there
now you have your windows on your memory
stick that we made how many to go you
can go ahead and connect this to one of
the USB ports and now you can turn your
computer around and press the on button
which in this case on my case is here
and we'll get going with the boot up
process so the first thing you need to
do with everything plugged in you get
USB with Windows on your keyboard your
mouse your power and your monitor you
want to turn on the computer and when
you turn on the computer you want to
look on the screen which will only
appear briefly usually the delete button
for BIOS and f11 or f12 for a boot menu
most modern computers it won't matter
you'll simply turn it on and it will
boot from the USB and I'm pretty sure
this one will but if not then you can
press del to get into the BIOS and
change the boot order it's all of a
quick look at the BIOS so go ahead and
turn it on you can see there it was a
very brief screen I think I just saw the
doubt and the BIOS and now you can see
we've missed pressing down
so we've messed the BIOS blood doesn't
matter it's gone straight into booting
windows so I guess we'll just install
windows in this case I think it's safe
to say almost all modern computers will
boot from the USB straight away if not
then you simply look for boot menu or
BIOS and then in the BIOS you look for
boot order and you simply you know move
the USB to a higher priority or simply
add USB icon and give any board in the
last five years that won't
from USB so you should be safe to simply
answer the USB into the computer and you
should get to the screen so I'm going to
leave it set to United Kingdom and click
next and then install now and then this
is activate Windows so we don't have a
key yet we'll purchase online afterwards
so simply if I don't have a product key
we should be able to continue fine and
then depending on which one you plan to
buy you can select the right version
here so I'll get pro with this machine
so just click Next and then accept the
license and click Next and then here's
have you've already got something on
your hard drive we haven't so it's
simply install windows only and then
here we can see our one terabyte hard
drive
clicking you apply which will make it
the full size and then simply click ok
to the warning that's just going to
create all the partitions needed for
Windows and then it's already selected
the primary partition and it's created
these three others than it needs for
booting up and recovery so just leave it
all as stands and click Next and that's
pretty much it so now we sit and wait
for the files to coffee get installed
finished and then the machine will we
start the only thing you want to be
careful of is once Windows is installed
and the Machine wants to restart you
will want to remove the install USB
stick otherwise what might happen on
some machines is you'll basically have a
computer restart and then you'll get
back into the installer and you'll start
this whole process again so you'll end
up in like this loop where you seem to
think hang on I've just installed it but
now it's asking me install and that's
simply because windows might boot off
the USB before the hard drive and again
modern computers it's not usually that
way they have the internal hard drive as
the first boot device and then USB
afterwards so we'll see we'll leave it
in for this machine
and let's see if it works and if it does
loop then you'll you'll see what's
happening but if you get that issue when
you've installed Windows that you end up
back in the Installer then simply remove
the USB stick and restart the machine
and it should boot into the actual
install windows and windows was pretty
quick at installing now this is a it's
not a super fast machine but it's a
pretty high spec machine we've built the
main advantage of this install it being
fast will be that this Windows USB stick
is an USB 3 stick and the PC has got an
SSD so a lot of the windows installer is
basically copying files pretty much just
copy the files after the USB stick for
the most part so this install should
take probably another another minute or
so so I'll simply fast forward until it
gets to the point where it restarts and
then we'll carry on from there and there
you go you can see it's now finished
that took about two more minutes and it
just starts itself and a few more
seconds so this is the point when you
remove the USB stick if you wanted to as
let the screen block off and then pull
the stick but again I'm pretty sure we
won't have the issue and I'm leaving it
in for this one but if we end up back in
the windows installer then it's simply a
case if you need to remove the USB stick
because now windows and installed it
doesn't need these the USB Drive anyway
so you can leave it in or you can take
it out if you have issues take it out
basically and there you can see clearly
the first Dell to run BIOS press f11 to
add the boot menu and now this is
booting into Windows I'm pretty sure
this is the dental hard drive there we
go so getting devices ready and you can
see we've got a card notice s on modern
motherboards likely that the Windows
boot process seems to overlay the
motherboards launch image in the
background when it's loaded
so all motherboards are different but
it's like a lot of Windows quark I've
noticed this this happens and I think
it's so that motherboards can provide
their own custom windows logo if you
will
so the loading circle of the only thing
that we draw is on the screen and it
leaves everything else as default so
kind of a strange looking thing when you
use the windows just showing their logo
but I've noticed this on a few boards
and then it just fluttered up and said
we start into this is just windows
finishing a few more install steps and
then I think this time around we should
end up in the getting started which I
think will be Cortana because it's the
latest Windows so we're going to have a
voice-activated cortana kicking in and
wanting to guide us through the finished
set up next so let's see where we get to
but all in all this is only taking about
I'd say six seven minutes since we
started so Windows is rapidly improved
the install speed and there we go so now
language UK for me UK again don't want
to add a second keyboard so I'll skip
that connect it to a network I'm going
to skip for now that's where you can set
up after you've internet so who's going
to use this PC is going to be luke but
in fact I'm setting this up for somebody
at work so this will be will add another
user afterwards and remove mine but an
hour looks fine password I'll do confirm
password and add a hint about no I don't
want my password and then here we go so
this is caught on a personal assistant
and I'm pretty sure this would provide
sound bought it's trying to come out of
the computer and we don't have any audio
plug them so we're simply not hearing
but if you've got speakers plugged in
then this would be talking to you right
now
so select on fiber bar I want no four
there so this is basically collecting
personal information I'd click no to
that and I'd also turn off all these so
you don't need any of these to do
anything
I'm very empty sharing of my information
online so turn them all off that's why I
highly recommend click accept you can
always turn these back on if you feel
like after book I'd honestly default all
of these to just off and then accept and
now this is the last step so we
basically sit back and wait and again
this will probably take a minute or two
and then it will just log us straight
into the Windows desktop so that's how
easy installing windows is there's
there's nothing really more to it it's
certainly easier than it used to be and
it's a lot quicker than it used to be
and then once you're in the desktop I
will go through I mean that's all you
need to install windows you're good to
go from there but I'll take you to a few
few things I always do at the start and
again it's preference you don't have to
do them but as a couple of things I do
as soon as a new PC is installed so
we'll just wait for this to finish and
then we'll go through that our modern
day long on about 30 seconds and there
we have it so now we're in Windows this
is a 4k monitor 43 inch and you can see
we've got low resolution at the many -
everything's a bit grainy you probably
can't see it on the camera but this is
the only probably 1k resolution but
because Windows has just kicked in we
already saw something pop about a
display driver so generally just let
Windows sit for a few seconds and see
here searching for display driver so
that's down at the bottom right this
little notification area and you'll tend
to find that just leaving this is enough
to get the display driver to kick in so
the screen will probably flicker in a
minute and all go high-resolution until
when you can see this here this is close
on ask me anything so I don't know
open calculator it's not really asking
or anything that's just searching so
this thing is for sort of similar to I
guess
iPhone Siri and the Amazon echo and
things that you know the speech assisted
search I simply don't want that's right
is right click anywhere in this dark out
you're down here on the task bar whether
people listening is clusters taskbar yep
and then show task view we move this as
well so let's first remove the search
which is up here Cortana hidden the
store I don't like anyway let's again we
click it it opens Windows Store but
there's no internet on this at the
minute so that's that but again I
right-click on here and on pin and I'll
remove it Internet Explorer now there's
no internet as I mentioned on this at
the minute I'll connected an Ethernet
cable and I didn't install wireless and
that's because we all use Ethernet at
work but the first thing I do is open up
Internet Explorer type Firefox download
Firefox and install that and then make
that my default browser now just
certainly a lot better than it used to
be but I still prefer Firefox so again
your preference you might want Chrome
but I'd certainly get you Internet
Explorer setup first this is a task view
so we click this it takes it just graze
out and you can't really see but it is
you can have like multiple desktops over
I'll say notepad open or rather sticky
notes is decided to open up notepad so
I've got a notepad here say desktop one
and then if I click this task view and I
click new desktop down this bottom right
I can now have two desktops so in this
desktop I could open say some files up
and I could be working on me files and
you can flick between your desktops and
have multiple desktops again I don't use
this feature
so let's first remove the second desktop
and then I will right-click on the
taskbar down here again and I will
uncheck the show task View button that
gets rid of that that cleans that up
then I'd open up a file explorer either
with Windows key and E or by clicking
here and then I'd go to view options I'd
change and uncheck these that I want to
show my recent files or frequent use
files click apply clear
previous and I also want to change that
the open file browser goes to this PC by
default so right now it's getting to
this quick access which shows me
downloads documents pictures but I've
got them in the side anyway so I'm
getting the exact same view here and
here it's like wasted so I change it to
this PC and then what that does now if I
close that and open a new one we now go
to the PC which can see the hard drive
and you can see the USB stick with the
installer so that's the the settings of
the file explorer and then obviously
from there you'd install you might want
to install Kaspersky antivirus Windows
comes built with Windows Defender which
is here so we double click the shield or
maybe right-click and open you
technically got this protection which is
firewall antivirus put your mouth on
something stronger than that see
mountain to get Kaspersky is what I use
at the moment then you set up you emails
and by default I do use this mail that's
built into the Windows installer I think
it's quite good so I keep that and then
if you want to change your theme to dark
right-click on the desktop personalize I
go to theme and all the other colors I
think it's them and I change it to dark
so at least part of this is dark and
then you'll see on my videos I have this
also dark the file explorer and there's
basically something called UX theme
patcher and there's a bunch of themes
you can get that you can install into
Windows I think the one I'm using right
now is after dark I think it's called or
arc but I'll post in the comments I'll
look at what I use and also post a link
to if you want the actual file explorer
dark as well again it's just easier on
the eyes and then finally you can see
this display either has installed which
it has so now the display drives install
the can bump this up to 4k resolution
and there we go you can keep the changes
and you can see how tiny the screens
gone now
it's crystal clear but it's really small
so you won't be able to see this well I
see you might be able to see it on the
camera but now we want to change the
scaling which is here which was just
above the resolution and you can change
the scales go to 250 a CF thing goes
nice and big again so I tend to run I
think about 250 and you can see now here
there's the resolution and then above it
was the scaling and you can change it to
whatever you want and I find 250 works
again now everything is scaled up so
that's really the windows install that
should get you from basically packing up
a computer to fully building and
installing windows and you're ready to
go I guess one of the things I mentioned
that I purchased Windows Pro now what
you might not realize that you don't
even need to pay for a license as such
so Windows allows you to use Windows 10
perfectly free the only difference is
when it's free and you go to personalize
you can't typically change themes and
certain things are limited now this is
probably just not kicked in because
we've got a great period and we also
don't have internet but once you'd
install Internet and do anything this
will start locking up things like
personalizing the desktop and you'll
also potentially have an activate
windows down here but in general you can
use Windows completely on activated with
no problem if you do buy a license and I
recommend you do and you press the
Windows key to get to here since I've
been activate you should see activation
pop-up and then here you can see
activate Windows now Windows 10 Pro
change product key so once you've
purchased a product you click change
product key and you'd enter it here and
then go next
and you'd activate your copy of Windows
and again you can actually get to that
from right clicking on the desktop and
click either display or personalize it
doesn't matter and then
or can you get to it from here I thought
you could maybe not in click home yeah
so click either one then click the home
at the top left then go to I'm guessing
was it in updates and security and then
activation and then it's there so it's
hidden in the same settings that's how
you find that yes I think that's that
covers everything so hopefully this was
useful you can now go ahead and build
your own computer from scratch any
questions any issues any comments just
leave them in the video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
