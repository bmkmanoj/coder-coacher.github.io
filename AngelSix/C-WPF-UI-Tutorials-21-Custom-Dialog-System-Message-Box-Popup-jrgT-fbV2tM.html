system in terms of not pop-up menus like
this in terms of an actual like a
message box a dialog whenever we do
things so if we want to confirm
something or simply display a warning to
the user or a message to the user like a
normal message box their peers and to
give an example we're going to just
simply bind it to the send button for
now to pop up something and what you got
to bear in mind when we're doing this
now is to keep the separation of concern
between the UI layer and the every other
layer in the application so we want to
make use of IOC and the fact that for
example in the say the chat message
ListView model when the user clicks the
send button so one of the things we'll
do here is quickly just add a command
some command I'll keep that comments the
same command for when the user clicks
the send button and then we'll create it
here some flavor parameter called send
or a function rather
I will say sends a message obviously it
won't in this instance because we're
gonna use it to do something else so
right now in the Senate let's say we
wanted to display a message box to the
user and also the other thing that you
have to bear in mind and it might not be
obvious and it might also be hard to
understand at first is your application
should be able to run without any UI and
now not in terms of as a functional
application that you could you know pass
to a user and actually use but it needs
to run without a UI as much as
physically possible in order to a unit
test you know to make sure your
application works and to be able to
write some coded tests that can like say
we have a pop up that should get a
user's name it's going to ask them to
type in the name well if you want to
unit test that function and everything
around that function that wants to get
some information from the user and come
back and carry on but you want to
automate that whole process you need to
be able to replace the UI with a unit
testing like an automatic reply system
so ensure you simply need to keep as
much of the things you think we UI not
hard-coded in a UI it also keeps the
link between these two separate and
that's the point of this IOC so right
now the IOC we simply have a view model
so we can access the view model from
anywhere in the whole application now
the same is going to be true for UI so
we want to make UI insert into the IOC
so that in this view model is send I can
simply tag IOC UI dot show message and
we can actually fire off anywhere in the
application even in the view models a
function that will show a message box
the user based on whoever implements the
UI so one of the first things we need is
let's create a new folder we're always
a folder we'll just call it pop-ups for
now businesses or dialogues that Sabella
and we will call this massive box dialog
view model and this is going to be a
base view model and they'll make sure
their description matches
okay so just any old description so a
message box or details for a message box
dialog simple enough for now and that
will have a title we'll also have a
message and then the dialogues also
going to have an OK button
so we're going to allow that to be
customized as well we'll pull out ok sex
so we have a view model that we can now
create and then pass into a function so
the next thing we want is in the IOC
will create a new folder called base
because that's of the IFC itself and
then we'll have interfaces and then here
we will add a new interface and we'll
call it I you I manager and this is
going to be the interface that any
application so any part of your
application because this is in core
which is the the low-level project that
everything else will reference when this
grows because we put the interface in
here every part of the application can
now call this so we'll have alice is the
UI manager handles any UI interaction in
the application and we will have a task
because we need to await for the the
message box to close so we can you know
when you start it the task won't return
until it's been closed and by when we
clean and then simply do a task and then
show message and then we'll pass in the
message box dialog view model and that's
like displays a simple message talks to
the user so that's always there so got
an IUI manager in the IOC we will add in
here just as a helper to quickly get
access to it will do I um I 0 and we
will call you I and that will simply be
a property that doors is you get an
attempt to get the UI manager so it's
just a quick way instead of writing IOC
get basically instead of adding this
every time got to get the UI manager you
can simply write IOC you is such a
shortcut and a shortcut to access the I
new iron manager so right now this would
fail because we haven't bound the air
flight we bound the view model you have
to bind something to that interface in
order to it for this IOC to figure out
either where to get it from so we'll do
that in a minute but now we go back to
the send here we could effectively do
IOC dot UI dot show message and then
we'd have to make a new view model we
could pass on the title of send message
a message of thank you for writing a
nice message and the update text of the
button to say ok and now that is
completely UI independent so the call
has no idea which is where we are right
now the core has no idea of UI and yet
we can invoke and call a UI function so
now we just want to bind this function
to do something so that's going to come
in in the app dot example because this
is the the project if you will still
have actually implement the UI in this
instance so we were to replace the
entire application assetid awkward part
with unit testing then instead of the
application starting up and doing this
or rather just this at the moment it
would the unit test would call this and
then it would do the buying in as well
so this we can call
application setup say so that there's
only one thing we come to as we
mentioned create a unit test we know to
just simply copy the application setup
folder and edit as we we need so
everything is going to win a single
application setup configures our
application ready for use so right now
we setup the IOC and I want to bind a UI
manager so we also need to create the UI
manager so in we don't have any folder
for IOC at the minute so let's make a
new folder at the top level add new
folder IFC roughly one in the heading
folder IOC include there we go and then
in here we add UI manager
we're going to implement the IUI manager
from core and then we need to now do
something here so for now we'll just
simply do the built-in message box from
the dotnet framework I'll simply take
tests just to see that something's
happening and it's a task so we need to
return tasks run and actually do this
non async call copy that into the
description and now we can bind the UI
manager so to do that we simply do I see
dr. not buying a UI money just when
anything is looking for the UI manager
it's going to bind to and we'll just do
a constant in this case you can just do
those another one to self as it I think
to self just basically creates them no
we don't want to yes it's a constant in
this case and then we'll simply pass in
a new UI manager and then this instance
we create here we could keep a variable
of that but there's no need because once
we've passed it in and bound it will
access it through the IOC anyway so
simply spins up a new instance of this
class so this class we've made this UI
manager this will now only be a single
class with no real variable setup which
we shouldn't need anyway the whole point
of everything is we work through I OC as
much as possible but now this is bound
we can at any point now just do i or c
dot either ioc don't get our UI manager
to return this instance or we can use
the shortcut we made which is ioc UI so
now because we bound this
the call in the view model too now IOC
that you addict show message will bubble
off and end up calling this function for
us of the Thule so we've got this send
command we go to the chat with few miles
I should find it to the view quickly and
then let's at least test of this whole
set of works so we have chat page I
believe I have a seven button and then
in the command will do binding to send
command and I think that's everything
other than I should spin up click and
show a message box which shows the whole
sort of process working there we go
we've bubble back up to a you know a
function in the UI from being called
inside core so core is calling the
function because we have it in here so
this is in core and this function we can
move that out the way so this function
is then you know going I or C dot UI
which tries to get there I UI manager
interface which we bound here so it
finds us instance and then it simply
calls into that instance and fires any
code we want so that's how we now have
UI logic if you will things that are
expected to happen in UI such as showing
a message box both without having the
actual you know you're not calling the
actual thing that shows the message box
you're simply calling the dependency
injection to resolve and figure out what
to do so now in our application which
right now is this application as I
mentioned before if you decide to change
this you can change the entire UI
manager how the UI we actually change
this to a console manager or an
automated robot that simply replies or
you know so you say get get name from
user or just simply get information from
you to like a pop-up dialog then you
could create a new manager for unit
testing that always return certain
information
so that's the benefit of doing it this
way as well as the fact that now you
never have to try and get from say a
view model here which is what typically
happens most people say Rob I've got
this function now it's called send and I
mean call how do I now show a message
box and without trying to them reference
high up projects like the application
they tend to make workarounds or hawkish
ways to try and do things whereas this
is the correct way to do it now because
there's there's no kind of link if you
look at the classic application you have
like a call at the bottom and then you'd
have say data layer than a business
layer and maybe a presentation layer and
there's this whole structure where you
should only ever call down in and that's
really old that's such a bad way of
working the way that this now works with
IOC is every part of your application
every chunk every module if you will in
terms of say projects only ever
references core and that's it so we have
another module into this that's for
handling database entries the database
will reference call it won't reference
word when reference the top-level same
as if you have a file manager for
opening and closing file saving content
that would only reference call and then
of these two modules say the file system
and the database want to talk to each
other you use IOC so they're completely
independent of each other yet they will
work through IOC two interfaces in call
so they understand what the other module
should be doing like we now know that
there's a UI manager module that should
be showing a message but we don't know
anything about it we have no link to it
so this will become a lot more apparent
as this grows and we have as you
mentioned like a file manager in there a
database manager set up and this will
start to really make sense then so
that's the first part anyway that's the
the bulk of the binding done which is
really easy so the next thing we want to
do is we want to make a nice pop-up
window or a nice dialog box for
displaying the message box
and we already have we go to here we
have a main window so I'm just going to
copy and paste that and call it dialogue
window and then I'm going to start
renaming all this so I will first clean
off this will be dialog window dialog
window dialog window dialog window view
model we also need another one so a
dialog is going to be we certainly want
a window view model but we want to add a
few more things and tweak a few more
things so let's simply just copy and
paste the window view model change this
to dialog window view models and habits
window view model we delete all a little
bit any of that and then in the let's
have a think about this in the view
model what will we need is extra
information
well let's blank this out for now I know
for a fact we'll need extra things like
for one we need a title so in fact let's
start with that
so we wanted a what's wrong with this oh
yeah this also needs a constructor let's
just err I'm a little sad that
constructor back it's easier and this
will expect a window and so called base
with the window because we're inheriting
from the main window view model expects
the window we need to also create a
constructor that does the same so the
constructor so now we are basically a
copy of a window view model but one
thing I mentioned we want currently the
main window doesn't exactly other title
it simply has our logo if you will is
sort of hard-coded into the style so
we're going to add we could always add a
title back and do things there but the
main window isn't really a view model
thing to change the title so we're going
to add one here for any dialog window
that pops up title on this dialog window
and then I'm trying to think ahead here
let's rename this file
that once we've got this dialog window
this this pop-up thing that appears we
don't want to have the content in here
like we do right now so we have all this
content in the pop-up or in the dialogue
window we're going to reuse this dialog
window to simply host any other kind of
control so I'm thinking we will add
probably a content as it content control
rather so any kind of UI control and
we'll call this content so the
uncensored host inside the dialog I'm
not sure if we'll change this yet or I'm
thinking we'll use that style so now we
have a new dialog window view model is
exactly the same as the window we simply
add title and content as additional
things so paste it into the data context
and then we're finally back up to the
main window so right now it's a complete
copy bar the name and the view model we
will tablet through here title now we
can bind to the title element we've got
width and height we're not going to set
we also want to remove all the contents
at the minute so this background will
simply change to a white background I
would have remove everything at the
moment so we just get rid of all that
it's all gone you can see how this is
still large for like no reason there's
no content but it's staying large and
that's because it's a window it doesn't
automatically size so pick a point
anywhere really
I'll go maybe below there get rid of the
name as well and I think it's I think
there's a resize mode or something yeah
resize mode no resize because we don't
want this to be a draggable dialog it's
a pop-up that's going to display
information we don't want to have that
resizable and then in order to get this
to automatically size somewhat to like a
grid or a stack panel to expand only as
it's needed
and what's the property called and I
think it is what was it called also
sighs to come to their wheel size to
content width and height and that will
make this window automatically resize to
fit its content and this I know this
view isn't exactly correct because it's
simply not honoring this min width and
min height which have a value and that's
just because of a limitation and the
design time binding which we could fix
by adding a design time version of the
window view model but I guess you know
there's no real need just for the sake
of seen we know this is going to expand
and we could also just put some you know
content than here to test it out you
know to start adding content like that
and see things so one thing we know
refresh we need here is padding it of
five say or maybe padding of ten of
padding of tab in the style we want
let's see we want to remove this
particle which is or not remove replace
so this title here that's a view box
right now in a column we just want to
get rid of that whole thing and we do it
so we get rid of this will have a simple
text block letting column one
and the text will be buying into the
title again and let's just for quick the
visibility just for a quick test just
Chuck that in there a moment so we
clearly want vertical alignment again we
want both alignment active center so go
Center we also want to get rid of these
two buttons quickly so the min and Max
commands just well let's just make them
invisible for now just in case we have a
dialog box at once these will also break
these off to new lines
so the min and Max will have visibility
collapsed so they're out of the way so
back to this title that title looks a
little bit small so we'll have from size
I think large font family
regular which I think your ideas but
just to be sure and then I guess the
call it's okay boss let's just specify
explicitly or in fact thank you look sir
now let's go darker let's kicked up the
the cob instead of it being the default
let's make sure to it is always set for
the black color in case we change the
default later I think it doesn't look
too bad
I think now I'll actually do for that so
we can view that when it's you know
popping off plus the new tile was bound
to a tile let's just get rid us four
bucks value now and again to see all
this we could make a quick view model
I'm just not going to bother with a
simple pop up you can make one but I'm
just not going to bother and then in
here the contents we shall always leave
us tests right now and let's just do a
twirl
go to let's go back to here a minute so
dialer the other thing I want to do in
here actually is because this is
dialogue window in the base you'll see
the we set some default size like the
min and max or the min width and height
a huge for the main window so we want to
override that at least and just change
those the title height will probably
make smaller as well so let's just
change the window minimum height to say
100 and the window minimum width to
maybe 250 or something make minimum size
smaller make title bar smaller so the
title height will be safe 30 so this
should all bind just the same as the
main window and create a pop-up window
while it won't create a pop-up window
right now it's also simply create this
window but we automatically see this in
chef it's working so to do that we'll
want to go to the UI manager and in here
where we are doing this at the moment
served in a message box show now and
we'll improve this but let's just create
a new instance of the dialog window and
call show dialog simple as that for now
so now it should instant ate a new
version of that window and show it
or not calling so we're now trying to do
it outside of the UI thread so because
we're doing at a stop run here or
breaking off the UI thread so what we
can do instead again just for quickness
just to show this do that and then
return tough stop from results zero and
in fact no will still be off the UI
thread Higgs that we can't guarantee
that this is being called so what we'll
do I'll explain this because this is a
task and we want to return when this pop
ups finished and because the show
message is being called from a call or
basically anywhere this is probably
going to be on the UI thread because
we've clicked a button that's been bound
to a command that's coming through and
effectively made this happen anyway but
you can't presume that this is this is
going to be on the UI thread the thing
calling the UI is typically not even
going to be involved it well it
definitely isn't going to be involved in
UI so we want to just make sure that any
calls inside the UI manager are called
on the UI thread and we can simply do
that by air application current dot
dispatch or in bulk and then do whatever
so in there we can do this and then this
can be run on a UI thread and then we
can also do a helper which I think we
will do in fact we will add this this
call into here or are we going to run to
run something you want to await finish
maybe and yeah we won't add it there for
now let's just do it this way but
eventually we'll make this a helper
function as well but that'll involve a
little bit more thought so this will
then this will call and run this action
now the issue is this one's a weight
that you can see it's void so this will
simply run this action but carry on can
be low here before this ever runs so
because we the point of this task is we
want to wait until this dialog has been
closed we need to somehow await this
completion so the way we'll do that is
something called a task completion
source
so inside task completion source and
well it's a type of task so you've got
to return something so we're just going
to return a boolean so create a task to
await the dialog closing so this is now
a task completion source which by
definition means we can now return the
task completion sources tasks so all
this does is create a new task because
this is expecting a task you know a new
job to do so we create a new job that
expects to be set as a boolean we then
do this which will run this yet it will
instantly it will set it up ready to run
on the UI thread but then it will come
to here and now we're going to return
this task that is never complete at the
moment because it's effectively it's
bound to this variable and we've done
nothing with it so this function would
call show message the dialog and pop up
well this would return to the caller
which would be awaiting this task and
this would pop up but it would never
complete because we've not set it so
what we'll do here is because this could
also fail so because this call inside
here could potentially fail we want to
wrap this off and now in a try-catch
where we simply hide in the error
well handle you know we'll do ever
handling in a future video in depth
where we add detail their login and
reporting and things like that or for
now we'll do a try finally and all that
does is it runs this inside at what
looks like a try-catch bought the
finally will always run whether this
crashes or not and because we don't have
a catch block it means any error that
would have happened will still happen it
won't get caught and swallowed up and
not reported it'll actually bubble up
and still crash just that we want to
make sure that the caller always gets
completed so whether we failed or not we
want to try set results to true doesn't
matter the value because we're not using
the value but that now at basically says
flat caller now we've finished
and share dialogue so this will call the
dialogue and I'll put breakpoints on so
you can see this will call this this
will call this this will call this and
the call itself which is the shaft
message list the list item chat message
list view model
so we've got brake prints everywhere so
you can see the the flow that I'm
talking about what gets called first and
what happens and this should simply then
pop up a dialog but you'll see the order
and you'll see what I'm meaning by you
know the stuff never finishes until a
certain point in fact I'm saying that
are we even a way to the task in a
moment while we're not awaiting the task
we need to await this task just to see
so took an async there for now await the
task and then hit another line here
it's no one let's send this wants now
share a message so that hits the show
message comes into the show message we
then tell us to invoke which you'll
notice it won't go into here he'll step
well okay in this case it has but that's
because we're already on the UI thread
so I can force that to show you
differently but this will do a show
dialog and then this is actually not
going to be turn from there it's also
not correct either because with we've
not got that okay let's not a wait it
here for now let's see if that's the
issue because we're waiting on a UI
thread that's already on e UI thread
send click call okay so we've got a
little bit debugging to do here so right
now let's break this down to being
simple again it first looks like this
does not showing off correctly the
pop-up window so we know we're calling
the pop-up window when I was simply
dispatching let's get rid of this
or do we break off the UI thread first
just to forcefully make sure we're not
running this on the same khalad so this
can return but I think there's what we
want to do seems weird that we break off
the UI thread to jump back on the UI
thread let's just give this a quick go
I'm just got a hunch that's showing up
we have something we don't have the
window we wanted so something's not
right there so let's just quickly jump
it's obviously the view model binding
and that's window something's gone wrong
lol straight away in your face so the
target type is main window we renamed
that the dialogue window so style needs
to be for a dialog window and hopefully
that's all that was there we go so now
we've got a pop-up you can also see that
you can't get to the window behind like
classic pop-ups do you know once it's a
pop-up you don't expect to be able to
start messing with the application
behind so that's that don't we I'm going
to tile though something wrong with the
title so let's take a quick look at the
title I think I know what's going on
there we have in the view model we are
bound to Oh
title is bound to title now this yeah
this should work
type window Manhart with tile we have
the data context of this where we
haven't got a title of the minute that's
why because we've got a dialog view
model what we needed to do was in the UI
manager when we're spinning up this
dialogue we wouldn't spend it up this
way so what will happen is when we when
we have the function that says show
message will actually set the dialog
windows data context of this view model
and satis title so for now we could
simply say for you know for quickness
just to show you and make sure the
bindings right your date's context ours
dialogue window view model I thought
equals test title let's just quickly
check that work someone will do that
when we make their the actual pop-up
function there's a tire we also on that
horizontally aligned Center as well and
then this obviously is going to be the
content we want to show and then that
closes and we'll have a a button inside
we'll get around to all that so one
stuff to turn I'm going to leave that
testing for the moment let's get the
title there and do a I was on four
lineman Center as well and now let's go
back to figuring out what was going
wrong with this flow of control so back
to the break points of what should hit
when we know that one wrong we know that
I hear that hit that half back to the
caller so this will call this we want to
await it
and in fact before we start putting
breakpoints on everything let's just
make sure it runs still the same by
awaking here make sure we're not
breaking something because what we're
doing here is we're awaiting something
on the UI thread which is counting on a
lot of UI thread so you don't really
want to do that so they see we've locked
I know they will starts working and we
also want to check so there's more
obvious of what's going on
let's first let's run this and then
let's look at threads let's get a little
bit involved in what threads are so in
debug window threads you can see right
now where the arrow is is where we are
what on the main thread which is the UI
thread so we're actually on the UI
thread here so we step in
of course property chain is step in yes
we'll get in a minute but a send message
still on the main thread task completion
source is going to run a task which
we're going to hit at some point here
and then we want to return this so it's
going to run now you see down here we've
jumped onto a worker thread so we're now
in the screws do the task runs off the
UI thread this is going to dispatch and
invoke something back on the UI thread
but now because the thing that we were
running is off the UI thread and this is
what I mentioned then once you call
invoke on the UI that this doesn't
actually happen right away so we just
ran this let's call to invoke but the
function that it invokes here won't be
run until we then complete the
higher-level you know something coming
after this which is basically nothing
and then it steps out and returns a task
so now we're back on the main UI thread
and we turn returning a task that's now
going to await for that eventually when
this UI thread then completes so this
will return to this function the UI
thread that we're on now is going to
wait before it hits here
and that's going to execute now so now
we are then inside this bucket strolling
you out there now and it's going to show
the dialogue and we know what the
dialogue we've got everything functional
and then one would close so when that
dialogue is now finished it then sets
the result and again UI thread and then
this now carries on so there's actually
a bit going on here in terms of a lot
less really is involving the framework
being smart enough to know so what it
looks like we've done is awaited the UI
thread here because this is on the UI
thread as we saw and that the all let's
talk about this await in the UI thread
what I mean is when you await something
you're blocking you're typically
blocking that thread which means only
what the thread can only process one
thing at a time and the UI thread
everything on your screen has only got a
single thread that ever updates the
screen and that's to stop things trying
to override each other visibly on a
screen there's a good reason for it
so each thread if you await something
effectively this this process this
thread that we're working through this
will stop here and can't process
anything else until this is done
but what we've actually done is you've
got a potential here for what's called
the deadlock where if you're on the UI
thread and you will wait something that
then goes in and tries to wrong button
and then awaits the same thread you
should have a deadlock situation and the
way I think I've potentially just gotten
around that is by spinning up a new task
so we're off the UI thread before we
then return I think is what solved the
issue well let's just remove that and
call this so we well then be on the UI
thread we'll await this call which will
go to this function which is still on
the UI thread so even though this says
dispatch to invoke it's going to go
straight in it's going to actually
happen in line and then we're going to
show a dialog and then nothing's going
to happen until we close so we won't be
able to do any
else on the UI thread in theory there
until this finishes so you might get a
deadlock situation here so let's see no
see you find there so basically the
framework is handling the situation okay
boy you've got to be aware of is you're
going to be very careful to not what's
called deadlock or thread so you don't
want to have something on the UI thread
that's awaiting something else that it's
also on the UI thread because then you
can never carry on with your work so
it's a bit of a complicated topic that
we'll we'll do a video separately on but
I just want to make you aware that when
you start doing things like this when
you're doing awaiting something and it's
involved in the UI thread if you ever
get a situation where all of a sudden
the UI simply stops working you won't
need you can't click anything you can't
do anything then you know you
potentially got you know a deadlock UI
that you need to to investigate the
await statements so for now that's
working you've got a general overview of
what's happening but I'll do a separate
video on this and future to explain you
know a lot more about task completion
sorts and awakenings and locking threads
and things to make sure you understand
kind of deadlock situations I'll make a
note and we'll do that in another video
so back to where we were we have the
show message which now creates a task
completion source shows a dialog when
it's done it then continues so we were
to await this as we saw now we simply
await that and then hit here and run
will click it will then call show
message now you know to show messages
appear but this hasn't it yet so you can
do whatever here would you click your
code carries on so now in your view
models or anywhere in code that you want
to then say display a message to the
user and only after that then do
something else then you can simply await
the show message and then do something
else afterwards so that's now got that
it's important that we have that ability
because say this changes from show
message to get user input and there's a
result like you know bar result equals
IFC dot
get user input and you need to await
that because it's not something that's
going to return instantly it's going to
return when the users finished and
clicked ok so you need to have this a
weight ability of you know the calls
so the your code can handle situations
where it's not always going to return
straightaway that's the show message
dawn so as far as this part of code
concerned the view model that's not
going to change that's fine this style
in here we just want to know tweak so at
the moment we just have a text block
let's change this to content control and
the content is going to be bound to the
prodded record we actually called it
content so we'll call this content so
now got a Content control that's going
to bind to the content of the view model
so all's you've got to do is set up the
view model and I think that's this
window done as well so we close there
and now we want because we're going to
be doing a lot of setting off so like
already we've started to see creating
new dialog window and do things what
we're going to do is we're going to
create a new dialog window then we're
going to set up its view model right
we're mentioning the title that needs
setting which currently is just set here
so we're gonna have to create a new
dialog then set the title up to whatever
the title should be because this is
going to be used for more than just one
dialog we're going to learn how to set
the content up in a specific way
depending on what we want to include so
for the show message box we want to
create some UI that says it's going to
be inside a message box that forms the
message box then we're going to have to
show it so all of really this entire
logic wants to be moved into a kind of
base functionality to show a dialog
let's get a
new folder huh gasps bullet dialogue
more dialogues we will add a base
dialogue user control and this is going
to be the content that we push inside of
well not necessarily this control but
it's going to inherit from this this is
going to be the class that is a user
control and we can add this inside of
any dialogue well inside of this
dialogue window the base class for any
content author is being used inside of a
dialogue window or have private members
we will have put commands we'll have a
constructor
I guess in the constructor we want to
what we need first a dialog window
because we need to keep track of the
parent we're going to be in I guess
or rather what yeah we're going to going
to be inside of a dialog window but
we're going to actually create it
ourselves and show it it's the way I'm
thinking that's a works so we'll have a
privy dialog window I will just call it
a dialog window so it's kind of a
child's creating its own parent
situation here it will also have public
properties and the reason we want to do
this is because we want this control to
handle creating a dialogue window and
the dialogue window has certain things
like we mention the minimum width the
minimum height the title and a lot of
other things so we want to just extract
just the properties we care about that
are going to be customizable for a
pop-up or a dialog so we'll kind of
repeat the public properties but just
the ones we care about so right now it's
window minimum width and we'll have a
default here which seemed nice up to 50
minimum width dialog
coffee tastes like minimum height and we
had 100 anyway minimum hi to this
dialogue and also going to do with these
as you'll see in a minute we're going to
be buying them to the actual dialogue
windows for your model probably in will
do that title height thing again which
was good for changing the height of the
title bar and then we also want a title
I think that's it for now so we can set
all those in whatever functions we like
so a dialog window we've got a
constructor so in the constructor we
want to set the dialog window to a new
instance so through the new dialog
window and this is the thing we've just
shown in here already
we simply made a new one and showed it
so that's kind of what we're doing but
we're building it up into a a more
customizable version and then the window
the window the dialog window view model
which we don't have
can we not access the view model yet by
default dialog window also what we've
done here is we just set the dialog
window directly because we need to
change things like title we enough to
tweak this so instead of just setting
the data context directly we'll have
again a private member's area
Travie a dialogue window view model I'll
fold this window public properties
dialog window view model remodel the gap
is actually I guess it's going to return
the view model and the set is going to
set the view model done and then as well
as set the view model which what's it
complaining about oh yeah just tell me
Kay use pistol run online and then every
time we change the view model we set the
data context to the new view model date
concept so it's going to do exactly the
same thing whereas were setting it here
inside of ourselves of the minutes we're
simply going to remove that and by
default it won't have one and we expect
now the thing that creates us to make
the view model for us
so that's doing exactly the same thing
we'll get rid of all them that is the
something else fine where were we okay
we're here so now we've created the
dialogue window we now need to set the
view model so the view model clear into
equal a new keeping is called pop-up
dialog window view model and the window
is the dialogue window itself so they
all we've done is this now creates the
new window and then we set the view
model which sets this data context but
now all's we've done is we've moved out
here so we can access the view model
inside of here so we can access this
windows you know dialog window view
model to control it so when we create a
new instance of this control we
basically create a new window and we set
up a view model ready so now we want to
help a function or this will be yeah
just probably kind of a long region name
but that'll do for now we want then a
task of show dialog because what we want
to now mimic is effectively this so
let's just call it show message and we
could almost copy this from the exact
same thing Neil so this well displays a
single message box to the user and the
view model so yes exactly the same
and we've got a task and then I think we
want we want this to be mmm let's leave
it like this for now so go show message
which now we want to take this logic
that we were doing here move all that
out and in the show message we'll update
this to do the dialogue let's put it to
do that for a minute
we now create the task application
really sis not Windows so create the
task to the exact same thing again spin
up the dialogue and the only difference
now is instead of doing the show you
know clean just a new dialogue window
and showing it we've already got the
dialogue window we got here so we can do
the EM dialogue window dot shell context
virtual dialogue but before this now
because we have a show message we expect
to show the message we can start buying
in the specific to the view model into
the dialogue window
so the dialog windows view model which
we just exposed for one we can first
match the window minimum width and
height to this property itself minimum
width I title although so let's bind
those two minimum width minimum hi
and this will be called match controls
expected sizes to the dialog windows
gear model that the title hi this pile
art and then this is where we were
missing before which was now do we can
get the tile itself
so that will set all those up and then
we could share the dialogue now this is
also going to be as we mentioned we're
going to make a actual user control that
inherits from this there's going to be
the content that actually shows inside
the pop-up so this control that's going
to become say a message box we really
want access to this view model or
potentially even yeah I think just this
view model a message box dialog that's
all you should have to care about so
we're going to set this controls all
this you know the content that's inside
the dialog it's view model its data
context to the view model so that's off
this controls state context binding to
the new model so now because this is a
show message when whatever we decide to
inherit from to have a show message it's
going to expect the message dialog view
model or we could potentially move this
out to go further this is almost a in
fact this is not really a show message
this is a it's almost a generic all to
show the dialogue buying the context to
any view model and return yeah it is so
this is actually a generic message
originally call unless this could then
be T where don't or see you are the base
view model and
so hurting me you moron time for this
control and this can just something be
the name then I guess to show dialog and
then whatever we decide to pass in which
will be so here would be but let's make
it control first let's get the control
bit done so you can see this working so
in dialogues let's add a new user
control call it dialog message box we
will get rid of this dialog part
and this is now going to change to
inhabit this base dialog user control
that's relevant we have anything in
there anyway
then we have nothing right now but we
don't need anything to search let's just
slap in a textblock testicles test for
now so we have something to show where I
guess a background of white get rid of
the designer hi some wits and now ever
simple texts just seen test just so we
have a control so now there's dialog
message box and have it from a base
dialog user control in here we should
then just be able to do we can new
dialog message box show dialog and we
simply pass in a new L dot the view
model already above us so we pass in a
new model and that's it so that will now
create a new specific version of this
version of a base control little call
show dialog it will do the same pop-up
system but it'll now bind the title to
actually there's one thing that will
binding the tile to tile but the view
model has its own title in this case so
we probably want to say trying basically
crying gasp well we'll do the spit ugly
I know for a fact now title we haven't
set anywhere we've set these as defaults
so what we could do now is in the dialog
message box in the constructor here we
could potentially change our defaults
like window minimum width and height to
something different or the title height
for this specific version of the dialog
because we've bound them here and then
the same with a title we could set the
title specific to this type of dialogues
and potentially the dialogue you're
showing might want its own very set
title right here message box so you've
got the control in the implementation of
the dialog there
but also in certain instances like this
view model that's coming in that there's
now just purely generic so we don't know
it could have a title itself which is
what we've done here this this view
model the pop up expects a title and
we're going to expect to set that title
in the pop-up window as well so we'll
fix this and I mean I know this is not
going to show but everything else should
show the window should show we should
then be bound to a view model and then
we're going to show it to but now
instead of showing our whims at the
condoms either so the dialog window if I
remember rightly I think we did that the
dialog window has a content control
bound content so we need to set this
content up so we bind ourselves so set
this control which is spare in - give me
the dialog message can be disc
controlled fine let's control - these
dialog windows content so em dialog
window view mola content which is the
one we need
it calls this so we're going to bind it
to ourselves which means that the dialog
window should then have this content
test
I think so this is a this is the first
test failed because it doesn't build
that's because it's a base page it
thinks it's a base page yep that is a
base page so that's not the underlying
issue the type name dialog is not exist
and where's that in message dialog with
letter name space somewhere is it in
here there
that happens often I always forget that
little bit yeah sit doors stop
complaining
build clean and build up come on
dialog message box and base dialogues
use control we've got to change this
type to be the base dialogue user
control as well
finally there we go that's when we click
there we are kind of I'm sure it's a
test before let's make that a little bit
more obvious that it's this control so
let's change background to red say make
sure we do have this there we go so now
we've got our pop-up that's called
through a generic dialog box show dialog
style called that we can simply pass in
a view model and now in this
implementation we could bind like say
this test text now could be bound to I
think it was called a message in the
message box few model because we set up
the binding here to this so we should be
bound to whatever view model we passed
in which means we should if we bound a
message this should now show the actual
message we had there we go thank you for
writing a nice message so let's just get
rid of the red change to the foreground
light brush
I think this font also wants to be or
not the font the foreground color I
think looks a bit faded I don't know if
it just fades or not but just try
foreground very dark and say that makes
a difference I think my default doesn't
want the black color there we go so now
we're almost there we've got a pop-up
box so thank you for acting a message
can't continue and then flows away and
you can carry on so now when you fix
this title I was talking about so the
issue we have is the title is bound
for the actual pop-up dialogues bound
here so we put a breakpoint here and
take a quick look to make show you the
issue we're facing let's just get rid of
that threads window okay just close it
so we have the view model that's passed
in that we know is a message box view
model but it could be any because we're
going to make another one that's called
but you know like get user get text from
user or something or you know ask you a
question type thing so this view model
is going to change but the whole process
of simply showing the dialog popping up
and everything else is going to stay the
same but we expect this view model as
dark a title and we want to make use of
that title so we can do two multiple
ways we could propose that any view
model that's going to be used in the
show dialogue implement an interface
that could potentially have a title but
the issue there is you're forcing it to
have a title so we're going to do
something slightly different we're
simply going to attempt to get a
property called title from the view
model so we could do view model title
equals and then also do is cast will
cast the view model to dynamic which
means simply attempt to access things on
there without you've got no intelligence
now but you can type anything you like
so we're going to attempt to get title
this way and then here we're going to
say if the view model has a title
effectively view model tile otherwise
use the default tile so this is going to
override any title we might specify in
the actual class so we specify the title
in here but there was one in the view
model then the view model will take
precedence
so I'll show you both situations there
so we spin it up we click the send view
model tile you can now see is managed to
get send title because we simply tried
to get title if that hasn't got one so
we say title to something that doesn't
exist it won't crash it'll simply well
actually might crash here let's see yeah
so as it were pointing on to do a mini
wrap on that
so the quickest way to do that is to
simply say in fact view model title or
equal result title equals title and then
do a little try and this is something I
think I mentioned before is something
you rarely rarely rarely ever want to do
and this is a basically a try caption
couldn't care about the result so try
and get the property I thought from the
view model and nor any failure and I'm
probably going to change this cuz
already writing it I don't like it in
fact I'm going to change it because what
we don't want is we don't want this to
constantly crash every well not
necessarily crash but the debugger to
constantly break in here every single
time we have a view model that doesn't
have a title passed in so I think we
might we might do reflection here to get
the title we might end up doing well we
got a dialogue you always want to title
don't you yeah I think well actually
we'll roll back and do the the interface
thing I mentioned or potentially just a
new base for your model that's a base
dialogue view model I think is what
we'll do so view models wrong solution
your models base base view model will
copy that move into dialogues that
doesn't income part doesn't it beyond
that a minute and then this will be
based dialogue view model and it
implements base view model and basically
your model for any dialogues that may be
on sits now above the base view model
and all we're going to do is simply add
public stream title I'm going to move
that from the rename the file
we're now going to move the message box
title out of this into the more specific
based dialog view model and paste it in
there of the dialog so now all we're
doing is we are forcing the any view
model that's passed into this dialogue
system here instead of in a basic view
model is now going to have to be a base
dialogue view model so we always expect
now if you're going to call show dialog
that the view models got a title
snogging that we change this to your
model dot title and the risen one fall
back to the windows title and then I
think I'm a little much check in there
that might break it might work there we
go
now we got send message and thank you
for writing a nice message and then you
can close I think I need the button as
well like an OK button but that's now
work in there what else have we got a
feeling I've missed something what was I
doing and that's just complaining cities
rebuilding message this is the actual
dialog message box you want to work with
so okay there oh well that was it I was
going to show you the if this didn't
have a tile and also we did have a tile
here so it was just forcefully clear the
view model title for now so basically
pretending we didn't pass one in and
then where I mentioned you could set
this title would be an N dialog message
so any any control that implements you
know the base dialog you could that in
the constructor set a default title like
default here and then what should happen
now is the title I'd say default here if
there was no title specified by the
caller or not
so let's figure that out yeah default in
here okay the question mark question
mark is null so you'd want to change
that to string dot is no empty if it is
not going to use the title for the wise
use the value itself so just tweak that
logic a little bit and then if you show
that now you get default here and then
if the user was to pass in the title in
light for example the color of this
which passed in a title that will then
take president's now and it will say
send message but if you didn't mention a
title if you do a title you get send
message and if you didn't you'd fall
back to whatever the specific dialogue
that you're showing set it to with in
our case is default here so that gives
you like a kind of a fallback title how
are you going to get rid of that for
hours for now but that shows you how you
can do that then alright that's that
we've got all the pop up what else if we
go so then to add the where is it want
to add a button to this what's wrong
with this the base dialogues not exist
yes it does
it says base dialogues causing an issue
now how about some airliner workers it's
we add this before a long while back in
the previous videos it doesn't like
doing this I think we probably been find
actually or was it gift is in design
mode we add it here if you remember this
it doesn't like to do anything specific
to specific in the Constructors so what
we're going to do here I'm guessing it's
this in the constructor if we're not in
design mode we want to
kill all this and I think that's what's
causing this build-out so I'm hoping now
when we rebuild us works though maybe we
just need to close and reopen Visual
Studio
okay let's just try and close and reopen
maybe
there we go so sometimes visual studio
just doesn't have a compile you know I'd
never updates itself fully in sam'l so
sometimes just after closing reopen
Visual Studio which is what fixed that
so we have this base dialog we have a
text do we have text here something's
completely off here Oh trying to see
something that we have no value for the
moment absurd didn't mother making a a
design model so there's the I think also
this tech text was a little bit close to
the border I'm just spin this up and
take a look
ah yeah I think that's just a tiny bit
close let's just pop that out a little
bit
that looks nicer now there's a very
close message box are being done let's
add this close button so we want to have
at case it's not a grid now it's a
struck panel and below that we'll have a
button just content it can be found
which we already added was this okay
text thing I think we'll make a design
model as well because this is starting
to get annoying so let's just quickly
make how I do a view model dialogues
message box add design crappie paste
that in for their design model in the
file paste that in override view model
take any other design one just copy the
singleton part of it get rid of that
creates new instance and then add the
constructor
and now we want to set up the properties
which are too damn tight on that iota of
Title IX the base so taro can be which
we won't see in this anyway it's not in
the window so actually yeah no need of a
message of downtime messages are fun and
we will have a okay text of okay I
always want to bind to that so now we'll
have data complex as started off that
instance thing that's how we do it maybe
just compile and mullet markup again
datum and not supported me out it's in
cool I always forget that there and then
X and our namespace for pickles for
second cool there we go now we have Oh
what up to nobler looking button where's
my style disappeared there we go
so we have the this looks massively
disproportioned as well let's change
that font size and that is going to be I
don't know drive from regular looks okay
we want it to also be horizontally
Center so it doesn't keep expanding and
infinitely let's have a quick look at
that
yeah now I have a button so now comes
the interesting part you're going to say
well how do you now get this button to
close this dialog when this control has
no window
it's simply injected via its base class
into a dialog window and you know that's
how it's all working so how do we get
back to accessing I guess really this
dialogue window so we can do that quite
easily if we add a public command to
this control itself to this class then
we should be able to do I command call
it close command and then in the
constructor close command this new rule
a command
you should call quite well in fact
appear then we just simply call the end
dialog window dot close because that's
got a function already so we basically
make this in the base class to call the
dialogues close and now we just need to
bind to the Left which might not work
actually because we're bound to the view
model
okay text our tie what we do here this
is this is one place where it doesn't
really matter to drop in well those two
two ways to do this we could be lazy
here which was about to be and just
simply do like a click event handler and
go in the code behind and then call
close command execute and just literally
run effectively that command we just
need that's just been lazy I was going
to be but I'm going after I'm doing a
video so they do correctly so we will
change this quick man will have the data
context mmm no car new data context has
got content there the command is going
to have to be found too close command
but the our hit better there we're going
to do this relative source is going to
be relative source and what we'll do is
ancestor level maybe or just ancestor
type I'm just the type equals this let's
just go up to that I think
I always loved doing these relative
sources I always forget I know we've
done this before it took me about 10
minutes in the video to do it corrupt
the last time so there we go
binding blah blah with relative sources
relative source find ancestor and then
the tag is X colon type Thalia it's
going to be easier to copy that string
than s to train so we will do a copy and
paste in here what did we get up to just
the relative saw spot so base dialogues
use a model as what we want so we have
the copied whole thing
relative sources finance as that type is
sharp your model takes why somehow and
then finally as never flows in me change
this to base dialogue user control okay
so that was a big long messy string so
all's I've done here is because we're
already bound by the view model here so
this is expected to be bound that's
where you want you know when we bound to
the view model that you want to you know
it's showing for but then because this
command wants to bind really to its own
base this base dialogue view model keep
pressing f11 why do I keep thinking f11
to go to definition instead of f12 so
because we've made this command that can
then do that you know the access and
enclosing of the dialogue we simply
change the the binding source to
ourselves so we simply say relative
source is fine ancestor and step up
keep stepping up the tree until you find
a base dialogue user control which we
know is ourselves
so it's just a quick way of binding to
the close command so I think now the
close command should open and close yeah
there we go so now we have a a dialogue
that's popped off where this is simply
been injected into a dialogue yet we can
now control the dialogue as well and
close it so we've got you know the link
behind so I think that's that's pretty
much everything the one thing I don't
like about this is the others is still
bright I'd like that to kind of feed
maybe
so it's like a gives a little bit of
focus on that you know your folks needs
to pay attention to this not the thing
behind so let's see how quickly we can
do that so now we've been going for a
while on this video book it shouldn't be
too hard so we want a on the main window
some eluc blah blah blah all those
background pedro so here let's add
demmed overlay and this can be a border
red dot Rose fan as in three rows as
their and because we're going to want to
I'm going to want to animate you know
fade in that the dialogue but I want it
to fade into about thirty percent
opacity instead of making a whole new
animation to do that I'm going to simply
set the parent to thirty and then do
another border inside with a background
of very dark so basically black and
rowspan didn't seem to do much or doing
it desert index to be higher there we go
so row span three I should look how many
rows ago
we have no rows just two columns so
column span of two now I guess we get
like this overlay that is what we want
now we want to animate the inner one
this one so I think we need another
animation so we have framework
animations
slide left law of law we want to copy
and paste that whole section and do just
a fade in/out so no sliding we've
already done it so what you need to
update this played an element in simple
as that no comments fade in and I want
to explain this too much you've done
enough animation you know what's going
on here
I'm just ripping stuff out doing the
storyboard doing the fade only beginning
job done so just pretty much copy paste
and remove the slide animation just keep
the feed
so this fades
played out an element this will be fade
out don't need those storyboard don't
slide fade and then the difference here
is once we fade it out right now we're
visible and we'd have an opacity of zero
when I finished but because we are
overlaying this over the top and that
means nothing to be clickable underneath
it so let's just make the once there
fade out is finished make the a
visibility collapsed we could probably
do this with the something like it you
know hit test not visible you know so
the think on do the hits but I think
collapsed is better so fully hide the
elements that's the fade out fade in
then we need to go up to attack
properties framework elements and we
have animates slide in copy that whole
thing again and we want to animate the
framework element fading in on show and
fading out
unhide animate
they'd in property copy and paste that
over there do animation unless it goes
to the fade-in animation that we just
made and the fade-out we don't pass them
in don't pass them in copy that
save clothes and then in here we want to
do animate feed in I think a local call
emanates a dendup value equals bind it
to and then we want a new property call
dimmable overlay visible is that going
to build that's built that should
animate so now we just need to make a
property called dimmable overlay visible
so in the background we have a main
window view model let's just go and slap
in this new proxy and this is through F
we have half a dims overlay on the
window so it does when it pop up and
play ball or the window is not focused
that's of that window view model and
then what we're going to do is in the
main window scroll up go to here on
deactivated aladdin events aren't
activated or live event code behind
scroll down and then in this ruins the
data context it's all Russian now to
finish lady complex does window blue
model dark dimmable is true when it's
not focused
and then a bolt is closed and I'm going
to comment beliefs Oh hide over like if
we are focused so over like every just
focus poof madam I think now with all
that bound and totally untested and rush
to get it done to see we might have a
nice baby dimmable overlays I can't even
find it in here that dimmed over like so
let's just give this a go no idea
they'll work but that's a bit cooler
with us oh there you go that's nice
that's much better
so now when you get any pop-up and I'm
guessing also when we have say notepad
open our application fades your focus
and comes back in so I quite a lot ah
you could limit this to if you only
wanted to fade when your application is
the thing showing the pop-up so we could
tweak this but I just wanted to do a
nice and quick to give you a it's just a
much nicer up so much more focus just
that faint over like and I had to be
honest quiet like there once it's not
focused it being there my quiet like
that so I'm going to keep that in that's
nice that's a goal of about three
minutes I'm quite pleased for that so
this has been a long video I'm guessing
I don't know long it's been going on it
feels like a while but we've got all the
the pop-up system done now and you can
now see that even though is only done
one this will become more obvious that
the only thing that's custom in this
whole dialogue system now is we simply
created a custom control to show exactly
what we wanted in here so we can now use
this entire pop-up window and pop-up
system to just write a user control that
looks like or contains whatever we want
in this pop-up and buy into it we don't
even have to keep making this whole
pop-up system it's completely
self-contained now in that base class so
that's all done hopefully you follows
along there try to explain things as
much as possible as I went it will make
more sense
we make more pop-ups because right now
you only seen one so you're not quite
seeing where the usefulness of all that
work is but now we can make a brand new
user control as a short as this one
where we just have this this is the only
piece of information in here we've got a
simple user control that overrides this
and then just has importance and does a
few binding that's all the ways now to
making a new pop-up so we'll do another
pop-up potentially in the next video if
not in a few more videos again there any
questions any confusion just leave a
comment I'll get back to you I want to
finish on one note that quite a lot of
people people have been realizing that
when they come to start doing the videos
because I did these obviously I started
them in December or whenever
fadi weaver was older than it is now and
we have like 40 weaver here with
property changed in core and we also
have 40 weaver here in the main one and
what's been happening is if we looked at
our money's nougat packages there's now
an update to these fadi weavers so we go
to updates now if we go to update them
what you'll notice and this is what's
happening people are just starting out
or that maybe are updating they'll
update them in you gain this prompt file
conflict file fadi weaver XML already
exists do you want to override most
people are clicking yes let's just click
yes anyway and I'll show you what's
happened and then fadi needs to update
so we update and then yes again so it
depends the order you do each other and
typically you can see it's done property
changed first and then fadi we've the
general Fadi last so so we've now
updated both how don't need to restart
that satisfied and then if you open now
for the weave you'll see the proxy
changed has been removed and the same
guess will go for down L so the cause
capped it or is that just cause we
haven't updated the call yet yes of the
core needs updating as well so you can
see what's happening if you update 41st
and we update just that one and we
override
then it's basically taking the fatty
Weaver and it's not typical when you're
shown it doesn't do it maybe this one's
going to do it well it could just
because they haven't successfully
updated yet but there you go you can
seize it basically get rid of this
property changes all and trying to get
it so if you update funny Weaver and all
of a sudden like now we run the
application I'm guessing because this is
in the area and then the other thing
once you've updated you'll get this
warning about implement property change
not being required does valid that you
just simply remove that that's not
needed when you update but now you've
updated fuddy we've really just
installed and things just won't work the
same so you can see for one now the fade
backgrounds disappeared and that's
that's it's very soft or because a lot
of these things are set at the start but
the things that are changing you can see
they're basically no no change event
going on so if you get in weird things
like that or your update Waddy Weaver
just double check your finally Weaver
and both the call and the parent and
make sure you have this property changed
in there in case you've got over in the
other option is if you are going to
update it simply select note at the
overriding in the file and you've got no
problem and now you can see the it's
working again so that's just a quick
note because I know a lot of people have
been getting that issue so the way that
the property changed gets added
automatically to our view models is
through funny Weaver and we have to make
sure funny Weaver gets told to do that
in this XML plus so yes that was that so
again I hope you enjoy this video any
comments let me know anything you want
to see next again let me know and we'll
go from there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
