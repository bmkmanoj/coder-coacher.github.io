with the setting page and aligning the
text so we did this view when we did
these text edit where you can double
click type and enter to save or double
click type escape to cancel or you can
click the buttons to do the same thing
and the last thing we need to do here is
the password field needs to be a real
password field not just a text field
then we need a new password - like a
current and then you password and
confirm password instead of just one box
and then we'll just pull a little Sign
Out button as well and we'll get that to
actually technically sign out you know
take you back to the login page but we
have no back end yet so it'll be purely
just semantic to get you back to the
login page so we'll start with that it
should be fairly simple shouldn't be too
much of a task so this text entry
control start by just cloning that
control let's try that again
okay we'll rename this to password entry
control then change whatever else we
need in here so this needs to be
password entry control hit a viewmodel
password entry control so we'll make
that animam click glance through will
change to just edit content to a
password box as well but we'll do let's
just do the recording control name
change roof so password entry control
change the constructor change the owner
at the dependency property and also
change that here so I think that I will
need to now do the view model so quickly
go to view model import text entry
control copy that rename that to
password entry control create a password
so I've label now we won't have original
text
we'll have secured as its fuel possible
subfield text if your string is an asset
so our original password then we'll have
edited password now all the confirm
password then editing stays the thing we
also want file isolate down we can just
simply put actual stars now still view
model for that
so we'll do a string for the either the
fake password display edit save
constructor password entry command
methods will comes out a minute so in
here we'll set the lake password to
sh stars so we never want to give away
anything to do with the original
password anyway so set the fake password
and then in the Edit we want to cancel
the same save will come to and the other
one to make sure make sure from password
is correct and so this will be with the
you know the real users password that
you'll have stored somewhere that we
don't right now so this would be if
looking to of our stored password I
wanna make this so typically the stored
password you know the current password
you'd do nothing whether such you'd
simply send the current password and the
new password to the server encrypted and
the server would then verify if the
original password was correct but for
demo sakes here I'm going to make one so
I think I could just make a new secure
string and a pointer to the array of
objects so we're going to make it that
way okay so I can just do it's got
really easier way to make a secure love
strings I'm just making up a pointer I
know for one I'm an unsecured method so
we should have a secure method maybe no
really
okay and certainly the characters
and while let's make the fake password
testing to do to a character array then
and find a for loop in it okay so what
we will do is make a new secure password
or in fact we don't need to make your
password key existed just you know a
demo that we test and you wouldn't have
this here this would be done on the
co-branding Li so the first thing we
want to do is confirm confirm on
password too much and then again note as
isn't John here I just don't
almost back but for this demo we'll do a
still password isn't equal to and then
the other thing we need have it here
that one so we have the current password
so original password with book so
unsecure the original password and
memory if it isn't equal to that then we
as well as now we'll keep the dialogue
open to literally just tell the user and
then we will display IOC you i dot sure
message how we added localization to
this year now so we really need to start
thinking about localization since these
strings can be stored in other languages
so title is wrong password
okay text now I would default the okay
text okay to our office at it now let's
default that to okay
and then the message equals and current
password is invalid so then if it was
the current password was valid after
that we then need to check the new and
confirm password map so then if not for
relative new password or call the edited
password only isn't equal to confirm
password and same again we have an issue
let the user know password miss map the
new and profound password would do not
match and again typically all this is
done on the server so about the only
thing you do here is this check is there
if the edit didn't new editing confirm
passwords match things like this the
current password you'd usually just send
the current password with the request to
change the password and the server would
verify then you can do more checks here
like say you know make sure the
passwords seven characters long and
contains this at the other but again all
those checks you don't usually do on the
clients you let the server handle those
things so in the real app when we've
done the backend server this will be the
only thing that remains and then like
this will go but for you know the demo
you want to see something happening so
I'll leave that in there so this
confirms that the original password is
testing and that the the new and the
confirmed match and then if it is you
want to update the original password
equals the edited password and now this
thing would actually become the point to
them because well I'm pretty sure would
that if you simply
set this class to another and the
underlying content 2.2 which I think
this is this would actually clone so
what we'll do there instead is very non
password is new secure string and then
for each character in editing password
dot unsecured character array original
password dot and character C so we're
doing like a deep copy of your live
every character for making a new one
because I've got a feeling that simply
setting original password to edit your
password because the underlying secure
password is a pointer in memory it's
going to literally be this point into
the same thing and then they'll never
you know change one it's going to change
the other and that's how we'll handle
back so the edited text the context live
password to the current value and then
go into editing mode and we just put
that all in the wrong place yes we have
okay let's take a quick look at the
original is rename this class and open
tech entry view model I've gotten dumped
it all in that edit command which should
have just simply changed the text and
this logic all the way down to here was
actually one we want to save so this
should have been there so probably a
setting to save and then in edit mode we
simply wants to enter edit mode of a
password is actually different want to
clear all password so this would be edit
C password equals needs to kill a string
and confirm password list new secure
string then
in fact if we do that but also we want
to oh yeah we can't just kind of think
ahead here that we are going to have to
or we'll see how it goes because can we
bind we could bind to this but we're
going to have a you have to do something
else of this view model and password
changes let's just roll with that for
now
and let's start getting this in so I'm
thinking I should compile at least so
that compiles so we now have a password
entry field password entry design model
we need as well let's just quickly do a
design model and the design model will
have fake password greater those and we
name the class now that should well
hoodie builds but they should now get
rid of the compiler so we have all the
view model for starters we have the
label the Edit content now wants to be a
password box you can't now set the text
so we'll come around to that in a minute
but let's start with the basic edit
password and make sure it's a password
box so we've got that we don't need that
now we don't need that in the settings
here want to change this want to
password and there's the password field
and now it's a password you'll know just
do what clicking doesn't focus so let's
fix that so here we handle text pop
generally so just change this logic a
bit to a handle text boxes first or
password boxes as well and then of its a
password it should still focus
- Logan eyes focused so we there we go
so last thing we haven't bought anything
yet
so let's start binding things um first
thing password entry edit text box as
the content a normal original text so
now original text doesn't exist because
this is a different view model in fact
it doesn't a minute because the
underlying settings view model is
actually set to text entry stuff that
wants an avid one password entry design
model and that will be a puzzles just
change this so we know first I'll change
it back and where did we start putting
like stars and so we entered it in the
design model which is fine in the
password and view model we do that by
default so let's remove that let's let
the thing constructing inserted and so
we only do it in two places one is in
the design model which is fine and one's
in the real place which is a rather this
is the design model still so we did it
in the constructor of the actual view
model itself before and whereas now we
don't we explicitly set it here so it's
also set it here so this should be fake
design just want to prove the binding
works first
so in design time we should see fake
design and absolutely design model sorry
this is the S right in a minute this is
the run time so that's fake
and in a design time we want big and
we'll change this back after I just want
to prove that the binding works chef
where else for now doing anything so
that's it so we've got the design model
itself let's fake design the setting
interview model creates a new view model
with vacant and the settings the
settings design model has a same thing
again yeah so this one's also fake
design time as this in the second one we
see that in here so if we then bind if
we bind this text now to fake password
see they're fake design here in the
settings page we should also see fake
design because that's what we entered so
there we go we see the fake design and
then run time we should see the word
fake so then we know the binding is good
for that and we can change it back to an
actual start there you go
so that's the binding for the display
text so now let's just change all those
back now we're happy that that's done
correctly
and that's that bit done so we have the
display bound and next so the underlying
content which is this edit content
well first we want this is the UM
current password oh I don't have
anything to it open PowerShell Chrome
password then we want to more when this
is new password confirm password so give
them all names as well so current
password new password confirm password
when it double clicks winner on the
first one to focus test so let's get rid
of the focus on the other two we also
don't want to in the grid make some rows
also just simply size to whatever we
want but because we're going to have
this text box and until this winner of
the you know the the new in the confirm
will triple a new on the row below
and the other one on the road below
though and to us right and then we will
want we need to go back to the password
env view model as well as label and fake
password without the and the current
password in text and then the new in the
confirm new and then in a constructor we
will leave them blank we'll let the the
design model in fact now we won't leave
them blank we'll set defaults for these
and again we should replace with
localization text so this can be a
multi-language application so we really
need to start adding in a localization
soon well for now we'll just type in
English and type it direct so we'll have
current password pin text is from
password new and confirm and then the
design model will pick up on those
defaults anyway so we shouldn't have to
do anything with the design models then
we'll combine the current password too
and also two lines correctly let's rule
them bind the tag we use in the style
the password hint text and believe it is
let's just check that one works
wrong box but yeah that works
I'm back not-it's not the wrong box who
simply got these in the wrong order
somehow because that's also the one that
focuses when we double click current
well I've done the rows on so simply
prove that row down to there and that
row down to there there we go and we now
know that work so buying the tags to the
other to change this to a new password
let's click confirm now I'll have the
three password boxes we need all data
bound in terms of the hint texts and the
display so you've got password double
click now it's ask you for your current
password new and confirm so you need to
tell it flowers liar
whatever and then you press ENTER and
we'll actually just check the logic
there so wrong password the current
password is invalid that's fine so we
know that should be testing with a
capital T will type that right I know
that pop-up needs to have an enter
button ok so that's something is not
working a little logic there let's
quickly check that out
password where is it the view model is
net password entry view model so our
logic that does this check is and not
working so we should probably can't see
it very well here but oh I know why we
haven't bound the passwords that was a
last step so I'm going to add a meself
by pressing enter but I'm sure we
haven't found anything to these
passwords so they're nothing right now
also we want to just quickly I don't
enter to that pop-up dialog if that is a
quick thing I'm not going to waste time
and it's not um dialogues based dialogue
dialog message box
um default true see that's now working
when you press ENTER and in fact escape
it should also be default and cancels
employed any button should get rid of
that dialog I think that's it so now
enter will get without dialogue let's
also make a scapegoat of that dialog
because it's simply a you know a popup
message really ok and cancel
you know both should really close though
so I will press escape that's it's now
we have a nice Waker yeah touch things
so I think the last thing there I'm
quite happy with that animation so I was
going to do like a feather just fading
them in and it jumping invading them out
I was gonna you know size the the
overall height but to be honest I think
that's what over animation I think
that's nice that's that doesn't hurt the
eyes really I've noticed this is jumping
them let's just align the picture to the
top so this is in a grid vertical
alignment top
it's badass smart doesn't jump see I
think the last thing this dialog box is
banging these three controls to the
actual secure text or we can simply
because we don't do anything with it
until we we actually you know press the
the check if you will it's at that point
you could actually notice that we enter
we could basically presume that until
they run a check until they call the
save or edit then we pull the data or we
could do it based on actual edit in you
know the editing the text itself so
let's just have a quick look and think
about it so it's going to be
self-contained in this control yeah so
actually we are we're always in control
of this but I think for for everything
we need here I don't as a reason why not
to bind it to the the commands so what
we're going to do and is in oh we can't
money to the Commandant well we could
but now we're going to going to update
it as it changes because this doesn't
want to start interfering with the view
model itself we simply want to provide
the view model with the information and
doesn't you know as often as possible so
we need to text box let's do password
changed and that's current password
changed so in their update Li view model
prior of the new password so we'll have
um if data context is password is
password view model
password entry view more so this is
checking that it is that we actually
have a data context in case we don't so
we have a data context then the view
model darts original which is really
starting to learn actually rename these
too much so this is the current password
um label current new confirm edited
password change to new current password
new password confirm password current
new confirm new confirm that's all good
rather so the view models current
password equals and the current password
which should be on this zama that's not
showing up in so the name is con
passwords that should be showing up I
see just I think they're looking at this
there's amell's we just need to clear
the project to fix that so this should
exist it's just we've got broken
intellisense at the minute and that
should be I think just password nothing
that's secure let's try and compile up
build ok so it's just this password
because we don't have intellisense
password box secure password one want it
could also be because we don't have X in
front of the name so it's got some
namespace conflicts no such fine so
cont'd a view model will do that for the
other two so on the password changed of
these two or have new password changed
the Korean password changed and the
backend code will copy all of this again
remember we're doing this because you
can't data bind to a secure string as
the whole point is it's in safe because
view models are stored in variables sort
of accessible via simple reflection and
simply pulling out so an application
could just read that value very easily
so whenever you're dealing with
passwords you keep them in the RAM and
when you unsecure them you always do
them in like inline statements you never
store them as a standard string anywhere
unless you absolutely have no choice and
then you keep it in memory for the
shortest amount of time and so that's
why we're doing this work in terms of
every time the password changes updating
the secure password to match which this
might be a pointers this might be okay
to actually do once on creation which we
can you know we'll have a look at after
but this is how we're doing it and why
we're doing it
so that's with a new password what's new
password cause new password confirm
password confirm password and password
so now that should all update and as we
type we should get them and then when we
get to the view model which is here this
should now work we should be able to
unsecure and check the real value and if
not then we'll also let's see what we
got and then we'll delete this life this
is something again you could never do
actual new password equals password on
secure so again this is exactly what I'm
talking about what to never do never
unsecure and store in a value RS I'm
just going to do this to check that we
actually do have the values we think we
have that we've done all the you know
the code right
so I've new currents and confirmed that
a breakpoint there so let's run this and
we should get first hint that it works
as they would type testing it should
pass that validation so we type test in
without the G should move she does it
would be and then put a b c d e f and
and so it shouldn't say it's not testing
you should say that these others don't
match which it now does the new on
confirmed no-match so ABC ABC we got
through so now the current password
should be testing which is not out
because we've updated it here too much
so we knew it was because this check
worked then we've gone ahead and updated
the current password here and that's
just again for this demo that would be
done on there you first ask the server
to update the password have it confirmed
it dead then you know you set this but
really this is something that probably
won't even stay in the view model when
we have the server doing the word
because the the current password will
never be stored anywhere you'd simply
keep passing it back to the server so
current password ABC they will be all
match now because those two matched and
then we set the current to match that so
that's all working so let's just delete
that because that's what you never do
and it's just run once more see what's
left but i think us that's pretty much
the password box done i think so we have
normal boxes for edit names and things
you have password box now that
highlights and says current passwords it
checks with the right one and that isn't
test test so it's current passwords and
valid the scored test in a capital T and
then that works and closes and this is
this still stays the same and then also
one should obviously ask the server to
change the password that would probably
pop up with a message saying
successfully changed or we might have
some kind of a little hover over here
like a green box that says successfully
changed and fades out after a second SOT
a nice subtle him that it actually
worked
but again that's we need the backend
code to do that so that's a password box
which is a colleague of anything else
we've we need there we could obviously
do a check that we actually have a
password because give it leave it blank
so that we would do and again yeah you
only want to do very basic checks and
addie model to the server will handle
the real logic of what's allowed as a
password but we know for a fact you
shouldn't be able to have a blank
password I'm sure some applications well
I can't see any application expecting or
allowing a blank password so we simply
check we check the length of the blog we
know they match so it doesn't know about
the matching or not we just simply now
have to check one so the length becomes
equal zero exactly actually have a
password password too short in some
ironic vein message you must enter a
password so now if we enter the word
testing but then leave the other two
blank we should get that warning that
you know you've got at least them enter
password what you do so I think and that
is the password field all done now do
the logout bought nothing called have I
don't know where to put the logout
button visually I guess below for now
is okay I just add it to the grid like
everything else and then we could we
could fix this I think this just the the
whole project needs cleaning and
building and I don't think just the
standard clean I'll do I think we need
to delete the vs folders and everything
for this to update to you know hide the
the other boxes that aren't hiding
correctly but I'll clean that afterwards
I'm sure that's just a you know
restarting visual studio and cleaning up
to get this to share the correct tag so
then ignore that for the moment lights
the wrong height we've got the stack
panel of those in now let's try and if
truck a button in with content and just
type it in manually for the moment let's
get a feel for this happening big logout
button that's a bit big font size
Rushmore a bit too small
regular seems okay with me then we
probably want to move it to others in a
bit this is just ER oh yeah these are
all set via the thing that also isn't
working that's why I can tell we just
need to clean the cache because this is
all out to a line in design time when it
wasn't before and so in fact let me just
completely clean and reopen everything
okay I've just completely deleted all
the PS folders to bin the object to
clean the project rebuild the project so
let's see if that's fixed the visual
removing that house there we go so if
you get that issue all you do is open
the project folder open folder and then
you delete the bin the object folder you
go one you delete the hidden BS folder
then you restart clean solution build
solution and because sometimes WPF gets
out of sync so now we've got the correct
looking UI and it's correctly aligned at
design time that logout button I think
that we honest looks okay therefore now
you know what I think I'm going to
anything else word back so I have the
login button
we need to bind this so right now we
have setting new model so we want a
public string hog out button text except
for the logout button again this will
come from localization but for now we'll
simply set it directly titles logout and
then we'll need a command to actually
log out so about open/close and the log
up command really wants to and just make
use of a shared logout which we don't
have right now both it will leave it in
the settings but that'll probably end up
moving to actually to be honest it's
fine in the settings you model but if we
have another view model that also wants
to logout from somewhere else
that view model should simply get access
to this and then fire the logout command
we don't want to write the same logic
twice but this is the first time we've
done on logout so it's okay going here
so logout command open close I'll sneeze
out and then for that we simply have to
go to page log in in this case which we
would want to go to be Ward clear marker
she would confirm the user wants to log
out which right now we don't have a
confirm box we only made the okay box
we've got to do that you know the yes/no
type dialog box so for quickness will
just simply ignore that for now but put
it to do enter that you would confirm
first that the user wants to do this
then when we've got the backend storage
and we actually have some information
about the user you know we've actually
stored information and clear any user
data to cache then then finally you want
to clean or on application level view
models that contain any information
about the flowing user so for that we
take a look at and I think when we're
binding so we look at where and the
application will buying static things
and so we've got the UI manager which
doesn't have anything about the
application and the settings you model
right now so let's take a quick look at
application we have one person on the
application one character application
view model got the current page that's
nothing to do with the user settings
visible that's nothing to do so the
application view
doesn't contain anything about the user
settings your model contains name
username password and email so they are
all definitely a user specific piece of
information
now again right now we just set them
here in the constructor so the very
first time the application runs that's
not really the correct place to set them
so you would set these when you log in
so let's move that and kind of set them
at the point where we click login so
let's actually do something now when we
log in and this will all obviously come
together to real code as we do
everything else but now here you'd say
this is pretending to login so so you
login ok successfully logged in now get
users data so to do ask server for users
info and then right now we populate the
IOC you've got settings dot name with
this so now at this point you've logged
in we've set the users information to
this and let's set the let's just or
rather not what's that the name for that
let's set the name book post fix it with
date time so let's do local time we'll
do to just look at the time as an offer
to Phi so that we have some idea when
this was set and so it's going to set it
when you log in and then it's going to
go to the chat page so in here when we
log out we're not going to clear it
right now so when we first log in you'll
see that we get the time of what is
right now and then when we log out and
log back in in fact rather when we log
in it's going to replace it anyway but
when we log out we want to clear that
information because if you stay logged
out and you potentially got that you
know data and memory still you you're
storing the users data that should have
been cleared
so let's just actually clear it here and
instead of doing this name equals you
know empty this equals empty that it's
empty
when add one was called clear user data
a lot of function to the settings view
model to do that we're in the settings
you man don't need to call IRC doc
second is ourselves so we'll have a new
function public void clear user data
please any data specific littering user
and then as always whenever you're
adding a function in a view model you
should always have a command for that so
that things could data binds to that
function if they needed so the command
to clear users data
I'm the new model of the create user
data command and we'll create it there
clear user data permit equals clear user
data all done and then here we want the
name to equal string dot empty text out
a text entry and so we want these name
circle and you and will simply wipe them
out for now or we could even set them to
nope you know just completely wipe them
out and let them be recreated by when we
login so I think there's no harm in
doing that password an email so that's
cleared all the info clear all clear
models containing compel slice of run
through this before we actually run the
code so we've got the log out button
I want to bind that now too cool um what
did we call it log out button text so
that should then update when we build
there we go so we got log out text the
command when we flip the boss now wants
to be logout command so we'll click the
button we get the logout command the log
out command will get here
it should ask the user to confirm that
is something we need to do it should
then CLE have any user data caches and
something that's physically stored on
this machine like because you will start
writing you know data to the machine
especially the users credentials when
they've logged in you'll have like
they're you don't have the password but
you'll have an access key that allows
the application to otherwise the user so
you need to clear all that information
when we have that and again that's not
in right now so we simply don't add it
and then we can clear in memory data
which is this clear user data this is
what's in a view model you know the live
view model in memory so we clear that
off then we just go to the login page
and on the login page now or on a login
view model rather in the login again we
successfully logged in and then we asked
the you know we usually then clearly the
server for the users data or in the the
reply of login it will simply provide us
with this real information anyway but
for now I've simply dumped it in here
and set the name to the time we
effectively logged in if you will just
to show it working and then we go to the
chat page so that's work we should now
have a a basically working log in log
out system with you know all the data
ready to be plugged into the real server
so we go to here and now you'll see the
other issue we've started the
application without logging in so
there's no info so that will fix that
but that's a good start that shows us
that with effectively we've got no info
because we aren't logged in we just we
forced the application to start at the
chat page and then we were not logged in
so let's check the logout works to know
so let's just check why are we settings
you model log out let's check we're even
hitting this command
so we're hitting this command clue in
the users data want to go to the login
page current pages login side menu
visible as lap so that should be going
to the login page
oh it does but we don't hide the the
settings page which is something we need
to do so where do we have oh yeah
settings menu visible so also on go to
page so I'm invisible or not shouldn't
be visible in fact we should always hide
the setting page of a changing pages I
think so always hide settings page if we
are changing pages settings menu visible
if it was false and then what you'll get
is that will be fading out as the logins
fading in as well so we have no info we
log out now we're not going to see the
animation really well so let's do that
again so we go here we log out that
slides out that slides in now is ensign
back in and then when we've signed in
this time we've now got all that with
the date time that we have logged in and
then when we log out against up 730 and
also we probably want to handle what
happens I mean that you could you could
handle this overlap and you could
potentially just have as you hover over
it tells you what the full text is or
the user is double clicked and you can
see the value so top view is another
tool tip over there I think we'll do
that in a minute but you can see there
are seven thirty four in the morning 21
if we log out we log back in now 734 58
and we log out together she'll get to
735 and there you go so we've basically
got there the logout working and we've
got the password box all done so I think
that's really it we I know one thing
people are dying for me to do is this
side menu so I'll probably do that in
the next video where is in you click
this and something happens here no
loading pages based on content so the
answers in the comments where people
asked but obviously there's a lot of
people that now want to take this and go
racks like that now want to do something
here how do I do that so I'll probably
do this in the next video but at least
now we've got a way to log in and out of
the application and typically you should
start at the login so if we start here
where we just force it to go to the you
know the initial page and there's no
info because we haven't logged in it's
kinda to be expected so we can the way
I'd fixed that is because usually you'd
open the application you'd load the
user's data from a back-end storage I'm
just going to this basically change the
application view model to simply start
back at the login page because we're
going to add the actual real login stuff
not far from now so that's but you know
why you're not getting the information
because we simply don't set the
information until we login so via the
noise when you want to see the
information simply paste this into a
lovely back where we were application
from you my command where we put it but
we did you dump it in was a good place
dump it in the constructor of the
settings view model of you want and like
here so you want it to always appear by
default then you can just slap it there
and that could be or you know your place
that you product but I'm just going to
stay so the page now open is the login
page by default so the application opens
we get that we login and in fact because
we're working on this page that is
actually going to annoy me
so now let's
stumped Messenia for now as we mentioned
so we've got it in both places and with
a note to remove this and then this will
be mean now when you're not logged in
you just won't have a time on the name
so that's a way for you to visualize you
know whether you've logged in and then
we'll swap the application view model
back again to the shaft and the true and
there we go we've got the info back when
you log out and log in you'll actually
get the time in your name so that's all
that all good let's maybe just quickly
do this tools here let's get that out of
the way
I'm hoping that so simple things and I'm
hoping that we'll remember how you even
do it so we all want to be in text entry
controls are more with WPF would
remember the layout position always
forget it
so it's on this text and I was off a
tooltip yep we have content yeah
testing I really can't know what you do
with the tooltip doesn't like that too
complaining up now maybe this has a
filter but maybe so simple
and then we probably want a style a
tooltip but for now all that was easy so
all's we want to do is bind the tooltip
to the value so let's just do that cool
tip is buying into original text and
then we also want to go to the class
word and preview model entry control
roller and then in this one oh no
password you don't want the tooltip if
you don't want to see the password so
that was nice and quickly up a tooltip
and then we could override the tooltip
style to look nicer so hover over there
but again for now I think that's fine so
if we logged out logged in and now the
text is too large you hover and you see
the whole text that's a you know a lot
like that that was easy
again will style that tooltip in another
video it's super easy just make a new
style override the tooltip and will
probably change the background quarter
faded yellow or maybe even use this
orange ooh it's not too bold and all
make it look similar to a you don't want
to look the same as a button though but
we'll come up with that stylist that's
nothing complicated so there we have it
we've got the password entry dialog all
done we've got some logic and testings
we added the end to an escape on this
dialog and then we've done the logout
and login logic so hopefully that was
useful next video we'll probably focus
on the sidebar everybody's wanting to
load content into here as usual any
questions comments just let me know in
the video and I'll get back to you
