video I think it was video 7 the use of
enums ratha take a deeper look and
explain them a bit more in depth and
then also show you a real world example
of where we're now using them in the
receptor word application so just
started a new console application and
made a few notes of what we want to
cover this is just a bog-standard
dotnet call console app you can make any
this is just the purposes of the demo so
we're going to get started with first
what our enemies so by an enum I mean if
we go here and do probably norm my inner
ones and this is an email so any
knowledge of the keyword I need to type
and the point of an enum is to store
certain values so the first point of
what is an enum an enum is a type like
any other and for the most part so the
same as you know an integer a string an
object of all types in C sharp so this
is just another another type if you
think of it is like you know another
style of variable it's the simplest way
to try and think of an enum in terms of
you know not technically what it is
defined and how you explain it in terms
of what it really is but to understand
it just think of it as it's just like
being another variable like an integer
so this is all the enum is an enum then
contains values so you can have my value
1 mile value 2 and so on so now you can
see you're starting to get a list and
this list is then at a set of hard-coded
constant values we're typing them
they're not create a ball at runtime
they are no defined a compile time so it
sort of brings us onto while doing quad
blend is onion to bass type so
an enum is a constant list of values and
you can see when you hover over them you
getting this one zero and then one
and then we added another one I'll hover
over there basically getting assigned
and entered your value by default so if
we then try to get a value from this so
we'll say my e-number we have to pick
one so pick value one and you can hover
over email and you can see that a is
available a is a sign but never use us
so it's showing you that it's an enum of
a type in 'm and there so basically we
have a type of enum or in this case a
type of my enums so this acts like the
name integer it becomes this is the name
of vino so you don't get an enum where
you have where you've stayed tributed
int I equals 1 and this int here is the
type you can type email a equals my in
I'm going to stop my value 1 so you
can't have a type in on but you can have
a type of the name of the enol so the
slight variation is this isn't the type
this becomes you know the name of the
type of this enum so slightly different
than standard variables but again try to
think of them as the same thing so when
you assign a value of the your specific
enum to a variable it's effectively the
type of your enol now there's different
base types so as you can see here what
can you do with that value because right
now it's a you know specific to this
enol so you can make use of that value
so for example a classic places in a
switch statement or let's just doing it
for simplicity so say if a equals equals
and actually you can compare them to you
have set values you can do logic based
on and the type of value also when you
come to store these values so you store
them in databases or code-behind files
they can't be stored as an enum because
this is just a constant
and compiled type so you either have to
convert it to a string and physically
save this name or you convert it to the
underlying base type so an Elan by
default is an integer and that's why
I'll either gain auto assigned an
integer value so that means you could
have for my Inc equals and we'll just
cast the value to an integer or you can
simply grab another enum
cast the value to an integer and then if
we were to run this example we will see
that my integer is equal to one and it's
it doesn't integer type as well so it's
cast this enum to an integer and that's
by default there the underlying enum
types are integers and you rarely ever
have to change them and if you do you
can change them to basically any whole
number type so you can change them to
say a bite like that and now we have a
bite and this'll still cast 5 and
because they're all interchangeable
about can be cast to an integer you can
also have things like short just again
different and long different lengths of
number values so that's how you change
the base type if you wanted to so you
want to sort some really long values and
you could say I'm signed long or in
c-sharp rather you long
it stands for unsigned long and it's a
64-bit integer so now you can have a
really really really long number and
then here you can also assign specific
values so by default you can see it gets
zero the next one gets warm and epsilon
gets too but you can go ahead and say oh
this is going to be full this is going
to be five it's going to be one and now
if we run this example my value to that
was an integer now five so again another
aspect of an enum by default the value
goes zero one two
if you start the value at two and then
you hover over the rest you can see they
do then continue from two onwards you
can also say my value three equals my
value two plus four so you can also
combine them as well which now that was
two that will be three so that will be
seven and that's how you add you know
set the values so usually I like to
explicitly set values and I like to
start at one now it is recommended that
you also have a zero value so you could
say like unknown that's what a typical
tort is zero so that's for if and the
reason I do that is by default an enum
is an integer and by default an integer
so we do int equals default integer
you'll see that I will equal zero so a
default integer is zero so for any
reason somebody creates an email from an
integer or you know a default value
anywhere comes into the system I kind of
catch that by the fact that it's
unexpected whereas if we have my value 1
as 0 it could inadvertently be thought
of as a valid value so that's just a
reason behind why I do 0 is unknown
typically and then my values starting I
also explicitly state each one so it's
very clear glancing when this list
becomes 20 long you can easily see the
value of that name that moves on to
where to use them so my value 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
are not very useful so one of the places
we have used them and that's in the
Fassett their word application is for
animations so we have a function let's
just make a quick function public static
animate and then we want to pass in so
let's rename this to animation direction
come we'll have left right up down you
can see now this is the Y of major so I
want to animate something we don't know
what it is before we expect a direction
so we pass it in just like another type
of variable like passing an integer in
you pass in there the enum type of
animation direction now in here you
could say if direction it goes it goes
left console dot write line and I'm
making left and we'll doing a live which
is you know L to this the classic way to
do enemy is through your switch so you'd
simply switch on the direction and then
you do a case of left and then you'd
write anime Kingdom I'm making laughs
like so I just have right up and down up
top and bottom left right up down and
they'd also want to handle the unknown
case of default so it's anything else
and that's how you usually consume an
enum and also the point of the negative
valid function at the point of why we've
created this is because we have a very
set requirement of values a constant
list if you will so we want to animate
something in a certain direction
and we know there's only four directions
we want to animate them
so we create an ite Imam to be able to
pass it in like a variable and simply
define very clearly what we want to do
so if we just change this now to
something that will still work and then
we move on to where to use them which is
we've used them here so then we would do
something like animate and now you can
see we can easily pass in an enum like
this is very clear looking at the
statement and that we want to animate
right so now we run and we will also
want to uncheck that and do console
bleed when I'll just stop the console
from closing you can see now hello world
and then animating right so this is now
catching and processing and this is why
we've used it to aid our function so now
we can make a universal function that
will animate in all four directions and
the caller can simply pass in a you know
a specific animation direction so this
moves on to them casting to and from
integers or to and from whatever base
type which is typically an integer so as
I mentioned before you store the value
anywhere then you end up storing so you
store it in a database the value can't
go in as Ninon because a database
doesn't know what an enum is so it gets
converted down to an int which is
something that a database doesn't know
so have you ever saved the value pull it
back in or yeah he's converted to Jason
maybe and send it over the Internet you
typically want to convert it to you know
it's based typing on its string name
because the other thing is if you've
stored this value in a databases with
you a user signing up to your website
and this was a gender and it was male
female and you had this running he had a
hundred users and then you realized
you'd misspelled mail and it was spelled
incorrectly you could then rename the
enum to you know something else
but the underlying value should stays -
so then you
application and everywhere else your
value now updates to the correct name
but you haven't then just lost all of
the backing values in the database or
the stories the the value stays the same
so you always really want to store as
the answer not this name this should
really be used for developer purposes
only for ease of visual you know visual
aid when passing values in so firstly we
know how to get the value to an integer
because we've quickly shown it here so
you can cast say this a which is left
you've cast it to an integer so a as
integer and you just do this is simply
casting just like we've done here so now
we have the animation left as an integer
and then to cast it back to an enum so
it will be a buck as itself and you'd
simply cast the integer we have back to
the animation Direction enum so it's
just basically boxing and unboxing a
value to a specific type so we run this
now and debugged you can see that we
have a which is a left animation
direction a is an integer as one which
much is the value and then a buck is
itself as converted back so that's how
you convert to and from integer values
directly when you have an integer you've
got about you can also create one
directly so for direct create equals and
then you can do animation direction of a
value for and you can see four should be
down so then if we run this direct
create should be an enum of down which
it is so you can also instant eight
enums directly from numbers the the
weird thing you can do as well without
error as you can assign to an enum that
doesn't exist so you can just do six and
convert it to that type and it won't
data and the weird thing is now even
though it's technically meant to be an
integer
it just has a number six so it's a kind
of a quirk of enums that you can you can
cast an integer to an enum where the
enum doesn't have that value and it will
happily do that so you have to be
careful of that kind of creation don't
presume this will fail if it's an
invalid number so put that back to a
valid number now let's say for whatever
reason you did want to use the string
and the like for example here these
whole animations we could just say get
rid of all the Switch and we will just
output the enum value as a string so we
could do animating and then we just want
to do Direction not to string you
wouldn't have to do this to string
inside Yeats it will automatically call
doctor strings but that's what it's
doing so we just passed in that now and
animating a certain direction we run it
should say animating right because it
should convert to a string so it is as
animating right so now we have a string
value which we can also get here so
enorm as the name of ul and you could
say let's take in that's my int and it's
the agent was taking that egg which is
left and just call a doctor string
English you saw and this enormous string
now should have the string left so you
might need the name of the string for
purposes of display to the console and
things like that and then you might want
to get for whatever reason I don't
recommend doing this this is like a last
resort or if for some reason you only
have a string not the value you can try
and get the enum back from that and you
can do
anon from string and this capital e this
time enum dot Pass is a value and this
will try and pass the string that you're
going to pass in
back to a specific type in our case two
type of animation direction and the
value is the enum is strange
so enum as nameless Corbett and then if
we run this we should end up back with
the original a value which is the enum
left so that's how you cast back from a
string to a needle so a few warnings
here or a few quirks as well let's say
we do this direct cast and it's of an
unknown type but we still have an enum
and then we want to or rather let's just
pass it straight in here so instead of
doing animation right we do animation
direction six it's going to go in as an
enum we're still going to get in here we
should now have animating six because it
should still have turned to an enum
except now that the two sit there to
string converted to the integer value so
again one of those strange quirks we've
been able to create key numbers that
don't have a back in value in essence
you could think of it as if there is no
value six it's exactly the same as it
appearing because of you with this which
is not valid because you can't start a
available with a number but you can
think of it like this this is what it's
similar to doing so if you you know
tried to convert it to six News and
exists then C sharp is automatically
saying ok we'll make an enum that's got
the name six and the value six to you
know allow it to work without crashing
if you will
so that's one of the the quirks there
the other thing with this enum got
passed this is a crushable call so you
can see exceptions there argument no
argument exception and overflow so they
can be thrown based on what you pass in
so if we passed in or then we'll get
argument nor thrown just have to control
ultimi and turn on the second one down
to catch the exceptions now if we run
this you should crash with argument knob
which it does so you got to be always
that might fail we can also passing it
an unknown name and that should fail
with the invalid argument exception no
rather argument exception on its own so
those two things can crash
overflow I'm not sure where it ends up
falling into causing that but it can
obviously throw that as well so how you
should either handle this is if you
expecting that then you could do a try
and you could capture explicitly the
argument exception I think there's a new
C shop seven something like catch where
I can't think of it off the top of my
head but you just do catch argument
exception say you could handle Adams
exception you could do catch arguing no
exception you could handle it that way
or wasn't argument nor was it it was
yeah there was enough no reference
exception so you could handle these two
exceptions that this is expecting to
throw and also overflow and then do
something specific or an easier way
instead of having to try catch the whole
thing is you can just change this enum
path to an enum try pass and now it
won't crash and what it will do instead
is we turn a boolean of it was
successful so now you change your logic
from enum from string that becomes the
variable output here which will now do
out animation direction and cannot
revert from type to string to do okay so
now the tryparse takes in the type as a
generic instead of a type and then the
value is the enum name and the valuable
is passed as an out and outputs there so
now you flip the logic so we just copy
that line put on and do so you can see
the differences so that's one way of
doing it and that feel a way of doing it
and that will be a result in this one
will crash or it doesn't exist
this one will return true or false
whether it works honor so then your
logic would be
if and you brought luck so now every
succeeds will get into here I'm going to
do the console dot write line
successfully converted to and then with
it output the value as well and that
value is enum from string so you can get
cast back to a string anywhere else
console dot write line failed to convert
and then we'll pass the value again
anyway
and it was enemas name was the thing we
were trying to commit so we will Ness we
should see that successful converts and
they're successfully converted to left
but then if we were to change this to
something invalid and we were trying to
convert it won't crash now but instead
it will go to the boolean that says it's
failed to convert something on valley so
there's two ways of processing from
strings you can either do a direct enum
dot parson and try catch the error or
you can do a try part and then do the
logic based on whether it worked or not
but again I'd avoid doing string passing
as much as possible wherever you can
enumerate in the email so an enumerator
by definition that you've also got some
C sharp and then just the English
language in general but the numerator is
something that you you enumerate - so
basically you step through one at a time
and you evaluate and then you continue
so again that that's kind of a list of
you will but a list of something in
programming terms that is already
completely defined and in memory so
everything exists there whereas an
enumerator you don't process each item
until you step into it so in terms of a
database call if you re numerating a
result from a database that says get all
users and there's a million users and
enumerator won't get a million users
from the database it will get the first
one and then when you go to the next one
it will ask the database for the next
record
new step over one at a time whereas a
list would have pulled in the million
users and then you simply iterate
through that in code so an enumerator or
when you talk you see enumeration and or
ienumerable which is a type in the
collections this isn't Vanina don't get
these two things confused an enum is the
type that we're talking about here which
is a list but it's a static you know a
constant list that we've defined but
it's not in any way related to an
ienumerable it's simply well I say
doesn't it's you know it's got
similarities it's a list and it's a
constant and we can you know get the
list of items but it's not anything
related to this ienumerable so when we
say let's enumerate over the enum we
mean let's you know say we have this
type now and we want to do some it we
want to find out what the all these
types are we want to provide some user
interface for the user to select a
direction and then based on that we'll
do some animation so how do you then
present these items to the user or how
do you get those items in the first
place in general so you can enumerate
them in terms of getting all the items
with the catallena which is the helper
class for working with enums and you can
get names and get values so get values
will get you all the enum values of a
specific type so again type of animation
direction so then with no personal
attack
so get values right into a for each
Volvo in the enums console dot write
line and let's just output the value
this will enumerate all of the add not
closed off enough let's really evaluate
all of the values in here which will be
unknown left right up and down and it
will output them to the console they say
that's enumerated all of these values I
know you put a breakpoint ages actually
see each value which you go through so
this is getting the actual enum value
the same as like.he
we have created same as this variable
that's it it's of this tired we know but
this will get each one so you can step
through and do what you like you could
then use the same thing again but you
could say get names and then that will
output and the only difference here is
it simply got value and called a string
going but you know by default so that's
why I have no difference in our loop
here but that's based on whether you
want NZ now it's a string so you can see
the double quotes around it as opposed
it being you know the actual you know so
got those two options to get name or
value and then you might have seen as
well you have enemy get name and in this
type of animation direction and then the
value so we have a value say this left
one so it's passing a and call it beef
really creative name and we run this B
will have the string name a venal which
is left
so really the map is I'm on the line and
reason to do this as opposed a doctor
string I guess the only reason I can see
there is it will potentially do one fact
is not it's going to throw in no it's
not so to be honest I don't see any
point in England up get name when you
know the email itself top to string will
do exactly the same thing and first I
thought well that was north then it
would you know handle that and return a
blank string bit doesn't it throws
argument not so that's no different than
if we were to call you know a dot to
string and a was not it would still then
do the same thing so there's enum lot
get name but I've never used our just
use to string as needed if anyone knows
of a reason or a difference to this then
calling doctor string let me know but
I'm unaware of any everybody's there for
your knowledge so that's the in iam
rating through the string at any waiting
to the emails
getting the values or the strings and
then finally we really have flags
so another use of a constant D nom list
is usually for say options so a classic
place for this is if you go file dot
open and you have file mode you see this
file mode has append create ok that was
actually a bad bad example I don't think
that's the one I was thinking of now
there's an option somewhere and let me
see if I can remember where it's
basically a set of open lead think or is
it an open it's just the overload file
access maybe
so was it file access read now they've
done it readwrite okay so I will try and
think of maybe post in the comment what
I'm thinking of but you can use enums as
like a set of options a flag of you know
various options that can be set in one
go so you could have a public screen on
my options
and let's say we want to give the user
the ability to triangle a good example
here it's real world example we'd have
you can have I mean this is a great
example but you'll get the gist of what
I'm doing here you have the Anna was a
good example so you have a user system
and and you want permissions so user
permissions and it's a very specific set
of permissions here so we have say a
blog site and we want to use it to be
able to have various options so one
would be to read one will be to write
blogs one would be to delete blogs
one would be to create users you can see
the the gist of what we're doing that
these are options that a user might have
but they could pick it up the ability to
read and delete and not write or they
could have all four options and you want
to combine you don't want you know
multiple flights you don't want a
boolean for this a boolean for this
building for there's a building for this
you can just simply have a single value
that can have multiple options set so in
order to do that I've made a video on
bitwise operators 'im and how bits work
in terms of set in there you know the
bits serve either the calculator and I
went to programmer and when I say bit
saving number four and you go to binary
here you can see 0 0 1 0 so these are
the bits here and I won't go in depth of
them a video on this book when you're
setting bits you can set you know this
bit this bit this bit and a bits are
simply on or off so if we've got four
options here we only need four bits in
memory to define each of these options
so this could be the read bit this could
be the right this could be the delete
and this could be the create and you can
see the the decimal value is 8 so we
were to turn on all values then the
decimal is 15 so if we wanted to enable
every option in here we'd expect you
know an integer of 15 so how do we
represent that here well the simple
thing is you want to this number read to
be 1 you want the right to be to you
want the delete to before you want the
create to be 8 see all this doing a
doubling the number so in order to store
all the values you have one two four
eight the next one would be 16 and you
can go back to calculator to see that so
you kept going up you have 16 you see it
there actually the decimal it's a 16 32
64 1 to 8 but you don't really want to
write it that way there's an easier way
to to do the
and to remember these values so he'll
get larger and larger you will be going
32 64 1 2 a 2 5 second you have to keep
doubling your number so instead of
adding add an integer decimal you can
just do Oh X 1 which is no hexa decimal
and hexadecimal again I've done videos
on these so I won't go too much into
depth but you do your hex value which is
you'll notice here 1 2 4 8 and then
you'll notice you go to the next set of
4 which I think it's called a nibble one
it's the before you'll see then a basic
puts a 0 and then it's 1 2 4 8 go to the
next one 1 2 4 8 so you see what's
happening here now in order to define
the values correctly all you have to
remember is that we use 1 2 4 and 8 and
once you've run out you put a 0 on and
you carry on that will naturally then
define an enum
with an or operation to set the flag and
by set the flag I mean set the bit so
now we want to define user permissions
that are say read and delete then we do
it by going to here and do commissions
equals user permissions read and then we
use this pipe which is the all pie which
combines them so it means the value of
this all this and then combine them up
so if either of them are set then the
results includes that bit so because the
read blog has this bit set and the
create blog has this bit set and all
means you know that value all that value
assess so this all this assess the
result is affected like adding them
together so even though it's an all you
can think a lesser sort of an addition
if you LM add so we want to do a read
blog and create blog and if we run that
now you should see that we have we
should have one
us for so we should have an integer five
now or rather nine because it's a
hexadecimal four so if you go to in fact
melet's no I'm going to say that should
i memorize what we've done is the read
and create the read is one creates HRE
cannot delete so we've got eight plus
one which is a noun so you have an
integer value of nine so that is now a
single integer of a value nine but
because the way we've constructed this
with always doubling the value it means
nine can only ever match these two
values so there's nothing else this
could ever combine to so we know that
the you know the user permissions we can
extract these two values from so it's a
good way of compacting and storing
permissions and or any other values in a
single variable so then to read that out
there's also a thing if you're ever
doing this kind of email where it's what
are called flags
so we're indicating this is a set of
options you should have the attribute at
the top that says flags and that's a
helper for certain things and one of the
things that will help is the console dot
right so we know they're console dot
right and we passed in permissions and
we run this it should output the
permissions and you see they're read
blogs create users so it's actually
figured out for us that we have passed
in these two options so you could simply
State this is reading from an integer
and let's say we want it to be be delete
and right so that would be 2 plus 4 is 6
plus the 2 which if we go back to the
calculator of you don't now go to hex
type 2 O so 2 n 2 hex is 32 in decimal
so you got 32 plus will it say delete
them read didn't we so 32 plus 5 more
and that will give us read delete and a
letter B so we want 37 as the value
so we just literally create a user
permission from the integer 37 and then
we output it to the console we can see
it knows it's read delete and B so
that's kind of a concept that you'll
have to understand initially and bitwise
operators and all Alling values together
and which I've covered in the previous
videos and then you can understand that
all we're doing here is going to a
calculator seeing that the binary values
and we're basically using each bit of
the the integer to store a value to
represent one of these so every time we
add a new option we jump down in this
order and we keep jumping down so each
bit in the integer will represent one of
these options and now we can turn on any
combination of these options and simply
use a single user permission so
hopefully that's clear enough that you
understand really everything about enums
so there's nothing more about enum than
then really isn't covered here and again
there the main thing is the use case
which is usually and most typically
things like this where you you want to
pass in a set option like it and animate
a certain direction the alternate option
is when you're storing you know Flags
permissions or things that have multiple
options and again you don't want to a
class with a bunch of billions in you
want to you know user permissions then
the other thing with that is so you've
created this enol with user permissions
here and you now want to say well in
your logic we've said this this has got
permissions of read delete and B but in
your code well if you want to say all of
the users got the ability to delete
allow them to or rather if they haven't
don't let them so to do that you'd say
if permissions and you say permissions
and so this is basically how you say it
permissions if they've got permission
for delete they'd say permission and
you've missions leaks equals delete then
you do something so you'd have to wrap
that up
and then that's how you do it so this
logic and again if you understand
bitwise operators this means all the
permissions have been given which
includes delete and the delete has the
bit set so the delete bit only has the
fourth bit set so the third bit set so
the delete bit only has this bit so if
we did delete and and then regardless of
what's in here outside of this bit
because this one only has this bit set
all the others are going to get wiped
out so even though this is got the read
bit set and the B bit set which is
somewhere here because this one doesn't
and we've ended them together these two
naturally get removed and this one only
stays flagged if you will those from
they stay set if this has the delete bit
set as well so this again I'm sure I
covered this in a previous video but
this is how you do effectively checking
of permissions has the delete blog set
so that's the check if it's set and then
if it is you do console.writeline I can
delete so if we run that now we should
see that we can delete so I can delete
and now if we were to remove the delete
which is knocking for off the value so
if we that was 33 we can now see read
blogs and B's there but delete
permissions gone and we also don't
output delete permission that's how you
obviously read back in you know it and
it enorm to see if it contains a
specific one as well so there's
everything covered in enums any
questions let me know again comment on a
video and I'll reply what hopefully this
was a more in-depth tutorial on fully
understanding everything about enums
there isn't really much to them but
there's a couple of concepts that you
need to understand and hopefully they've
all been covered here
