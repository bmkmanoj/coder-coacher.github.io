the how to reference a dotnet core class
library in the.net framework primarily
because one of the users on my channel
called Eric posted this question and
basically I stating it isn't it easier
to use a.net standard class library to
achieve what we were doing in this video
which is to reference a dotnet core
class library I'm trying to answer that
in a comment on the video it's simply
much too large of a response I supposed
to do a quick follow-up video so I'll
quickly show you where they are so we
have done that call here and you've got
a class lobby dotnet core and that was
all that existed at the start of when
DNX come out which is what turned into
dotnet core and obviously during the
evolution of any framework in any
technology in general as it was growing
it got meaning from V next to dark net
from DN v next to d NX
to dotnet core then they started using
words like the dotnet standard and
everything got intermingled so coarse
are very confusing set of terms that
most people still don't understand today
but ensured Donaire standard and as you
see it here which confuses it even more
don't next and that there's not an
implementation it is a standard so it
means it's almost like an interface if
you think of like dotnet core is a class
and next and there's an interface and
the dotnet core implements the dotnet
standard interface and the WPF are
implements a dotnet standard interface
and those version numbers are save
versions of the interface so that's the
way you can think of it that the dotnet
standard is is an interface that defines
how things are as a standard and then
all these implementations all of these
frameworks implement a certain standard
so at the start we had a dotnet core
class library and instantly everybody
wanted to reference them in like WPF and
other places so that they could have
shared code and that's where this in
other words the purpose of
first video to show people who already
have a dotnet core class library and
already got working code but they want
to reference it inside of WPF or Windows
forms or an old asp.net for you know any
reason so that was kind of the point of
that video as dotnet expanded and grew
the issue with dotnet core progressing
was they were trying to maintain this
class library backwards compatibility
with all the frameworks when really
dotnet core is a brand new framework
it's a new implementation that wants to
progress faster than say WPF will
progress so as new standards come out
like the dotnet standard 2.0 Darnell or
is that the the cutting edge he wants to
be released first and because this was
acting as kind of a dual purpose was
acting as a a class library as well as a
shared library with other frameworks so
what they did was they actually split
the dotnet core and specifically the
part of dotnet core like this class
library if you will the fundamental code
sharing aspect of it into its own type
and confusingly they call the dotnet
standard class library which really
throws confusion into the mix because
dotnet standard it is not an
implementation so this really means a
class library that implements dotnet
standard and you can simply select which
version you like so we just create a
dotnet standard so call it class library
standard and then we'll also create a
dotnet core class library so you can see
the difference so new project dotnet
core class library and call this one
cool and you can see understand that if
we go properties the target framework is
now the true dotnet standards and these
are the implementations and 2.0 will be
coming soon so you can now target a
specific framework well not a frame
workers so it's the standard you know of
what your frameworks are meant to
implement
whereas dotnet call class libraries
which was the first ones target
something called net core app so the two
fundamentally different things and the
first video was to show you how to
specifically link call class library
should you already have them with like
WPF and other applications so the
question becomes then why would you not
want to reference a dot or rather create
a dotnet standard a class library over a
dotnet core and really that there are
very little reasons the initial reason
is when this first come out the dotnet
stand the class library about I think
September last year somewhere around
that time there was not much implemented
in the darknet standard so the dotnet
core was ahead of the game it was under
pressure of you know users asked him for
features and wanting things that were
missing like at the very beginning XML
was missing so you couldn't even do an X
document and load things in your
serialization or binary converters there
was so many things missing that the core
class library had far more features so
you could almost use it with you know a
lot more feature set and the dotnet
standard library was far behind so that
was the original reason why but now and
especially with the upcoming release of
dotnet standard 2.0 there's very little
reason to need to use a core class
library unless you are targeting
specifically just a core application so
say you're making and buy a core
application I mean if you go to add new
project can you go to dotnet core and
you're only making it's really an
asp.net core web app and that will run
on Mac Linux and Windows and that's the
that's the dotnet core framework this
new framework so if you were only
targeting you your application was only
ever going to be this asp.net framework
then you could target a dotnet core
class lie because shared it between say
multiple asp net core applications so
it's sort of if this is your whole world
this is all you're going to design then
go ahead and create plus libraries here
however if you want to make
WPF apps or Windows universe laps or
xamarin apps or any other then typically
you'd want to create a dotnet standard
class library and that's the way you do
it now and again you'll find certain
things missing right now in dotnet
standard that are in dotnet core but you
can install the preview tools in order
to get the dotnet standard 2.0 which
will have almost everything implemented
so cutting a long story short usually if
you're starting a new project simply
creative class lobbyists dotnet standard
and then reference that instead so we
now go ahead and do similar to the first
video let's create a new project let's
make a WPF application and that will do
let's just make sure everything builds
first there's no issues everything's
built and now on the WPF app you
right-click right click on the
references add reference and you can
reference the standard library as normal
and it will reference and if you build
you'll probably get an error so now it's
seen the dotnet standard 1.4 combi
reference by 4.5.2 and again same fix as
the last one you can simply up your
target framework or you can lower the
standard library implementation here and
if you might be asking well where's that
list or you know where do I find that
information so if we go to here the same
place before Microsoft comm yin GB or
en-us dotnet standard net - standard
you'll get this dotnet platform standard
table and this table here shows what's
implemented so we're on 4.5.2 so I like
right in the middle here and we
basically know that now anything that
targets the dotnet framework for point
five point one has to have one point two
so you'll find it supports one point
three as well but if we drop this to one
point two and now build we've lost some
of the api's that were obviously in one
point four but now we've successfully
reference this library and we
build against it you can go to 1.3 and
that succeed is kind of a in-between
state that wasn't mentioned you go to
1.4 and it won't build because 4.5.2
doesn't implement as you can see here so
we offer our target four point six point
two we should build the reference the
latest online system which is one point
six so we changed our net standards one
point six change a WPF application to
four point six point two and now these
two should be on effectively a very
up-to-date thing and you can see here is
now saying it's not implemented so let's
just drop it to 4.6.1
because that's technically the explicit
version it says it's capable so it's
still complaining even though this table
is telling us that the darknet standard
framework implementing 4.6.1
supports this and it doesn't so I think
it's table slightly out to sync but
let's go ahead and say jump to framework
four point seven and see if that allows
us to target one point six so there we
go so there's there's a slight issue
with this table in what it says it is
and what it really is
so four point six oh so stable just
updated ah I see so I need tooling 2.0
preview in order for this to work so
I've been open the eyes have been
following this table here not this one
so we've obviously got tool in 1.0 so we
need four point six point two that we
run only supports one point five whereas
we've jumped to four point seven which
is allows us to target one point six so
we have sold the tooling 2.0 preview we
could use four point six point one as
well
but the point of all this is you can
this is the typical way at work you
create a dotnet standard library and you
kids a framework ideally to the highest
possible between your shared
applications and that's how you do work
so so you were making a WPF application
so it's the dotnet framework and you're
making a salmon iOS app and let's say a
universal Windows platform so what you'd
have to do is ask
each one so the i/os the the windows
platform and the dotnet framework you'd
have to find the newest framework that
all three supports so along here this is
saying V next which basically as far as
I gather that's the latest thing I
haven't got a version number yet so
ignore that part so we need to have say
the windows yeah you WP targeting 10 and
then we can hit 1.4 and we can't really
go above it to 1.5 because it's not out
yet officially so this is the lowest
point here one point for iOS supports up
to 1.6 and dotnet framework supports up
to 1.5 or one point you know the whole
works if you get the tooling so these
are the lowest point in this chain as
we'd have to drop our shared don't let
standard plus library to version 1.4 in
order to support you WP and now it can
be used with all these frameworks here
so it can be used with every one of
these if you wanted to target everything
including even Windows Phone Silverlight
which is Windows Phone 7 I believe then
you'd have to lower it right down to the
standard 1.0 which means you've been
missing a lot of things so there's a
compromise between what's going to be
available in order to hit you know the
cross-platform area compared to a
trade-off of having say a modern dotnet
standard class library that can have
more features but potentially you can't
target certain things so you can use
this as the reference as you know how
I've just explained in that table to
pick your donut standard class library
version number and the idea is to get as
high as possible and then I thought in
order to explain for people that have
been using dotnet core and I wondering
what this dotnet standard is because the
part of the problem is as things
progress fast and even the best of is
constantly working in software and
trying to keep up with constant change
like the dotnet framework is and all the
terminologies and the names and things
that we've got used to it can be
difficult so a new comic coming in might
start and just read a document and they
simply create a dotnet standard library
and get going
we were using salmon and the latest
tutorials they'll be pushing dotnet
standard class libraries but if you've
used it already have you've already been
using DNX or dotnet core or anything
that you've known it has in the past
you'll likely still be using these
dotnet core class libraries and be
wondering what the hell they stock next
under class libraries because dot knows
done that is not an implementation as we
mentioned so in order to explain that
instead of me babbling on to a video for
an hour I thought I'll try and find a
good explanation and I found one here on
Microsoft's website and I think this
link is by far the best link that
explains mainly for people that have
already used net core I know wondering
what the difference is so he's the
original how we been using it if you
will and this is a dotnet core plus
library here called core library and you
can see they've got Devon effectively
different layers these are different
based libraries and the first video we
managed to make a link between these two
libraries thanks to you know the late
latest frameworks allowing that kind of
link but as we go down when that
standard library now has separated what
this core library was trying to do and
make this interface between all three
and it's become its own thing so now a
dotnet standard library is a true layer
between these and you can see they're
trying to now drop if you will the the
core is even a module in this layer so
the donnetta standard library is is the
true cross-platform library and again if
you scroll down you'll have this table
again which they try to make easier with
an arrow and you keep going and you'll
find the key part I think that helps
people understand the difference is it
starts here the.net standard to breaking
changes and you keep going and explains
what it is and what was missing and then
we'll find it in a minute and then this
statement to think really solidifies the
thing that you'll be after there the
what's the difference question that will
come up and I will read it out to you
but in short it tells you that
in the beginning the issue was that the
dotnet core was trying to bridge this
gap and act as like a standard and it
was slowing the progression now so again
then I really recommend reading this
page if you want to understand the
difference and a lot of the changes that
have gone on so I'll put this link at
the bottom of the video and you can
happily read but hopefully that's
clarified this question to Eric and I'll
get back to you just after this video
but yes it is correct in saying that
really you should reference don't know
standard libraries and then you can
target all these frameworks but the only
downside is again you might be missing
that a few things in the dotnet standard
library that are available in the core
library however if you want to you can
sort of put up with that or even just
install the.net standard 2.0 preview
tools so that you can get on to 2.0 or
I'm sure you'll find you'll have
everything you need there so hopefully
that's clarified it again any more
questions just let me know and I'll get
back to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
