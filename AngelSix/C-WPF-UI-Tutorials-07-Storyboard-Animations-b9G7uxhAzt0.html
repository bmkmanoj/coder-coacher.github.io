videos I went away for a week and I want
to come back as you can probably tell I
got laid off so I'm going to cold only
just about good enough to be able to
speak so that you can hear me clearly so
that's the reason for that of long gap
between videos in this video we're going
to cover some WPF animations we're going
to keep it short again just because I've
got a cold and I want to be coughing
into the mic all the time and then I'll
just do multiple videos over the next
few days in you know smaller chunks so
we're just going to cook some basic
animations in this video so we've got
the processor word application if we
give that a quick run
I'm sure you'll remember it have you
been following the other videos we've
basically got the sign up screen done
we've got an email you can enter a
password that you can answer and we've
got a basic a few buttons and you can be
sighs and move around and what have you
so now we're ready to do these are the
register page or once you're sign and go
to the other page so we basically need
to transition between two pages and to
do that the Mars on now add some nice
animation so we probably love this login
screen to maybe slide in from the right
when it is loaded and then when you
click Next or when you collect I have an
account it slides out that way and the
next screen slides in or something we'll
do some kind of animation we'll figure
out as we go and then the same thing to
get started we'll just make this hover
like a smooth animation and study just a
snap and WPF as always there's about 50
ways to do everything so we'll show you
one way we go to the login page we'll
click this button we know it's basically
a default button style so we go to the
buttons and we go to
regular button we've already got some
triggers for mouse-over I'm setting the
property background so got what we want
here we just want it slightly different
so instead of a trigger you want an
advanced trigger and it's called a
routine event instead of a normal event
and it's mouse and just instead of is
mouse over so basically going to delete
this trigger afterwards but we're using
this as reference so mouse overs become
mouse enter trigger event from event and
routine event instead of property and
then we will want to begin a storyboard
so in WPF or animation should be done
through storyboards you shouldn't
manually be changing properties to like
resize things or moves and use a
storyboard because that's Hardware
accelerate accelerated and heavily
optimized and things like that so a
storyboards basically an animation in
WPF so we begin the storyboard and now
we need to actually create the
storyboard then we create the storyboard
there there's multiple types of
animations you can do you can do number
animations color animations three type
animation in so you got building an
animation decimal animation character
animation there's a lot of different
types of animations we're changing the
color so we can animate a brush a brush
- a brush like we've done here so
instead of setting the background we're
going to have to set the background
color so use a color animation we want
the color to go - and then we need the
color so it can basically copy this just
without the brush at the end - on the
actual color so we want to transition to
blue on hover you've got the duration
which is hours : minutes : seconds till
dew point three seconds and then you
need to do the we need to get this the
target name so it's an attached property
in this case so it's storyboard target
name that be border
and then we will want what's left the
property so we need to set the
background in this time we said when I
set the background color so it's
storyboard dot carded property
background dot for what I think is and
then end the storyboard and the color
animation and then we can delete this
old one so now it won't fade out yeah
because you've only got the enter but
let's just check that works so just
remember the project we should see fade
to blue so you can see that was a nice
fade and now we've got into the opposite
we've got to reverse the the animation
everywhere so we can copy this event
trigger paste the whole thing change the
mouse leave change it to its orange by
default and that's it so when it leaves
it should go Orange and there you go
slice as simple as that now very nice
smooth color changing animation just
makes it a little bit nicer we haven't
done it to this one down here but I can
leave you guys to do that it's just
change the different button styles so
that's one way of being animation you
can create the storyboard directly in
zama you can create multiple animations
that target multiple different
properties and elements and you can have
them triggered on specific events so
there's there's one way of doing
something so that's the button runs the
next one is a bit more tricky so what we
want to do is run you want this page to
slide in and then slide out when it's
done but that's going to be a universal
thing we don't want it just on this page
and then when we've got 20 pages in the
application have to redo the animations
so what we want to start doing is making
a base page that all on the pages can
follow and in that base page were
actually add the ability for all pages
to be animated and in an out or up and
down or grow or shrink or whatever we
like but we're going to make a base
class for the page so that all the
function we add for this page
is going to be available in all pages so
start by making a new class on the pages
we'll call it base page and all that on
new stuff base page for all ages to gain
bit of a random comment by that although
it's kind of an havoc itself from page
and then what next we one will need a
page animation in order to create
multiple animations and then allow them
to select what animation the page wants
so it's making you follow the first in
the project let's call it animation
we'll add to their page animation that's
just going to be an enol of different
types styles of page animations straw in
and disappearing we will do I think
we'll do a slide in so we need the
animation for the slide in from the
right so it comes in from the right and
then when you go away you want it to
slide out to the left so we'll actually
call it that will just call it slide and
we'll do fade as well so looks a bit
cleaner will slide and fade in from
right and we will slide and slide and
fade out to left so once I get an in
style the others and out page slides in
and fade in
so pretty self explanatory variable of
our property page animation and again
we'll need to we'll need the page load
animation so what happened when it comes
in will be for that to slide in from
right and then one thing we've missed
we need the knob and the animation to
play when the page is first loaded image
to play when the page is unloaded and
then for the unload we'll do the
opposite by default will slide out to
the left but less in a region then we
have were want as these animations grow
will one time so you can value the times
so will it be in a base page and I think
the simplest way is just to have a
property that can be a protected
property now let's make it public
there's no real harm and the little
mummy likes a slide second so I don't
know how long the animation have you
select a slide animation it will take
and we'll need this information in order
to know when the pages say loading we
need to know how long that's going to
take so that if we wanted to await that
and then do something once it's in you
know fully animated in we need that
access to that amount of time so you'll
make that a property and we will default
it to say
one second to slide in let's say eight
point eight seconds okay husband we need
up to be afloat so that's what we'll do
and then you'll have these if you do say
aggro animation you'd then up grow
seconds as well and it's up to the user
to know and this light load animation
slides and they need to make sure if you
want to change the time you change the
slide seconds not like the grow seconds
time any slide animation takes to
complete I think that's it for the
properties because we're only doing this
one animation for now or what the
constructor and then in here we will
want to know when the page is loaded
chop this in another region and this is
the page is loaded from any required
animation we'll do that in a second
where else will we need I think that's
it for now look there well if there's
actually in order to start an animation
so if we have any animation we expect
that it's not going to be visible
whichever way by the you know initially
you need to start the animation so that
it moves the element to wherever it
needs to be be then we'll make it
visible so basically if we have if
desktop take those animations isn't
equal to knob then we'll make the
visibility collapse to start this are
basically totally invisible
so really but I do that explicitly
sometimes the intellisense is not
intelligent so as we are kind of making
n hi to begin with and you'll see why in
a minute
so we hide it we've got an animation
which by default we're going to do the
slide in we then listen out for loads so
then our load we want to animate in so
we'll just say animate in and unless
function animate in an in fact we'll
make it a why not just make it public
we'll do it fast as well so it can be
awaited so we know when it's complete we
can't do that so we might as well this
is not awaited because this is just an
event and we'll make it away table just
to get rid of the error basically then
the animator will check again if a shop
page load isn't equal to non or rather
than this case of a is equal to norm
just return because we're done there's
nothing to do so now we get here
we know there's an animation to do we
should do then a switch on the load
animation and then this is we can start
adding all the ones you want to handle
so in this case we're going to handle a
sliding from the right for now and we
will will make okay what we'll do what
mixer what we'll do directly in here
from out and then we'll make like a
storyboard helper that can have
animations like sliding and fading in it
and we can we use them throughout the
whole application map so to start with
let's just handle type the animation so
similar to the WPF you can do a
minimalist we want to create a new
storyboard and then in that storyboard
we need to slide from the right so to do
that we first need a new animation so
we'll do slide animation as new it is
there's a slide from the right we are
going to set the page itself a pages
margin on the left hand side to the
width of the window so basically this
will shift all the way over there and
then we need to set the right margin for
the negative of that so that doesn't
just crush in so we're going to
literally shift this page using the
margin so to do that we will need a
thickness animation so create a new
thickness animation and we want to do
and duration is this dot slide seconds
and it is a duration which needs a
timespan this is why we'll make a helper
function because otherwise this would be
very long-winded
timespan is informed so that was a
long-winded way of just saying the
seconds whereas in Tamil it was a lot
shorter but we'll make helper function
so well that'll be much easier so got
the duration we need to go from some
look at before and that is a new
thickness and the margin goes left top
right bottom so the left wants to be the
list stop we know with the top stuffing
the right is - let's start window width
and the bottom is nothing
that's the from if you want to go from
all the way out the screen to just a new
thickness of nothing - basically backed
away started
that's the from the - and then you've
got something as well called
acceleration ratio which is like a speed
of how it decelerate them it's like an
elastic effect I always find point nine
is quite a good slow down over and so
you've created the slide animation where
you'll basically move from me out to the
screen to the inner now we need to tell
it where the animation is used because
that's just the animation right now in
the zamel you'll see we did there's a
touch property storyboard target name
storyboard target property so there are
attached properties so in order to do an
attack property and code behind we need
to access the storyboard itself the
actual static plus and we do set target
name and set target property so we'll
set dog each property to slide animation
and it's a new property path and we want
us to be the margin and we don't need to
set the target name because the time you
name is ourselves this page so we don't
even need to set that and then we just
need to add the animation to the
storyboard you'll notice I've got
comments
this by the way because this is going to
move to a helper function in a minute so
storyboard dot children that are the
slide animation and that will now slide
in if we play that animation so let's
start with that so now we just do
storyboard begin and because we know
we're waiting this long tree to complete
we can then do an a wait tough start
delay let's stop slide seconds and it's
in milliseconds at times of thousands
and it's still done rather so with our
time span really what's the time span no
it's not okay maybe just doesn't realize
it's an integer very well so then we
await so that effectively if somebody
awaits that's how to make then you know
when it's finished we know one will
animate it in so now when if we overload
the space page and overload sorry if we
inherit from the space page when the
page then loads it's going to set itself
to collapsed so it's invisible and will
then get out as a points we need to make
sure we're not invisible once we stop so
we need to start the animation set it or
not begin as soon as this begins its
going to start from here so it's
instantly going to move it's going to
set the margin to that distance it's
hidden so as soon as it's begun we can
now unhide I keep trying to comment I'm
going to resist so just do this top
visibility equals and then make it
visible again and then we let the
animation finish so we basically hide to
begin with start the animation so that
the from is the part of whatever
animation were playing is all set up and
everything's moved into position then
make it visible after we've started and
then wait for it to finish so now that
should happen we should basically
replace the login page open with replace
replace the login page with
the base page so to do that you've got
Duke in two places what is a sam'l and
the code behind
so that's becomes base page and now this
also needs to become base page which is
in the local names face makes page and
that's it's just a designer tend tough
trouble that's fine the ones you've
cleared off and rebuilt a few times at
all beside so we will match should
basically animate in from the right oh
no no target was specified okay then we
needing a target so the tog was obvious
it was ourselves have a look so we're
gonna storyboard a slide animation and
we have oh sorry the beginning you have
to tell it what's it again on if you're
not setting the thing so the beginners
going to be on this on this page
that's all listen because you can create
a storyboard men assign it to different
things okay and that's a nice little
there slide in so in case you missed
that I'm just going to on the click tell
it to replay the animating function and
again just for the demonstration I'm
just going to do a normally them so you
know chose we're doing this in
production use view models for things
but just for quickness to show you I can
then just do this to animate in if I
made it probably quick I thought of it
yep okay just I think I shouldn't
Alison's been delayed that's perfectly
fine yep so if I click that again it
should start again
and there you go so that's like your
animate it but we've done this encode
behind them it's okay to do animations
and codes behind like we've done here
you know manually creating code all the
times I've been saying do not do code
behind if you remember I basically said
don't do it unless it's for animation it
arises for UI and only then if you can't
accomplish the same thing with you know
I example and in this instance because
the logic of animating the page in and
changing the properties and everything
else from the way that we're then going
to animate the page out wait for it to
finish then animate the page and it
starts becoming quite logic intensive
zamel is not that good at logic that's
why we have view models in the first
place so because this is pure UI
whatever doing UI stuff in the backend
we're animating perfectly fine to put it
in the back end so that's stuff we've
got the animation started so now let's
just actually we'll keep that click on
and there's time on the click we will
animate out so she's really annoying
that the intelligence hasn't kicked in
yet let's just try and clean and get
this realizing it's okay
and be honed there we go
never mind anyway we'll work out
intelligence for now so we've done the
animating let's actually move this now
to the helper class was talking about so
in animation create a new class we'll
call like storyboard helpers and we also
need to add the fade in as well as that
slide so we'll do that now when we do
this helper class so we do a public
clustered most graphic animation helped
us for storyboards what you'll become
apparent in the moment then we'll do a
full which static void we want to do the
add slide from right and we want to do
this storyboard so that we can just use
the helper function storyboard dot add
slide from rec yeah we'll need the
second slow track you it enough we'll
want the offset in terms of you know how
far for the right do you want to start
from will need the deceleration well we
don't need it so I'll make this optional
yeah we'll get it vandeman will be for
that to what we know and as the slide
and fade-in animation to the storyboard
timely animation will take the distance
to the right to start from and the rate
from assimilation and then we've already
done this code this is already in the
function here so I'll just cut all this
out we don't need the beginning so that
goes there we don't want to we need the
storyboard in fact let's make a helper
function for this as well so make a
function here for in fact now in to help
us with the animation to help us unless
is going to just be a short function
which will be I shall we call it slide
and fade in from right and reflected now
we'll do our helper class for this
because we don't want it all nodes it
all inside this flat in this base page
because it's going to get quite big with
animations so we'll go to page animation
tag or then do page animations which is
going to just be again a pure helper
class but somewhere we can just move out
the animations because it's going to get
quite large as you want to start adding
multiple animations so again it's just a
static class and
help us to animate pages in specific
ways and then the first one ones is
stuffy we'll be doing a fast again
what's wrong with intelligent visas
Bobby started gazing tasks slide and
fade in from right from their cage age
just going to work here earlier and then
we need just the number of seconds well
float and finally we'll paste the code
we had in here so this one's to the
whole thing like the slide in invade so
we need the storyboard creative we want
them to add we're going to storyboard
help we're doing that will add the slide
animation slide from right so which
really splitting this up into as modular
as we can be so we just create the
storyboard we don't leave storyboard and
we should have a helper add slide from
right the number of seconds we've passed
in the offset is going to be the pages
window width the deceleration ratio will
leave as default so we pass that
information through so through the
storyboard and hopefully or as you can
see I'm doing here is separating the
code we had and splitting it up into
nice small sections and the storyboard
helpers can work on just storyboards to
add slide effects to any storyboard so
we can use that anywhere in the
application then the page animations can
be used on any page even if it's not a
base page them so you can stand and make
a regular page for any reason and that
just then creates the storyboard cause
the storyboard helper to add specific
animations and then we will use that in
the base page so we're just really
keeping it all separated me there making
it modular so that we just be usable as
possible so as slide from animation
paste spm we've got the storyboard so we
create the animation
this animation the duration we need
times buns there and to the left slide
second it's just seconds it's not this
that window it now it's the offset with
past N and a - offer to their
deceleration is oops acceleration ratio
so now create the margin and we make
from right set the target property name
are left to the story mode let's just
change to the storyboard and that's it
that's all we need to do for that little
animation so then we add it to that
we've got the storyboard we've now added
it to the story mode itself and then
because we're doing this we actually
want to do that begin things so we just
want to do storyboard up begin and we
want to do it on the page and when we
want to make the page there's a box
again we'll remove that and see if it's
smart enough to find it
there we go so start animating make page
visible wait for it to finish
so we just do awake tasks delay seconds
times of thousands and cast it to an
integer and that's that so it's exactly
the same as what we've already done
we've just moved it all around so now
we've got a page helper called slide and
fade in from right we still on down the
page yet but we've moved everything out
now so now the base page can become
that's done unloaded animate in we
turned up we've got nothing otherwise
that goes nuts gone nuts on so basically
now all that comes down to if we want to
slide and fade in from right into their
stock slide fade from right and those
are going to provide is four seconds
which is provided in the property and
everything else and passes down and we
await that so it looks really nice and
clean that in your base page you're not
all doing the animations of the base
page so start the animation so we then
just step into that with f12 you see
that goes to the page animations class
using the page which is specified
creates a storyboard adds the slide from
right to the from the storyboard help us
and then begins it makes the page
visible and wait so everything we had
before is now just in different classes
so let's check that still works that
still works which is good let's now get
a fade in so to do the fade in let's go
into the page helper we got add slicing
right so we probably want to do now add
fade in animation and then we'll call
this add fade in and alternate for that
seconds then we'll go to the storyboard
helpers copy and paste this adds a
fade-in animation up there on
description as the slide from right
animation
that's the faded animation so the bit
animator time rotate to animate we don't
have offsets we have the deceleration
leg oh we just got seconds let's you
know called
add fade in now the animation is now
going to be a double just a single value
double animation double animations we'll
just have generation and then they'll
have to and from stuff it's just that
they'll be when you're fading in you're
going from 0 to 1 so that's the opacity
from completely invisible to fully
visible and then that's going to be the
opacity property then we add it so
that's it that's those about to do so
now we've added slide in we also add a
fade and so we play this we must have to
slow it down to see so let's actually do
that to start with let's go to the base
page change this to 5 seconds so you see
happening nice and slowly you can see
that it slides in and fade them so if we
change that back to normal and you can
tweak whatever settings you like about
this to make it you know how you want it
to appear there's a nice little you know
a simple animation and then we got a
little hop it just starts making it feel
a lot nicer so that is the slide in
impatient right we might as well go to
the storyboard helpers and do the
reverses of these so we'll copy and
paste the fade in and we'll call it one
fade out fade out animation I fade out
sober to animate blah blah blah or this
time just reverse these so from fully
visible to invisible that's that done
same with this very similar copy and
paste ok mess up on the comments visual
studio thank you
slide to left animation absent stays the
same they're easier to just rename as
you know we're going from zero to and
less time we want it the opposite one
the negative and the positive inverting
so then offsets the left margin all the
way out to the screen and the right push
it all the way over so it slides out and
that's our house as simple as other
that's now the two new animations that
storyboard helpers done on the click or
mail want to animate out which I love it
was made yet but that's what's going to
be called age animation next stepping up
the structure commenting this side the
page in from the right H to animate
animation take copy and paste that slide
the page out to the left slide them fade
out to left storyboard add slide the
left add fade out again everything else
is the same
that's it for that and then the base
page we now want a probably async task
and a make out animates the page out
keep your comments the same again
similar logic copy and paste
there's nothing to do return otherwise
find it and this time we want to handle
these slide out to left which by default
we set here flied out to left on the
unload and then we just change the
helper to slide and face out to left and
that's it so now the animates out we
should animate this out the button click
should call up so we just run mess it
should slide it and then when we click
the bottom it should slide out or not
so let's debug that step in okay load
animation so it's a danger of copy and
pasting make sure you have to pay a bit
more attention I've got a cold so that's
my excuse today copy and paste slide
down click yeah we know we've hit mark
and I'm going to miss the slide out
because the breakpoints do it again
slide then click slide out that's quite
cool and then you'll notice if we make
the screen bigger so one thing you've
got to bear in mind as well as a point
of start of the animation so when we do
it how to make out to an animate end so
the animate ends a better example and we
call the helper to slide in and we add
this slide from right at this point in
time we're then going to query the query
ok yeah when was we're going to be
clearly in the page with the window
width at this point so when you start
the animation if you started a really
slow animation which one fact I'll just
show you it's easier so make a really
really slow animated so let's make it at
last under 20 seconds I'm going to run
this and then I'm instantly going to
maximize the window because what's going
to happen is when the window is loaded
we then start animating from the right
but we automate from the size of the
window so if the window is so this size
so here this white window
we are going to start and effectively
our page is just here on the edge it's
almost like the solution Explorer and it
some drugs and because we offset it by
the window width at that point in time
so we open the window start animating in
the pages here then we double-click a
maximize the window you're going to see
that it's already you know if the
windows bigger your feet animating it so
you'll see what I mean so you just got a
bad out of mind words the way we're
doing this animation so it starts
maximized and you can see it's already
here it was already at the edge of the
window because we told it where to start
animating from so that's one things
about in mind but typically animations
are very short and they're just more of
a visual appeal so it doesn't matter
about it being absolutely perfect in
terms of somebody opened over them
instantly expanded the might see that
it's already started to move in you know
it's just really isn't an issue but just
bear that in mind that when we start the
animation at this point we are reading
the window width and the window can be
resized at any point in time
so if you do future animations if you're
using things like window widths and it's
a you know a specific animation or
repeating animation you might want to
handle the window resize to keep track
of you know the true size of the window
so that's the animations done that's
kind of the points this video I wanted
to keep it short like say I've got a
cold and I want to talk too much I'll
lose me voice again we've got the slide
in we've got the slide out we're doing
that just on the slide is fine that can
happen on load but a slide out we want
to change from just being a button click
to beam in the actual window the windows
style the actual window in window so we
want it to happen on all pages and
whenever we are changing this frame
which is where the pages the current
page gets bound so what we're going to
have to do in the next video is when the
current page changes in the view model
will have a value converter for that
application page and here where we then
just go wrap be telling you page that's
going to change the frames content here
to the new frame we don't actually want
that we want the first
animate out the current page
then we want to return so this is going
to become an asynchronous converter that
when it gets called we get the old value
from somewhere somehow and then we'll
animate out the old page and then when
it's finished after a week and will then
return the new page which then will fire
the unload which will slide in so then
this animation will happen naturally the
previous page will you know animate out
the other one or animate end we could do
it another way and actually have this
returning instantly but the old page
being on a separate frame that so we've
got two frames and I've won on a mating
out and the other one are mating in and
the other self removes we'll figure that
out in the next video but we'll get it
so that it's more Universal through the
application there's no manual changing
of you know page animations we shouldn't
have to fire them off in the background
yes that's on the May 10 will but then
the animate out we want to get called
from the view model when the content
changes so this will become you know
fired violent view models so hopefully
that give you a good example of
animations we'll be using a lot more
throughout the application so I'm not
really going to do another specific
animation video unless it's requested
because we're going to go and you know
we're going to start adding animations
everywhere as we go so you'll get to to
use them get a feel for them anyway but
hopefully this is giving you a little
understanding of a few ways of being
able to do it so we've done it in a
style in one way and on the storyboard
inside of an event trigger and then
we've created some in the background
code and just manually set them up the
same way and you know dummy attach
property this way so let me know what
you think any comments obviously leave
them answer them anything confusing
again just comment it off I'll reply
