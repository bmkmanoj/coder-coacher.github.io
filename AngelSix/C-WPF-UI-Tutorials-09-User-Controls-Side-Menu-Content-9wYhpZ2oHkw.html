the view model and code-behind stuff so
non-ui
a lot of you have started really wanting
to do some more UI so instead of
carrying on with the view model stuff
and doing the navigation and everything
else I thought we'd just jump back onto
some you know some nice UI so a model
desktop in Photoshop it's also when they
get repository if you want to take a
look at the Photoshop file and this is
our visualizer kind of chat screen so
once you've logged in the login slides
away will have this menu slide out and
probably this slide in or fade in in
some way that'll be the chest these are
going to be buttons this would be the
main chat list of people you're talking
to and then this is where the chester's
will be a selected shaft in blue and
it'll show here the red will indicate
like a new message and this will be the
profile pictures and by default if you
don't have a profile picture which most
people won't by the start will sort of
also generate these random colors with
the names of the initials I've thought
this through because actually I've
already made this application before for
Fassett oh the older version so I'm used
to making chat applications so we've got
things like when somebody's typing out
Lapeer here have there's multiple people
typing in a good message settled fade
between whose type in every say half a
second as you hover or click or whatever
we decide we can show things like times
and when it was red and then by default
they'd just be invisible like this now
you can search message layer search this
specific message and the more actions
here like I don't know delete things or
add more users to the group to start a
new just you would click here go to
effectively your contacts list or
basically anyone you have a message
before any of your new to this and you
share say your Outlook calendar then the
people would appear there otherwise you
can manually add them by phone number or
email and just start a conversation and
then I thought we'd have this feature of
if you click here you'd have say all the
attachments you'd ever sent in any
messages and then that's searchable as
well and we feel like a nice
list here of pictures so if you know you
just sent somebody an image you can
collect this and in date order you can
take a look through all the pictures and
then we'd have a second icon to go to
your settings page and I think that's
enough to get us go it will start
building this often and then we'll think
about it you know more as we go but I
thought at least this is nice to get
back to some nice-looking modern UI so
we're going to start this video see how
far we get
I'm guessing wall will start on the side
menu probably get all this done I'd say
then the next video we'll do this list
and then the third video we'll do say
these chat bubbles but we'll see how far
we go so this is what we're trying to
make so we just make sure the current
app still runs and you can see what it
is and then we've got the sign-in so
we're going to first just remove the
signing for now and we'll need a new
page this page this is the page and then
this is going to be a side menu that's
throughout their application so this is
going to be in the window that comes
over the top and this is the page form
we'll call this one chat page so we just
copy and paste the login page
so leak chat page so open it up going to
leave the login view model for now trick
we're just using this as a blank page
call the chat model there give the title
of the shot again just delete all this
lock save that press f7 to go to the
code-behind change here to the chat page
that chat page that page don't need that
don't need that
and there's our blank chat page and if
we go to the remember we set the current
page inside the view model of window
view model so we have someone here
current page here as login that's the
only one we've got right now so just
press f12 on application page
as chefs the main shaft age will change
the default page to check and then in
the value converter for the application
page is where we then spin up new
instances so here we'll just add a new
one where it's a chat page and press f5
and that should now open the application
we effectively have just a blank page
there we go so this is the chat page
loudly but there's nothing in it
so we've wiped that out and then we can
always up the chat page afterwards
that's tough so now we want to go to the
main window so we'll go to main with
everyone in the main window
and then before I go much further before
I forget let's make sure this text with
large there we go
there we go so we're going to add this
side menu here so we want to we scroll
down to main content here right now
we've got the blue background and we got
a frame which is a page which takes up
everything and we're already in a grid
so that's fine what we're going to do is
it will have a grid of about say
two-fifths for the menu and the rest for
the page so just do grid column
definitions go on definition width is
two star which just means to Unix
copy and paste flat and have a five
units well two sevenths in this case
then we'll do and then we'll move the
frame the content to the second column
on this case one which is over here and
then in the first column we will now
want to put the first column the way
we're down here this is where we'll
start making the side menu will turn
into a user control after but let's just
start working directly in here for now
so first one the background so
we'll give it a static resource of not
stuff it well now we just want it work
in the reason for static resource here
unless we have a color and we actually
have a color of white already styles
colors oh yeah so foreground light make
sure we carry on using our stylesheet
Oh for where I might brush and then just
press that 12 F plus f5 let's check that
that's a decent size that looks alright
and then you can resize and we'll
probably add some well we definitely
will when you get down to this side 0 on
this squash that much but we'll do that
in future videos we'll we'll do like a
drop shadow and animate in just mainly
want to get the UI built and humble will
do all the little tweaks but that looks
like a generally good size in fact what
we could do are then what's better than
that let's get rid of this and let's
just put a fixed fixed size and say
something like 300 let's take a look
what that looks like
that's better and then again we could
adjust adjust that size when you get
down to minimum really you want the
minimum size to be this anyway so let's
eyes we just tweak the minimum page size
to be about here which I just do a
screenshot it's about 1,300 is not yes
it's about 1,300 pixels across and this
one is set to 300 right now and it's 500
so it's about just on the two times as
big so I thought let's make about 800
should be a rough guess so scroll to the
top of the window actually we're bound
to minimum width to the view model so we
go to the window view model
minimum width is 400 let's double up for
now 800 run it again and make sure it's
a decent minimum so that's like the
minimum size you could get their
application which i think is realistic
probably again minimum high it's a
little bit more so let's just tweak that
to 500 so I think the minimum 800 by 5
and is fine this is now a fixed size for
now so that will do us we've got the
background plus common trick and this
wants to be the main background and we
need it content so we've got here's the
side menu so we would need a stack panel
so this can be one thing going across
after but then the content below
actually no we don't want to stack
pattern we want to grid because we want
this to be the first thing and then this
content of you all wants to fill the
rest of the the height so we actually
want a grid we need row definitions in
this case the first one will be also
take whatever height we decided in there
the second one wants to be the remaining
height and then the first thing in the
grid is this menu here so that will then
be this would be a grit because we've
got a lot of grid as the main overall
because this needs to be on the right
these need to be on the left so we'd
have a grid on the outside we'd then do
these three buttons inside a stack panel
so they're just as long you know is why
does it need to be and then they stuck
against each other and then this can be
in a column that's pushed over to the
right so we want
top menu on the grid to start with we
want background of the blue-collar we've
got the wood glue and then we want the
column definitions and the first column
wants to be also we want to just put
this all the buttons in a line and fill
up whatever basically needs the next
column is going to be this space in
between that can just expand all the way
out so it's going to be a width of auto
and now with the borders a width of a
Asterix and then the final one of the
right-hand side now is going to be yours
over there settings cog serves the three
columns now we want the these main three
buttons in so they want to be a
stackpanel
inside the first column so start panel
oriented horizontally main buttons we
need a height as well because right now
it's nothing so let's make the top menu
right about 50 now you can see the
background so the main buttons now okay
I still a button content just close
letter X for now or three buttons so you
see these are default style buttons so
we want to make a new style for the
button so let's go to button styles
we'll use the regular bottom of the main
one
just use the regular button just copy
that entire style taste a new style down
the bottom I'll call this one icon
button this is going to be an icon
within the button give it a name of icon
button copy that style these buttons so
first thing we want to do background
wants to be the blue so I want it to be
a by default this the same color so if
you do the blue foreground is fine being
the Y large font we want to now be font
awesome so we're going to use the font
or some icons here so we're changing the
font to the bottom to be the font
awesome cutting then I what wheel with
padding say about 30 still arms any
margin don't need that don't need the
placeholder episode a loading spinner
that can go we don't need the visibility
now on there corner radius we don't need
any just with the focusable forces fine
font family as that looks like basically
just the control now the animation when
you hover we want it to be this lighter
blue that we don't have yet so we go to
colors we're blue we need a light blue
and that color which I've got the
Photoshop file is full 5 e 6 e 5 and
then we'll also need this darker color
here so not as I'll just add that now so
that's going to be dark blue and that
color is OC 6 9 9 1 so we've now got the
dark and the light blues so on a hover
we want this to be light blue and when
you remove your on to go back to the
blue itself we can keep the disabled
color that's fine so that it should be
the button styled and you just need to
compiling to show and then we now need
are the looks of it we can see the
buttons we want these buttons to be
square as well so what we'll do is
because we're making the top menu height
the buttons got a set height will simply
bind the width to be the same as the
hike so property width value is binding
actual high relative source is relative
source of self see bind to yourself and
I think that will make it square there
we go so it's hard to see here but
there's the three squares in fact we can
run this and you should see on hovering
obviously fades to the light blue so
there's three buttons
and now we just need to add the font or
some icons so to add the icons we did
this somewhere already in the
application I think was it crash XPath
yeah honey we did it somewhere oh yeah
for the login button spinner we added
the font or some text and that's what
we're going to do with these buttons so
instead of having this nasty looking
string here in the buttons which we
could paste into the button so instead
of doing content rather we're going to
define we'll put in the fonts class you
know define some strings down here so
system string give it a key of a what
shall we call this want it to be font or
some shaft icon say and a value of less
and then let's just use that that's not
the chat icon but let's just make sure
this is belittling font awesome chat
icon it's got some kind of issue here
because it's not it's not explain how
did I change the font then like a change
of style in there oh yeah
I don't want awesome the padding is too
much
so in fact the padding should be fine
but I think what we want to do is we
want to put this on do me yeah because
if we change the padding to say 10 and
then we resize the buttons which you
could do see the text disappears because
you can't fit in we never want that to
happen so instead of just putting the
text box there let's just wrap this in a
view box so that it will always scale to
text inside and steadily beam font size
of a specific size like this size and I
won't matter because it's inside a new
box so doesn't know what you put now if
we reduce the size it's just scaling and
it's also keeping the proportions
so let's now change that back to a
bigger one
let's try 2030
yeah howling I like that so you can now
see the icon is showing here in the font
and what we've done is made a static
string here for it so we will just then
we want use a picture and card say for
now so use a picture we will bind
them to these
use a picture and then we need the cog
one as well which will be out here and
it will be in the druid column to shift
over to the right and then it will be
the COG so now all we need to do we just
press f5 we're going to make sure we're
happy with that size and layout so
that's looking quite nice
we now want to get these texts done the
button style you want to get these
values so the quickest way to get those
values you just spin up a browser go to
fun awesome dark IO forward slash cheat
sheet and this will bring up all of the
icons with the valuing in here the text
value so we want one for the chat first
and I believe that comments is called
they are so it's this one here
so eighty six and that's the icon so
paste that into there right we just need
to change the number there then we've
got user here which i think is restored
user yeah user must go seven so now
we've got the picture which i think is
called photo or picture yeah so that's
one c5 and then the COG is hardly call
it gear
yeah it's thirteen so I've become
thirteen now we look back whereas all
the icons
there's another three buttons for the
main part and this icon now the card we
just wanted to be was that down I wanted
to be this darker core and we could do
that with the same attached property and
calling it a you know it does highlight
you do a dark button but it's just as
simple to simply set their color here
foreground static to be blue we made and
there we are so that's the quickest and
simplest way of doing that just a small
appearance tweak and that's the menu so
that's now got everything we need and
we've got this area here now to fill
with something we need to do the drop
shadow but I'll just leave that for now
M thought through I will wait until we
get the chat screen in before I see if
we want this drop shadow I don't really
like drop shadows this is nice and clean
and we've got no real drop shadows
anywhere so I don't really want to add
the drop shadow at everything but when I
was doing the Photoshop file it didn't
quite look right this right message just
going straight into this thing here so
we might just do a single line I'm not
sure yet but we'll wait till this screen
then before we do that so now we've got
all the let's just compare so there's
the image and there's our actual window
which I think's pretty close so it could
make the icons slightly bigger or you
know this slightly in but again the
Photoshop file I just mock up for a
general idea so you might want to make
these bigger just reduce the padding to
make those icons bigger but I'm I'm
quite happy with that as a style so we
want to now move this into a user
control because right now we've just
made it directly inside the window so
this is the entire side menu here so
let's just go to a solution make a
folder called controls
ah 31 matter
and then add a new item and plop right
here side user and he should filter use
a control WPF we'll call this a side
menu control then one thing I want to do
is put in a controls namespace by
default get rid of that change the local
to not be that as well press f7 remove
it there as well
so what it does by default when you
create a new control or new anything if
you add it to a folder by default Visual
Studio changes your default namespace
and append the folder name as well and I
don't write that there's no no need to
pick your govern all your name spaces
for such a small thing so I've got the
side menu control it's a user control
that's all fine and then in here also we
need to do now is go to the window cut
all this border taste it in here gaming
mouses company there we go
paste the end zoom out a bit you can see
there's the user controller simple as
that and then if we want to use this
user control side menu control go back
to here now do local Cole on side menu
control that's all the ways to a user
control so we've got that five you
should still see this does exactly the
same thing just now we've moved all that
UI into a single control and now the
next thing we want to do is once you do
a side menu control like this you want
really the content inside it to become
this content here so if we just did say
a button test again I see it's just
completely overridden everything about
our user control so turned into a button
so to fix that instead of just defining
a user control and putting content here
because this is currently the content of
the user control this becomes the
content so when we've set the content
explicitly it's over in our content so
what you want to do instead is you want
to wrap this in a user control can blake
and that wants to be a control template
of a tie user control and then we want
to cut this into here and now the
template for the user control is this we
go back now you'll notice that we've got
our control back but we now don't have
the content so in order to get that
content that we specify the side all we
have to do is modify our what is now the
template and after we've done the top
menu grid we don't want to cook in a
content presenter which basically then
injects the the content that the user
selects into this location which is
basically this area here because it's a
in fact it needs to be the second row so
let's rip that row is one if we go back
you can now see it's put the button in
the second the second area there so
press f5 we're now going to use a
control where we can set content that
then becomes the content of this grid
here so now we can inject our well we're
going to get we can make our lesson out
of this chat list here so that will be
in the next video we'll go ahead and
make this scrollable Chaston again I
think these will become user controls
each individual part there and then
we'll just put it in a list that each
one is in a list and then we'll do some
few models today to bind some dummy data
into here so we can get this a list
actually spinning often
having some fake data that we would get
from the server eventually and then
we'll move on to the screen so hopefully
this has been a bit more enjoyable than
the last few videos we're back to doing
some nice UI you've seen how to do a
user controller again there's nothing to
it yet basically right click add new
user control and then it's just like a
page you just get you know your normal
zamel put whatever zamel you want in and
then if you want to use a control that
can have sub content then you just wrap
your content in a user control template
or the control template of the tides
that matches you know your applicate
your control type in this case user
control and then everything inside here
stays exactly the same and you just put
this content presenter anywhere inside
your design where you want the users
content to get injected so we wanted
this content to be say here instead in
there and in between the two columns
it gives dump it here and change the
column to one which would be here and
then if we went back to the window and
we put a button in there you'll see then
it gets injected there so again it's
nice and simple it's nothing complicated
about a user control move that back to
where we want it simply was here and the
row is 1 so that's stuff any questions
let me know next video will be on the
the chat list hope you enjoyed it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
