videos how I get this dark theme in
Windows and I've given this out a few
times but I thought I'd make an actual
video on exactly how to do it and also
put all the tools in one place so you
can download them and just follow
through so I'll put a link in the video
but this is my github YouTube repository
so it will be here when you'll find all
this all the stuff I've done in the
YouTube one so there'll be a link in
this description to get there you go
into the windows dark theme and then
I've also got you'll notice a few
settings here so SQL management studio
if you use that there's a simple guide
here to follow to unlock the dark theme
which might now be in the latest update
anyway so I won't go through that that's
simple enough and it's specific to SQL
so you can do that
got one for office 365 which is simple
enough in case people didn't know that
you simply go to your username account
settings then you can actually change
the theme to dark in the office
applications and then we've got Windows
and Firefox so we'll cover windows first
and that's to get this whole dark theme
here and I've also made a readme so you
can follow this but I'll we'll go
through this at the same time so you can
see how it works
so basically the first step for pretty
much all custom themes on Windows is to
install UX theme patcher so in the tools
folder you'll find ux the impacter so
you simply install this you click Next
accept next agree then you get to this
page and this is where it'll ask you to
it'll say here status unpatched if you
haven't got it packed already you can
see I have and you simply click install
but because mine's patched I don't need
to also notice here your system version
so make sure because all the themes are
put in here are specific to version 1703
which is basically the latest Windows 10
theme and the well latest windows 10
which these themes will work on so make
sure your windows is up to date because
if you don't and you install say these
themes on an older version of Windows
this will stop you being able to log
into this
system and we'll go about how you
recover from that you know if you
accidentally do that at the end of the
video I'll explain how to come out of it
but basically make sure you're on 17:03
or if you're watching this video in the
future and it's gone off then make sure
you on 1703 or later and also tend to
make sure your themes have been tested
on that version of Windows so everything
right now is up-to-date in Windows so as
of today we're on 1703 so you'd install
this first and click install here not a
patch and then restart your computer
once you've done that you'd go to old
new Explorer and basically double click
this Exe I'll put a readme in here as
well explaining what let's actually come
with the you know the software but I've
left that one in but basically I'll put
a screenshot here of settings and this
shows the settings of how you wanted to
be selected and I've checked the show
status bar here which some people don't
check but that allows you to see this
status bar here at the bottom where it
says five items and the size so if you
want that showing check it otherwise
don't
so basically double click this exe and
then you can see this opens up so check
whatever you like leave everything else
default there just follow the screenshot
and then click the install now it's
already installed on mine but when you
click install it'll pop up with your
warning to say you know confirm admin
privileges you've got yes once it's done
that it will pop up another one but in
the background you won't notice so down
here on your status bar you'll notice a
flashing you know this shield symbol so
once you click install and yes then
another one will pop up down you just
got to click e to bring it into the
foreground and click yes and that'll get
this installed and what this does is
basically we move you know the ribbon
that's usually here that's got like year
context menu and things you can still
press the Alt key to get you all
old-style menu but windows by default
had the you know the big ribbon and you
cannot style that so we basically we
move it and change Explorer back to the
old style and that's what this does so
with that installed
you could leave it there but one thing
you might notice is in control panel so
if we go to control panel this bar here
and also when you go into places this
bar here the background would be white
on all themes because it's independent
of a theme so if you go to control panel
dock you've got three versions so - one
does this - CC it's like to see to see
which if you open up is just the color
there this is the - 8 and that's all
black so basically just double click on
one of these say you want this version
number one and it'll say it's gonna set
it to - C - C - C I need to click yes
and we start your computer again so
because I've already got that installed
I don't need to and then once you're
done you can double click control panel
default and it would restore it to what
it originally was if you weren't using a
theme and again I've provided a little
and you know mean me there so it's as
simple as just double-clicking on 1 2 or
3 depending on which color you want it
to be and that installs control panel
dock now that's the control panel dock
the open their old new Explorer and the
ultra theme tend to be the same thing
that's required for almost every dog
theme on Windows that's why I've put
them simply in our tools folder because
the almost universal to every theme and
they won't hurt another theme you know
just doesn't really change anything
because this can't be changed by a theme
this simply removes the the ball that
can't be styled and this is needed for
any custom theme so always install them
3 and then we move on to installing
actual themes there's one other thing I
will mention here which I have which
some of you might ask and you'll notice
in this PC I don't have all of these
folders repeated so by default what
really annoys me is in this window you'd
have you know desktop downloads
documents pictures all here in quick
access and then in this PC below you
double again so then to get to like your
C Drive or D Drive you have to scroll
down so I made this little 64 bit remove
entry so this removes you know all of
them from showing in this PC and if you
right-click an edit on the regedit file
you'll see it as basically just a
tutorial
from here on how to do this and this
removes these entries and you can change
this back to show you know you want to
them to reappear but if you want to get
rid of you know those entries they're
just basically double click on this reg
edit file accept and then say yes you
want to you know install them it'll say
successful and then again you might have
to restart the PC but I think you can
just close down Explorer and reopen and
the final one is this I've noticed a few
themes that I haven't applied myself yet
I'm waiting to see if it's it's needed
but I noticed one of the themes give me
this option no and it says to make apps
use the dark theme when you look at what
it does it basically sets this theme the
registry entry in the the themes
personalized option so it's obviously a
standard Windows thing a huge light
theme it's set to false now I've got a
feeling all that is is when you go to
personalize and you go to things colors
you have this option here choose your
default app mode light and dark so I'm
pretty sure that registry setting has
already set I am mother checking book
you might want to install that you might
not it won't harm anything if you do so
that's all the tools installed and that
you only have to do that once so now for
all themes that you want to install it's
a simple ass taking a theme so I've
downloaded two that are free and this
one at the minute is this penumbra I've
got applied and we're going to install
this arc one so for all themes that you
download you'll basically get a folder
you'll usually get a lot of crap in it
so you usually get this you X theme
you'll get a few text files you'll get
some shortcuts the internet you'll get
this you'll potentially get that you can
kind of ignore all that in the themes
now and all you're looking for is the
folder that finally gives you a dot
theme file or multiple and then a
subfolder with you know the actual theme
content in so in all themes the folder
might look messy but just dig down and
find just the theme so in this repo I've
already cleaned them up for you and
these two themes are nice and clean you
simply open the folder and this is now
what you want to copy to add the theme
so this is what I'm talking about here
copy all files and folders contained in
the
themes file basically copy old files and
folder that are in the you know a fault
that starts having the dark themes in
which basically means all of these and
they want to go into see windows
resources themes so we open a new
browser know a new Explorer C Drive
windows resources themes you'll notice
you should just have the arrow and
potentially these one and two I can't
remember whether I made these or whether
they come with Windows and then this is
where you simply paste all your new
themes so right now if I go to
personalize and themes I've got the
windows the penumbra and I'm guessing
this is maybe the one and two and then
if we just select all this arc copy and
paste into here and then continue now we
go to personalize we should see in the
themes we've now got all the arc themes
so if I put that there and say this here
and then we move this over and we change
to arc you'll see now we've got this you
know nice blue star a dark theme what
blue with a bit of colors so the arts
fine I should go between different ones
they give you multiple different options
so you can flick through and then you
know pick which one you like once you've
got one you're happy with that seems to
be the arc dark flattop ulis I think I
think all the rest or a bit oh boy
you've kind of removes the gap between
them or you go back to this penumbra
which I'm going to stick with this
penumbra for now but that's how you
install the themes that's all there is
to it and then if you want more themes
so I'm going to maybe I definitely want
to flap the void dark flat dark and now
not the first one
I'm guessing it's that one I want so I'm
gonna clean up all those because I won't
use them and if I go to personalize
there we go so at least now I've got one
option to flip between the one I liked
which is the default one and this
penumbra so I mean you're back to the
penumbra so that's the themes also make
sure you do go into colors and change
this to dark otherwise if you've got it
light then you have this horrible nasty
bright why didn't stand it up so do the
dark as well as that and then for more
themes you pretty much get them all from
these two locations so if you just go
and I'll put these links in the video
and they're also in the repository but
if you just go to these two places the
Clio desktop is where you get paid
themes usually they're like three
dollars for a theme but they've got some
nice ones and then here's the Debian
tart usually where you get moved to the
free ones so it literally browse them
and they have a readme file and all the
installs are very similar but this
should hopefully cover how you install
almost all the themes so just remember
there's one other things as well that
I'll just put into this folder so in the
tools here
there's creating new one and this is why
after sleep fix and there's also a bug
in most themes what I'm pretty sure it's
all of them say you open like notepad
and you'll see the background here is
the same as the theme well when your
computer goes to sleep and wakes up or
from hibernation and wakes up this then
goes back to white and sometimes border
there's a few settings that don't
restore correctly so I forgot to also
paste this on it so this is again just a
registry that you can look at to see
what it does yeah pretty simple stuff so
you can double click this to install and
then if you want to remove it afterwards
you simply double click this and it
resets all these and all it's doing is
basically we're moving all of these
values so that the theme you know the
themes values apply otherwise these
values out get over in these are the
default values that will be over in so
also install this one and then you'll
basically have no issues from there I
use these themes all the time and
there's no real issue with you know any
theme they were
perfectly while everything's always dark
there's no glitches anywhere the only
thing is as I mentioned at the start of
the video make sure you are on the
correct Windows version for the theme
that's really important so if you press
the Windows key in X and then go to
system you can see the version here
which is you know one 706 so you want to
make sure you're on one 701 703 or was
it 1 706 yeah 1 703 so when you get your
themes wherever you download them from
they'll say what version the fall so
make sure the for that version and these
two are if you do happen to install a
theme and you're on the wrong version of
Windows or even if you think you are and
maybe the themes are bad one the symptom
you'll get is when you restart your
computer you'll go to the login screen
but when you click login it fades in
fades out and you straight back to the
login screen and that's because the
theme you know won't correctly load on
that version of Windows if you do get
that issue it's as simple as going to on
the login screen you have a power button
down here that looks like this power
button and you simply click the power
button hold the shift key and click
restart and then you'll get a bunch of
options and one of them is enter Safe
Mode you know restart in Safe Mode do
that login and then you might be able to
go to personalize and safe mode and
change the theme but I'm pretty sure by
default it will then just simply reapply
the default windows theme and then
that's it you just restart the computer
again and it's it's removed effectively
your selected theme so you're safe to
log back in so some people say that the
themes you know you got to be super
careful cuz they can break your machine
and all this lots and I've never had a
situation where I couldn't simply go
into safe mode and you know back out and
then we start the computer once more but
do make sure you're on the correct
version of Windows before doing that and
that that's all of us to install in the
windows
dark themes the one other thing I'll go
through is the Firefox and I'll go
through really quick but basically I now
use Firefox well I've always used
Firefox for the most part but when I
open up you'll see it's all dark other
than a slight flicker sometimes when you
go to the new panel flickers
but now after that every new tab there's
no more white it's all dark you know and
go to anywhere and this is all dark you
know back and test and you know just
it's easier on the eyes so again some
people have asked how I do this so I've
made this readme file well that's how to
file and basically it states do go to
about add-ons in appearance first and
change your theme to compact doc so
that's as simple as opening a new tab
and Firefox typing about : add-ons
going to appearance and then enabling
this compact dark which is built into
you know the latest Firefox is after
that you want to enable this add-on so
if you go to here and add this add-on
dog background like text and that gives
you this option up here this AAA if you
click this and I did disable it you'll
see this is the standard websites go to
Google it's all bright you enable this
and all the websites go dark for you so
that's you know the next step the last
step is when you first start up that
Firefox will flicker white or sometimes
this off like a white and to help that
you want to go to options and colors and
Firefox there you go here options and
then call us down here and then you will
select background and you can see I've
changed mine to black and the text to
white and this stays is never and then
click OK and when that flips around the
default colors of the background and
that helps with again the flickering and
the final step is in order to get this
new tab to open up blank like this with
just a dog background I install this
add-on which is just customized about
new tab so you install that add-on and
then you go to about add-ons and then
you go to extensions and you'll have
this customized about new tab click
options uncheck everything so none of
these are checked change the background
color to a dark color
and click okay and that's it that's all
I've done to get Firefox you know this
dark so hopefully that's helped
everybody realize how to get a you know
a nice dark Windows theme where you know
all your windows your control panel
notepad everything stays nice and dark
and easy on the eyes
any questions any issues just post a
comment and I'll help out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
