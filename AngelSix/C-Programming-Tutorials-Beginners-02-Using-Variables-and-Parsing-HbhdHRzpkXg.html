installing Visual Studio quick look at
some variables the basic structure of a
console application in this tutorial
we're going to go through a bit more on
comments and ending lines and statements
accessibility levels different ways to
declare variables reading text from the
user parsing that information which
means converting it from one type to
another some calculations based on the
input and then finally we're going to
output a message back to the user that
contains a calculated response so for
comments as you've already seen two
forward slashes as a basic line comment
we also have a multi-line comment which
you can do with a star forward slash
star tank that multi-line comment and
you end it with a star forward slash
with no space these stars are
automatically added by visual studio
every time you go to a new line but they
aren't needed basically once it finds
this symbol everything in between those
two points will be a comment until you
reach the star forward slash so that's
how you do a multi-line comment end in
lines and statements so in the last
tutorial we were creating some variables
we're doing things like by to my byte
equals 12
now when you know programming that's
natural and comes to you straight away
but to somebody that's not programmed
before you might be wondering what's the
equal sign for what's the semicolon for
the basic structure of creating
statements so the left-hand side of the
operand or the operator so this is your
operator this is the thing that defines
two sides so your equals
whether it's equals or whether you
double equals or whether your plus with
your minus the operand is the symbol so
to the left side of the symbol you have
the thing that you want to create or the
thing that you want to assign
information to so in this case we have a
byte called my byte
and then we're going to set the value
because we're seeing single equals means
to set the thing on the left hand side
to the result of the right hand side so
my buy it is equal to 12
and then in c-sharp you have to end
every statement with a semicolon so if
you were to remove that Visual Studio
will complain and tell you that it's
expecting a semicolon so it's fairly
intelligent but in essence most things
end with the semicolon
the exceptions are things like functions
as you can see you've got curly brackets
and the same here so usually curly
brackets are when you don't need a
semicolon so just think of most lines as
you go along you'll pick these up but
most lines are ended with semicolon our
accessibility levels this is something
that will come into play as your program
grows and by that we mean we've just
created this variable called bite now
typically you'd also have variables
directly in your class so let's put it
up here instead so we'll just do my bite
and we'll just declare it let's just
comment this one out for now
because it's got the same name so now my
bite is declared in the class by default
if there's nothing before the variable
so there's no accessibility name then
it's called private so it's exactly the
same as typing private bite and what
this private means is that nothing
outside of the place it's defined within
so nothing that's outside of this plus
so nothing outside of these two curly
brackets can see my bite so if we were
to create another class and we just do
class plus B
and then we try to access something from
that program I'm just going to create a
new instance of the program for now so
there we have an instance of the program
and we're going to try and access my
bite and you can see there's no bite
because this class is outside of these
brackets so a private defines the access
to be contained within the place is
defined now there's various levels of
accessibility the next one is protected
and this is sort of one stage up and
this won't make much sense right now but
this then allows any class that derives
from this program so you think of this
class as say a fruit and a fruit defines
a basic object a basic edible food and
then say class B was an apple and you
could over eyes you could make program
your base class so then you take
everything from this class and it
becomes part of this class so in that
case when it's protected it's already
inside this class now so you can see my
bite because we've over in this class
we've got everything from this class so
protect it allows you to for the parent
class to see the variable so we change
that back to private it's strictly
within this class only even if something
overrides the class so we do this dot
and there's no Maya bite so again that
one is a little bit over your head right
now but that's a quick overview of what
protected is are the most common two are
private in public so public means that
there's no access restriction so
anything that tries to access this
object whether it's outside the program
inside the program or an over it in
class can all access this bite so if we
were to create plus B again
I'm going to the constructor rate a new
instance you can see now I can access my
bite directly because it's public so
when you use these access levels as when
you're thinking of again constructing a
bigger program and you're say defining a
specific function and you want to expose
parts of your information your variables
to the outside world that you will or to
the thing that's going to consume your
program or function and it's part of
defining that function again for now
these won't come into play instantly but
just be aware of access levels so it's
you can have a private byte private you
could have come on stick these and the
plus not inside the function that's one
thing to note as well of you're inside a
function so you're not inside the class
directly you can't define an access
level so if we try to do the private by
a it will complain because you can't
have you can't define an access level
inside a function because by default
anything defined inside this function is
contained within this set of curly
brackets and this is called the scope so
this is the scope where you can access a
if you've defined it inside of this
function is strictly within this
function nothing outside of this
function can access that variable so
let's remove this comment up to here so
you've got a private and that's
accessible early then program this plus
yep protected that's only accessible
within this class and I mean that
overrides OHS I don't believe overrides
the correct technical term labra a class
that uses this as the base class then
you have your public and there are no
access descriptions and there's also
other types which I'll just mention here
but we won't make note of yet because
again until you get much further down
the line they won't make any sense
anyway but you also have what's called
internal and internal means when you
create this application so this project
on the right when you compile this
project
you get this exe so this is your result
of this project if you create multiple
projects which is typical in larger
applications you can create what's
called class libraries and those
compiled to dll's which are things that
then this exe can reference so for
example these references like system is
a dll that's a class library so you can
see the dll file internal means that
anything defined inside of that program
or inside of that project rather is
accessible only to that project so if
you wanted to keep something
self-contained within your class library
or program that if somebody was to
reference in this references couldn't
access you mark it as internal it's very
similar to public however public means
that if we were to reference this
application externally in another
project we can still access that
variable so again that won't be useful
right now but down the line that's where
internal does and then finally can have
a combination of protected internal
which is the only dual accessibility
level and what that is it's limited to
the current assembly or types deriving
from the same class so it's a bit of a
complicated one but again you won't use
those you probably never will use those
but they're there for you know a
complete overview now different ways to
declare variables so again we'll move
this up here because we're not declaring
available inside a function so declaring
is when you give a statement you're
declaring what something is so I want to
buy it called B that's a declaration you
define a variable when you assign it a
value so this is the definition this is
the declaration so by different ways to
declare a variable I mean different ways
in order to create this variable so this
is typically just known as a member or a
field as you can see what visual
with talent is there and this is typical
when you tend to use fields or members
when the private when there's something
self-contained within this class that
you want to use and you'll find a lot of
people give these variables specific
names so a long while ago which is
fairly outdated now people used to call
the variable starting with the type so a
lowercase B for byte and then my
variable and then say they were defining
a string it'll be a lowercase s and my
variable now it's up to you what you do
but I feel this is very old practice now
with intellisense and with good coding
and good comments you shouldn't need to
rely on the type of variable based on
the the name so my preference because I
call them members I start every private
field every private member with the
lowercase M so regardless whether it's a
string or a byte or any other I started
with in a lowercase M I also don't
typically end it with the type of
variable the variable name should do
exactly that define what this variable
is holding so this was going to hold my
credit card number it would be M got it
card number
it wouldn't be credit card number string
and it wouldn't be asked credit card
number it'd just be defined as what it
needs to be and again this is all
preference you can do what you like but
this is what I do now this is a field or
remember the other way of defining
things so this is typical when you do in
public something accessible outside of
this class by something that's going to
consume it it would be what's called a
property and it's very similar so it
wouldn't definitely use privates but I'm
just going to show you anyway private by
it and then again my variable but what I
tend to do with properties is I just
drop the lowercase M and that gives me a
indication that it's you know external
to the program because you tend to see
when you write something like system
cons well I know this is a function but
you tend to see them all capitalized you
don't see a lowercase M in front or a
lowercase F or anything like that so
when something's coming inside of your
class and trying to access things you
don't usually want to have them seen
prefixes you know at lowercase happens
so because I'll let make this public so
it makes more sense because a property
it's going to be public you define just
the same we'll leave the lowercase M off
all right variable and then instead of
just ending with a semicolon it's
similar to a function in a class it's a
curly bracket and then the shorthand
which means just the quicker way to
write this is get a semicolon set
semicolon and then you don't end with a
semicolon because the curly brackets
replace the need for the semicolon they
define the start and end and it also
means anything inside curly brackets can
go over multiple lines no problem
there's if they don't have the semicolon
because they've got these then the end
is defined by this curly bracket so now
if we to access this variable you'll see
the difference we do this which refers
to ourself so in this case program also
they're in a static function we can't do
that it's just a quickly spin up here
access so you can see here the blue ones
and my variable is a field they seem my
available here and I was not seeing it
but this is a property the symbol here
means a property so that's how you
typically define things that want to be
accessed outside of your program again
don't worry too much about what it is or
why or you know what these getters and
setters are right now in short this is
actually a function of the property so
if you wanted to do something specific
when something tried to access this
variable this would be called I'm right
now it's a blank function it's a
shorthand version and the setter is when
so the set is when somebody wants to set
the data on this variable the GAT is
when something tries to get the data
from the variable but we'll go through
properties in a separate tutorial
because I want to go quite in-depth with
all the things about properties but for
now if you're defining something
publicly accessible a variable that's
accessible outside the class I'd
recommend using a property with no
prefix and then for private fields or
members add prefix them with a lowercase
M again completely up to you but that's
my preference so there are your two ways
of creating variables for defining
outside declaring variables we've got
reading text from the user import so
finally let's do something slightly
interesting so we want to read some
information we're going to ask the user
to enter a number so first we want to do
and we did this in the last tutorial I
want to do console dot write line and
we're going to say please enter in
number between 1 and 10 and now we want
to read the user's response so in order
to do that you do console dot read line
read line means we will read the result
until they press the Enter key now you
notice this function returns a string so
it's not void and like our function here
it's a string it's returning something
so we need to assign that return value
what they typed to a variable so we're
going to create a variable and we can
actually create it at the same time so
we can do string user response equals
and now you see this is your operator
the left-hand side is what we want to
give a value to and in this case we've
created a string called user response
the right side we're calling a function
that actually returns the string so it
will get assigned to this variable now
you'll notice here there's no lowercase
M and there's no capital it's neither of
these it's because when you define a
variable inside a function so this
variable is only accessible inside this
function again it's a slightly different
way of writing again completely my
preference but what I do in that case is
I leave the lowercase M off and I just
start directly with
name of the variable and again it's also
you can quickly ascertain when you're
trying to use a variable or set
available if I am inside here and I go
to set a variable and I say and credit
card number also and static again we
can't do that these would have to be
static remember the static is a single
instance so these don't have static on
at the moment which means they're
accessible only two instances of this
class so I'll just mark them static
quickly so we can access them inside
this main function so if I were to type
M credit card number equals user
responds really easily when I'm glancing
through a code I can tell because of
this lowercase M I'm assigning a value
to something that's outside of this
function and maybe that's not what I
wanted to do maybe that's what I didn't
intend to do at the same time if I was
to do my variable now it's the wrong
type but ignore that for this point but
again that's really obvious it's a
capitalized start I know this is a
public thing outside of this function so
the point of having the different styles
of variable is so when you're coding it
helps you spot errors as well as conform
to a certain standard so in my head I'm
expecting to work within this function
and I know it's self-contained I don't
expect to set any variables that are
outside so then if I see a lowercase M
or a capital it makes me aware of a
potential issue so now we run this
program right line will run will output
that to the screen read line will run
and the user response will be set to a
value and in order to see this so we can
just go ahead and output but it's nice
to actually see something happening we
can do a little short tutorial on
breakpoints so I won't go too much into
detail about what they are so just
follow along for now this is the line we
want to start at in terms of we want to
start stepping through code line 35 so I
just click the gray part here and it
will highlight the line red
now I click start or press f5 the
application runs in sees jump straight
back to visual studio and it's going
yellow and this means now it's a way in
our response of what to do so now it's
paused here we can you can see we can
hover over things and inspect things so
we can see what valuables are and what
values are have you press f10 and see
it's jump to the next line and now the
console window will have output please
enter a number between 1 and 10 now if
we press f10 again it's going to try to
jump to the next line but because this
will wait until we press enter nothing
will happen until we type and press
ENTER so go ahead and press f10 and you
can see now it's waiting in this window
for us to do something so let's go ahead
and type 12 and press ENTER and now you
can see it's jump back here to the end
of the program but now if we hover over
user response we can see the number 12
and see these double quotes this means a
string so we've got some input from the
user and we can now do something with
that in the next step so we'll just stop
that program for now so now we have this
response it's a string so it's not a
number that we can say times by 2 which
is what we're going to do in this
example so in order to work with
mathematical operations we need to
convert this string into a number in
this case a whole number and that's
called parsing so what we need to do for
that first we need a variable of the
type that we want which is an integer so
we type int user number and then we just
declare it we don't define it and now
we're going to do something that's an if
statement this is a branching statement
we can do something if something's true
and we can do something else if
something's false so you type the word
if open a standard bracket just a a
normal bracket and then you can call a
function which is called int pass now
the pass will crash the application if
it fails so the user enters say the
letter A instead of a number and you did
in dot pass this would crash your
application so we don't want to do that
we want to do what's called try pass and
you see this returns a boolean so this
returns true or false and true means it
was successful and the value was a
number and false means the user didn't
enter a valid number so we do in not try
pass and it's a function so we open up a
bracket as expecting a string and then
it's got this thing called an out into
result so let's deal with the string
first the input but that's how we use a
response so we just type user response
and then for this integer and set out
and that means that this function wants
to set this value so when we pass the
user response in as a normal parameters
we can't this function tryparse can't
set that value it can't change the value
whereas when it's an out it's passed as
a reference so it goes directly into the
function and this tried pass function
will have the ability to change the
value of this result so to pass it in as
that we simply type the word out and
then our variable which is username bur
and that's the function so now in doctor
I pass here is returning a boolean and
the a of works on true or false
statements it's as simple as that year
if this is true or if it's false so then
we close the bracket for this statement
so here's the inner function
that's our call that will return a
boolean and this is the ifs outer
brackets
and then we do the curly brackets which
is similar to a function again because
an F statement needs a start and a
finish so this is the start of the EV
true inside here and this is the end
so we're saying if the entry pass is
successful then user number will be now
an integer will be a usable number of
whatever the user entered that's all
good we'll come to that in a moment and
then you can do the opposite what if it
didn't
what if it was false you can type after
the closing curly bracket the word else
and then open and close and other Sattar
curly brackets and now we'll get to here
if the number of the information the
user entered was not a whole number so
let's work with that first which is nice
and easy so the end of the wrong number
we're going to simply go console dot
write line and say sorry that was not a
recognized number and and then that will
just close the application so we will do
in fact we'll put the red line
afterwards and we'll also put a little
statement so regardless of what happens
here we'll do a little statement before
the program closes and just say press
ENTER to close and then we'll do a
console dot red line in order to wait
for that enter so we run this program
now with start or f5 you can see it says
please enter number between one and ten
so let's enter the letter e and when we
press enter sorry that was not
recognized as a number so that's good
that's working as expected so now we
want to deal with what happened if it
worked so first let's take a look at
what happened if it worked so we click
in this gray area here to set a
breakpoint press f5 to run type in a
valid number five and press Enter you
can see it's broken going yellow here
now this is debugging so that means we
can have a look at things
so now let's hover over user number and
you can see it's now been set in the
number five so that's good we know we've
now got the number
entered so press stop so now it's time
to do some arithmetic so firstly we told
them to enter a number between 1 and 10
now an integer is a number between - a
large number plus a very large number so
first we want to make sure the user
entered between 1 and 10 so we can do
that by another wave statement so we
have user number and then we do this
angled bracket and this means less than
it's you know it's pointing to the left
as my way or pointing to the right is
and greater so the user number is less
than 1 and then in order to say the word
or because you want multiple things
inside of this you want to check if it
was below 1 you also want to check if it
was above 10 so for that you can say if
the number is below 1 and then 2 pipes
on your keyboard which on the UK is by
the left hand shift this this double
pipe means or so think of it as if
you're speaking it's if the number of
user number is less than 1 or user
number is greater than 10 we do the same
style so it was outside of that range
let's let the user know that the number
was outside of the range
otherwise we know the answer the number
between 1 and 10 so we're going to
create well in fact we don't even need
to create another variable we're just
going to use this variable directly user
number so we're going to times this
number by 2 I'm going to do user
response equals user response and then
the star the asterisk is at times so
times 2 hopes that I have the user
response not user number so there we go
we've user number is now equal to itself
times 2 so if we put a breakpoint here
and we've run the application
let's first test the logic that if we
enter number too large or too small that
it fails plus under 44 and God the
number was outside the range so we run
that again now let's enter a valid
number as enter 3 and now we hit this
breakpoint
so you can see right now before we've
run this line the numbers 3 we're now
going to like run user number times 2 so
press f10 to step over and now user
number 6 so we've times the number by 2
which is what we want but we don't do
anything right now we just end the
program so what we want to do now is
output that number at number 6 back to
the user
so you do a console dot write line and
now you can see this one of 19 means
that this write line function similar to
our main function
it's overloaded in this case so there
was multiple versions of this function
with the exact same name inside console
but they all accept different parameters
so they accept a boolean a character
character a decimal double a load of
different variables that's handy because
then we could just type in user number
because one of the accepted variables
inside this as an integer and all that
does is takes the user number and
converts it to a string by doing doctor
string
now if we did that we're just going to
get the number output on the screen so
enter number three its output the number
six so we want to actually state
something instead of just right in the
number six so you'd write a message your
new number is and now you'd say well how
do we add six to that do we just put it
there do we just right now it's not
there do we do and no it's not appearing
so when you want to add two strings
together it's called concatenation and
it just means to join two things
together so you want to say your new
string is and then this variable so the
correct thing is to do plus and then use
a number now because you're trying to do
a string plus a number here again visual
studio is smart enough to take this
integer and effectively do two string so
the adding two strings together so we
haven't explicitly told it to do that
but the overload for the string class
has something in that allows you to do
that so you can add a string like this
and this will out report if you run this
program your new number is six now
that's okay when you're starting out and
same as this this is okay when you're
starting out but there's a much better
way of doing both of these things so
we'll leave the statement in I will just
comment it out and what you can do when
you're doing an operator and the left
and right side
start with the exact same variable and
then another operator you can do a short
under quicker way a variety in the
statement so it would say user number x
equals two what that means is the user
number is going to be x by itself by
this number so x equals two so that's
how you start writing it and it's the
shortened version similar to this string
when you're creating strings there were
various ways to create this string so we
could have said string by string
new stringer believe we can do and we
can pass in other strings the fact we
can't pass a string and they're less
characters you can do string dot Comcast
which is short for concatenate and you
can pass in multiple objects so we could
pass in effectively this string and then
a comma and then use a number and then
my string would now equal this same
string but obviously you can see that's
a lot messier than just doing this so if
you can construct a string in line as in
directly and here you tend to do that
and again the plus a sort of an old way
of doing it so the more modern way is
that you want to put a dollar sign and
now inside your string you can remove
the plus and if you open the curly
brackets like a function open and close
now inside here and we can type the
actual valuable name so we can actually
return our number and it looks a lot
cleaner see you a type in a longer
message your new number is this dot
which is two times the value and you run
this you now get a cleaner way of of
seeing what we did so that's enough on
passing the value and output in the data
calculations we've actually covered here
we've already gone through calculations
right here and constructing strings from
variables we've just done as well are
just here so I think that covers this
tutorial for now and we'll go through
some I guess some more if some I'll see
