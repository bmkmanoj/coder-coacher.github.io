creating this custom program that asks
the user to guess a number between zero
and a hundred and then guess is the
correct number within the fewest amount
of tries in this tutorial we're going to
now move this program if you're well
this piece of code into its own class to
keep it organized and make it more
meaningful we're going to keep that
class clean and easy to browse through
by making use of regions we're going to
create functions to expose things such
as asking the question and then trying
to do you know make a guess if you will
and then finally report the findings at
the end and then we're going to use that
class inside of the main function in
order to then do what the programmer
originally did so as we spoke about in
the tutorial previously classes are
things that contain other information so
they contain these properties and
variables and they can contain the
functions that we need and many other
things so we're going to make use of a
class in order to consolidate this
program instead of being just a big dump
of code here it's going to be a nice
plus that can be created and used
throughout the application so start by
right-clicking on your project do add
class I'm going to call this number
gasser
so it's created this class for us I like
to prepend all the classes with public
so it's obvious that this class is now
publicly accessible I don't like to
leave things undefined and leave it up
to misinterpretation so at the word
public so this class is called number
gasser now when we comment code we use
these two forward slashes and that's
good that's that's non exportable
comments that's comments that stay
within your application and of your own
use now if we do things like console dot
read line and we wait you'll see reads
the next line of characters from the
standard input so this is a comment that
the developers added to this function
read line so that all the developers
like us that want to use this function
get some information so this is an XML
comment and we want to add these to our
class as well so it's nice and handy
when we consume our class so to do that
just before the class name just here put
three forward slashes and this will
automatically do a summary statement
this is a an exportable comment so we're
going to give this class some detailed
information now and it's basically what
our program does so it's going to ask
the user for a number and and find that
number out in the fewest possible turns
so now let's take a look at this comment
how it looks when we go to consume this
class so you create an instance of a
class just the same way you create
variables but instead of using integer
or boolean or any other variable name
you actually specify the name of the
class so you can see number gaseous so
we can do number guesser
and then we'll call it a number gasser
is the variable name equals nu number
gasser and that's now created an
instance of the class so just like you'd
create an instance of a variable and
what I didn't show you is on the
constructor the thing that instant takes
the class or rather on the definition
over here because this is the definition
at the top you hover over number gas and
there's our comment ask the user to get
a number between a certain range so now
when the somebody else comes to usual
class they're going to have some
comments on you know what it's doing and
what it's expecting I'm getting going to
comment our code changing new instance
number gas plus and now it's also a good
time to mention the use of var so you
can see here we specify number gasser as
the variable the type and then we go
ahead and create an instance of it here
with new number gasser
same here when we make an integer we
specify int give it the name and then we
set it to the value now the thing is
visual studio is smart enough to realize
that you're specifying 100 by default
it's going to try and create an integer
anyway it's going to try and make the
variable of that type same if we were to
do
a boolean and we do true and again you
can see it's going to try and use a
boolean by default so instead of
specifying the type of variable all the
time when you're specifying a variable
and then assigning it at the same time
you can use a shortcut so instead of
typing the variable name you simply type
var and that just means it's a variable
but the type of that variable is going
to be defined on the opposite side of
the operator so in this case we haven't
specified the exact type we've just said
it's a variable with this name and this
is what we want it to be a new number
gasser
so now visual studio has actually
created a number gas available for us so
you want to make use of this var as much
as possible so we've now run new
instance of the class and we need to
start shifting this code over into a
class in some meaningful way so the
first thing is here ask the user to
think of a number between well no
actually let's put the variables in
first so let's take these variables cut
them out with control X go into the
class and inside here let's just paste
them for now so we know what they are
and now because these are by default
because there's nothing specified these
are private variables they won't be
accessible to this class so if we did
number gas there's nothing available we
can't and change those values or use
them and in classes instead of using
variables what we like to use is
properties so a property is just in
essence a variable but a property has
what's called a getter and a setter so
let's just go ahead and turn this one
into a property and we'll make it public
at the same time so they can be accessed
so it's a public integer and you can't
use var in this case because we're not
going to define this value here and even
if we do we still need to specify the
type because a public property is
something different than a variable it's
not directly a variable so we can't use
the VAR in this sense
so it's a public integer and the max so
max is now no longer a useful name in
terms of this class now trying to set or
configure this number gasser so max is a
bit non-descriptive so we're going to
change this to I'm going to also start
with a capital because this is a public
property and by convention that's just
what I like to do is to start there
anything public in a class with a
capital letter so we're gonna call this
Maxime um number we can just call it
maximum number because we're going to
add a comment so now we mentioned before
our let's finish making this a property
so to turn this into a property it's
similar to a function you open and close
the curly brackets inside for short and
for now and we'll go over properties in
another video in more detail but for now
just type get semicolon set semicolon
and that's enough to turn what was a
variable now into a public property and
then thanks to c-sharp 6 we can actually
still assign a default value to that
property directly so we've done that
right afterwards so all you have to do
let's do it to the gases you make it
public you keep the integer you
capitalize the latter you don't have to
but let's again preference we're going
to just give this a better name as well
so we'll call this current number off
gaseous then you do the curly brackets
get semicolon set semicolon close curly
brackets so these have become public
properties and to finish off with these
public integer current guess minimum
and then current gas maximum now for
these two you can see here we can't use
a number directly as an initial value so
we can't make use of this number here
that's just how things are but because
we can run we're going to make a
function that can run our program that
can run the the guesses if you will the
system that says right pick a number and
then goes through the gases and these
two are they need to be reset each time
you run the program we don't need to
define them by default here anyway
so simply remove the values correct
number of gases is again the same as
below that's going to change every time
we run so the only one we're going to
define a default value is the maximum
number now we want to also comment these
properties just like we commented the
class so it's exactly the same we just
put three forward slashes instead of two
and then we'll just go ahead and move
this existing comment in and back the
third slash and then define maximum
number of get now this is a comment to
ourselves so this is sort of a non
English sentence if you're willing
shorthand it's just define maximum
number of use the user can guess we want
to be more explicit because this is what
another person that hasn't written this
code is typically going to read so we
want to define this as the largest
number we ask that you
the gas between zero and less number and
then same here we'll just three forward
slashes then we're going to type in the
current number of gases I complete
they're as hard current known minimum
number the user is thinking off copy
that paste current noun maximum so we
now have public properties instead of
the variables and comments on all of
them so we go to our program and then to
access anything inside of this class we
use the variable name to retired number
gasser and then put a dot now you can
see we've got all these values so you
got current guess maximum and there's
our common to the current no maximum
number the users thinking of and you've
got them for all the comments now
because we defined here get and set that
means that this class that's making use
of our or the class that's number
guesser
it can get the value but it can also set
the value now the current number of
gases and the current min and Max
although we want to expose those
properties so that this class could make
use of the maybe liked we don't want
this class to be able to go and change
these values because they are critical
to the function of the program there's
something that that you know the user
should not be changing that the what we
call read-only or you know get as only
the not to be set by an external program
because that would throw off that the
way the program works the program isn't
expecting these values to be changed by
anything except itself whereas the
maximum number we're going to allow this
to be changed so then outside in this
class the user can go ahead and say max
number equals 220 this as a get to set
it but in order to make these not
settable by anything except this class
itself simply of the access of private
before the words set so it's now got a
private set which means only this class
itself can set the value so we then want
to try and change say their current
guess maximum we're going to warn in
that the property or index a current
guess maximum cannot be used because it
is X inaccessible basically so it's
saying we can't reach it in order to set
the value so that's that's good enough
for us that's now protecting our
variables now we've done creating a
class so we've effectively spun up this
number gasser class and then we've now
added some public properties so going to
move down to regions because this class
is going to have public properties it's
going to have a constructor which is
this thing here when you create a new
version of the class this is a function
you'll notice it it's effectively
calling the default what's called the
constructor of a class a function inside
the class that always runs when it's
created and then we're going to have
functions in general for doing did the
actions that we want so this class is
going to start becoming very large and
with these comments as well it would
start looking you know hard to read and
hard to find so we can minimize the
comment by clicking their little minuses
and that makes it a little bit nicer but
then we also want to group things so
these are all public properties so what
we're going to do is make a region and
to do that just go above the way you
want to we want to group all this so
just above this we put a hash and then
tap the word region and a space and then
we give it the name I'm going to call it
public properties
and we're going to go to the end of
where this region is this group type
hash and end region and what that allows
us to do is simply use this minus sign
here next to the region and that will
collapse this into a nice box and you're
going to hover over and see what's in or
you could expand again and it just
allows us to group in inside purely this
window just the visual way of inspecting
code it allows us to group and minimize
sections of the class so that it's nice
and easy to read so we've grouped those
into public properties now I mentioned
this constructor and you'll say well
lots of function and yeah this class has
no functions which is true but by
default all classes have what's called a
default constructor and that just means
when you create the class it accepts no
values it simply gets created when
everything is in its default State and I
always like to create that constructor
and in order to do that it's effectively
a function and there's a shorthand to
creating one so inside the class just
click anywhere inside the class type the
world c tour and then press the tab key
twice and it's going to create you the
constructor
now you can tab this by hand all you
have to do is type the word public so
that you know this class when it's
creating it can actually access the
function and you'll notice there's
effectively no return value and that's
what makes it a constructor you've got
the exact same name as the class which
is also required and there's no return
value so normally you'd need to avoid or
integer or your return value a
constructor is special because it has no
return value and it's got the exact same
name as the class so this is now the
constructor and this is code that if you
wanted to do something so say when they
create this new class and then you want
to set up some values so how we've got
the maximum number right now is 100
let's get rid of that there and instead
you could actually do it inside here in
the constructor so we can do this dot
maximum number equals 100 and that's
going to set the value of maximum number
to 100 as soon as this line has been run
this has been created obviously we're
going to change it here afterwards but
you typically use the constructor to
create default values again let's add a
comment to this 3 forward slashes and
just call it default constructor and
then again remember to comment
everything you're doing set default
maximum number and then we also want to
put a region around this so hash region
and I usually put seat or dot seat or
again that's just a preference that's
what I've been doing for years and
that's that's what I doing that to me
signifies constructor and then you can
minimize that and let's go ahead and
just run this now to see what happens
here so I'm going to put a breakpoint
I'll put it right here on line 44 so we
know we should hit this breakpoint when
the class is created I'm going to have
to just temporarily cut this code out
because nothing will work right now
because we've moved the variables just
cut that away and then we'll also put a
breakpoint here so that once the class
has been created we can inspect the
value of maximum number then we can
change it and inspect again and I'll put
one here so press f5 to run
and you can see it stopped in code so
we've got a number gas a variable that
hasn't been created yet I press f10 to
just step over and that'll and carry on
running until the next breakpoint the
next thing it's hitter's it's gone
inside of this default constructor as we
said and the maximum number right now is
zero because the default value of an
unassigned integer is zero is then going
to set the maximum number to 100 as you
can now see we'll press f5 to let the
program continue to run until it hits
the next breakpoint so it's now created
the class as you can see you can also
expand you can see the maximum number
has been set to 100 so that's done what
we expected it when you create a new
instance of that class the default
values are set so the maximum number set
to 100 and then here we're going to
change that value from 100 to 200 and
you can see that it's changed
so that's the constructor that's the
thing that runs when the class is
created
you got your public properties which you
can think of as your variables in the
previous program but now they are
properties so that our main function can
access them such as this and now we want
to create our first function so here in
code we say ask the users to think of a
number so really this is the start of
the program of you all this is wrongly
the same route we've set up the maximum
number now we're ready to go ahead and
run that and guess the numbers now we
could just put this all in one function
and call it something like you know run
or guess or whatever we want to call it
but just again so you get more used to
creating more functions we're going to
break this down into several functions
it's not meant as a functional real
world class it's more of the concept of
of what a class says and what it does so
let's take this part of our code that
was to ask the user to effectively
inform the user of what number to think
of between what and what
let's cut that code go out to our class
and then we're going to create a new
function so again public so that it can
be accessed by the main function and
we're not going to return anything
because it's simply asking the user
while telling the user to think of a
number we don't expect anything back we
don't need any information back from the
usual information back to the caller
right now so it's a void we don't return
anything I'm going to call this let's
call it inform user and the way we
create the function as open and close
the parentheses and then create a set of
curly braces so we have its publicly
accessible it returns nothing and is
call inform user we also have nothing
being passed in there's no parameters
inside these parentheses which means
such as when we do console.writeline and
we pass in a string that's a variable so
just hear the thing that calls me come
pass in an array of strings so we're
saying we don't need any information
from the caller from this guy here we're
going to then call it just simply needs
to inform the user we can then paste our
existing code in there and that's good
enough we ask the user to think of a
number and now here between 0 and 100
100 is no longer valid it's now between
0 and our maximum number because it's
now a variable so call this maximum
number and then we also need to change
the string because now we're explicitly
asking the user between 0 and 100 and
it's noise between 0 and this maximum
number so we've put the dollar sign at
the start of the string this allows us
to then use curly braces inside the
string and place a variable we're going
to do this dot maximum number so now
it's going to say I want you to think of
a number between 0 and this maximum
number and that's a function so again we
need to comment this function 3 forward
slashes and we'll say ask the user to
think of a number maximum number
so now we can call this function which
will then effectively run this code so
let's go back on where we've removed the
previous code let's now replace it with
the the new classic function W number
gasser
dot and now you can see we have inform
user and as our comment asks you to
think of a number between zero and the
maximum number and to call a function
you simply type the name of it and then
you just open closed parenthesis and
semicolon to finish the line so right
now has really been moving code into the
class we've been replacing them with the
actual making use of the classroom and
calling those valve variables and
functions as well let's just add a
comment here as well change the default
maximum number to 200 and then ask the
user to think of a number so don't
classes or regions we've just created a
function I'm going to create a few more
and using classes we're already doing
right now this is using a class so
already we've pretty much covered the
topic of there the tutorial but we'll
keep going more you'll get more used to
how this is all going to come together
and effectively keep the exact same
logic but make it much nicer and again
easier to read as well as easier to use
in multiple places or again once you do
more real-world applications which we'll
get onto in a few tutorials you'll
realize the benefit of making a class
instead of just don't be a load of code
inside a function it's always good to
keep your code small and clean and
organized and customizable so already by
creating this class we've naturally
added a way to easily customize the
function of that class the function of
what it's expected to do we can now
change the maximum number nice and easy
so now we've informed the user the next
step is really this whole while
statement this is effectively
taking the gases this is finding out the
number so this is I'd say call it
discover number so select this entire
while call and cut that away go back to
you number gasser let's create another
function call a public we again don't
need to return anything and we'll call
this discover number we don't need to
accept any parameters and give us a
comment ask the user and series of
questions to discover the number they
are thinking of and paste our code in
and all we have to do is really just
change where we have the previously
defined variables to now use our public
properties so guess min we can just do
this doc guess minimum max is this doc
gets maximum because we're not changing
the function of the program so much
we're mainly organizing it and putting
it into a class so for the most part
everything is just the same we just need
to make sure changing the name of all
these variables to be the correct public
properties
and you want to be careful when you do
this that you don't make any typos you
don't accidentally use a different
variable because then you would be
changing the the function of the program
so that's everything replaced inside
that function so now that function
should run exactly the same as the code
that was previously here so now we just
call that new function so we'll call
discover number and then this last part
really is the report you know this is
announcing the discovery of your well so
we'll just select those three lines cook
them do exactly the same go back to the
number get a class add a new function
doesn't return anything and we'll say
announce results and paste that code in
and then change the variables give it a
comment three forward slashes
and then call the function in the main
plus and now you can see our main
function looks much nicer we have create
a new instance of a number gasps
applause so we create the instance we
want to change the default maximum
number the user can guess to 200 then
going to ask the user so we're going to
inform the user which effectively asked
them to think of a number then going to
discover that number and then we're
going to announce the results and
hopefully you can see already that how
more descriptive this code has become so
instead of looking at what was a big
just long list of code we've now got a
fairly well-defined almost human
readable code so number gasser is the
variable name but it's also descriptive
that it helps us understand so it's
clearly trying to get a number we can
see that we're setting a maximum number
then we can see at this point we're
informing the user and then one more at
this point we're discovering the number
and at this point we're announcing
result so it's a lot more human readable
it's not like you're flicking through
this code and saying while this and do
that this is this is a lot more detailed
this is exactly what the program is
doing but in terms of then making use of
this code we don't want to be just
dumping this entire code and we want to
each part each chunk of their code each
chunk of your program has now got a nice
function it's broken it down into
smaller parts and that's always a good
thing in code to keep things really
small your functions want to be nice and
small and compact and do a small job you
know lots of little jobs put together so
this should now do exactly what we did
before
so let's first see if this program will
build so we'll do ctrl shift and B I
think it is built successfully so that's
a good start now I just changed this
back to 100 for now because first before
we start messing with the program we
want to run it and make sure that it
does what it used to do because we've
effectively done quite a lot of changes
here
let's also wrap these public functions
in a region because you can see again
now these are nice public properties
constructor but now just got this again
there's dump of code starting to happen
so let's just create a new region called
public and I'll call them methods
because when we get more in depth about
more advanced things on c-sharp you'll
realize those things called actions and
functions and these things although they
are functions again this there's various
names for for this this type of thing
and now more commonly it can be called
more of a method because a function is
something that is now a defined thing in
c-sharp you can have a function and an
action so we'll call them methods so if
you hear the word method or you hear the
word function typically when you hear
the word function it's referring to the
same thing if you referring to this
which is a function if you hear a method
it's exactly the same thing it's a
function so it's the same thing just a
different name so let's clean that up so
you can see how nice and easy this class
is to then navigate and find things so
we want to know what happens when we
create this class we go to seat or
double click you've got this nice little
constructor you want to check out the
variables in this case the public
properties you just go into the public
properties section you want to see some
functions of what's happening you can
expand this and then go to those set
functions so it's it's broken all that
code down them and sort of organized it
into a structure so again it's easy for
you to navigate and find out things that
you need to find out so let's just press
f5 and run this and make sure everything
still works as it did previously so
there's a good start I want you to think
of a number between 0 and 100 now
remember this this string was actually
changed so our code went to inform user
and we edited the original code and
change from 0 to 100 to put the actual
public property
which is maximum number which also means
our default constructor has actually run
this code in order to change it to 100
so even though it looks the same that's
actually a good thing we now know this
code and this function specifically are
working
let's just stop that and change this to
200 we'll change it back in a moment
f5 to run again now you can see now it's
saying thinkwe number between 0 and 200
so we know that's now working pressing
enter your number is 0 guests in 0 Getti
so we can see something's gone wrong
already so let's just first change this
back to 100 run and press Enter so yeah
we can see right now this has gone wrong
and now I know what's gone wrong because
if you remember we go to the number
class's number gasses remember we
created these public properties and we
were defining these we will change them
from valuables into public properties
now mention that these three change
every time we want to effectively now
run this discover number function
because at the point of running the
discover number is when we were really
at the point of inform user because
we're outputting the number they want to
Gasport either way if we put it inside
the discover number it's good enough we
need to initialize the current men and
current max gas so by default these are
0 and 0 so what's happened because we
never replace them with the original
code which was if you remember this was
much divided by 2 which is effectively
this dot maximum number divided by 2
like that we're not going to put it
there but that's effectively what was
there because we then come into here and
there's a while as well the Gasman isn't
it to the guest max they're equal at the
start because they're both 0 so
basically what we need to do in the
discover number is then initialize the
variables so we want to change the
maximum to what it used to be
let's stop going as much as that we also
want to make sure because again what
could happen now because this isn't a
set of code that just runs from top to
bottom this is done by functions here
that we call we could do number guesses
discover number number gases discover
number we could call it twice we might
want to do that for any reason if we
were to do that and we run it once and
this while loop run it increased the
current number of gases and then it
finished but then we called it again
when it starts off at what should be a
brand new loop the number of gases is
not zero anymore it's from the previous
run so now it's going to increase even
further and be invalid so we need to
maintain the state of the program now we
need to make sure that when we're
calling these functions that these three
properties which you really need to be
defaulted every time you're running this
code instead of in the constructor we
need to make sure they are all set so
before you discover a number you want to
make sure the current number of guesses
is zero so we'll put clear variables to
the initial values before a discovery so
number of guesses zero the current max
gas is going to start off with it being
half of the maximum number and the
minimum is zero so that should fix that
issue now let's that's still on 100 so
let's run the program with that five
again I want you to think of a number
between 0 and 100 so press Enter and
there's the familiar sign is your number
between 0 and 50 so let's just answer
yes to everything which I believe should
bring us to the number 0 so yes is it
between 0 and 25 yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes
now go and then this part here your
number is 0 guests make guesses is
affected with the announce results
because the discover numbers finished so
that's a good sigh all looks the same
so we gain the exact same function of
the program here it's all operating the
same but what we've done is we've taken
all that big dump of code from the main
we've constructed a class we've put it
all into nice organized sections we've
done regions and then we've also made
the maximum number customizable so now
let's test by changing the maximum
number from 100 to 200 1 let's run again
with a 5 and that's good it's now think
of a number between 0 and 200 and there
we go it's now asking us between 0 and
100 not 0 and 50 because it's half of
200 so handsome now as it between 100
and 150 sure let's go for this yes yes
no yes no so the sons of know when our
number should be 120 which is any guest
in 7 let's check that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
guesses here so now our programs
customizable via just changing this one
variable here which is quite cool we can
go further and we can
you know add more features to this and
say handle issues like maximum number
sales I have no idea what will happen
able I spot minus one as your number
twins think we're done between 0 and
minus 1 okay your number is zero so you
can break it - - there we go hmm between
0 and minus 1 no Paul look and we've got
some kind of weird issue of an infinite
loop here and no matter what you answer
it's just a infinite loop so we could go
further you know and add things like
checking the maximum number to make sure
it's within a valid range it's you know
above zero so it's it's 1 or more and we
could do more things you know we could
you can continue to grow this but this
is a really basic and quite frankly
boring program we want to get on to more
exciting things so the next tutorials
we're going to start creating the way
you're going to learn the rest of
c-sharp it's not so much like a book
will teach you and we'll go through this
is a variable this is a function this is
you know an event or all that kind of
training we're going to do more things
like this we're going to create an
actual program we're going to make
something that does something and as you
go you're going to get to see how it's
built you might not understand fully
like right now where we've just created
these properties but the difference is
you're going to get to create actual
program you're going to get to do things
it's going to keep you excited so then
you might not fully understand what
you've written but you'll get it to run
you'll understand enough to create that
and then in your own time you can you
know look at these and change them and
maybe do some reading up and find out or
you just keep watching the videos and as
you go you're going to understand more
and more so you're going to get a really
fast tracked into learning c-sharp
without realizing you're going to be
making programs and applications that
will be interesting and as you go you'll
be chucked at a you know a whole lot of
new information very quickly and then
again if you got any questions on
something you don't understand or
something you want to ask just just ask
it in the comments or send me an email
male and you can get the answer that way
so to make things faster from now on
we're going to start just creating
hopefully in each video we're going to
create a new application that does
something different and we'll go on to
creating you know some visual
applications so instead of just this
plain black console app we'll go into
making some WPF applications which are
visual windows and doing things with a
file system and you know try and create
some interesting stuff so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
