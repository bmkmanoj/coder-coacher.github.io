should be able to create after following
this tutorial 3d perspective boxes
in this fireworks cs4 graphics design
tutorial I'll be showing you guys how to
create custom 3d perspective boxes and
you can go into the shapes selection and
grab the 3d box and then grab the center
point and you can it any way you
like it to the side backwards
upside down anything you want to do but
I'm gonna mine sort of like that
maybe like that okay and what I want to
do is use this as a wrapper for all
sides of my box so I'm going to so you
can make a custom logo or a little
rectangle that you want to use and a
little square that you want to use it or
whatever shape that your box is going to
be on the sides so let's go ahead and
remove this Phil may get none so that
way we just have a frame let's make that
the same color actually let's leave that
white I mean black now we'll grab this
flash we'll grab this flash icon and
we'll bring it in we'll make sure we put
this one modify transform flip it
horizontal this one's going to be in the
back
now we'll zoom in by holding ctrl and
mouse wheeling in or out and then we can
adjust the points on that item then we
can distort this item
just bring all the corners to where they
should be right in the corners it's very
easy just dragging nothing special this
one maybe over one there so now our box
has a back looks like this one needs to
go over one as well
there that's good okay see now the box
has a back and the icon is on there just
like it should be let's take this
control-c control-v get another copy of
it I'm going to slap this one on the
side over there and this one it really
wouldn't matter too much but we're still
going to flip it make sure we can just
use that other one don't use this so you
can go up here to flip horizontal see
these little icons up here will let you
manipulate shapes arrange them and such
okay so let's get this one in to place
now
okay so using that method I'm gonna go
all the way around the box with the icon
closing it up let's go to distort tool
I'll show you this one more and then
I'll do all the rest of my sides on my
own let's put that there put that there
put that right there
booyah so easy okay so now I'm going to
fill in the front and the side and those
won't have to be flipped horizontally
okay nevermind that cuz I just realized
that I'm gonna have to show you
something if you some people might not
happen to know so I'm gonna show it so
what happens is when we ctrl-c and
ctrl-v copy and paste another copy of
that it's behind that box we needed in
the front so let's press ctrl shift up
or you can use the arrange tool up here
to bring it to any layer that you need
and so you'll see that when you put that
in there let's zoom in by holding ctrl
and mouse wheel you see when we put that
on top of the box we're going to try and
distort it we can't see the edges of the
box and that's no good so we'll go here
to the opacity of the item and now we
have a real clear view of our edges in
the box where we need to get that thing
sunk into so now we can go ahead and
distort
pop that edging pop this edge in pop
this edge in and then bring it back up
to 100% opacity now we're looking good
now we can take this one ctrl-c ctrl-v
bring it to front here see how it's in
front do the same thing to the opacity
and now let's manipulate it
let's make sure we're in the right
starting point there and distort
you go here you go here
and that corner goes right there bring
the opacity back up look at air it looks
like this edge might need to come
maybe one more pixel to the right so
let's move it over there we go
this one down
and over one beautiful okay
now what we can do see now we have a
nice box now we take the edge which is
the box and sync it up to the color of
the box make it a nice dark red maybe
there we go and now you see you have a
custom box
so these wouldn't have to be a little
darker these edges on the inside the
perspective of the box and what we're
gonna do is make them a little darker
here we'll go down to filter I just
color brightness contrast bring the
brightness down on it so now it looks
like it's on the inside of a box that's
okay looks like my edge here needs to
come over
okay I've imported some little graphics
to use with my box and I'm gonna make it
look like this little guy is inside the
box it's very easy to do you can even
bring this to front and control shift
forward way his little heads back there
real good maybe make his little eyes
peeking out and then his hands grab his
hands and ctrl shift up bring those to
front and they'll be out in the Box on
the side of the box again on top get
them in the right angle there we go okay
so there's a little dude in the box and
let's see his little penguin character
bring him to front just stand him out in
front of the box
there we go maybe you have to decide not
in the front it's good
all right there
okay so now that shows you how to set up
any kind of 3d custom boxes you want
with junk inside of them and you know
you can do a lot more to these
graphically let's see let's grab this
control C actually then let's grab the
whole thing C control B
and let's go ahead and group this one
and group this one this one we'll flip
it
make these little corners match up
there you have it now you have two
options you can grab a rectangle that
has a linear gradient of the same color
your background is and then make the top
opaque a little bit C or you can get rid
of that don't need that either so you
can do that kind of like a shine effect
and you can also distort the way this
item is go ahead and distort it to make
it look more like a reflection that's
distorted see you need something like
that
or if you happen to have a custom image
pattern background say something like
this let's just make it solid and let's
give it a grain that's fine so say you
had something like that you wouldn't be
able to just put a black rectangle in
there you can go up to commands you
highlight the item that you want to give
the mask to go up to commands creative
where is that creative Auto vector mask
and you'll see that it puts a mask on it
that Auto applies and you can change the
settings inside before you apply it to
put any kind of mask you want so you can
do something like that and then you can
bring the opacity down and give it a
little more realism and that's if you
had some kind of image pattern
background like that I'm saying you can
still make a reflection on it so it's
pretty cool so that's how you can make a
custom box and then you can give this
thing a little glow you look cool the
whole thing there we go
it's pretty awesome and it's pretty easy
way to create 3d perspective items boxes
boxes with lids whatever you want to do
okay we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
