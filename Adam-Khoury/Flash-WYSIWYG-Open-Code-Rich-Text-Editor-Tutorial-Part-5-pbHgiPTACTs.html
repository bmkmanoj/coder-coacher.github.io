your own custom WYSIWYG rich text editor
in flash actionscript 3 and I noticed
mine was a little buggy because i was
using a mouse click event and I was not
listening for when they stage when the
mouse was up on stage so I added to the
code I added a few things here on my own
and I'm going to explain them to you now
so if we open the code and we look at it
and this source file will be available
if you want and but first let's actually
let's publish it out or render it and
take a look at how it works now so you
can see the way I made it was it's kind
of tan when before the user clicks their
mouse into the box and when they click
their mouths into the input field it
turns white and then the edge it
animates like a pulsating blue you can
check it out see that it's beautiful
letting them know that it's active and
they're in their typing and yada yada so
now what was happening before is if we
selected the whole selection and we
tried to bold it it wasn't bold
incorrectly and it wouldn't toggle so
you see now it's toggling folding and
unfolding whatever is highlighted and I
also added a format code button so now
what's happening is the the mouse is
listening for the Upstate so on mouse up
let me show you in the code before we
were using a click so I added for the
stage-two sense this text selection
function as well to make that fire off
as well as the click function we had
here remember but we change that click
to mouse up for the input field so when
the mouse comes up on the input field
after
a drag so say this would be the time
where that happens I drag and I unclick
that means mouse up that's when that
fire is off so mouse up for the input
field and mouse up for stage and mine
was a little buggy before because when
you would try to say you tried to grab
this whole selection and maybe your
cursor or your mouse was over here and
you let go it wasn't firing off that
function you have to listen for the
stage event but the mouse up on the
stage and not only the input field I
guess you could just use stage if you
wanted I don't know but I'm going to use
both it seems to work really solid now
the way I want it and I also added a
format code button since I'm going to
have this custom at my site I can make
it any way I want so I'm not going to
give people the ability to size their
text so when they say these two lines
with their code right here they type in
here is my code her is my code this was
their code they format code booya turns
it red makes it bigger so it
distinguishes itself from the rest of
the text as code and that's what I want
I want a very simple rich text editor
that I can just use for formatting
things to adjust a certain level and I
also added this scroll bar here so if
you keep pressing enter you keep putting
in a lot of data you see scroll bar just
automatically works and that's a
component from the components library
you I scroll bar you just take it you
plop it right next to whatever you want
to scroll the text field you want to
scroll and then you set it in the
properties here the parameters to the
input field that you want that to scroll
it's very easy to set that up so when
you drag it out the stage you set it
next to your input field or your dynamic
text field whatever you want to have a
scroll long and you just said the
since name for that field right there on
the scroller in the parameters and so
that works automatically like that it's
really nice and that was all I added now
let me show you right here is the
function make the fields background
change when focused so that cool effect
that we had on the background right here
the text input I just put a custom
background on it and it's a movie clip
with an instance name of field BG so
when the focus in on the field when they
focus in on the field this is a focus
event when they focus in on the field
this input field it fires up this
function and inside the function we say
field BG go to and stop to field BG is
this little guy back here right behind
that text input see feel BG double-click
inside of it it's a movie clip the first
frame it's that brown tannish on active
looking state and on the second frame
where it says with that code was command
and go to and stop to its that blue the
white has a white fill with a blue edge
and you'll see the blue edge is all by
itself just a little movie clip an edge
it's just a of a border there's no Phil
and it's around that that white box you
see what it does it animates kind of
pulsates so that makes this effect when
they put their mouse in there see turns
white and then pulsates and then their
cursors there you can also
you can do something like this start
typing actually I don't know if that
will work because it's going to empty it
out yeah if you didn't empty it out at
first using this line here you could
have something in there says start
typing here and then when they start
typing it would turn out you know and
what else should we tell you about we
also have the scroll bar that has no
programming on it it doesn't even have
an instance name and that was made
active like I showed you just by going
to the parameters and the form format
code button I just have to give that
over in a downstate and that one will be
like the others and that has new format
default for code and and format code
when I format code I'd make it bigger
and I make it red dark red and if they
want to change it back to the default it
goes back to black and normal 12 and i
set my text input field to 12 now so
everything runs a lot better on this
thing and it's a lot more solid there's
no no bugs that I can find here in part
for when we left off there were part 5
was the bug squisher that's what i did
and squished all the bugs i added things
to make it solid ok toggles format code
change the colors it's really solid it's
one of the best wizzy weeks I've ever
had the experience of using and it's all
custom or maybe I'm just saying that
because I made it but making something
like this is uh is no little feat
especially I'm not referencing anybody
else's code and I've never created
anything like this from scratch I've
done in a JavaScript WYSIWYG editor but
that's you know JavaScript this is all
flash and actionscript so this one is
the concluding part 5 where we added the
format code and so I showed you the
default setting for the with the format
code and default format code values and
attributes here and then I just added
another section for formatting the code
just like we did the bolding and
italicizing see bolding this one is
italicizing this one's underlining this
one this section formats the code the
way I want it custom for our site and
then the color picker is right down here
okay so if i go to add anything else to
this it will be documented on video and
i'll lead you through what I've done to
make it happen so like I said we
switched from using click event like we
were in the beginning to mouse up events
and we added mouse' up event for the
stage just to make it work without bugs
and solid and now it toggles the way it
should with toggling while it's selected
we can just keep hitting that button and
it will keep toggling it back and forth
see that's what we wanted beautiful okay
we'll see you in part 6 whenever I go to
adding smileys or allowing links to be
put in and things like that okay bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
