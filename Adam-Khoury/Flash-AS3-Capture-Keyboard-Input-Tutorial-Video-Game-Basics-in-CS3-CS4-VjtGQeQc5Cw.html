we've created in this capture keyboard
input tutorial will render out in
ActionScript 3 and you'll see I'm using
my keyboard a and D keys to move my
little ship back and forth and my
spacebar to shoot a laser beam out the
nose q q and I show you how to create
all this beauty I'm using my keyboard to
control okay hello there in this flash
cs3 and cs4 actionscript-3 tutorial I'll
show you how to program keyboard
functionality into your applications to
have the user keyboard become part of
the control interface and this is
especially handy for flash video game
controls photo galleries slideshows and
page flip applications and having them
use their keyboard to submit your flash
form so like traditional HTML forms if
the user fills out all the fields they
instinctively sometimes go to the enter
key on your keyboard to submit the form
and it works for them in HTML forms and
in your flash forms you can program that
in easily enough by listening and
capturing the keyboard input of the user
and when they fill out the form they put
their name email and message and they
press Enter it'll be it'll have the
it'll be equivalent of them hitting your
submit button there okay so what I'm
going to show you in this in this
demonstration is a simple video game
basics video game programming basics
just to show a demo of the capturing
keyboard input and so I'm going to in
flash cs3 professional I'm going to
click create new actionscript-3 file and
the first thing we'll have to understand
is how to capture the keyboard input of
the user
to make the keyboard part of the control
interface so we'll go in a flash help
you go up to help hit flash help and
right there in the field type in
keyboard event keyboard event and then
press search make sure you're searching
in actionscript 3 and not ActionScript
to and then you'll see the second result
under programming actionscript-3 they
have some examples for capturing the key
boot key boot capturing the keyboard
input and I'm going to take the first
little bit code they have their
highlighted press ctrl C and then close
out the help file window by clicking
outside of it and then you'll highlight
the frame the first keyframe there the
only key frame there press f9 and this
is how you add your code to your
application in the actions panel f9
opens your actions panel when you have a
keyframe highlighted and then you press
control V will add that code and now you
can see spread this out a little we have
a trace going here the trace is going to
show us what key the user is pressing on
the keyboard so ctrl enter will run will
run the will export the file or render
the file rather for tracing so you press
control enter and here's the file you
see it's blank but if I hit W on my
keyboard you can see we have output now
and the trace output says keypress w
character code equals not 119 if i press
the D key it shows keypress is D and
character code is 100 so you can see
we're effectively capturing the keyboard
input of the user that's what we want so
that simple demonstration shows us how
now we have a nice function set up and
I'm just going to move that bracket up
top because I'm old school and we can
remove this trace now now that we know
that we are capturing the the input and
we have a functional setup if you go
back into the help file and you might
want to read through all that and take
all those examples and play with them
but if you remove event there and just
type keyboard into the field and press
search you'll see down under
actionscript-3 language and components
reference the second result is keyboard
class and there is the list where you
can find all of the codes for every key
all the f keys on their keyboard the
home insert the left arrow key the right
arrow key anything you can want to
access on somebody's keyboard pretty
much and the popular controls for video
games or a to move side left d to move
side right and then spacebar to fire so
that's what i'll be showing you how to
do is access just those three controls
and you can expand and do whatever you
want after that whatever this is going
to be real basic and buggy probably but
so if we're going to do create a game a
simple video game as an example here
just to show you guys how to program a
video game we'll make this thing look a
little more like we want it will change
the background some black make the size
550 high and 550 wide press ok and the
frame rate will bring up to 24 just to
give it a smoother animation and let's
see now we need a ship so we'll build a
little spaceship and then we'll have the
spaceship move side to side using the a
and D Keys and shoot will have it fire
with the spacebar so here in fireworks I
create you can create a little spaceship
right here in flash
happen to create mine and fireworks and
there it is a little sinister red and
black ship and I'll press ctrl C and you
can be in Photoshop Illustrator whatever
adobe software that you want and press
ctrl C and then when you get into flash
press ctrl-v it'll put it right there on
stage and so I created a new layer let
me delete that layer and show you what I
did above the layer where we have that
code in the actions panel I pressed I
have that layer highlighted and I press
insert layer so i have a new layer above
it will call that the ship if you
double-click there you can rename that
layer and we'll drag it highlight and
drag it to the bottom so it's under the
the actionscript layer so we'll name
that one action script now on the ship
layer in our clipboard we have our
spaceship from fireworks and press ctrl
V and it will import it as a movie clip
and that's what we want let's give it an
instance name down here in the
properties inspector and call it the
ship so now we have an instance name on
it so we can refer to that object in the
code now and control it so let's bring
it down to the more down to the bottom
where the ship would be resting and we
can start doing some code inside of this
function now to have the ship do certain
things and I guess the first thing you
want to do in a video game is with the
ship is have your ship come into screen
come into view in a nice easing sort of
fashion with an elastic ease and sit and
it'll set in the spot where it's going
to where it's going to be going back and
forth and shooting from so to do that
we'll import a couple of transitions
will import
so you type import the open up your
actions panel again above that function
in port FL transitions and right there
it comes up so you can just double click
that and it puts it in dot tween and
semicolon and then the next one be
similar so we'll highlight all that
press ENTER paste it in and then this
one is going to be easing import the
easing and all so we'll type in the
asterisks now I to bring the ship in
like I was talking about in an easing
sort of way and i'll show you what i
mean in just a second will type in VAR
we're going to make a a tween right now
and the movement create the movement for
the ship upon entering the vial when
somebody enters the flash file they'll
see the ship tween into position which
is a cool effect then you'll see why in
a second I get done with this so you can
see what i'm typing in and they've been
new tween open parenthesis and put the
object here the ship the instance name
of the object and the position which is
the y position that it's going to move
the axis that it's going to move along
and then elastic is going to be the
between type
and ease out
and we'll put a comma and 550 is where
we're going to start it from 400 is
where it's going to end on the y-axis so
it starts on the y-axis at 550 the
animation will end at a Wyatt a y
position of 400 and then you type in the
duration and that's control speed and
such and then true and then close your
parentheses and semicolon now with this
now if I was to let see i think if i
press control enter look at that it's
pretty funky fresh huh see that again
let's press f12 render it in a browser
see so when they come into your game
your ship will fly in do a little bouncy
bounce and then set in place real nice
okay so that's step one and now to the
true nature of the tutorial we'll get
into making the ship move by using the
keyboard so let's see in our actions
panel I guess the first thing we'll need
to do is set a laser blasts movie clip
so let's just make a movie clip let's
create a user rectangle for it rectangle
primitive and this is going to be like a
laser beam laser shot so make it have no
Phil no stroke and whatever color you
want for your laser shot it looks good
to me
it looks about right okay and don't
worry about where it is because it's
going to go into the library anyway you
convert to symbol you right click it you
convert it to a symbol and you name it
whatever you want in the library will
just name it Laser laser shot and it's a
movie clip that's good press ok now
highlight it on stage and control x get
rid of it get it off a stage now it's in
the library here now we should have a
fireworks object which is the ship and
now our laser shot now you go into the
library right click laser shot movie
clip and go to properties now we're
going to export for action script and
we'll give it a name of just laser and
that'll be its its instance name we're
going to use that in the code as well
okay so yep that all looks good export
for action script export in first frame
okay it's going to say a definition for
this class can now be found in the
classpath so 11 will be automatically
generated in the swf upon export and
that's what we want so press ok ok now
we can set up a variable for that laser
blast that way we can use it when we
press the space bar we wanted the laser
to shoot out the nose of the ship so
we'll set up another variable here type
in bar laser blaster and that's the the
instance name will give it actually in
the code or that's how we refer to it
the code but we're using the laser name
here that's into the action script then
we exported for action script that
symbol in the library remember we named
it laser
and then we'll open parenthesis closed
parenthesis and semicolon now we have
our laser blaster movie clip is ready to
be used and we'll set some bars here for
some positions so let's just say bar i'm
going to set up or some variables ship
speed is colon this is a number and
we'll make it 15 now next bar is going
to be the left bounds so the ship cannot
go further than our left boundaries or
else it'll fly right off of the screen
the user keeps hitting the a button but
they hold down the a button your ship
would fly right off the screen if you
didn't set up this left bounds and this
will be let's say something around 50
and this is you know depending upon your
stage size and everything you can change
all these numbers and play with them see
what feels right what looks right this
one will call right bounds because this
will be the right boundaries so they
can't fly off the right of the screen
when they're pressing the holding the D
key to make this ship move right
and for 60 say for 60 that's good and
now we have to set up the Laser y
position and the laser exposition when
it gets shot now what happens is they
press when they're going to press the
space key to shoot the laser we're going
to pull it reference it from the library
put it on stage and shoot it out the
nose that's basically the logic that's
what what I'm going to show you how to
do okay so we'll type in VAR laser y
pose that's good for laser y position
this is also a number and we'll give it
a value of the ship's y position so
wherever the ship is no matter where it
is the laser will come out from the ship
and that's how you can make the this
variable dynamic and then we'll set up
the Laser x position as well because
we'll have to reference both positions
both axes to make it line up right when
we shoot out of the nose okay so this
will be this ship X dot X and semicolon
and that's it for the variables now we
can finally get to the fun stuff okay so
looks good now inside of the function
we're going to have whoops it's open
like that inside of the function that we
used from the example in the flash help
file is where we can put all of the the
logic for the code and the movement on
the ship when certain keys are pressed
on the keyboard so let's go ahead and do
that and remember i showed you in the
flash help file where the this list is
here you reference that list for any of
the keys that you want to program into
your application so now we're going to
type inside of that function some if and
else conditionals because with it
without these conditionals we wouldn't
be able to pull this off and the
conditionals make it to where we can
listen for if certain keys are pressed
so we'll say actually we have to set up
a variable before we can do that so
right above the function let's set up
one more variable no actually inside the
function will set the variable bar will
call it VAR ki char code key car code
like key character code so let's type in
key car code so key character code is
the variable name and it's you int which
is an integer
and it will equal the event which will
be the key press event was the key down
a bit and the char code you reference
that and that will tell you this will
put whichever key is pressed it'll put
that number code into this value here or
this variable here and then we can
access its value right here where we're
going to set up our conditionals so we
type in if put open close parenthesis
and set up the opening bracket and then
go two lines down and put the closing
bracket now you have an if statement set
up and inside of the condition for it
we're going to listen to the key card
code so we can just grab that double
click it press ctrl-c ctrl-v paste it
right there I'm going to say if the key
card code the key to our code equals 97
now 97 is let's just make ourselves a
little note here say 97 is the key code
for the a key on the keyboard so now let
me know that we can use it so if the key
car coat equals 97 when they press the
keys any key we will make the ship do
something now so we'll say the ship dot
X
plus equals and we'll say minus ship
speed we'll use our ship speed variable
remember that was 15 and what this will
do is make the ship move to the left
this little bit of mathematics here and
make the ship move to the left when they
press the a key and let's go ahead and
test it out now so if we press ctrl or
f12 make sure we'll check for errors too
because I might have ever in my code and
it looks like it Bob's in some place
like it should and there it is I'm
tapping the a key let's see if i refresh
and yep I can just hold it down I don't
have to tap it so it hold the a key down
and ship flies to the side that's what
we wanted and we it's not respecting our
bounds so we're going to have to set up
another conditional inside of this one
so we'll say if the key card code is 97
will have it move but not if it's too
far to the left so we're going to use
another conditional here if
let's move this down
now we have another conditional setup or
an if statement set up we'll put a
condition in say if the ship dot X ships
exposition is greater than our left
bounds when we set our left bounds
variable laptop we gave it a number if
the ship's exposition is greater than
the left bounce then we'll move it to
the left if not we don't want to move
into the left or it'll fly off the
screen let's move these in a little okay
so now we have an if statement inside of
an if statement that's laying out the
logic we need so let's press f12 and
you'll see that now when i move my ship
if i hold down a pep hit a boundary it
doesn't fly off the screen and that's
exactly what we want now let's control
program in the D the deep button to make
it move to the other way and it's pretty
easy to do this once we have this set up
already we can just say grab this whole
both of these if statements here
highlight them they're opening and
closing tags and press ctrl C and then
you just go down a couple lines and
paste it in again now you change this to
say if key card if ki char code equals
100 because 100 is the the we'll just
say that 100 here is the key to our code
for D key on the keyboard and so we have
to change this as well to go the
opposite direction so we'll say if ship
dot X is less than right bounds
change this to write bounds which those
variables are right up here remember we
created them so if the ship's exposition
is less than 460 then it could move to
the right if not we won't let it move to
the right and we have to change this to
a plus sign to make it move right and i
think that's it if i was to press to
render out by pressing or export the
file i'll publish the file by pressing
f12 now minimize that let's refresh now
the ship flies in lands in place and if
I move a hold little achey it moves all
the way to the boundary to the left I'll
hold the D key it moves to the boundary
on the right up you can see it flies off
of the stage and it loses part of its
wing there so we got to adjust the value
of the boundary so let's go into flash
into the actions panel again hit f9 open
that actions panel get to the code let's
change this 462 for 40 or something like
that then render out and you'll see that
it should adjust to where it won't fly
off the screen now see now it has a
better boundary so it's staying within a
certain place now all we have to do is
make it shoot when we press the space
key or the spacebar and that'll show you
video game programming basics and
capturing keyboard input to tutorials in
one can't beat that huh okay so that's
fire
now last thing to do is program in the
laser shot so we can stage we're still
inside the dysfunction the the report
key down function move down a couple
more lines and then oops let's open that
back up paper and move down a couple of
more lines and now we're going to type
in another conditional so let's just
take this conditional here press ctrl-c
go down paste it in now we're going to
let's remove this inner conditional we
don't need it now if key if key car code
I know I keep saying kee khara code but
that's how you pronounce that character
for short if the key card code equals 32
and right right here a little note for
ourselves 32 is the key code for the
spacebar on the user's keyboard and now
we'll put in the code that we need will
take the variable will make a variable a
new movie clip rather will call it laser
shot colon movie clip and equals new
movie clip
semicolon now we have a variable name
for our new movie clip the reason why we
create a new movie clip here is because
we're going to drag it out of the
library or not drag it but we're going
to reference it from the library add it
to the stage inside of this movie clip
that little laser shot we made in the
beginning and now next line is press
ENTER now we type in laser shot dot add
child and this puts it into the movie
clip our laser blaster which is the
reference name for a little movie clip
in the library okay so now we have added
laser blaster to the laser shot movie
clip that we just created there and now
will add child to stage to actually show
it on stage add laser shot the movie
clip containing the movie clip in our
library so basically we take we created
a movie clip we take the movie clip from
our library place it in it and then we
add the new movie clip the stage and now
we're going to position it correctly so
laser shot dot X we got to put it the
right x position equals the ship's X so
we put the ship X we wanted to come out
of the nose of the ship we might have to
do some mathematical adjustments to make
that happen and we're going to use
another tween here we're going to create
another twin so we type bar my tween and
this tween is for the laser actually
shooting of the screen at your space
invaders or whatever little creatures
you want to make in your game
new tween open parenthesis and this is
for laser shot movie clip on stage this
will be on the y-axis Tama now this will
be a nun because we don't want it to be
elastic and live it ease in and laser y
position it's going to be the starting
point and the ending point will be
negative 50 so to fly up and off the
screen and the duration of one so it
doesn't go too fast and change that
number 12 different number you'll you'll
see or if you change that make that
number higher you'll see the laser shot
go slower you play with that number
change the speed of the laser shot I
think that's it that's I think that's it
so now if we shoot press the spacebar
this thing should shoot for press f12
there it is an Internet Explorer I'm
going back and forth with my a and D
Keys and if i press space there's a
laser shot as you can see the
mathematics are way off so we have to
manipulate that to where the laser comes
out the nose let's do that make the
laser come out of the nose of the ship
by changing few of these numbers the
laser shot that exposition is going to
be let's add plus 22 that let's see what
happens let's render out now let's shoot
it
okay we're getting closer to the middle
let's make that plus 50 rite throughout
f12 press space boo I almost got the
center maybe 48 now we have to change
the laser y position so we go up here
laser y position minus probably about a
hundred now let's run throughout now
let's shoot all I'm getting close it's
almost coming out of the nose and you
can see wherever I move my ship it stays
with the ship the laser shot and all you
got to do is detect collision for any
little space invaders you got coming
down here and you got yourself an ISO
game now it's really buggy you would
have to do a lot more programming but
let's get that laser shot right so I can
make it look good here minus 120 and
this will be 46 let's see how this looks
now but this is that's pretty much it
that's the end of my example here and
that shows you there it is now you can
see the laser shot coming out and we got
to make it come a little bit higher so
let's make this 150 now it should be
right about right about coming out of
the nose that laser shot there it is pew
pew pew don't don't build up
dies come die alien skin but yeah that's
how it works capturing keyboard input
it's a fun thing to use on your flash
applications because you can just cuz
you can okay see you guys next lesson
I'll have these source files available
for download like always and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
