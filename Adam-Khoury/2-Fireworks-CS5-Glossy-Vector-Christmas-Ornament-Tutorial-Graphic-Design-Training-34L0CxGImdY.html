all by good bread so Kate the last one
we showed you how to make this satin
type Christmas ornament that had gold
Fleck design on it and now you can learn
how to make this much more glossy type
surface on your Christmas ornaments and
you'll have a much more realistic
looking top see the top and a little
loop it's much more realistic than that
one
you really don't see anyway the big ring
circle like that it's more like that
okay let's go I'm going to continue with
the assets that we left off with in the
first vector Christmas ornament tutorial
we made where we showed how to make this
red satin type Christmas ornament with
gold Fleck on it
so if you don't have these assets in
front of you you might want to go check
out video number one so you can get to
this point right now or at least to the
point where we have because I'm going to
remove the design on that and we're
going to show you how to make this a
very glossy bulb now or a very glossy
ornament that would have a lot more
shine to it and it's not really going to
take much doctoring at all to get it to
that point and we're going to turn it
blue and we're going to put snow all
over it and we're going to have a little
Christmas tree on it okay first things
first let's make this blue you can
choose any Q of blue that you like I'm
going to choose that one right there and
on that opposite edge I'm going to give
it very very dark shade of that blue now
I'm going to send that to the back
control shift down arrow key that sends
it to the back now this thing we just
want to make it white and this time
we're not going to forget our light
source pretend this is your light source
let's make it a solid white like a light
bulb and that's the direction that the
light would be coming from something
like that and we'll leave it there that
way we can always keep in mind that that
is the direction that our lights going
to be hitting from so let's change this
interval to that direction and
everything else is correct on the ring
the inner bevel was in the wrong
direction when we last left off in the
video number one that we made with the
Christmas ornament and it was really no
big deal and I made a note about it in
the video
and some people even beefed about it to
me on YouTube they putting like petty
comments about it even when I recognized
it and I discussed it in the video it's
whack means weak weak and whacks are
that is waxers wack and weak and gay now
let's resize this one and make it a
little bit smaller we're gonna make it
white so it looks more like a silver
this thing we're gonna make it a little
wider and instead of having the the gold
with the satin we're gonna have white
with grey and we're gonna choose bars
instead as our gradient and then what
we'll do is we'll add just a couple of
points in here like this this one we can
turn white and then we'll take this and
just move it over right about there
something like that and then we'll make
sure this is in the center so let's just
move this out of the way grab this make
sure it's in the center and bring it up
to where it sits right on top of your
bulb right there and then make sure you
little hook or your little circle right
there is in a good spot
put your bright light back right there
now zoom back out using control mouse
wheel and now you can see that you have
a much different style of the top
component that hooks to some kind of
chain or a hook or whatever now we want
to grab all of our little yellow dots
that we had before make sure we only
have those dots selected so when we move
them down right now
our shine doesn't move with them just
move them down put them into place and
and turn them white so let's select all
of those
and then we can deselect that star and
that star and then we'll have all of
those little guys selected turn them
white so it looks like a silver chain
now okay so now you have a silver chain
blue bulb but yet the bulb is still
satin it's not glossy and doesn't have
like almost reflective qualities to it
and that's what we're going to do now
all right so first grab your pen tool
and on the side over here somewhere
right about there just click down let go
and then come to maybe right about here
and click down and hold this time and
drag then you make a curve that kind of
contours with the outside of your circle
here you see and then let go once you
have that curve that you like it kind of
contours with this but not the exact
same contour you want it to be a smaller
contour then click down here on this dot
or that point to make a sharp corner
point and then click down here and hold
and drag in and you make like a little
sideways smiley face type looking shape
and then go to solid make it white then
I'm going to go to filters and I'm going
to give it a blur of Gaussian blur that
looks good to me
and then I'm going to bait it down just
a little bit right there looks good and
I can take that exact shape control-c
control-v make a copy flip it
horizontally drag it over to this side
somewhat on the top a little bit and
then hit the bit scale tool to where we
have the rotation selector handy and
just rotate it to where it would meet up
with that contour of the circle but on
the other edge bring it in just a little
bring this one out just a little and
we're going to fade this one down a
little more so it's not so as dominant
as this gloss effect now we're going to
take a ellipse draw it out right there
in the very center of that shiny part
and then we're going to rotate it just a
little bit like that and then we're
going to go and give that a blur of
gaussian blur as well okay and there you
go now you have more of a glassy look a
much more glassy look to your ornament
now you can put your design on it okay
for this design we're gonna grab the
pencil I'm just gonna make sure it's
white so I'm just gonna go through here
and click in dots everywhere make it
look like this snow all over okay so
once you have all your dots on there
you'll notice that you can then take the
opacity down on it if you like and you
can also do things like give it a Auto
vector mask where is that creative Auto
vector mask and what that does is that
will allow you to give it a gradient
like a linear gradient and if I apply
that you'll see what happens so all I
have to do is really move this and what
that'll do is fade them out as they go
away from the light you see what that
does so as the light is hitting it you
could do something like that to where
only the ones in the light would be
really shining so we'll do something
like that and that'll help us keep a
realism to our lighting effects okay
what should we put on a let's do
something nice let's grab the pen tool
and we'll do a Christmas tree how about
that that's very pretty and nice we'll
start right in the center right about
here somewhere
and just eyeball the center click down
and let go and then come right down to
about here click down hold and give it a
curve and click down on that point to
make a sharp corner point then you're
going to come in just a little bit let
me zoom in a little by holding ctrl and
mouse wheeling you're going to come in
just a little bit click down right here
and give this a downward curve like that
then click down right there make a sharp
corner point and down to about here
do the same thing hold down click and
hold down and curve and let go and then
click this point to make a sharp corner
point then do the same thing with
another layer down here click down hold
and make a small curve in there now
click down on this point to make a sharp
corner point and add another layer same
thing as you go down just layer it click
down here let go and then
make the last little layer on the bottom
and then you can keep going down maybe
right about there now on this bottom
part you want to click right here and
let go and then you want to get to about
the center right about there looks like
the sensor to me I'm going to click hold
down and curve it to match the contour
of my little circle by a ornament the
main sphere the mainly lips for my
ornament match that contour click down
let go and then click up here at that
top point and everything will connect
then go to the subselection tool hit
this point on the bottom or the one on
the top and just make sure it's even
make sure you have an even line so you
go to 100% and you'll be able to see if
it's uneven because the line will kind
of discombobulated alright now let's
just give that a white fill take the
edge off of it if you have a white edge
press ctrl-c ctrl-v flip it horizontal
then the copy that you just put on and
if it's coming on if it's coming off the
bottom you can easily just move it up
right there that's perfect now let's
select this and this go to multiply
combine paths and union those to make it
one piece but don't move it leave it
right where it was now we're going to
highlight it make sure we're on the
regular pointer selection tool and not
the subselection tool right here and go
down to grain make sure it's on grain
I'm just going to go a hundred percent
on the grain and make it transparent and
I'm gonna put a little bit more snow on
the bottom
remember how we put in those little snow
dots and we'll do the same thing but
this time I'm gonna have a little bit
more snow on my bottom around the tree
yeah that looks a lot better with the
more snow down there by the tree so what
I'll do is I'm gonna grab the tree just
that tree symbol actually if you want to
go into your layers you can get it
things more easily you can grab the at
the top I've got the bitmap which is
little pencil markings a little snow and
then the path right there is the tree so
let's select the bitmap and then go on
the screen into the stage of the canvas
and hold shift and select the tree as
well so now I have the tree
the snow selected so I'm going to group
those ctrl-g now it's one item see if I
moved it you see what it looks like the
don't move it leave it right where it
was
I press ctrl-z I put it back now I'm
going to go up to commands creative give
an auto vector mask
just a slight linear Auto vector mask
apply that and I'm going to make sure
that it goes around the other direction
and you can see what this does is it'll
help you make some more realism to your
light source with the objects that are
on the globe or on the ornament so you
can see as I bring it down they start to
appear and you can make it fade a little
bit as it goes to that side it'll add
just a little bit more realism to your
bulb or your design and you know what
you can highlight it and press ctrl-c
ctrl-v to make it brighter if that's not
bright enough for you and it'll still
hold its gradiated alpha qualities okay
so that's how you can set up a more
glossy type ornament that has a
different kind of top a more realistic
sort of top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
