to create web site layouts very easily
using the css3 flexbox model flex box
layouts are optimized for user interface
design and two-dimensional layouts of
any scale before we begin coding let's
take a look at the finished product our
layout uses all new html5 elements so we
have the header element we have a nav
element we have the main element we have
an aside element and then the footer
element so that way all of the content
on your page will be marked up in a nice
semantic sort of way so you can see it's
got a nice stretchy fit and it's also
easy to build okay so get yourself a new
example dot HTML file ready and we'll
start with the HTML since it's so simple
we're just going to add it all at once
you can see we've placed a div element
and then it has five children inside of
it the header element the nav element
the main element a side element and the
footer element now these are all called
flex items this div that is their parent
is the Flex box the Flex container and
we're going to make that so in the CSS
if we take a look at this right now
we'll just have a bunch of words on the
page and they're in boxes but their
boxes aren't styled at all so in the
style element the first thing we're
going to do is target the body element
to make its margin zero pixels that way
that little margin spaces and all the
way around the page then the next line
we're going to put body child
development which targets that child
development inside of the body which is
this and that's going to become our Flex
container or our flex box so we'll do
that by setting the display property to
a newly added setting for the display
property which is flex and that's all
you have to do to designate that that
container is a flex box we're also going
to add the Flex row property with the
values of Rho and wrap so the direction
that all of the elements all of the Flex
items will be flowing inside of the Flex
container will be in the
style which is on the horizontal plane
and we we specify rap just so that
elements will wrap under one another if
there's not enough space in the Flex box
now at this point you don't have to
worry about the details about these too
much because I'm going to lead you guys
to pages that I've written already and
these pages are not yet published to
develop PHP calm but they are there and
I'm going to give you guys the links in
the description of this video so if you
want all the links to learn about all of
these properties in depth a little bit
more you can just click the links in the
description of the video to find them
all and pretty soon I'm going to publish
these documents to develop PHP com
so that's just if you want to really
wrap your head around the whole flexbox
model and see all of the properties that
are involved with it and it'll make you
a lot more creative if you have a more
full understanding so I'm not going to
go too deep in depth with explaining
these Flex properties because I've
written a bunch of pages already that go
in-depth describing them does that make
sense you can just read those pages I've
documented it all at develop PHP you can
click the links in the description of
video okay this next style rule is just
going to be some basic cosmetics for all
of the elements within this Flex
container so you can see we're targeting
body child div child header nav mane
aside and footer targeting all of those
with CSS we're giving them these
properties that way they have that
little gray background they have a
little border radius a little bit of
margin space in between them and then
some padding inside of them now let's
single out the header with its own
little rule here now the first thing
we're going to do is set the order
that's order of appearance within the
Flex container we'll set that to one and
order is a flexbox related property then
we'll set the height this is just a
normal height setting 100 pixels and
that's just for the header and then
we're going to set the Flex shorthand
property to zero space one space then
100% and the 100% specifies the width
of the header and you can investigate
the Flex property at my site to
determine what all of these values stand
for now since the header is set to flex
let's take a look at what we have all
right things are starting to shape up
okay next we're going to target the nav
element this one here and do a very
similar thing to it we're going to give
it an order of two and we're going to
set its Flex to make it 200 pixels wide
let's take a look at that now you see
the navigation element is down here and
it's 200 pixels wide very good now let's
do the same thing to the main element
we're going to give it an order of three
then we're going to set its minimum
height to 400 pixels just so you can see
that it has a height while it has no
content in it right now it's not going
to have a very tall height so I just set
this property here this is not a very
necessary property I just said that so
it has some height to it so it gives you
the appearance of the layout but when
you start putting real content in this
main element then that's going to be
what determines the height and we set
its flex to simply 1 or that might be
able to be Auto but one seems to do the
trick
now let's target the aside element which
is the one that kind of represents an ad
space or something like that
this one we're going to give order 4 and
I'm going to change the orders in a
minute so you guys can see what that's
all about and we don't have to set a
width because the width is actually set
in the Flex property right here so we
know it's going to be 200 so let's take
a look now things are really starting to
shape up nice we have our header
navigation and our side element and the
main content stretches the main section
or the main element stretches to
accommodate any screen width now all we
have to do is get the footer in place
just right we're going to give that
order of 5 let's make its height 100
just like the header and then we're
going to set its Flex to 100% as well
just like the header that way it spans
across the whole screen let's take a
look at what we have
here let me put this on maybe 250 there
we go so no matter how much content gets
put into this main section your nav and
your aside columns those are going to
stretch along with the main section
automatically which is a nice feature
now you can get really creative this is
just one type of layout that's a very
standard layout but you can get really
creative with the way your flexbox
elements are stacked in there and the
way they size and things like that okay
so just so you know these links right
here are going to be under this video
you can just go right under the video
into the description area and click on
these links to investigate the Flex
Direction flexwrap flex row order flex
flex Gro flex rink flex basis justify
content align items align self and align
content CSS properties those are all
related to the Flex box model so once
you click these links and go and
research these things you'll be way
better equipped to make awesome layouts
and user interfaces I just want to add
real quick that some of you guys might
mention that you'll see the aside
element goes down you see see how some
of the elements rearrange themselves
when it gets too small the screen gets
too small so all you have to do is set a
minimum width on the Flex box itself so
if I go in and I put min width 800
pixels that means the Flex box won't get
any smaller than 800 pixels you see it
stops at 800 that way you can avoid that
issue remember any element can have a
minimum width the minimum height maximum
width and maximum height so play with
those two okay here's another few last
minute tips
you might have other divs in your
document that you don't want to be flex
boxes the way we have this set up it's
going to target all divs in the body
element so what you could do is put div
colon
mm child and then just put a one there
now let's see if that targeted
everything yeah so we can just go ahead
and replace every where it says div here
with the that way you're only targeting
this specific div and if you happen to
have another div above this div you can
target this div by saying in child 2 so
you can target that div no matter where
it lives in the body element by using
child and whatever number wherever it is
so we'll just put a once in since the
first and I also said that I would show
you how the order works first let's take
a look at it before I change the order
of things so you have a navigation over
here and aside over here I'm going to
swap those two put the aside over here
and the nav over here just by changing
the order so let's go to the nav and
make that 4 and make the aside too isn't
that awesome
now the aside element is over here and
the nav element is over here that's a
really cool feature
okay so I'll leave the order like it is
and that's it okay so I hope you guys
have fun creating your own unique
creative flexbox layouts I'll see you in
the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
