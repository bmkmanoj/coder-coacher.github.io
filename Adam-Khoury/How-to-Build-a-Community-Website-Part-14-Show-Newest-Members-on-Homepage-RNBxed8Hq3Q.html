community website using PHP and MySQL
and in this part we're going to see in
part 12 we displayed member lists
temporarily for viewing and there it is
in the home page right there and so what
we're gonna do now is set a table in
here to have to show the four newest
members or maybe six would fit in there
maybe five will do the five newest
members that join the site so if you
were to join the site today or whenever
you would be in that list right when you
joined when you go to the home page you
would see yourself there so that's what
we'll show you how to do and let's go
ahead and open Dreamweaver cs4 and close
that out and here we are in our root
directory of the source files of our
website and we're gonna open index so
let's go to open index so we open the
index page and here in the index page we
have the query I'm gonna shoot that bird
I swear to God
Jesus okay so we put it in the
mechanisms or the script to show all
those members we just listed out all the
members just for an example and so we're
going to change this script up just a
little bit to make it display just the
four or five newest members that we want
that joined our database so we'll keep
this connect so that's what we're gonna
do right now I'm just gonna rewrite this
script really quick and it's really easy
let's get that space out of there
and connect the database will remain and
what we're gonna do is change up this
select query so we'll select ID their ID
and the members first name and their
last name too and I think that's all I
need to give a display and a link to
their profile so from my members and you
can select all of them like that but
what we'll do here is make sure they're
activated in the database like we did in
the activation script where email
activated underscore activated equals
one
and single quotes there it's one and
then we're going to order make sure we
order this query or the results set that
comes from the query all the results
that come from this query are gonna be
ordered by the ID field member ID field
descending that way it shows all of the
newest members to oldest if you put a SC
ascending it would show oldest members
to newest but we're gonna do it
descending and we're going to limit this
query to four that way we don't run a
huge hogging power hogging query on our
database when we only want four or five
people let's change this to five make
that limit five and that's what the new
query is gonna look like okay so we
don't need to get the number of rows we
can get rid of that and
don't need this get rid of that we need
the while and yep
that line is correct so this will run a
while loop over the result set those
those five newest members and then you
can loop the data display or you can
display the data within the loop and
I'll show you that right now so let me
just see we're gonna use that mechanism
to show the pic make the pics maybe
eighty and we want to get ID still first
name and last name it's all great this
is all pretty much set up the way we
needed almost so what I'm gonna do now
since I want a certain type of display
within a certain type of container I'm
gonna go into my HTML section here into
the design view or you can hard-coded in
the code view and I'm gonna do something
that makes the CSS guys mad right here
I'm going to put the table and you can
easily use divs for your containers and
don't yell at me for using tables just
go ahead and do it the right way by
using divs okay
so here we go columns four no five one
row 100% perfect okay
actually no we won't make it any percent
okay and then we'll Center it we have
that table centered now down in the
aligned properties and we can go into
the code view okay so now we have a
table sitting there that we can use for
our display and this is how you can
dynamically render the table with the
result sets in it it's me
right under the SQL array for the SQL
query we're gonna put
let's see red no member display
that's true if that's what I remember
displaylist
we'll just name it that same thing
remember display list equals and that'll
just kind of initialize the variable
that's a way of initializing a variable
and or you can set it as a string or
number variable but we're just going to
initialize it like that so a member
display list is going to be the top set
of that little table we added in so
let's add this table and the table row
tag so we can exit out of there we're
gonna come back to it in a second and
we're gonna pop it right in here
actually let's use single quotes for
this one single quote another single
quote and in between them pop that table
in right there the table beginning tag
and the first table row tag now we're
going to take this number display press
see when you highlight all of it and
let's go down to outside the while loop
right here and add a dot to compound the
variable so this will allow for this to
be displayed in a variable then all the
table columns from the while loops
result display and then we close off the
table so we're gonna need the closing
tag and the table row control X so we
have the table closing table row tag and
the closing table tag let's pop that in
where it needs to go here okay now all
we need is one of these td's take one of
these TD sets
control X get rid of all those other
ones we don't need it
and right here remember display list
equals put that right there in the TD
actually it's already set up nice what
we got to do is wrap the TD around it so
let's just pop it right there get rid of
that NS BP because that's just a space
till X put that first one right here and
then the closing table column tag can go
right at the end
now we can simply get rid of the break
tag here before the table rope or table
column closes get rid of that we have a
link to the members profile already set
using their ID from the database it's
what we want for each guy so for each
person in the database right here this
table column they each get a table
column printed to the table and you can
see outside of the loop is where we
start table tags and the table row and
we close the table row in the table tag
table tag after the while loop closes so
only thing that's inside the while loop
that would render out many times other
table columns you make a column for each
person in the display list here which
there will be five so that's pretty much
what I've done there and make sure we
have a break after the user pick
let's put a br tag right there by
pressing I think it's ctrl shift
nope it's shift enter shift enter
automatically in Dreamweaver will put a
break tag for you now let's see we have
the picture break tag under the picture
will be their name let's see if this
works so all we have to do is take the
member display list here and print it
out in the HTML section you can take
this member display this variable that
naming and we're going to print it out
here where we had that table so let's go
opening tag question mark PHP some
spaces close off the PHP tag and in the
center we can put remember display list
before we do that let's type in print or
echo the member display list in between
double quotes that should work now that
should put a table a dynamic table on
our home page with pictures of our
members that are 80 pixels and the name
will be under it the name will be a link
to see that person's profile and this is
mechanism is for showing the newest five
members to join your site at all times
it's always dynamic dynamic and up to
date you don't have to touch it so let's
go ahead and reconnect yeah
put up the index page see if we have any
error or in our code let's go to refresh
and there we have it that's beautiful
now what you could do let's make this
table with or give it a spacing
cellpadding grab that cell padding from
that table there and just pop it in the
dynamic table up here any attributes you
want and values go to index mmm and this
will put a little space between
everybody and these source files will be
available so you see how easy that is
and if you wanted to make sure if
somebody puts maybe a tall picture in
and you don't want it to you know in all
the names to be in a straight line there
you would just put him in a div I'll
show you how to do that real quick
each TD gets a div inside of it so you
can say let's just put it down here so
in the HTML anywhere so we can set up
the daviesi
and get the code hints div style go down
to where it says style go to down to
where it says width
I'm sorry height
not with height 100 px
semicolon
and close the div tag now we can grab
that and just get it out of there
control X and we're going to use it up
in our dynamics section here so right
here inside the TD we put a div start
the div and right after the pick we can
put the closing div tag right where that
BR is just put a slash div and that will
close it up now let's see what that does
that should
give us a different rendering for that
person with a tall picture it's
hopefully I might have messed it up but
we'll see yep that's not right
let's grab that div again
I mean this is a very necessary but some
of you guys might want to line
everything up right even if your members
pictures are wacky so let's say height
100 pixels when it should have been 80
right 80 and let's make the
overflow:hidden that might help
overflow:hidden put a semicolon and now
what am i doing
you gotta get that up where it belongs
Long's up here in the dynamic query
section or the dynamic while loop and
that's the user pick inside of the div
and that's all that's in there that's
what we want it's FTP that index page
back up after we press ctrl s to save it
in Dreamweaver and let's take a look
there we have it so you can see you can
successfully make everything line up
right
you can even Center the names in there
by putting Center div tags or just
regular Center tags so these these files
will be updated to show part 14 here and
the source package will have the
additions that I've placed into the home
page and you can see that the big list
is still coming out of our footer so
let's go to file open footer for the
template let's get rid of that member
display list there we don't need it
let's put that back up okay so I'll
update the package and you guys can get
at what we've done here or you can just
straight code it by watching the video
it's pretty easy what I did so let's go
ahead and refresh that make sure it's
gone from the footer yes it is and it's
right where we want it click that person
and there are it goes it's beautiful
okay
and in the next lesson part 15 and we
only have a few parts left in part 15
we're going to show you how to build a
member page the member display page an
official member display page and maybe a
search mechanism in there so you can
search through or they can pick what
type of members they want to see and
things like that but we'll definitely
make an official member display page and
then one application to show you how to
let your users interact your members
interact with one another in some form
we'll make some kind of application that
lets your members interact with one
another like a social network should
okay we'll see you in part 15</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
