fireworks and do some work inside of it
and i figured i would record it you
might be able to find some handy tips
innate in the workflow that i do here
and what I'm going to do is go to a
website and at that website I'm going to
take their logo and then I'm going to
make a banner out of the logo because I
want to represent and help promote them
on my website and so to do that you just
go to google and I'm in fireworks cs3
but you can be in cs4 or fireworks 8 it
doesn't matter that it'll all be the
same you go to google and I'm going to
cam studio because i'm going to promote
them on a page on my site let people
know about it so i click camstudio there
and there's the website so i press print
screen
and now I'm going to go into fireworks
and we're going to go to New create new
press ok it'll have the dimensions of
your print screen already in there and
print screen is a keyboard key above
insert and delete on your keyboard there
it's right above insert and it should be
next to the F the row of F is there on
the top is the little button called PRT
scn sysrq that's your print screen
button and you hit that one too you can
record anything on your monitor on your
computer screen or you can capture that
in an image if you press print screen
and you press ok
and there it is and I have dual monitor
setup so you're going to see like two
monitors their go into a hundred percent
and that's what I want to get right
there so I'm going to take the marquee
tool the rectangle marquee and I'm going
to make a little rectangle and there it
is and once I make the shape that I want
to press ctrl-c to copy what's in the
marquee and I I usually just press the
text tool to get out of marque and then
hit the pointer tool laptop and then
press ctrl V and paste it in place right
there and then you hit the background
this the captured screen and then you
press X and then you fit canvas you
click outside of this little rectangle
here click outside of it and press fit
canvas at the bottom and there it is so
now you have a banner and you can take
that and give it a
an inner glow go down to shadow and glow
press ENTER globe and you can make it
really
no that's not what I wanted to do I want
to make a tight line there we go and
that's it now i have my banner ready
then i can file save as uh where are we
working now
develop PHP images actually i'ma save it
as a PNG in my imagery folder as
camstudio banner now I'm going to take
it place it on my site and make it an
image link to link to camp studios
website so people can go and get the
free screen capture recording software
press save that's it we'll see you next
