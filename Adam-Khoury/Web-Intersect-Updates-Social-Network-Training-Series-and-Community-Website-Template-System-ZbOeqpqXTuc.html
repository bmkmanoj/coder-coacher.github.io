because there's a few people that
expressed anxiety to me in wanting to
know what exactly I have planned for web
inertia calm what's coming up what
changes on making to it what tutorials
I'm adding to it things of that nature
that's what this video is going to be
all about so if you're interested in
that sort of thing stick around many of
you guys already know what web intersect
is and what it's all about some of you
guys might not so it's a social network
production training series using PHP and
MySQL databases so basically it's a
training series that shows people how to
make the foundations and the bare bones
of a social networking website and so
you can kind of see through this list of
one through five things here what I'm
going to do but I'm going to go through
each one of those things and elaborate a
little bit on what I plan to do the
first thing is I'm going to go in and
replace the flash header within all HTML
header this is something that I promised
people like last year when I put the web
intersex series out and a lot of people
requested that maybe we can put a flash
header into it this way it wouldn't have
any proprietary software in it or for
people who don't really know how to use
flash or work with actionscript 3 so if
we make it an all HTML header where i'm
going to have it to where you log in and
kind of like you log in at youtube where
the sign-in form is on a different page
all that's on the pages of the site is
your name on top to get to your account
stuff things like that on the top right
so we're going to go with that kind of
format and develop PHP has a similar
thing when you log in to develop PHP
it's a separate page as a form on a
separate page the form to login is not
directly in the header that's the format
we're going to go with because YouTube
does it that way I think Facebook does
it that way and you know we're going to
kind of stick to what all the big boys
is doing in our training series here so
the header won't have any proprietary
software at work in
it because flash is not open source and
I'm going to present what I did in
replacing the flash header with HTML in
tutorial form so everybody understands
exactly what I did then at that point we
can kind of close the doors on the 30
part series and then continue on with
round two of web intersect and what
that's going to do is well let's just go
into number two here adding the jQuery
library to the system to give
contributors the use of the library in
their production so what that means is
when somebody wants to add to the web
intersect software and teach people how
to do things for social networking
they'll have the jQuery library already
available in the head tag of all of the
site pages so they'll be able to use all
of the functionality that the jQuery
library gives us while producing things
and tutorials for the web intersect
training series okay number three is
we're applying the GNU GPL open source
software license to the website template
software and keep credit to the creator
and the people who contribute to it and
I spelled the contributors wrong there
let me fix that contributors and it
persuades other programmers to share
more openly while adding to the system
so future users have a better system
being under the GNU GPL open source
software a license this means that
people can add to it modify it
redistribute it as long as they keep the
the copyright and the headings of all of
the scripts in place within all the
scripts and I'm going to discuss how all
of that is going to go down and how to
add yourself as a contributor when you
make software for web intersect and for
which we already touched on a whole
bunch is opening the software to
contributors other programmers so it
won't be just me in there throwing in
applications I'm going to get this baby
to where it doesn't have a flash header
so where is no proprietary software in
it and everybody understands HTML or
anybody who knows anything about
websites understands HTML to a certain
degree not everybody wants to mess
flash 12 no flash or use flash in their
website so while making this an open
source software putting it under the gnu
GPL open source software license I don't
want to have a flash header in it and so
when we open it to contributors they'll
be able to add tutorial contributions to
the official download packages so what
that means is like somebody can take
this under the gnu GPL license and
modify and redistribute it anywhere they
want but for it to be included into the
official web intersect download packages
at web intersect your your contribution
to the system has to be in tutorial form
so that's what i'll be looking for is
people like that of that caliber to come
in and make video tutorials or really
good clean text-based tutorials on how
to add maybe from private messaging
systems friends systems all kinds of
different applications that can go into
a social networking website so the
people who are contributing to the
official download packages at web
intersect com must do it in tutorial
form whether it be video or a nice clean
text tutorial showing people how to add
and apply what you added to the system
so they can add it to their systems that
might be already in place or if they're
newcomers to the web insects series they
won't have any trouble placing your
application into the system when I work
when i'm going to add things to it i'm
not going to i'm going to make sure
there's no problems that's why i have a
whole huge 30 part series going real
in-depth about everything I was doing
along the way create the backbone of the
system so when I add anything to it here
in the future in time to come I'm going
to be doing it in tutorial form so
that's number four and finally number
five is i will be adding to the further
functionality of the system myself i
might not get to these things as quickly
as other people can get to them creative
and add it to the system if i see it's
not there yet i have the time to put
like a private messaging system in or
french system into web intersect that's
what I'll do
I'll do it all in tutorial form so
that's number five so that's everything
I have planned and i hope that soothes
your anxiety if you're somebody who was
wondering what the hell i have going on
a web intersect and this is coming up
i'm going to start tonight i think i'm
going to start with the HTML header
start with number one there and then
we're just going to once the flash
header is out of the mix the gnu GPL
will be applied to it and then there
won't be any proprietary software within
it will all be MySQL PHP HTML CSS and
jquery which is all JavaScript all five
of those are not proprietary in their
open source we're going to kick some ass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
