flash cs3 professional and we're going
to click a new ActionScript 3 project
and inside of the project we're going to
rename the first layer entire form and
then we're going to create our
background for the form bring out a
rectangle primitive and size it up to
about the size we want our form to be
and then give the background a gradient
and transform the gradient here and grab
the little corner a little circle there
transform the gradient around and then
grab the color and move them swap them
to where the blacks on the bottom and
then make like a light gray now
we're gonna right click that and convert
that to a symbol which we're going to
name entire form and I do this so I can
easily pop this into the other
applications and it's a movie clip
symbol and no need to give it an
instance name but what you can do now is
pop this entire movie clip from the
library into other applications and
we'll double click inside of it and now
create the form when this first layer
will name background fit in our window
correctly we're going to make sure it's
dark enough to see on a white background
12-point I can get it to 12 I do okay
12-point single line
and we'll give it an interesting name of
name underscore txt and we'll highlight
it ctrl c ctrl shift b to paste it place
copy and paste in place and then we'll
rename this one email underscore txt for
an instance name and then ctrl c ctrl
shift v to copy and paste in place again
and then this one will drag out to be
larger
fit in that window
and we will also make it multi-line and
will give it an instance name of MSG
underscore txt short for message okay so
I think our forum items needs couple
more things like a now you have
everything in the forum items layer that
should be there and everything has an
instance name that it should now we can
lock the forum items layer and go to the
static text layer and let's just start
with putting in let's see that's since
those are aligned left already let's
make that a static text
and let's type in name : it says please
enter your name type in the name whoops
one more thing I'm gonna align these to
the right and this one
now let's publish out
and if I press send please into your
name okay
please into an email address okay please
into a valid email address okay for the
ad I'll put a dot for a send please into
a message then the processing movie clip
shows up and if we were online with this
it would connect to our to the script
that is looking for here at flap it's
calm and it would send the message and
that's it so that concludes it and we'll
see you next time around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
