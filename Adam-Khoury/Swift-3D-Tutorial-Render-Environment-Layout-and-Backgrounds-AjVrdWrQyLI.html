version six tutorial and we have just a
couple left we're gonna do this one
which is going to cover layout and
environment and we'll touch on camera
which are the three properties that are
first available when you open a file in
the next tutorial we're going to talk
about lighting and cameras and then the
next one after that which will be the
final one
we're going to discuss the advance
modeler so regarding layout and
environment layouts very simple you have
three units you can choose from pixels
inches or centimeters and most of us
would use pixels and let's say I was
creating a desktop background or maybe a
background for my webpage I could just
set the size I want the background to be
I'm gonna go 1400 pixels wide and 900
pixels high okay so now I'm going to add
a torus I'm going to rotate it just a
bit I'm gonna get the segmentation up to
64 minor and major give me a better mesh
quality now I'm going to go to the
reflective materials and I'm going to
take out this reflective whitish gray
color and I'm gonna use reflective just
so you guys can see the different
options when I talk about the
environment here in just a second okay
so now that's set to a 1400 wide by 900
pixel high image that this will give out
or rendering that this will give out let
me sit get one more torus in place I'm
gonna press highlight that press ctrl-c
ctrl-v and on the new one I'm just gonna
rotate it just a little bit to look
something like that
I'm gonna press ctrl-a and write a
rotate both of them now the camera is
you can get to that in two ways you can
adjust that in two ways you can just
click up or down and you'll see what
that does for your camera
or you can press alt and then the right
mouse key hold down the my right mouse
key and you'll see the same kind of
functionality there so all right mouse
key will have your camera go in and out
now environment is very simple and what
that does is the background color like I
said if you want this to be a JPEG image
or maybe a default movie from Swift 3d
an avi movie from Swift 3d then you can
set your background however you need it
to be you can see you can change your
background color here if you need it to
but if your rendering inside as a PNG or
an SWF that background won't be involved
in the render it'll just be the model
that way you can get really creative
with whatever backgrounds you want to
put in flash or Photoshop or fireworks
so that's background under the
environment property now the ambient
light color is also important so if I
see let me grab these two again let's
rotate them a little more okay so if I
am in environment and I have my ambient
light color to set to that gray or that
really dark gray we can see what kind of
tones that gives our model now if I go
and I make that red you see the tones
that the model takes on and that will be
also shown in the render now the
environment is you can use anything for
the environment actually they have some
down here environments you can put any
of these gradients on you just grab the
gradient put it into the background
there and it shows up as the environment
you go to preview an export generate
selected frame and you'll see that the
models take on the reflections and
really the environment will only be
reflected onto the objects in the scene
if you're using
the reflective materials which when I
started out I put reflective steel color
onto my objects there if these were flat
or glassy the environment really
wouldn't show up as much now the last
thing about the environment is you can
then change your gradient generate
preview you see you can change that
gradient up scale it so you can
manipulate that any kind of way you need
to to get just the desired effect that
you want but if I wanted to use one of
my own custom bitmaps is the environment
scale let's move in on this
preview and export so you see it just
picks up anything that I set as the
environment as reflections upon my
objects and models and let's say if you
were exporting out as a JPEG then it
will bring this gray image with the
rendered file you'll have this gray
background but if you export as PNG it
will only be the model so then you can
work further in fireworks a Photoshop a
flash or whatever but any kind of
backgrounds you want using those
programs behind the images behind the 3d
models and that's all there is to the
environment and layout and so let's say
I wanted to have a custom bitmap image
come in as my background I can put this
plane and I can set the rotation on the
plane to 90 90 degrees and I can just
move it back let's grab it on this side
move it back you can make it as big as
you need to cover the whole scene if you
want and then you just apply an image to
that as material any bitmap image you
like so let's say if I go to my
libraries I create a flow JPEG image
that's okay and there's creative flow
behind the model subscribe both of these
move them a little bit
and then you'll see the creative flow
back there and I can also grab
everything by pressing ctrl a and even
rotate everything like this you see
so using this method of creating a plane
and then putting a custom bitmap on it
you can have your background integrated
into your 3d model scene so the
background will have all the correct
shadows and lighting that the model the
modeled scene would render so let's go
to preview an export and you see now
that your background has the shadows on
it that would be appropriate for the 3d
scene and you can also see a little
reflection on the model of the
background a little bit because I made
that the environment you see here I put
that custom bitmap also in the
environment so that's how that all works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
