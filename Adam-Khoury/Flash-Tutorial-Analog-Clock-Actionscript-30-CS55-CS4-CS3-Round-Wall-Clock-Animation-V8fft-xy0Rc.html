and abroad
I hope you're doing well today in this
lesson we're going to show you how to
build your own custom analog clock in
actionscript 3.0 using just 13 lines of
code unbelievable and this lesson comes
courtesy of a request from Brett bond
Rhodes who two days ago asks sir Adam
how are you like I'm a knight around the
round table that's really cool thank you
can you share me the code ActionScript
in Adobe Flash cs3 how to make a wall
clock a circle clock let's get right to
it
okay right I'll be using Adobe Flash
Professional CS 5.5 but you can use your
cs3 you can use cs4 you can use cs5 you
can use CS 5.5 you can use cs6 you can
use CS 6.5 you can use CS 6 point 5
point 2 point 7 you can use cs-80 seven
point three point seven point five point
two you can use CS 1200 and 3.3 million
eighty four point 372 whatever whatever
flash version they come out with that
works out with ActionScript 3 you can
use that one okay now let's click on
create new ActionScript 3 file now I
already have my clock base ready in
fireworks and I shouldn't have to show
you guys how to design a clock face so
here in fireworks I'm going to press
ctrl C go back to flash I'm going to
press control V and it's going to import
to the stage I'm going to import as
bitmaps to maintain appearance you can
also keep all paths editable that way if
the file is scaled or anything like that
it won't lose image quality or whatever
I'm going to make my canvas a little bit
bigger that way everything fits in there
real good
there we go so what I will show you how
to do is create the hands the minute
seconds and our hands and then I'll show
you how to program those using
actionscript 3.0 to where it runs just
like an analog clock now what I'll do is
highlight this object right-click it go
down and select convert to symbol and
I'm going to make it a movie clip symbol
I'm going to make the registration the
very center dot press ok and I'm doing
this so I get a clear view of what
the exact center is of my clock base
when I go to put my hands there or you
can just draw out a spear or something
and make sure you place it in the exact
center or you really don't even have to
do that you can just put the hands where
it seems like it's at the center and
it'll be at the center so what I'm gonna
do is create a new layer I'm going to
name that a s 3 and this one graphic
elements and if you want to nest all of
this inside of its own movie clip to
where it has its own little timeline and
everything that's just fine that way you
can move your clock around within maybe
a full flash website or something more
easily and the code will run
independently within that movie clip
let's lock the ActionScript 3 layers so
we don't accidentally put any graphic
elements on that layer and now let's
create the first hand by dragging out
rectangle primitive and I'll start with
making the seconds hand so I'll make
this black so it shows up really good
and I actually look exactly like that
right now I'm wearing these big giant
1980s disc jockey headphones with the
little bobbi brown it's my prerogative
microphone on it I got that half-baked
look on my face alright so this is going
to be the second bar or the seconds hand
I don't want it so wide so I'm going to
drag this and make it skinnier here
maybe that looks good to me and it
definitely won't be so high it really
doesn't matter you can actually
manipulate it after you turn it into a
movie clip which is what we're going to
do now so right click it convert to
symbol this is going to be a movie clip
symbol and be sure that you make the
registration top center press ok now
let's give that an instance name of
second underscore and underscore MC
that's our second hand movie clip now
I'm simply going to highlight this and I
can see where my center point is here
and I'll move this over to that to where
the registration point for the second
hand matches the registration Center
registration point for this circle okay
so that looks like a good enough match
for me I think it's dead center now I
know I know I don't want this so high I
only wanted to come to maybe about right
there the bottom of his feet maybe so
I'm going to adjust the height
that movieclip to go write about maybe
there now with it still selected I'm
going to press control C control shift V
now I have a new one sitting right on
top I'm going to name this one minute
and underscore MC and that's how we'll
communicate to that one in the code just
like we'll communicate to the second
hand in the code using its instance name
now this one we want to make it a little
wider because this is going to be the
minutes hand so let's make it about like
that and then the height of this one we
want to make it a little bit longer than
the second time because on most standard
clocks you'll notice that the minute 10
is a little bit longer than the seconds
hand so we'll make it actually touch the
clock face markers there and if you like
you can use different movie clip symbols
you can you notice that I'm using the
same symbol and copying pasting and I'm
going to do that one more time
ctrl C I'm going to copy the minute hand
now control C control shift V and I'll
name this one hour underscore hand
underscore MC now this one I want to
make short because you'll notice on most
standard clocks that these are shorter
and wider than the rest so let's make it
a little bit wider maybe about right
there and let's make it shorter maybe
right there
alright so now you have all three hands
that you need hours minutes and the
seconds is under the minutes and
actually if you want to be able to get
to the seconds you can just put the
minutes to the back by selecting it and
pressing control shift down arrow key
well if you do that then you have to do
that to this to control shift down arrow
that way you can select the hours
seconds and the minutes hand and they're
all stacked up nice if you want to
separate them on layers you can also do
that to make getting to them more easy
and locking certain ones while you work
on other ones okay we got the design and
all the graphic elements in place so now
let's go up to the actionscript 3.0
layer and program this thing to work
highlight that keyframe you can go up to
window actions or just press f9 on your
keyboard the first thing we'll do is
create a couple of variables get them
initialized first one is going to be
called now and that's going to be an
instance of a date object
next line will type in VAR CT and that's
short for clock timer I thought that
would be a fitting name timer equals new
timer and you'll notice in flashes 5.5
that it automatically throws in any
imports you might need for external
coding but since I'm not doing
externally I'm actually here on the time
line
I don't need that so I'm going to get
rid of that you'll notice this
application runs without that if you're
on the time line if you're using class
files you have to use those imports so
now I've created a new timer object with
a one-second ticking so if you wanted
this to tick every five seconds you
would put a 5 there since this is
milliseconds we put 1000 if we wanted to
take every one second now the next line
down we're going to type in CT and add
an event listener to this object add
event listener and this listener is
going to be for the timer event so type
in timer event dot timer all caps comma
space and the function that we want to
fire off when every second ticks so
we'll name that on tick close your
parentheses put in a semicolon and the
next line down will type in CT start and
this will actually start your timer up
ticking every one second now all we need
is the function on tick so we'll get
this function set up to execute some
code that's going to affect those hours
minutes in the second hand and this
function goes along with the event colon
timer event closing parentheses and you
type in colon void since we're not going
to get any return values from this
function it's just going to run some
code that's going to affect the graphic
elements that are on stage this one
which is our hand underscore MC and then
the minute hand and the second hand also
so inside this function on tick that's
going to be firing off every second is
where we're going to effect those and
we're going to be affecting the rotation
properties of those elements on stage
the first thing we're going to do inside
of this function is alter the value of
that now variable which is the instance
of this
date object remember so what we can do
is just signify new date here that way
every second it'll get a new value for
what the time and date is that second
now we're going to create variables one
for the seconds I'm just going to name
that s keep things simple : and this is
going to be you int is equal to now dot
get seconds so we are running the get
seconds method on the now object to get
whatever the exact seconds are for this
exact time and date I'm just going to
highlight that whole line since it's
going to be very similar for the minutes
and the hours so let's just change this
to M change this to H let's change this
to get minutes and this one get hours
remove that I there we go all right
we're almost done so the first thing I'm
going to do is effect the second hand so
let's type in second underscore hand
underscore MC dot rotation property is
going to be equal to 180 plus and in
parentheses here we're going to group
this little expression to read seconds
times six this is a grouped equation
it's going to give you a value of
seconds times six
whatever the dynamic get seconds is
giving you at that moment or at that
second rather times six and 180 will be
added to that so it's really 180 plus
whatever that grouped equation gives you
now the rotation that we're going to set
on the minutes hand is going to be very
similar so we can just grab that and
type in minute hand underscore MC
rotation is equal to M times 6 over here
in this group plus 180 now for the hours
hands it's a little bit trickier and a
little different but we can still take
that line and copy it put there we'll
put it we'll put hours underscore hand
on the score MC that rotation is equal
to 180 + H for hours times 30 here then
you want to have one more little group
rushon for the minutes times 1/2 we'll
put em times 0.5 so as long as you
understand that every second this s m
and H for seconds minutes and hours it's
going to be dynamically changing every
second as long as you understand that
and you understand basic mathematics
you'll have no problem wrapping your
head around the mathematics we have
going on here for the rotation now let's
press control enter
to debug and check up I failed to put a
instance name on my hours hand oh I see
I put hours here blue I'm going to leave
that in the video so you guys see me
messing up
okay now let's press control enter and
there you'll see it picks up the correct
time and all of your hands are set
correctly if you gave them the proper
registration point for center and if you
want you can put a little round sphere
there just put a little circle there
that'll look like a knob or something
sitting on top there we go I get a
little circle on top there and I'm going
to highlight these three items here by
holding shift as I select them highlight
all three of those and I'm going to go
down to the filters here I'm going to
give it drop shadow now make sure the
distance is not very far maybe like two
you can distance your shadow however you
want that's if you want to even add it
the blur I'm going to bring down to
about one or two and the strength I'll
bring down to about 30 now I'll press
control enter see what I got that's nice
looks good works good okay my friends
I'll see you next time hope you enjoyed
