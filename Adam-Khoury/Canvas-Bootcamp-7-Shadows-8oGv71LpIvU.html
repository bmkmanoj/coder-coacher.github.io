JavaScript properties behind creating
shadow effects on the canvas element
before we start playing with the shadow
properties let's put in some comments
that way we understand the values that
we can place for each property so the
shadow color property you can use any
color names you can use hex values like
CSS color values or RGB a values and for
shadows I prefer using RGB a set to
black that way I can adjust the Alpha
which is the a and I'll show you what I
mean in a moment the shadow offset X and
shadow offset Y could have positive or
negative numbers applied depending on
which direction you want your shadow to
lay and the shadow blur is just positive
numbers you can give that before we draw
that rectangle I'm going to give it a
fill style of orange color now I'm going
to put the shadow color so I can take
the shadow color property put it here
and I'm going to make that equal to RGB
a color value so RGB a open close
parentheses and within the parentheses
you set the color you want to get a
black color you just put 0 0 0 and then
a 1 for the Alpha so I'll just leave it
on one for now then I'm going to take
the shadow offset X property and I'll
type in C TX dot shadow offset X its
equal to 5 and I can just copy that
because I also want to have 5 for my
shadow offset Y now if you were to look
at this right now you would see that you
have your shadow but it has no blur now
what if I offset the X minus 5 pixels it
goes the other direction and if I offset
the Y it also flips the direction for
the y offset
okie-dokie now we're going to take the
shadow blur property so let's take T TX
dot shadow blur and let's make that
equal to something like 3 and you can
see that you get a nice blur effect on
your shadow so if you were to set this
at something like 2 2 &amp;amp; 3 you get a nice
sharp clean shadow effect that has just
a
little bit of blur to it now the reason
why I use rgba is because now I can take
that black shadow and go to 0.5 on the
transparency on the Alpha setting you
can see it lightens up that shadow I can
even go so far as to put it on point -
just for a very subtle shadow effect so
that's why I prefer using RGB a color
values really you could just put any
color you want in there I can put purple
and then I have a purple shadow and if
you adjust your RGB a colors you can
just put this at 200 if you want it to
be full red that will give you a full
red shadow or if you want it full green
you make this 200 full blue you make
that 200 and those numbers can be
adjusted to achieve any color so I'll
just leave it on black now if I were to
take another fill rect and draw it
before we set any of these shadow
effects at an exposition of 200 you'll
see that that first rectangle drawn has
no shadow effects on it but the second
one does because the shadow effects were
specified after the first one was drawn
so I'll put this one at 50 and this one
at 200 so it makes more sense the second
one will have the shadow effects in the
first one won't and that completes all
of these shadow properties that can be
applied to your assets on the canvas
element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
