here and today's lesson we have
multi-plane easing effects tutorial
which will show you how to create
multi-plane easing with layers in
different movie clips that will move at
different speeds and it's mouse
interactive so you can see the planets
move at a different speed and a
different easing rate as the stars in
the background that star field and then
the spaceship in front here it's closest
to us is moving at different speeds than
everything else as well and oddly enough
this is inspired by a video I watched on
about Disney Walt Disney himself was
explaining the multi-plane camera that
they invented way back when and I was
like hmm that's interesting so I've made
a few files since then with this
multi-plane theory in my mind and I'm
going to be doing one more and you can
see you can read over here on the side
I'm gonna do another one on this that
targets the whole stage so you can do a
full flash website like this awesome
stuff okay so enjoy this tutorial and
look for a part two of this kind of
functionality and we'll discuss doing it
for a whole class website and more from
scratch and if we're going to use an
existing file here at develop PHP and
just modify it a bit to achieve the
effect so let's go and grab the I hit
the flash to have there the video
tutorials and apps and in the where is
it image photo and picture gallery
programming the magic pan windows file
here and you can see what the magic pan
windows file does I'm gonna snatch that
up
but on the save it to my desktop or
something close that
okey-dokey now let's open this thing up
I'm extracted folder to the desktop and
there it is okay so I'm going to open up
that file I just downloaded in flash cs3
works the same in cs4 because we're
using ActionScript 3 and once it opens
up here we notice that it has a movie
clip on stage and it's the only item
there and it's called whole magic window
in the library has no instance name
because it's just a container to hold
all the elements of this file so you can
move it around if you wanted it to be
over here that's just fine and it still
works just the same that way if you had
a pull flash website and you wanted this
little area to be on it you can move it
around alright let's set it in the
center let's get our background the
black and let's get that guy in the
center the best we can
it doesn't have to be perfect let's move
it up okay so we'll double click inside
of it and that's really where everything
is going on there's an ActionScript 3
layer which controls here let me unlock
these the ActionScript 3 layer controls
how this big image is panned under this
activator window ok and the mask is what
covers everything up so when the mask is
set you can see only that section is
seen and that's what makes the pan
effect so what we're going to do is
realize that this clip is 800 by 800
we'll keep it just like that and it's x
position Y and the I'm sorry X position
0 and the Y position 0 so let's double
click inside of it remove that image
control X now we're going to put some
let's just put in another rectangle in
its place it's like a little border make
sure it's at 0 0 and make sure it's 800
by 800 this is just to be a visual guide
for us to where we know we can put all
of our elements
now let's go to the pill here and bring
it all the way down the output that way
it's clear completely alright now you
see we just have like a border around
them movie clip now so let's stay inside
of it here and make a new layer and here
we're gonna put stuff we're gonna make
two other movie clips like this one and
they'll each have stuff in them and
maybe layer one can just be that border
there yeah we'll do that
okay so what I put into my stuff layer
just a series of dots that cover that
whole 800 by 800 square and now you can
achieve that by painting or using
primitives I just use primitives that
you can paint it on there too all right
so if we go back into the whole magic
window clip here where we have the mask
and the activator again and create a new
layer above the starfield layer Y
renamed it star field because that's
what it is let's take a look at it it's
pretty cool okay so we have a star field
that hands and zooms with the mouse or
not zooms but it pans around in all
directions with the mouse now this layer
6 we're going to create a actually we
can just take this one well let's just
create another rectangle make sure it's
a zero zero and make sure it's 800 by
800 800 by 800 and you'll see the the
contents inside of these movie clips can
just add a section may be you know
really small maybe like that big but
inside here where content is but this
would be just a container so now we have
800 800 0 0 convert that to symbol let's
call it click 2 or whatever that name
isn't important what is is the instance
name here so let's just call this clip
to clip 2 and the score MC
control-x get it off of the stars layer
make sure we put it on layer six there
control V now we can go inside that one
get this movie clip for this symbol to
have a black border like the other one
and the fill all the way down then you
make a stuff layer you lock that layer
then make a stuff layer just like we did
the other one and I'm going to put some
different stuff in here
okay so in the stuffed layer of my
second movie clip I put a little
spaceship looking thing and we can take
a look at what that looks like and I can
put many more things in here to fill up
this 800 by 800 space but I'm just gonna
leave it like that but this layer I
think so you can see what that looks
like
someone asked me what the hell kind of
spaceship that is it's supposed to be
going away from us and those are the
thrusters come on I was just doing a
real quick shut up
all right now so we have the spaceship
as you go back into the whole magic
window movie clip we can name this one
spaceship and then make sure we have an
instance name on it a clip to underscore
MC let's name the first one clip one
underscore MC clip one underscore MC
alright now in the code I'm going to
change a couple of things with this to
say clip one underscore MC good good
easy enough and I'm going to copy those
two lines ctrl C
and I'm going to change this to clip two
and now I'm going to mess with the
easing speed watch this this is where
the effect comes in easing speed let's
say minus five let's see what happens
- by both the X and the y see big pick
this needs to be clip one in the score
MC clip one
big-big clip 1 anything it says big clip
or a big pic we changed the clip 1
alright that looks good
this one's clip - okie dokie
now let's press control enter so you can
see and they're cool it's like the Stars
and the ship being on different layers
and having different ease speeds it
makes a cool effect now you can change
that number - no plus
three
see what that does control-enter see
that gives it a little smoother effect
but you can still see it's on different
layers and it eases at the end at a
different speed it's pretty cool I'm
going to add one more layer
okay so now I made the planets layer and
so the order of things our star field is
on the bottom planets above that and
spaceship is above that and then I have
the code in there press f9 or clip three
underscore MC which is my planets layer
and now let's look at what we have and
then I'll explain a couple things so you
can see inside of that clip that
whenever the mouse is over it those
three layers will all move at different
easing speeds and position things in
relation to one another to make it look
like it's more in a 3d space maybe a
little bit it's just a fun effect that
some some of you guys might have fun
with some of you guys might say there's
no use for that at all and that's cool
too but I just want to throw it out
there because sometimes you see this
effect okay so in the code let's talk
about this clip 1mc where we have the
bounds up here and everything that can
stay clip 1 and score MC as long as all
of those movie clips are the same size
which all three of our movie clips that
we made were 800 by 800 and it's also
important to note that the activator
window needs to be half the size of
those movie clips and if you want to
make it different sizes then you would
have to change your math up which I'm
not going to show you how to do that's
all on you to get creative and do but
let's go into the main scene you can see
we can drag this thing anywhere now
it'll work anywhere in the scene so we
have a full flash website let's put it
in this corner so you see so it works
just fine and if you wanted it to fill a
large area you just make your activator
window as large as the area you want and
make the movieclips twice that size it's
very simple
make sure your movie clips are at zero
zero on the stage though okay so that
about wraps it up I'll have the source
files available so you can get to it
download if you want to see my example
vials that I made here for reference
Erica we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
