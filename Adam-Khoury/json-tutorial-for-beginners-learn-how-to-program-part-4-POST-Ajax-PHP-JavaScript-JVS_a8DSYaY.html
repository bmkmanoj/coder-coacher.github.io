number four in this lesson you will
learn how to make your JSON Ajax data
requests more dynamic by posting
variables to your dynamic PHP JSON files
that we learned how to make in tutorial
number three and we'll also use PHP JSON
decode and JSON encode functions to more
easily format JSON data handling with
PHP so you'll be introduced to those two
functions within this lesson and then in
tutorial number five we'll bring
everything together that we've been
learning to make an actual JSON
application that would be in a real
world environment we're going to resume
with the same exact files that we left
off with in part three now our objective
is to make this Ajax get JSON a post
request rather than a get request so
let's go right here and change get to
post then the set request header and I
accidentally put the true parameter on
the set request header but set request
header actually only gets two parameters
so remove that true even if you're using
get or post you only need two parameters
for the set request header and I thought
I was putting that true parameter into
my open method when we started these
tutorials but you'll see that if you
have true here it won't stop this
application from running and you really
won't get any errors but it's not needed
there and it's really not even a valid
parameter for that method you really
want to set true here if you want this
open method to be asynchronous so we'll
leave this as content type and for the
value we're going to put xww form URL
encoded so pretty much everything will
stay exactly the same within our Ajax
request but here in the send method is
where you can post some variables to
your magic PHP JSON file so I'm going to
post bar 1 is equal to birds put the
ampersand symbol to make these URL
encoded variables var 2 is equal to bees
so var 1 is equal to birds and var 2 is
equal to bees
so var1 and var2 are going to get posted
to that magical PHP script that we
created this will allow you to do things
like access the database information
dynamically make pagination whatever you
want to do let's say you listing maybe
you have a thousand things in your
database you're only listing ten items
at a time in a box but you want to give
the user little controls to change what
information goes in that box what ten
items you can make pagination you can
change your queries altogether to bring
all new dynamic data back into that box
in real time on the page without refresh
and that's why JSON is hanging there you
know what I'm saying in my own so when
the data comes back we're going to still
create our object the same way in this
for loop we're going to access all the
objects within the JSON data and instead
of user we're going to make this a
property a and age will make say
property B because we're just going to
make a very simple object to return to
our Ajax mechanism now we can get rid of
all of this data back here and where it
says is let's just put the pipe symbol
actually I'm going to change the syntax
up a little bit I'm going to put double
quotes in the front and then a plus sign
to attach property a to this string
which is going to be just make that
string say property a and then it's
value will follow it and then we'll copy
that line and do the same exact thing
but this one will say property B you
want to change this to property B
because property a and property B are
going to be the properties within the
object that we're going to be sending
back and it's going to contain these two
dynamic variables birds and bees well
they're statically placed in there right
now but you can easily send that through
this Ajax get json function as arguments
those two dynamic variables but we'll be
going more in depth about that exact
thing in the next lesson where we show
how to create an actual application so
let's see right here let's put a
horizontal rule so let's put plus double
quote double quote and right here a char
forward slash there we go and that's all
you need to do
so with this kind of setup you're
posting to your PHP file which is going
to send back JSON formatted data to your
Ajax request and you're using variables
that way you can explore how to send
things dynamically to that PHP script
now let's go to my JSON list of PHP that
we left off with in tutorial 3 and what
we'll do here is remove the file get
contents function just put single quote
single quote for the JSON data and then
right below the header function we're
going to scoop up those two posted
variables from our Ajax request remember
variable 1 and variable 2 which we're
sending static values which is birds and
bees so bar 1 is going to contain birds
bar 2 is going to contain bees now we'll
create a simple JSON data that has only
one object within it so within the curly
braces type in double quote double quote
and in between double quotes obj one
then we'll type in colon and on the
right side of the colon is where the
value for that object 1 goes so that
will be its own little nested object so
you put curly brace opening and curly
brace closing there the first property
within this object is going to be
property a colon and then it needs a
value for now we'll just put xxx then we
put a comma double quote double quote
property B : double quote double quote
and xxx
and that's where property B's value will
go so let's put those values in place
now to get those inserted in PHP all you
have to do is put a single quote and
another single quote and what you have
done there is you're breaking that
string and you're allowing dynamic
variables to be put in between those two
double quotes so you put single quote
single quote in between those two double
quotes dot dot in between the single
quotes and in between your dots you put
your variable ctrl C pop it in right
there bar one and then you can just kind
of copy that single quote set up and put
it here make this one bar two so all
you're doing is string concatenation
here which is pretty much what we've
been doing in JavaScript the whole time
where we put the plus signs you know
how you put your double quotes and then
plus signs to append variable data to a
string it's the same thing we're doing
in PHP here it doesn't use plus sign so
it uses dots so now you have JSON data
variable ready and it has one object
within it whose property is obj one and
its value is another nested object
so now breast ctrl s and u1 to FTP my
JSON list PHP and JSON tutorial three
actually this should be JSON tutorial
for save as JSON tutorial number four
save JSON tutorial 3 I'm just going to
backtrack by pressing ctrl Z and get
back to where we were when we ended
tutorial 3 and remember this true
parameter does not go on the set request
header it only goes on your open method
not your set request header method that
was my bad but as you can see it didn't
even mess with the application at all
and everything worked just fine but it's
a redundant not needed parameter all
right so you just close JSON tutorial 3
you have JSON tutorial for now with the
new setup that's posting variables so
you want to FTP JSON tutorial for FTP my
JSON list PHP up to your live web server
because this will not work on a local
machine and this is the result that you
should get I'm here on my live web
server testing those exact scripts that
we just wrote reload the page you can
see it says requesting for a split
second then it sends that object back
and we are able to parse it within
JavaScript so the JSON object the JSON
data came back and we parsed it in
JavaScript property a was birds and
property B was bees so this is just a
very basic example sending this object
back it's just a very basic example
that's just a really a test to prove to
yourself that those variables are in
fact being posted from your Ajax request
to your dynamic PHP JSON list and then
you can do things like query your
database your MySQL database differently
according to what those dynamic
variables are or you can dig into a
folder different folders on your system
maybe you have a bunch of image
galleries
and for each gallery it has its own
folder full of images go on the client
side you can let the user pick from one
of those folder names and your PHP since
PHP is able to access any folders
contents dynamically you can pull all of
the images out of any folder dynamically
no matter how many images there are and
you have no prior knowledge of the
amount of images in there and their
names so you can do magical stuff I want
to go to develop PHP and introduce you
guys to to PHP s JSON built-in functions
and actually they're right here on the
home page now but if you don't see them
on the home page you can always just use
my search bar here to search for JSON
underscore decode and JSON underscore
encode but when you get to any of those
each one will have the other two on the
left here so no matter which one you
arrive at you'll see all of the PHP JSON
functions available for you to use now
let's take a look at JSON decode first
the JSON decode PHP function converts
JSON data to PHP array data that means
you can take any JSON format data and it
will turn it into a PHP associative
array or a PHP STD class object so just
familiarize yourself real well with the
parameters that it can have applied to
it and mess around with the examples
here I have some nice code examples here
that go a little more in-depth than the
ones at PHP net so we pretty much show
you how to parse the multi-dimensional
array that would be your JSON data
object okay so decode is when you want
to convert JSON formatted data to PHP
array type data now JSON encode is when
you want to convert PHP data to JSON
formatted data for instance when you're
going to query your database in your
magic PHP JSON file you can query your
database get all of that array data back
from the database call and JSON format
encoding so you just JSON and code all
of that data and here is an example so
just familiarize yourself with its
parameters and play with this little
example so familiarize yourself with
JSON decode and JSON encode
because we're going to be using them
within tutorial number five and in
tutorial number five we'll be taking
everything we've learned here and making
a PHP MySQL JSON application that would
serve some kind of purpose in the real
world then perhaps I'll make it directly
on world of web craft or something where
I can access my database of information
to do some kind of magical thing on the
page without refresh and handling loads
of data or whatever maybe we'll make an
image gallery maybe we'll just make a
data box that has all kind of dynamic
information that the user can choose
from I'm not sure exactly what kind of
application we'll make but I'll try to
make something that shows the the power
of using JSON encoded data something
that will make sense to use in the real
world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
