which is accompanied by a free source
file that you can download from develop
PHP calm in the flash tab will be
understanding how to program in our
numeric separate component from our
components library if you ever want to
gather quantities in a form type
situation or e-commerce type situation
from a user show you how to do that they
can select manufacturer quantity place
order there you go enjoy okay i'm going
to create new flash actionscript 3 pile
and then the first layer i'm going to
type in BG its background make another
layer call it form elements
in the next layer up name not won a s3
because that's where we'll put the code
it's not going to be much code at all
five or six lines I think and so what
we'll do is first set up the background
let's first to change our stage sighs
let's make it not so high maybe 300 by
550 is good okay now let's put the
background
we're going to place a rectangle make it
white the black edge
ok now the form elements which we're
going to focus on the numeric stepper
but in this lesson I'm going to work
with the components a little more
manually than I have in previous lessons
so let's first bring out the numeric
stepper let's place that right here
let's also grab a button it's going to
be our submit button or place order
button and let's also grab a combo box
I'm going to show you how to populate
these a little more manually so for this
item here the combo box which will be a
pulldown let's give it an instance name
of CB underscore MC combo box movie clip
and here we're going to name this NS
underscore MC so now we have numeric
stepper and combo box both have instance
names let's give this one an instance
name of submit button underscore BTN
submit underscore vtm now on the buttons
go to the parameters tab here change the
label to say place order I figured the
best way to show you how the numeric
stepper works and to access the values
of it would be a form type situation
where the user is selecting quantities
so that's all we need on that button we
have an instance name that's good a
numeric stepper we can go into the
parameters here and you should note that
you can dynamically render numeric
steppers to stage like we've been doing
with all of our other components in the
previous component tutorials but I just
wanted to show you how you can work with
it manually as well here in the
parameters tab if you chose to you can
have a little more control over things
if you do it this way
okay so the maximum will be 10 let's
make the maximum eight the minimum will
be one they have to order at least one
tire the step size is one it will
increment by 1 and starting value is one
that's good and so the enable button or
the enabled value or enabled property
and set the true okay so that's all we
need now let's make it a little bit
smaller because it doesn't need to be
that big let's set it to 40 since we're
only going to have two digits in it okay
now all we need is a status text field
dynamic text draw it out
make it black give an instance name of
status underscore txt
multi-line
show border yeah we can show border
that's fine and now I say all we need is
my submit button go there
let's put these over here place order
button right there okay now let's add
some aesthetic text that will say select
entire manufacture would
make that static sighs it out make it a
line right there we go
select the menu tire manufacturer
ctrl-c ctrl-v now select quantity
just get the colon there okay so we have
a select quantity and tire manufacturer
okay now let's bring our sex fail back
into place here and this is where the
order will display once they press place
order after they selected what they'd
like it's the only thing we need left is
the the data providing information for
this combo box so let's go two
parameters here see data provider let's
go ahead and access that by double
clicking you see a values window will
come up press the plus sign here you
make the first label say Bridgestone
and this can have data bridgestone and
add one more good year just gonna have
the data good underscore here one more
see Michelin
that can have a data value of Michelle
and okay now press ok and you'll have
your values in there now if you want one
more that says select here you can just
add it and make sure it's at the top so
you can use these arrows to move your
items up and down and if you want one
that says please select the manufacturer
here or select here you can add that but
I'm just going to leave it as is ok
let's see what happens if we press
control enter that's good we can select
that and use our numeric stepper there's
our place order button ok all we need is
a little bit of code to tie everything
together and I'll explain thoroughly
what's going on ok so let's highlight
our as3 layer keyframe and then press f9
open the actions panel let's type in
submit underscore BTN because this is
really where everything is going to
happen is in the click function of the
submit button submit underscore BTN add
event listener so we'll add event
listener and inside the parentheses here
this is going to be mouse event
dot click when the button gets clicked
we're going to run a function cold place
order so we fire off the place order
function right in that button gets click
the submit button and now let's type in
that function here function place order
and open closed parenthesis colon void
open curly brace close curly brace and
in between the parenthesis here let's
type in event colon mouse event
there we go now we have a function nest
all set up now we're going to target
that status text field let me say status
underscore txt that text equals I'm
going to display the order so let's put
in a string here it's going to save
order details and backslash n backslash
n to make two line breaks in that field
that multi-line field that we created
there now let's grab that line and we're
going to append some text to that that
feels so we don't need this to claim
that text right there we're going to
claim a pen text so it'll add to it
pentax get rid of the equal sign and put
this in parenthesis whatever you want to
append let's make sure there's only one
line break there let's get rid of that
order details right here and let's type
in right here we're going to type in
manufacturer
space
and we're going to add to that the CB
combo box that selected item
not label or you can do data I'll show
you a little about that in a second
status under school well let's just go
ahead and grab this whole thing see now
we're going to add the quantity so we
say NS on the score MC which is our new
marriage stepper and all we have to do
is say value and that will access the
value so we can send it in a form if the
person is buying something from us or
whatever let's see it looks good to me
try it out let's control enter select
tire manufacturer I'll select Goodyear
quantity you can go up to 8 i'm just
going to select four Goodyear tires
place order order details manufacturer a
good year manufacturer for that means we
didn't change this word just say
quantity there we go no biggie
so let's say Michelin three there we go
manufacturer Michelin quantity 3 so
basically that's a little form and
that's the best I would say that's the
most commonly used or that's what the
numeric stepper would be most commonly
used for actually all of these items
will be used in a form type scenario or
an e-commerce application type situation
smoove these over a little bit and bring
in some custom graphics from fireworks
so it's not so bad okay on the
background layer I'm going to add that
it's going to bring it in as a movie
clip press ok there we go put a little
text buying by your tires here
it takes a little funky
a little bit creative
terrible terrible terrible terrible
nights mine
okay so there you have it folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
