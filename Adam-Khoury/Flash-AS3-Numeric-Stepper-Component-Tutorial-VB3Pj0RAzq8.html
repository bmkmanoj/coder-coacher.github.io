which is accompanied by a free source
file that you can download from develop
PHP calm in the flash tab we'll be
understanding how to program in our
numeric stepper component from our
components library if you ever want to
gather quantities in a form type
situation or e-commerce type situation
from a user I'll show you how to do that
they can select manufacturer quantity in
place order there you go enjoy ok I'm
going to create a new flash ActionScript
3 pile and then the first layer I'm
going to type in BG it's background make
another layer call it form elements
in the next layer up named that one a s
3 because that's where we'll put the
code it's not going to be much code at
all five or six lines I think and so
what we'll do is first set up the
background let's first change our stage
size let's make it not so high maybe 300
by 550 is good okay now let's put the
background
you shouldn't place a rectangle make it
white it's a black edge
okay now the form elements which we're
going to focus on the numerix temper but
in this lesson I'm gonna work with the
components a little more manually than I
have in previous lessons
so let's first bring out the numeric
stepper and let's place that right here
let's also grab a button it's gonna be
our submit button or place order button
and let's also grab a combo box I'm
gonna show you how to populate these a
little more manually so for this item
here the combo box which will be a
pulldown let's give it an instance name
of CV underscore MC combo box movie clip
and here we're going to name this an s
underscore MC so now we have numeric
stepper and combo box both have instance
names let's give this one an instance
name of submit button underscore BTN
submit underscore BTN now on the button
let's go to the parameters tab here
change the label to say place order I
figured the best way to show you how the
numeric stepper works and to access the
values of it would be the form type
situation where the user is selecting
quantities so that's all we need on that
button we have an instance name that's
good then numeric stepper we can go into
the parameters here and you should note
that you can dynamically render numeric
steppers to stage like we've been doing
with all of our other components in the
previous component tutorials but I just
wanted to show you how you can work with
it manually as well here in the
parameters tab if you chose to you can
have a little more control over things
if you do it this way
okay so the maximum will be 10 let's
make the maximum 8 the minimum will be 1
they have to order at least one tire the
step size is 1 it will increment by 1
and starting value is 1 that's good and
so the enabled button or the enabled
value or enabled property and set the
true okay so that's all we need now
let's make it a little bit smaller
because it doesn't need to be that big
let's set it to 40 since we're only
going to have two digits in it okay now
all we need is a status text field
dynamic text let's draw it out
make it black give an instance name of
status underscore txt
multiline show border yeah we can show
border that's fine and now I'd say all
we need is my submit button go there
let's put these over here place order
button right there okay now let's add
some static text that'll say select
entire manufacture wood
you can make that static sighs it out
make it a line right there we go
and select the menu tire manufacturer
control-c control-v now select quantity
let's get that cold in there okay so we
have a select quantity and tire
manufacturer
okay now let's bring our sex appeal back
into place here and this is where the
order will display once they press place
order after they selected what they'd
like it's the only thing we need left is
the the data providing information for
this combo box so let's go to parameters
here see data provider let's go ahead
and access that by double clicking you
see a values window will come up press
the plus sign here you make the first
label say Bridgestone
and this can have data Bridgestone and
let's add one more good year I'm just
gonna add a good underscore here one
more see Michelin
that can have a data value of Michelin
okay now press okay and you'll have your
values in there and if you want one more
that says select here you can just add
it and make sure it's at the top so you
can use these arrows to move your items
up and down and if you want one that
says please select the manufacturer here
or select here you can add that but I'm
just going to leave it as is okay let's
see what happens if we press control
enter that's good we can select that and
use our numeric stepper there's our
place order button okay all we need is a
little bit of code to tie everything
together and I'll explain thoroughly
what's going on
okay so let's highlight our as3 layer
keyframe and then press f9 open the
actions panel let's type in submit
underscore BTN because this is really
where everything is going to happen is
in the click function of the submit
button submit underscore BT and add
eventlistener so we'll add eventlistener
and inside the parentheses here this is
going to be Mouse event
timeclick when the button gets clicked
we're going to run a function cold place
order
so we fire off the place order function
right when that button gets clicked the
submit button
and now let's type in that function here
function place order and open close
parenthesis colon void open curly brace
close curly brace and in between the
parentheses here let's type in event
colon Mouse event
there we go now we have a function nest
all set up now we're going to target
that status text field let me say status
underscore txt that text equals I'm
going to display the order so let's put
in a string here it's going to say order
details and backslash n backslash n to
make two line breaks in that field that
multi-line field that we created there
now let's grab that line and we're going
to append some text to that that field
so we don't need this to claim that text
right there we're going to claim append
text so it'll add to it append text get
rid of the equal sign and put this in
parentheses whatever you want to append
let's make sure there's only one line
break there let's get rid of that order
details right here and let's type in
right here we're going to type in
manufacturer
space
and we're going to add to that the CB
combo box that selected item
not label
or you can do data and I'll show you a
little about that in a second
status under school well let's just go
ahead and grab this whole thing you'll
see now we're going to add the quantity
so we say NS underscore NC which is our
new marriage stepper and all we have to
do is say value and that will access the
value so we can send it in a form if the
person is buying something from us or
whatever let's see it looks good to me
let's try it out
let's ctrl enter select tire
manufacturer I'll select Goodyear
quantity you can go up to eight I'm just
going to select four Goodyear tires
place order order details manufacturer a
Goodyear manufacturer for that means we
didn't change this word just say
quantity there we go
no biggie
so let's say Michelin 3 there we go
manufacturer Michelin quantity 3 so
basically that's a little form and
that's the best I would say that's the
most commonly used or that's what the
new numeric stepper would be most
commonly used for actually all of these
items will be used in a form type
scenario or an e-commerce application
type situation smooth these over a
little bit and bring in some custom
graphics from fireworks so it's not so
bad
ok on the background layer I'm gonna add
that it's gonna bring it in as a movie
clip press ok there we go put a little
text buying buy your tires here
attempt takes a little funky
I'm a little bit creative
terrible terrible troll terrible
terrible
nine spine
okay
so there you have it folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
