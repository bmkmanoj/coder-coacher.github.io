we'll be showing you how to create in
this Adobe Illustrator cs4 tutorial 3d
custom logo text for your web design or
print projects okay let's get started
click web document I'm gonna leave
everything standard like it is for this
demonstration I'm gonna go to the size
and make sure we're at 100% and click
the text tool type in the text I want be
space 3d now I'm going to change the
size of that to maybe about 150 so I can
see it really well now we're gonna go to
object I'm sorry effect 3d extrude and
bevel you can change the way the bevel
depth and angle is going to be with all
of these settings here let's go ahead
and move this not so deep maybe thirty
eight looks good right about there you
can change your bevel type whether it
has capped or not okay okay now I can
give the face the faces a linear
gradient transform that linear gradient
to where it looks like the lights kind
of hitting it from the top close to nine
negative 90s I can get it that looks
great and you can also see let's give
this another
color by adding it right there make this
bright white let's make this one on top
on a darker gray trying to make it look
like steel a little bit maybe if I can
bring this down that looks cool now what
we can do is go up to object expand
appearance because we're gonna try and
get to just the gradient just the
beveled edges not the faces so you'll
see we have a group now you can ungroup
by pressing ctrl shift and g together
and that ungroup things so then you have
each letter as its own group then you
ungroup each one of those ctrl shift G
ctrl shift G ctrl shift G ctrl shift G
now they're all ungrouped and I can
select just the beveled edges by
themselves you see that that's what I
wanted to do so now let's get those all
together here so let's highlight
everything and soo-min to about 200%
now let's deselect just the faces
by holding shift and clicking as you go
now we have just the bevels highlighted
back there
so let's get those into one piece so go
to the Pathfinder tool and unite them
now that they're united they're above
the faces layer so we can just hit the
the layer that we just United for all
those bevels and you go to object
arrange send to back
okay now the faces are back on top now
let's go back to 100% okay let's stay in
yeah one that's good okay so now with
each of the faces you can take that and
give that an edge
we write about
they're right there little darker right
there that's okay so now we have an edge
you can even give those an edge as well
the gradient try to match it up so there
you have it that's how you can make
custom 3d text and you can also give for
a better effect give the gradients give
the bevel itself in the behind the faces
there to give the whole bevel of
gradient by going here and giving it
gradient then you can transform that
gradient to kind of match your other one
so things look like lights hitting from
the top and there you go cool 3d text
you can manipulate those gradients any
way you want to give any kind of effect
that you like there you go
it's pretty cool okay we'll see you next
