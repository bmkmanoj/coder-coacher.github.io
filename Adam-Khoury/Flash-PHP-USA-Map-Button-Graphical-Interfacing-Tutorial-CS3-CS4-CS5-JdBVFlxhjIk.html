here with another free flash source file
and in this one well there's a lot of
developers that sometimes want a little
cooler more unique interface for
allowing people to pick provinces so
whether you're working in the United
States Europe Asia Africa it doesn't
matter you can you can construct your
own map interfaces and I have a little
tutorial on that in flash I think it's
in flash resent my fireworks now to my
flash section on how to make an
interactive map and I use parts of
Europe to construct that map but in this
flash file what I've done is created a
full working application that shows you
how to integrate it into PHP so once you
download this source file and you dig
into that movie clip you can see these
are each each one hour button instances
and they have text sitting on top of
them so that way when the users Mouse
rolls over each state it will light up
and then when they click it certain
things can happen so let's take a look
at what we have here you see all the
states down through there and they're in
a folder a layer folder that you can
collapse and clothes for collapse and D
collapse or uncle apps and you can see
inside each time you click on one of
these layers one of those buttons will
highlight and blue there you know which
one it is so all 52 states are there and
there's code examples here so once you
get into the Fla file you'll see my
little important information notes here
and then you'll see some action script
and on into action script layer we have
examples for actionscript-3 here and
then experience or action script to hear
this way action script to users can get
to it as well and use this application
so what happens is when they click one
of these buttons and I only
have in the example i only have
Washington and New York State coated out
here but I have in the package you'll
see a file called state dot PHP state
choice that PHP so what it does is sends
the variable flash sends the variable of
what they chose to that page that way
you can render some information out of
your database according to that
selection or do various other things
whatever you want to do and I made it to
where you can code this static or you
can take my tutorial for coding and
loops that way you wouldn't have to do
fifty two functions and 52 listeners you
know what I mean you can just have one
universal button function that would
handle all these buttons if you set up
your file naming and everything
correctly you're gonna have to be slick
about it and I'm not going to help you
hahaha so but you can do it static if
you're not too good with dynamics you
can just write out each state and you'll
have a full working application that's a
nice flash integrated and what happens
is let's export it I put a blue glow on
the entire movie clip to make it seem
like its water around the landmasses so
when they roll over each state it lights
up a nice brown color and I used green
and brown because well green brown and
blue because those are really popular
mapping and geographical referencing
colors it just made sense to me so it's
a full working application that you can
learn from or just use you know what I'm
saying so thank you everybody for
subscribing and getting everybody help
in the forums a develop PHP whoever is
helping out in the forum's there you
guys are more valuable than you'll ever
know okay thank you and good bite this
will be free at develop PHP under the
flash tab under menus and buttons and
such and the whole package will be there
a little readme file the PHP file that
sucks up the state the state choice and
everything you'll need to understand how
to build one of these or you can just
use the one that I built for you okay
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
