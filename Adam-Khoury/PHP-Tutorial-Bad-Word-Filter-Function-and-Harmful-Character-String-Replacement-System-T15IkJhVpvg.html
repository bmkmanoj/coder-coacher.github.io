short but sweet programming video
tutorial for PHP users the topic we're
covering today is creating a simple bad
word or harmful character filter system
for your PHP and MySQL database web
applications first we'll show you how to
set it up for one-time use in an
application then we'll show you how to
set it up as a custom function so you
can use the same filter on many pages or
scripts in your application if you have
that need okay here we are inside of the
basic PHP file that has nothing but the
opening and closing PHP tags so what
we'll need to start with is some example
data something we want to run through
our filter now I wanted to use really
profane words like the F word the S word
to really show you the things that you
would actually want to filter out but
since we're on YouTube there might be a
lot of kids watching I'm going to go
with the word douche damn and punch and
none of those really bad words but you
you can imagine you'd have the F word
there or the S word or maybe the C word
here or something like that but the
words in this sentence the ones I'm
going to look to replace our douche dam
and punch because those are not very
nice words so wonder our example data
we're going to place another variable
we're going to name that originals and
that's going to be equal to an array and
inside of that array we put as many
items as we want inside of that array so
in this case I just want to replace
three words but normally you would have
a nice long list of curse words or
harmful characters that you want to
filter out so I'm just going to put
double quote double quote comma double
quote double quote comma and double
quote double quote that's three items I
can place in there the first one is
douche so I'm going to grab that the
next one is damn put that there and the
last one is punch grab that and put it
there now my originals array is all set
up and ready to go so let's just grab
that whole array copy it and paste it on
the line under it and let's call this
replacements and I want to replace
douche with the word friend I want to
replace damn with the word wow and I
want to replace punch with the word love
so now we have our originals array all
set up and our replacements
is all ready to go now let's take our my
data variable which holds this whole
sentence that still has bad words in it
I'm going to make that equal to STR
underscore I replace now what this is is
the string I replace function in PHP
which allows you to replace one value
with another so let's say I wanted to
replace the value of turd with the word
poop and all I have to do is take my
data right here now it's all ready to go
and what that'll do is if the word turd
happens to appear anywhere in my
sentence or my text it'll replace the
word turd with poop but since we have a
ray setup and the string I replace
function in PHP allows us to put a whole
giant array of things we want to replace
with new replacements we can just add
originals right here where it says turd
this is the original words and these are
the replacements so it will work for 350
however many words you have in your
array now all you have to do is echo out
my data so we'll grab that just that
variable now will echo out my data and
you'll see that it effectively replaces
everything that you wanted to replace
and it's really only three lines of code
that's taking care of the whole thing
and I'm going to show you how to put
this into a custom function in just a
second but first we want to test this
out and make sure it changes this
horrible sentence into a more lovely one
so we're going to make sure that we have
this on a PHP enabled server and then
we're going to test it in the browser if
you're on your local machine and PHP is
not installed in your local machine this
might not work be okay you got to put it
online where PHP isn't able to run all
right so you can see it takes my
horrible sentence and changes it into
something much more lovely so now it
says hi friend Wow I want to love you
for a good cause so at this point as it
is now you can use this very simply for
one-time use in your script if you need
it but maybe you're going to have a
system that might use this on several
different pages in several different
scripts within your system or maybe it
uses it in three or four different
locations within the same PHP script
you'll want to have that in the custom
function so what you'll want to do is
take the three lines in the center here
that actually do all the processing and
filtering that we need we're going to
take those out and press control X and
right under the PHP tag above our data
and everything like that we're going to
put in our custom function so we'll type
in function bad word filter open
parentheses close parentheses open the
curly brace and go down a couple of
lines and close off your curly brace
that closes up your function nest so
anything you want to happen any code you
want to execute within this function
goes right here so we'll put those three
lines and then we have to make sure this
is going to be somewhat dynamic so here
in between the parentheses for the
bad-word filter function we're going to
put dollar sign and x or you can just
call it data now you just change that
for my data and now we're going to send
my data through this function so what
happens is let's go down here right
under my data we're going to call that
function to run called bad word filter
bad word filter and in its parentheses
here we're going to put my data so my
data is being sent through the bad word
filter function that we just created
custom so let's just take this line
right here and this if this line is
placed just like that it'll execute the
function but since we want to echo it
out we can do this
we'll just echo the function to run with
my data so it'll filter it on but if you
want that into a variable you can just
go like this cleaned equals that and
then you can just echo out cleaned so
that's what we'll do because that's
normally how people would use it now we
want to go here inside of our function
and make sure this one says data instead
of my data and then at the very end
we're going to return data what that'll
do is that'll send the cleaned data back
to your script from inside the function
now when we run this
browser we should see the same exact
output as we saw before and then we'll
know that we can just fire off this
function called bad word filter on any
data we want at any time and it will
give us a result variable of cleaned now
if there's anything I happen to forget
in here I'll find out in just a second
after I test right now okay so let's
refresh this and now with the new script
running we shouldn't see any changes
here it should run exactly the same as
it did before all right so I just
refreshed it and now it runs exactly
like it did before but we have it set up
a little bit differently a little more
dynamic so you can just send whatever
data you want through your custom bad
word filter and it'll wind up in a nice
variable called cleaned for you you can
put that into your database and you can
also use this bad word filter on the way
out of the database so maybe you don't
want to filter the words until they're
coming out for display but some people
might want to filter the words or the
text before it even goes into the
database now here's one last little tip
for you guys you can take this control X
and put it into an independent file a
PHP file that's all on its own just for
your bad world just for your bad word
filter that way you can use it on many
many different pages you won't have to
write this filter over and over again
you can just type in include once and in
between parentheses here you can type in
bad word filtered PHP and that is where
your code is that custom function we
just made that I just zapped out of this
file would live inside this file called
bad word filter that PHP that way if you
needed it for more than just this PHP
script you can use it on eight different
PHP scripts in your in your system or
whatever wherever you need it and it'll
run that function just like the function
was sitting right there because when
this script runs and it includes that
file basically that function is going to
be sitting right there in the file it's
kind of like an easy way to template out
your functions or you can use
object-oriented programming and make it
a class file and it'll be just as
dynamic that way so let's go back to
what we had here and there's the
function everything is in place
and this is the example script that I'll
put up at the
the PHP comm for people to copy and
paste if they want to get at the source
code for what I have here all right so I
hope that helps some of you guys who
aren't really familiar with filtering
things out filter out bad words unwanted
characters you so there's a whole lot
you can do with this okay have fun
