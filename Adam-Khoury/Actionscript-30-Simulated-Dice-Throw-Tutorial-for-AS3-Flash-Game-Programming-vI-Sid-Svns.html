me how I would simulate dice throws in a
flash game and evaluate the dice throws
for doubles and I thought it would be a
good programming lesson for all
beginners so we're gonna do a video on
it right now and this is the finished
product of what you'll be learning to
create press roll dice on that button
and it tells you what you rolled your
roll will never be more than a 12 never
be less than a 2 and if you happen to
roll doubles on the dice
it says doubles you get a free turn or
whatever you want to do for the player
when doubles occur if you want to give
them kind of bonus you want to give them
a free turn and it's all covered in this
lesson okay let's rock and roll you can
work with any Flash version that
supports working with actionscript 3.0
and create new actionscript 3.0 file the
first thing I'm going to do is create a
button I'll grab rectangle primitive and
I'll draw it out to make a button now I
will get some text on that okay so
there's the things I want in my button
I'm gonna highlight both of those items
right click convert to symbol make sure
it's a button symbol and symbol one in
the library is a good name okay now with
that selected the instance name for that
is going to be ro ll underscore BTN roll
button now let's create a new layer here
and call this a s3 short for
ActionScript 3 let's go inside and let's
type in or actually if you don't know
how to get into your actions panel you
can highlight that keyframe or that
frame press f9 on your keyboard or you
can go to window actions and that will
open your actions panel or you can hit
the little arrow button over here for
actions if you have that available in
that panel but basically it just gets
your scripting panel and what we'll do
is we'll type in roll underscore BTN
that add event listener and this is
Mouse event dot click so when the button
is clicked we want to listen for that
and let's make the function that fires
off called roll dice copy that name roll
dice go down one line type in function
paste it in roll dice open parentheses
close parentheses semi-colon void and
then open your curly brace go down a
couple of lines and close off your curly
brace to close the function nest and
here inside of the parentheses we're
going to type in event : Mouse event so
now we're all set up with listener and
function for that roll dice button okay
now I'm going to make the dice to
simulate a dice I'm going to grab the
text tool and type in a 0 and let's see
it's white so let's make it black so we
can see it and we'll make sure this text
is dynamic and we'll give it an instance
name of die one underscore txt to let us
know it's a text field in the code now
let's just raise the size of that may be
right about there is good and let's make
sure we have it centered in the text
field I'm going to show border around it
make it not selectable but show border
I'm going to make mine just a little
wider that looks good to me so I'm going
to ctrl c ctrl shift V make a copy of
that put it right next to it I'm going
to call this one in the instance name
died too then the properties panel we're
going to name it died to underscore txt
and you can just go ahead and take the
letters out or the zero now let's create
another dynamic text field for these
status I'm going to make the size of
this one I'm gonna know maybe 20 color
black that's good I don't need it to be
to have a border around it and I'm just
gonna place it right here and I don't
want that one to have centered text so
I'm going to make sure it's formatted to
the left and I'm gonna put these things
over here then I'm going to copy this
one actually let's give that an instance
name first the status underscore txt to
remove the text from it then I'm going
to copy that control C control shift V
make another static dynamic text field
rather and let's give that one the name
of doubles doubles underscore txt and
let's make this one green
this one is going to be the one that
shows the user if they've run doubles
and I'll show you how to listen for that
or make an evaluation for that to see if
they if the user has rolled a double you
want to give them a bonus so you want to
fire off some function to give them an
extra turn or whatever alright you can
see I put something on my ActionScript 3
layer which just happens to be all of
these things so I'm going to take those
off control X and put them on my layer 1
control shift of V I'm going to lock my
ActionScript 3 layer so I don't
accidentally put anything on there again
ok we have everything on stage that we
need this little simulated dice throwing
application now we'll go into the
ActionScript 3 and finish it off alright
the first thing we're going to do is add
two lines here and these are going to be
for calculating what the value should be
Ondi one and what the value should be
Ondi two
so those are two variables we're
creating here now we get the value of
those variables by getting a random
number between 1 and 6 and I have a
tutorial that I made a long time ago for
flash actionscript 3.0 and it's called
random number generator
I showed people how to make a random
number between 1 and 10 or 1 and 100
whatever number they wanted to go in
between 1 and whatever so I use that
code here and I just applied it to
making our dice to make a number a
random number between 1 and 6 every time
it won't be outside of those bounds it
won't be a zero and it won't be beyond a
six ever so we have those values using
math dot random times 6 so you calculate
that and then you +1 to it and you use
math dot floor on this little
calculation right here and that was
that's what around your number down so
basically that's how you get a random
number between 1 and 6 packed into a
variable called die 1 and die too now
let's put the dice total into a variable
so let's make a new variable and call it
dice total and this is going to be type
u int as well this is equal to die 1
plus die to that way you can know
exactly how many spaces on your flash
game board that the user can move now
the next line down we're going to
relate the value of dye 1 into our
simulated dice textfield on stage when
you say dye one underscore txt is what
we named it that text is equal to the
dye one you int variable dot 2 string so
we use the dot two string method to make
it a string before we place it into the
text field here I think if you tried to
put this into the text field without
claiming to string like if you just put
dye one like that the value you'll get
some flash ever when you go to export
this so you just say to string or you
see a lot of people will do something
like this they'll put in an actual
string with nothing you can put in a
string like you would type in some words
but just put nothing in it and then put
plus dye one and that'll work just the
same as dye one to string make sense
okay good now let's just copy that line
next line down we're going to put dye to
text is equal to die to doctor string
now the next line down we're going to
put status underscore txt target that
status text field dot text is equal to
the string of you rolled space and then
after your double quote you just put in
plus the dice total which is this
variable right there pop it in place put
your semicolon to break that line and
now you the last thing you need is an
if-else conditional statement so you say
if open closed parenthesis open the
curly brace go down one line else and
there just make sure you nest it just
like that you open your curly brace and
you close your curly brace then you put
else open curly brace close curly brace
and the condition we want to listen for
is die 1 is equal to die to this way you
can listen for doubles
so if die 1 is equal to die 2 then in
the doubles text let's say doubles
underscore txt text
equal to doubles you say real big you
you get a free turn else doubles text
will be nothing now what you want to do
is if they get doubles maybe you want to
run a constant function here say give
another turn and that's where you can
execute that function of give another
turn to this player whoever happens to
roll the doubles okay I'll just comment
that out right there function or doubles
bonus okay let's take a look at this
here everything looks good I spelled the
word doubles wrong that would have been
an error and I think I have everything
else felt right for these text fields on
stage so let's test it out control enter
and this says the font should be
embedded just because I'm in cs5 and I
can embed those fonts or whatever I
gotta embed the stupid fonts alright let
me go back here what am i using for dan
I'm gonna embed for Dan I'm gonna do
uppercase lowercase numerals punctuation
okay now let's control enter it hey look
at that first roll I got doubles alright
looks like this text fields too big so
let's make this green one the text size
maybe around 18 the control enter roll
dice you rolled a 9 you rolled 5 you
rolled four you rolled 9 let's see if I
can get doubles again and it'll never be
more than a 12 and less than 2 rest
assured there you go I got doubles see
you doubles you get a free turn so when
the doubles occur on the dice then you
know that you can give the person some
kind of bonus or whatever maybe a free
turn whatever you're going to do to them
and you with your game ok but that's
pretty much as how it's done buddy and
there's the little script and I'll have
this script available on the page of
develop PHP com
if you
happen to type something wrong you know
mine is typed right because I just
tested it and everything so if you have
any trouble with your script you can
come and get my script in the page where
this lesson will be displaying at
develop PHP com and I'll also have this
little flash file available just for
demonstration purposes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
