setting up this header and we're going
to have it separate it out as an include
file just like we did with our footer
once we set up the table there's going
to be a few more things in it and then
we can take it out make it an include
file because this will be something that
I'm going to have not change every
single page this is going to be exactly
the same this header the only thing
that's going to change on my different
respective pages on my site is this body
section so my footer can be an include
and my header is going to be an include
as well to help keep site management
really really under tight control now
before we even start setting up the code
to power this header this section right
here is clickable because most people
will instinctively go to that to get to
the homepage they'll click on the logo
especially that round part so I'm going
to make sure make sure that that's
clickable so what I'm going to do to
make that easy for myself is I'm going
to give this to Rose this to table the
header table I'm going to give it two
rows and three columns so you see what
I've done now right up here in this
center column I'm going to add a clear
image if you don't know how to make a
completely opaque the gif file I'll show
you you go into fireworks and mine you
can see the canvas size is four pixels
by four pixels and see canvas there's no
color it's blank totally clear and what
I do is go to file export wizard save it
as a gift right here give and then you
go take off the mat you want no mat and
then you can use alpha transparency I
believe and then when you export it save
it to the style folder as clear give
save
I already had mine made but that's how
you make it and now you go into
Dreamweaver and let's put that give go
to the pictures clear gift in the style
Boulder let's bring that sucker in let's
give it some alt text so we don't get
any validation errors at w3c you don't
give this alt text you'll get a
validation error at w3c so let's put in
web intersect just put in the name of
your site or whatever okay now you see
that little squares right up there all
we have to do is go into the code view
and let's make it bigger make the height
on it I don't know what was that height
we said 150 and the wood let's make that
I don't know maybe 96 look at the design
view see what I've done now I could put
a link on that watch this this will go
to http www web intersect calm and I'm
going to make it just a little higher
code the height let's make that 156 and
see what it does design
and even a little bit more let's go 160
and see if that pushes down to the
bottom of that logo now to get that
centered up you can see we have a blue
edge around it so let's click it border
0 now look in the code within that table
cell is just an image with a link around
it this will allow you to make this part
of the header clickable so watch this
I'm going to drag this in I'm going to
drag this head Booya baby that whole
section right there is clickable now now
let's make sure the height is correct
and dreamweaver you can actually just
pull it down makes it easier right about
there very cool now since I know my
header is 195 total height and I just
made that image 170 that means I have 25
pixels left to play with here and right
here on the bottom we're going to put
another div tag that way we can have
some margin on the side and get our
links in there just right so let's go to
div style make the height
25 pixels that will complete the 195
let's see what we have in design view
you see there now we can place links
right up in there and we want to push
that one off of the edge as well like we
did this one down here so let's give
this margin left let's take that style
put it right here in this div see what
it does you see now your div has a
margin that way your links won't be
smacked up against the side there now
let's just type in our links home i'm
going to put space then i'm going to put
a mid dot go into code view type in and
mid dot semicolon then i'm going to type
in about us or what we do and then
another mid dot
let's just put another link here just
label it another link and let's also put
a couple of spaces control shift space
control ship space hold down ctrl shift
+ space one two and one two now let's
look in design view yep that's pretty
nice not too bad at all we're going to
make those links now let's go into the
code now before I even make these links
I'm going to style these links up in
this main that CSS stylesheet so let me
show you what i added you add this to
your main dot CSS stylesheet you see
this a link a visited a hover and a
active that controls what all of the
links are going to look like on your
page unless you make another set which
i'm going to be making another set of
links as well i'll show you how i do
that to make a new style for a whole new
different set of links so all your links
don't have the same exact style you can
have different styles for any links that
you want so let's make this a link and
you'll see because my stylesheet it has
that nice blue that I want now let's go
here and make this one go to about dot
PHP because we already have that file on
server and this one goes to web
intersect the homepage so make that go
to the homepage URL and I want my links
to be a little bit thicker than that
make them a little bold all I have to do
is go into the code and I could set this
in the link style definitions but i'm
just going to use the div so all of my
links or these particular links will
only have that maybe i'll want to have
some blue link so i might down on my
page that are not bold you know what I'm
saying so I'm going to put the bold here
in the styling for that div I'm going to
go to font
wait bold semicolon ctrl s let's look at
it that's a little better I like that
I'm also going to make it 13 pixels
instead of the default 12 that we have
assigned in the style sheet for all
texts let's make this font size 13
pixels or 14 just make it a little
bigger so they stand out a little more
on the page that's a very good I'm going
to save this ftp it to the web
I'm going to put the index file and make
sure you go into your style Boulder put
up your newly configured main that CSS
that has those links definitions in it
remember and the clear gift you can go
check out your site and you'll see now
you have links set up any way you want
them it looks like i have a space in the
link on that one and i have to fix that
i'm going to show you guys a little CSS
trick here if you want different color
links you see this here called a new
link and you see it's green it has a
link it's an active link in the CSS file
what I did was I added a different link
definition than the norm see these are
for all the links that will be on the
site if you want some that will be
different you can make a new link style
definition and give it a class of green
links or whatever color you want yours
to be and in the file you just make sure
that link on any page has a class name
of green links so let's go and put that
up and see what it does main that CSS
and let's put up the index page refresh
see now you have totally different style
of links here which I might make these
green and then other links maybe normal
blue or whatever I don't know but now
you can see how you can have a role of
links down here that are all different
color from the ones up here you can make
all kind of different color variations
on your links if you need to using CSS
that way in the main CSS style sheet so
you see exactly what i have going there
and these are for my normal links
okay if you guys would like to see more
you know where to leave me feedback I
read all of my youtube comments every
single one even though I might not
respond I read every single comment I
get on almost all 300 of my videos I
read all of them so if you want me to do
more and show you how to do some more
stuff maybe you need to know how to get
something else going on the page just
let me know and maybe we'll do it for
you I'll take the highest request the
highest requested thing and that's what
we'll do for part 8 if you guys want to
continue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
