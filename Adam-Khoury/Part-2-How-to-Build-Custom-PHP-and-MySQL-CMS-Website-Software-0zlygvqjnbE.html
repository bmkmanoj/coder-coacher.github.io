creating custom CMS website systems
using PHP and MySQL and what we're going
to do is go into phpMyAdmin which is the
interface that interacts with the MySQL
database we created and we're going to
put in some dummy data and I like to do
that just to see how my menu is going to
be rendered and all the things like that
how the body information will look once
it's in there and other things and I
want to make my tables and get
everything set on the database end
before I get to creating forms that
people can use that don't know how to
program websites or HTML the WYSIWYG
forms basically input text fields input
text areas rather we'll just use input
text areas or WYSIWYG to take the data
from the people and the forms will be
specialized and custom to any way you
need them to be any kind of information
you need to take for the system to
operate okay so in PHP my admin here we
are on this sort of ER move this down a
bit
there we go and I'm showing all of my
information that normally you wouldn't
want to show anybody but this is cool
this is this whole setup is going to be
transferred over to a different setup
after the tutorial series I'm just going
to remove this database because I'm
paranoid like that and I'm going to
reassemble the new database to hold the
data ok so which is easy to do using the
export feature right here see export all
right now I named mine mr. magic Adam
which is kind of gay I know I'm a dork
like that and there's the information
schema which comes default inside the
database but here is our database
essentially right there and what we're
going to do is create a new table on it
you can either click it here or on the
home page there you can click whatever
where is it the database I think you
click databases and then you click mr.
magic Adam or whatever you named your
database and it allows you to create a
table here now the first table let's
just call it pages because this one will
hold all the pages and article type
things or whatever which they will be
mostly those types of things in the
database and let's give it a three one
two and three let's just say seven for
now now let's let's just give it ten
we'll make a few extras and then let me
shrink this down a bit
and then you can press where am i right
there
then press go and the first thing we'll
do is make the ID field which every
entry every page in the system has to
have its own unique ID so it's changes
from varchar' to int integer values you
can leave empty because this is going to
be auto increment so you switch this
extra option to auto increment and
that's all we need for that let's pull
this over so you can see it right here
make it primary that's it for the int
for the ID field now the next one will
make page title page title and this one
will be varchar' 255 now this one will
be our link label link label and we're
going to call it that because this is
what it will say in the menu which is
different from the page title page title
will be a little bit longer the link
label will be just a you know a button
label or a link label in a menu not too
many words you know maybe a couple at
the most and so the next thing is the
page body page buddy let's make sure we
give this varchar' 255 or we'll get an
error when we try and create the table
because we need a value in this field if
we're going to claim varchar' 255 is the
maximum of our char so I just used to
divide every time I use a bar chart
field I always set it to 255 usually
sometimes I'll set it down to 50 or
something like that but usually just 255
because that's the max number on it
anyway
and Paige body text now you can use text
if the page body is going to be like a
normal webpage it's going to be insanely
long you can use long text or medium
text I think are much bigger than
regular text but I'm just going to use
text it holds a lot you can check it the
PHP lessons the MySQL lessons rather a
develop PHP and it shows how much each
of these hold how much in bytes or
characters they can all handle some are
made with numbers some are made for
holding strings of text some are made
for date some are made for toggling like
enum is made for toggling between values
okay so page body is going to be text
and that doesn't have to have any value
here or anywhere through there and the
next thing we'll need is the order that
we want it to display in the menu so we
want to be able to order it in case we
want to move things around in our menu
have some pages more have more priority
than others okay now next is showing and
this will be a toggle enum let's see
what we have order this is going to be
int let's just make it we won't ever
have to get bigger than 11
it'll never have a value of length
longer than 11 characters that would be
an insane amount of pages
okay so page body that blank enum we
have to have default values in here like
it tells us if field type is enum or set
please enter the values using this
format ABCD so let's just put in a
couple of single quotes a comma another
couple of single quotes put a 0 here and
a 1 here oops and a 1 here
so zero means false and one means true
in the programming world so what it
means is if its current value is set to
one then it's true and it's going to
show showing if it's set to zero it's
going to be not showing in the menu and
we'll make this a default of one as we
want it to show by default the person
wants to shut it off we make a form with
a couple of radio buttons on/off next to
the radio buttons you know it's how it
works okay so there's four extras here
and let's say this is keywords and look
at that it's already there
this one is description and you can make
another one for creation time let's say
date time creation date maybe and you
can do modification date last time they
modify it you can record those type of
things but I'm just I'm not going to go
very far with this I'll show you
creation date now actually it's just two
last modified because that would show
everything but you can do a creation
date and last modified so I'll just have
last modified let's just make this one
extra not going to carried away here
nobody's paying for this let's go to
extras going to be varchar' 255 we'll
decide what we want to do with that
later if you want to add more they're
easy to add it's very easy to create
your tables and modify them within PHP
myadmin
last modified wants to be date or you
can use date/time and it will record the
minutes hour and seconds but I'm just
going to use date and that will record
just a date
and description that should be that
should be no larger than 255 actually if
it any larger than 255 it'll get cut off
see you going to our keywords same thing
page body is text okay we're looking
good for the date you don't have to have
a default value but you can if you like
anam we're set there it's got a default
auto increment and primary on the ID
field think we're looking good let's see
okay let's go save and we should have a
table already for making pages so now if
we hit now what's cool is I wanted to
show you guys if you haven't noticed yet
if you work in PHP myadmin this create
PHP code here's the the query the SQL
the raw SQL query it shows you what you
click create PHP code once what happens
in that nice PHP myadmin
hooks you up with a line of PHP right
there that will effectively create the
table okay so let's click pages there
and now here's the structure and looks
like I have everything I need so now I'm
going to press insert but before I put
data into this table let's make another
table so let's click mr. magic atom or
whatever you named your database you
click that right there
I'm going to put another table in it and
the table is this one we're just going
to call modules
and let's give this one just four four
fields press go now here's our four
fields let's give it an ID each one has
its own unique ID name and by the way
auto-increment
means if there is one in the system the
next one that goes in automatically gets
an ID of two then next one after that
gets an ID of three and they're all
unique and no two if you never have the
same ID okay so now we have name for the
module and the module body let's just
call a module body ed Lu module body and
then make this showing too so this will
be e num that's kind of like a toggle
single quote single quote comma single
quote single quote put a 1 put a 0 in
between the first set of single quotes
and there we go and this is default one
showing and let's say module body text
and the varchar' for the name 255 is
good ID is going to be the integrand and
auto increment primary make sure you hit
that primary radio button there and that
is good I'm not creating any indexes on
these tables really if you want to learn
how to create indexes on your tables
it's very easy
there's index right there you just make
that an index if you think it's going to
be a field it's going to be really
accessed a lot you might want to use
that as an index in the field but I
think mine is going to default to the ID
as index okay so let's press save
there we go I have both tables that I
need basically for the whole system now
what it's going to be is like modules is
going to be something that is not really
added to in my system but you can make
it to where you're yourself or your
clients can make more modules and add to
that table but mine is just going to be
like containers per the modules only the
ones I set pages on the other hand is
going to be where they can be just added
to and created more and more and more
and more right on top and the database
will hold many thousands as many as as
many as you can get in there basically
so now let's go into the pages database
and you hit insert I'm going to put in
some dummy data that way on the site we
can go ahead and program to display that
dummy data just to see how things are
going to look and then we'll FTP
everything up to the web and test it
okay so let's go back to the server here
and we're at insert so here if you're at
your pages you're looking at the
structure then you just want to go to
insert right there now we're going to
insert a page page title is going to be
home homepage central home page of my
magic website and then the link label or
you can just name the home page my magic
website if yours was a hardware store
you would say Jones hardware whatever ok
the link label on that one to say home
that's what usually says for an index
page and then page body basically our
index page is going to be one page is
going to run the whole thing the whole
shebang and that's what the beautiful
thing is wait till you see how slim it
is I mean once you start adding things
you might get a few more files but it's
really not necessary to have very many
files
ok so page body is
and say welcome to my home page say
strong I'm just going to show you how
you can throw HTML right in there
that'll make it bold if you use strong
this is using HTML to make bold style
text then you just close up your strong
tag now when this renders out to the
page that little part of the sentence
right there it's going to be everything
in between the strong tags is going to
be bold you can even make it underlined
too if you just put a underline tag in
between strong tags there see you now
it'll be underlined and strong so that
just shows you the HTML can go right
into that that field as much as you need
and then order by one let's make this a
1 and the next page will be 2 if we want
that to show up under the home link and
so on and so forth then keywords let's
just say home page
let's just say how to build dynamic
website you can put commas in between
there or you can use PHP to add the
comments for you
PHP can just snatch those spaces right
up and add a comma and a space you can
do cool stuff with PHP okay dynamic
website MySQL PHP blah blah blah that
way whatever and let's put CMS in there
too now the description is has to be a
certain length if it's too short the
search engines don't like that for some
reason this is my freaking cool ass
magic one-page huge giant indexing mega
beast of a website
suck on that hosers okay now last
modified would be right now so you just
click that little button by tapping
purple and extra just leave it blank so
that is page one
let's make a page to make this page
title about then link label about page
title will be about this website about
magic websites and then the page body
will be here is where I list HTML style
HTML or CSS styled step outta to render
my about page I'll be changing that up
later on just want to get some examples
in order by - actually I don't think we
can name that order I'm going to have to
change the name of that or I think we'll
get an error order I think it's
especially it's a reserved name in MySQL
I do believe I don't think you can use
that for field names
I should be spanked on the wrist with a
hard very very hard ruler
okay so now keywords and whatever blah
blah blah description I'm not even going
to put one you can put one if you want
and last modified and put it again for
today now when we press go we'll have
two pages
because Israel is okay good
okay now let's browse that table press
browse and you'll see we have pages 1 &amp;amp;
2 or the home page and the about page
and they have an ID of 1 &amp;amp; 2 and it
doesn't matter if they had an ID of
1,057 and 1058 or 1000 and 1037 it
doesn't matter what there either because
they're always going to be always going
to be unique ok so we have everything we
need here now all we need is a module
let's go to modules it's going to add
I'm just going to go ahead and add dummy
data for each module and it's the same
thing with the modules or modules keep
saying it like there's an A in between
you and the L module and so there's the
same thing you can put HTML data
straight into the modules module body
see right there so let's go to insert on
this one just put up some dummy data I'm
not going to make it officially what I
want just yet until I get my forms in
place for my admin my little admin
center my back-end admin center where I
really facilitate the management of my
website kind of like Joomla and
WordPress give you I'll show you how to
make a very basic very very basic admin
center okay so module body is going to
be links go here to various pages and
the name
this one's going to be put I still have
to change the name of that other thing
in that of the table order I think we
can do that
okay so border links go here to various
pages and then the next module this is
my custom mod tool I can put
any HTML doctor here let's call this
custom custom one showing us ID we'll
get Auto incremented we don't have to
put any values in the ID field it'll
happen on its own
since we have Auto increment set and I
think that's it let's go ahead and press
GO now we have a couple of custom
modules that we made that will be on
every page of the site if you want them
to show you know you got that showing
toggle there let's see let's go to pages
again and change this order because I
really do think that's going to give us
an error it's the name change the name
of this LTI border change it to a page
order that way we won't have any
conflicts if there happened to be any
that come up because I think that's an
assigned name order you have to use
something like ordering or ordered or
page order something like that damn just
so it's not order maybe you can't use
order by rows but we're going to say
page order in that field yes sir
okay now for save it's been adjusted it
has a new name that's good so that's how
you can get adjustments here you can
delete the field altogether you can use
the unique index and full text if you
want to and also the primary usually
primaries used to the ID fields it's
Auto increment alrighty I think we have
everything we need now and so we're
going to stop this lesson right here and
we'll say in part three I'm going to
show you how to go into the site
programming here and make it render the
page menu listing
dynamically according to how many there
are in the database and what they're
named and in the body of those sections
we'll go here the body sections for
those respective pages we'll go here
custom module that I made is going to
appear here and photo is going to appear
here very a say and this doesn't even
have to be referred to in a database
because guess what you can just make an
inform
original HTML form in the admin center
that would swap that image out a simple
image upload form and the programming
for the PHP would be directed to
overwrite this image and put the new one
in its place very very easy you don't
even need the MySQL interaction for that
one unless you really want it to okay so
we'll see you in part 3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
