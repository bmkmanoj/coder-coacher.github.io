learn to program a header that magically
changes as a user Scrolls down the page
a little bit when the user Scrolls back
to the top of the page we'll make the
header change back to its original
display mode let's take a look at the
finished product of the exercise I'll
grab the scroll bar and I'll begin to
scroll down the page now when I do watch
the header and the menu system see the
header collapsed or became smaller or
went into an incognito mode while the
user is scrolling down all the content
the page when the user Scrolls back to
the top watch the header you'll see it
all comes back along with the menu
system and it happens in an animated
fashion so it has a cool animated effect
as well and I made it happen too when
the scroll reaches around 150 pixels
down into the page and that's really the
basic guts of the lesson you want to be
able to listen for the scroll event and
then you want to evaluate if it reaches
150 pixels down into the page that's
when you want to make the header change
okay we're going to begin with the bare
bones of an html5 web document the first
thing we'll do is add the little bit of
HTML we're going to need for this
example first we need a div with an ID
equal to page top let's make sure we go
down a couple of lines and close that
div now we're going to put a child div
inside of that div this one's going to
have an ID of menu and we can type menu
system in the inner HTML of that div and
this is where you would put all of your
link elements or your button elements
that make up your menu system really you
don't even have to have a menu system
there I just wanted to show an example
of how to collapse two items this way
you can collapse or expand or change the
properties any CSS properties that you
want to change in an animated fashion
for any elements that you have so you
can reposition things when the menu or
the header change you can make things
fade
now you can make the height change which
is what I'm going to do in this lesson
we're going to make the heights change
to create the effect that you saw in the
demo and for the innerhtml
of the header which I named page top I'm
just going to put the word header now
underneath our page top container we're
going to have another container that is
the wrapper for the rest of the content
the normal default content that would be
on your page that the user is going to
scroll up and down so I name that div
wrapper and inside of it I just put a
little script that's going to put some
dummy page content many lines it's going
to put 40 lines of dummy page content
it's going to be 40 h2 elements
we're using a simple for loop for that
in JavaScript and you don't have to
concern yourself with that because you
would have actual page content inside of
your wrapper element and that's it for
the HTML now we'll apply some CSS to
this page top element the menu element
and the wrapper so here in the style
element we're going to pop in the rule
for the page top now the way we get the
animated effect is simply putting the
transition property on it and we put the
other properties and CSS that we want to
affect in an animated sort of way so
we're going to affect the height and the
padding of that header in an animated
fashion now when the change comes it's
going to happen in JavaScript but even
though the change is going to happen in
JavaScript for instance we're just going
to instruct JavaScript to change the CSS
of this element and since we have
applied this transition it's going to be
an animated effect we don't have to put
any animation or reference any
animations when we change the property
in JavaScript all we have to do is
simply change the property from one
value to the next and then and the fact
that we have this transition property in
place means it will be an animated
effect even though javascript is going
to be the technology that's
instructing the change now the next rule
we're going to put in places for the
menu div that's the child div inside of
page top which is this guy right here so
these properties affect that div and
this one is only going to have an
animated effect on the height and
finally in the CSS we're going to add a
rule for our wrapper div which is the
wrapper that wraps all of your normal
page content we're going to make the
margin top 230 pixels that way it rests
where we want beneath the magic header
so I'm going to go ahead and collapse
all of the CSS just so it's not in our
way visually and we're going to work in
the script element now to add the
JavaScript needed to make these changes
happen when the scroll position reaches
a certain point so in order to listen
for the vertical scrolling of the page
we're just going to add a listener to
the window window to add event listener
the scroll event so when the user
Scrolls with their mouse wheel or by
dragging the bar or any way they scroll
the page this Y scroll function is going
to fire off so we need to write that Y
scroll function right now we type in
function Y scroll open close parentheses
opening curly brace and closing curly
brace now the first thing we'll do is
get object references with two elements
on the page that we want to affect its
page top and the menu so we can put
those variables here actually we can
assign those variables outside of the
function which would be a little more
efficient if we put var page top comma
menu now we've assigned those variables
first thing in our program and they'll
be available inside of this function as
well so we say for the page type
variable we make that equal to document
dot get element by ID page top so now we
have an object reference with page top
and object reference for the menu now
let's go ahead and put one more variable
called why pose and that's going to
represent the Y position of where the
user has scrolled down into the page now
in your Y scroll function it's easy to
get that value so we say Y pose is equal
to window page Y offset so you can get
the value or the number of pixels that
the user has scrolled down into the page
by using the window page Y offset
property now once you have that number
all you have to do is put a simple
if-else condition statement it's very
simple logic your program just has to be
able to read the scroll position of
where the user is in the scroll position
of the page and then do things according
to that that's how simple it is okay so
let me put in that if-else condition
statement right now and I'll explain it
to you so here it is a simple if-else
condition statement so we write if the Y
pose is greater than 150 pixels and you
can set this number to anything you want
if you want to happen a little sooner
just put that on 100 if you want to
happen a little later when they scroll
down a little further into the page and
put this on a greater number like 400 so
I just said if it gets to 150 pixels
then the page top elements height is
going to be changed to 36 pixels the
page table elements padding top is going
to be changed to 8 pixels and you can
see from their original setting when the
page loads we have it has a padding top
of 50 pixels and a height of 120 so
we're giving it a pretty drastic change
in height and the padding then we're
telling the menu style dot height to
equal zero and just go away completely
now else if the Y position is less than
150 this else condition is going to fire
off this code and the menu will go back
to its original full display state 120
pixel height padding top of 50 and then
the menu comes back into view for the
user
use it's that simple this really nothing
complex going on at all the math is
simple the logic is simple everything is
simple there's no frameworks that are
needed it's a really cool effect that
requires very little mental work to
produce and I've tested this in all the
major popular browsers let's take one
last look at the finished effect so when
I scroll down a little bit either with
my mouse or by dragging the bar as I
scroll up and down the page the header
in the menu system magically changed in
an animated fashion if you enjoyed the
