here in this part of the series part 7
we're going to really zoom ahead and
pick up the pace and get the whole thing
done so you can see here we have volume
slider we have the playhead dragger you
can click anywhere in that playhead jump
to that part of the song the list is
complete we're showing song data here of
the current song is playing we have a
pause play toggle button stop button
next previous buttons works beautifully
the buttons are really set up smart the
way they should to loop through out the
list and we have a graphic equalizer I
chose to put the status text up in the
equalizer there you can remove and add
things that you need
this is the kind of player has
everything you need externally
configured that way it can be used for
all kind of situations whether you're
hosting a community and you want all of
the members different mp3's to play
through this thing if you know how to
program with PHP it can be quite easy
for you so and you can also use it on
your personal website just as a cool
player design it set your XML
configuration file up boom you're good
to go okay now and it's also handy to
note that somebody who doesn't even have
flash could just pick up this file and
use this thing on their website using
the external XML configuration file to
tweak it what it's going to play what
everything is named everything like that
now we're going to save ourselves a lot
of time here and zoom through the next
parts of the lesson because we already
have most of it laid out if you go to
develop PHP the adobe flash section
there's video tutorials and free files
and stuff and you go down to the sound
and mp3 section here you'll see I have
tutorials previous tutorials set up and
source files I'm going to grab this boom
box here download it to my desktop and
then use a lot of the items that are
programmed into this thing into our new
player
okay so let's open up that boom box
which is right here we downloaded it
let's open the source file into flash
very good now let's open part 6 so now
we can finish this thing up let's go
here part 6 right there now since I've
made since i program my players
similarly you can see that this one if
you go inside it has a hole player movie
clip as well and it's a very similar
setup as three frames that power the
application so in our playlist player
there's a whole player of movie clip
inside and look at that there's three
frames to power the application but very
different programming well not not
wildly different but there's different
programming set up to power this
playlist you'll notice that the boom box
has no playlist it just shows the
current track playing there and you have
to click forward and back to get through
all of them there's 50 in there that'll
be a problem with the playlist player if
there's 50 it's not a problem so there's
different programming but we can easily
chintz code from this one and put it
into this one and you guys really you
can go right now and just have a ball
probably but I'm going to guide a few
people that might need help through
adding these items to the other player
alright the first item that I'm going to
take and use first items are these three
buttons here so let's press control C go
to our playlist player and let's press
control V on the layer where we want to
put it let's put it with the player
stuff control V alrighty
let's just grab everything we need let's
grab the volume slider we also want this
song durations just grab that and yeah
we can grab the amounts as well and what
else do we need let's grab this playhead
dragger that way people can drag the
playhead and this current song playing I
don't think I'm going to grab that
scrolling current song playing movie
clip I think that's all I want control
see let me go here play your stuff ctrl
v right now we got all kind of cool
items and it looked like they might fit
in place real nice too so I'm going to
fit all of these things into place on my
player get it looking the way I want
okay now I've got all of my items in
place where I want them and in the code
I also added the status text field to
update when the list went automatically
to reduce song it updates the status
text build now and adding this code
right here right after you define the
new track to play you just update the
status text field inside of that new
track function for each section in the
if and the else say status text and
status text is updated now now since the
main priority of this whole lesson has
been how to program the list and we have
now completed that task way in depth I
mean I waited like six parts to it where
I was showing you how to just program
that playlist pretty much well the part
6 was the graphic equalizer tutorial but
that needed to be shown in depth as well
now with the rest of the stuff we can
fly because it's all stuff that was in
our boom box player and i'm just going
to snatch up code like for instance the
code that's going to make this playhead
dragger and show the song progress
that's all set up and ready to go the
volume dragger all set up and ready to
go the only thing we have to worry about
is the differences in the next and
forward buttons and this play and pause
has the Paul is set up in it so this is
a play button that when you click it if
it's playing it'll show pause if you
click it it pauses the song then if you
click it again it resumes the song so
it's smarter to have a play/pause
toggling kind of kind of button instead
of having a play button and then a pause
button sitting next to it because most
modern players have a play/pause toggle
type button so that's all we have to
worry about is really the stop buttons
already programmed all we have to do is
program these three things a little bit
differently than the boom box is
programmed but like I said the volume
dragger and the song playhead and adding
the information to these dynamic text
fields is already taken care of
Boris through the code in the boom box
now i'm going to chance a lot of this
code here and then i'm going to explain
it will get all these things working
inside of this mp3 playlist player and
we'll call it quits in part 7 here will
be done okay now I want to show the
playing time and the full duration time
of each song that happens to be playing
so I'm going to add code into that inter
frame event again right here under where
the volume functionality is happening
and there it is you can see under the
volume code there's two sections here
one for getting the full time of the
song the full duration of the song
playing and the next is forgetting the
play time of the song which is where it
is within the song so this should all
work and be set up because we're using
the same sound object code yes yes
everything good and the all the text
fields are already here on stage for
that so let's see if that works press
ctrl enter see it's 59 seconds that one
song and you can see how it's changing
dynamically in the enter frame event of
how much the song has progressed you go
to the next song or any song in the list
that one's only 15 seconds long
so that's all working now next thing on
my agenda is to get that progress bar
and the playhead dragger the scrubber
working so let's go into that back into
that end the frame event here we're
going to put one more section in for
that let's go down a couple of lines and
there it is starting right here to right
there that code will take care of the
playhead dragger and the progress bar
now let's see okay so I wanted to get my
playhead scrubber and the progress bar
to operate so what I did was went into
the inter-frame event where we have the
EQ bars and everything going to the
volume dragger and what we needed to put
in with something to make the progress
bar move along as the song progressed
and so I added these lines from the boom
box then I added a whole new function
outside of the enter frame event
function and this is a dragging code for
the scrubber and the playhead now we
have a function drag scrub and function
drop scrub so each of these functions
handle what happens when somebody is
dragging and dropping that scrubber
right here
so when I drag it and I programmed in a
cool ghost knob in to the boom box it'll
be in this one too so the ghost knob
shows them where they're going to drop
when they get ready to drop they let go
it snaps to that part of the song pretty
cool so what we do is inside of those
functions is actually you can read the
code because I commented out the code
pretty good I'm not going to waste your
time and I have a lot of other things to
do so just read the comments in the code
and track to play is the only thing I
had to add to make it work for our
playlist say I added that one line but
this drop scrub and drag scrub function
and these listeners and these few
variables here are the same from the
boom box so you can see what kind of
variables i'm setting up and on frame 1
i had to add is playing a boolean
variable and i just set it to false
because it's not going to be playing on
frame 1 but when it gets the frame 3 i
added right here is playing equals true
right after we set the storm to start
playing that takes care of the scrubber
and the progress ok everything is
working beautifully so far it seems easy
to take things from the other player and
put them into this one since the sound
programming is very much the same now
all the thing I have left to do is make
this play pause toggle button work and
the forward and back buttons make the
songs go up and down in the list and the
list component and make them play so I'm
going to tackle this play pause button
first let's go into the code and
independent of any of these other
functions we can put this new one in
there's the stop button listener so
let's go right there right under it
and here's play and pause function now
let's see if everything is set up right
to just work right out the box here I
took it straight from the boom box code
let's see
now does not work we have an instance
name of play underscore BTN
I'm a dope let me go get the listeners
stupid the listener for the play button
which we don't have and there they are
let's just grab all three of those
because we're going to need them let's
grab that title button listeners and
let's go back in and I'm going to leave
this little goof up in the video so you
can see what should I put the listeners
let's set the listeners down under the
button functions under the stop button
function to play button function i'm
going to put the listeners there and i'm
going to comment these two out because
we're not ready for them just yet we
just want to get that played pause
button Morgan alright let's tackle
making this next button work which is
going to be very easy because we already
have a function for making it go to the
next song so let's uncomment let's see
let's make sure this is click I also
went click instead of going to new track
let's go to the function call play next
now let's create that function really
quick let's say let's just grab this
and scrub the whole title and everything
so we can label it correctly nest it off
and inside that function nest i'm going
to add new track just like we did in the
own complete playback function and
that's it so that will be for the make
sure we rename this play next function
play next play next button play next
button function let's just go ahead and
make another one really quick this will
be for the play previous now let's test
out of our next button worked here let's
remove that for now so play next should
fire off the function say that it'll go
all the way through the list and then
back to one all the way to go back to
one all the way through that one's
working ok so that completes it i added
the code here that is the previous play
function the next play function was easy
the next button because we already had
that new track function set up and ready
to go previous button took a little more
work as you can see that function is
let's it looks like about almost 50
lines a few variables getting set in
there and i commented out the code
really well so i'm not going to explain
it to you here and plus everybody's
complaining this is all taking too long
so you can just dig into the code for
yourself study it get to know it change
it around however you need it and i set
up the now playing amount down here i
think under the listeners right here
place the track and mountain current
track number into our text field so it
says now playing song to total it up put
it up and i chose to put our status text
over here so you can see what that does
you know the status changes their shows
the song is playing up top in the
equalizer okay we hope you've enjoyed
this series and we will see you in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
