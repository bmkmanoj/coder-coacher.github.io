tutorial brought to you by flash
building in this one I'm gonna show you
how to put bling bling on thing dings
anything shiny that you have in your on
your stage or maybe in an image if you
have light shining on it or any object
that you want to have a sparkle and
animated sparkle on that's what I'm
gonna show you how to do make these cool
animated sparkles that are time
separated a little bit alright have fun
okay first things first let's get the
image that the client gave us into flash
ctrl C so I press ctrl C when I
highlight the image there now it's in my
clipboard let's go create a new flash
document press ctrl V it's gonna bring
it in as a movie clip okay so now we
have our picture sitting there and all
we have to do is get some animated
sparkles on it so to do that an easy way
to do that is just go into fireworks and
grab yourself a star and let's make it 8
points you can see mine is set within
the lips so let's make it solid solid
white let's give it an ellipse once we
get back in the flash let's just shape
it here that looks good to me
ctrl C and you can make yours for point
some people prefer maybe a 6 point or a
4 point sparkle I like the four point
sparkles they look good
I also like the 8 point sparkles right
ciao okay press control C now once we
bring it into flash its going to be a
native shape still let's bring it in as
movie clip
now you see if we double-click inside
this movie clip it's a group now we
double-click inside the group and
there's a drawing object so if you go to
the fill color give it an ellipse and go
into the color palette
make sure it's white on both ends and
the end where the points are you just go
and make it opaque click that one go to
alpha zero there we go and now what I'm
going to do is also add let me not move
that yet
let's go back out to where that's a
movie clip on the main scene I'm a
double click inside of it again and I'm
going to give it an oval shape right on
top right about like that and it's
already has the ellipse that we want
let's make it a little bit a little bit
brighter in the center I'm gonna make it
a little bit bigger actually so it has
more of a fuzzy look to it
just brighten up that Center a bit there
we go
make it even a little bigger okay
that'll do now if we look at it it has a
nice bright spot in the center which is
cooed and we're not gonna want it to be
that big but we can size this thing any
way we want
okay so all we have to do now is animate
this sparkle so let's go and bring it
where we want it to be we're gonna make
it a little bit smaller so let's just
drag it over to where I'm gonna want one
on the top of this bracelet top of that
bracelet maybe one on the nail there
let's go ahead okay let's put it on the
nail first now let's put it in the
bracelet first okay now I'm gonna create
a new layer for this actually so let's
press ctrl X get it off of that layer
make a new layer press ctrl shift to V
that's good name this one picture this
one sparkles
now
we can resize this let's bring that dot
to the center then actually let's just
go ahead and convert it to a symbol
convert the symbol movie clip call it
sparkle sparkle one all right now it has
a central registration because right
when I created that movie clip if you
rewind just a little bit you'll notice
it had a center registration when I
created it okay so now all we have to do
is go inside of this and animate it so
on the first keyframe inside of that
movie clip I just double clicked to get
inside of it let's go ahead and get the
free transform tool selected and bring
this dot to the very center now when you
skew it it will spin on its center axis
right there let's move it there and now
what's gonna happen is we'll make two
more keyframes let's go to maybe about
ten and maybe about nine and then out to
18 create motion tween create motion
tween now let's give it what we want to
do is make sure that in the center it's
the largest that we want to see it on
the bracelet there right about there is
viewed that's a little big but I want a
dramatic just to show it off not show it
off but show off the effect better a lot
of you guys can make this sparkle
probably a lot better than I can and you
probably will okay so I'm gonna bring
this one down all the way almost to
nothing I'm gonna skew it a bit let's
just spin it around then go to alpha
none I'm gonna do the same thing over
here this time I'm going to spin it the
other way
well let me first skew it down or scale
it down then I'm going to spin it this
way skew it that way let's go to alpha
none make sure the first one is alpha
none to alpha none or zero bring the
framerate up to 30 and if you're working
in cs4 your framerate will already be 30
but by default in cs3 it's 12 so you
might want to bring that up to 30 if
you're in cs3
now let's press control enter and see
what we have okay that's cool
but it's going it's pumping just a
little too fast and constant it's just
looping over and over and over and over
and over so what we want to do is go out
to maybe Q frame or frame 60 and we'll
press f5 now let's press control enter
and look and you'll see that it's not so
constant and every few seconds it fires
off it's very cool
okay now let's click scene one against
get to the main timeline now we have a
little movie clip there but you can't
really see it because it's alpha zero on
the first frame of that clip on the
inside of that clip so let's just go
ahead and highlight it press control C
let's go ahead and lock the picture
layer so we don't put anything there
press control C with the little star
highlighted or the little animation we
just made press control V now you have
two of them one there and one there now
this one you can go to modify transform
flip vertical and this way it won't do
such a mimicking animation of the one
sitting right next to it they'll be a
little bit different so let's take a
look at that press control enter
that's cool but we don't really want
them to fire off all at the same time so
let's go ahead and give this a couple
more layers let's get one more star
going ctrl-c ctrl-v let's put it in snow
one down here on the nail where it's
shiny right there and we're also going
to zoom in to about 400 and resize that
one a little bit so we don't want it as
big as those other ones but we do want
to see it a bit so I resize it and I'm
gonna go ahead and modify this one
transform rotate rotate this one 90
degrees just to give it some variation
now I'm going to grab it press control X
get it off of that layer put it on the
topmost layer ctrl shift to V let's go
back to 100 I'm gonna grab this one here
that's on the second bracelet press
control X and get it on this layer ctrl
shift V now let's press control enter
and they'll all be still firing off at
the same time and I'm gonna show you how
to fix that in a second but let's just
take a look it's great this one right
here is really nice and subtle more like
you would want these are just made
really big for just showing off the
demonstration real good but you really
want them nice and subtle to get the
smoothest and most impressive effect all
right so now let's get these things
separated out so they don't fire off
such as or so much at the same time and
it uh it just has a more realistic bling
bling effect going on we're not
realistic but just a more engaging cool
bling bling effect okay now let's go to
the picture layer bring it out to about
50
by pressing f5 to make extend the frames
out not making key frames just extending
them out now let's go to the sparkles
layer well though all three of these are
sparkles you name this sparkle one you
can name this one sparkle two and this
one sparkle three
okay so sparkle one we want to buy off
on frame one and extend all the way out
to fifty as well so that's good
sparkle two we want to fire off at frame
a safe frame ten and then extend out to
fifty sparkle three we want to start at
frame 20 and extend out to frame 50 so
let's see what happens
control-enter there we go now you can
see they have a more of a randomized and
different time spaced animation play
when each open fires off now
so let's just go ahead and grab a few
more watch what I do here control I'm
gonna grab this one control see put it
on the same layer with that one control
V and just make sure you take it and put
it where you want it I'm gonna add a few
of these control C control V put a
little tiny one over here somewhere
right there
and grab another one of these big ones
control C control V I'm gonna put that
right about here and resize that just a
little bit there we go so that should
give me a nice full random looking thing
let's press control enter beautiful
that's how it works
so if you want to put bling bling on
your grill or whatever you have that
shiny jewelry just a shiny side of any
kind of object if it's 3d looking
whatever has light shining on it on the
brightest part this is great to put
these on and to really the video won't
show this animation real well but you
can click the link in the description of
the video to see the animation on page
really well and see it how its intended
to look and the video won't do it
justice and I know you guys probably
look at the video this animation right
now and saying wow that doesn't look
that great but just go look at the page
looks a lot better and oh yeah since I
give away all of my source files for
download so everybody can see a good
demo an example of the working file you
can just take my little star movie clip
you won't even have to make your own you
can just take my little stars and pop
them in like I did okay you have fun
with it we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
