creating fast-loading power sites where
we're using HTML basic CSS and all of
our own custom graphics that we can
create in any design program to create a
fast loading validating power site what
we want to do is go into a text editor
I'm going to go into Dreamweaver cs4 but
like I said you can be in any text
editor you want i'm going to show you
all the code i'm going to go into
Dreamweaver cs4 I'm going to take all
these pieces that we peaced out last
time the background the body the footer
and the header and we're going to make
it to where the body auto expands to
hold all of the page content that we
desire to have on each individual page
we're going to go here to the website
validation service you can go to google
and just type in website validation
service google search and that first
result will be the w3c market validation
which is the web's official validator
there is no better so when you want to
validate your website you just go here
so what we'll do is we'll set our files
up we'll ftp it to the web and then
we'll see if it validates and then we're
going to put the little validate icon
right on the bottom of our site so that
way as we produce through production we
can just keep clicking on that to see if
our website doesn't does indeed still
validate all through production to
completion that way we can just keep our
HTML and CSS validation symbols there to
let people know that we're top notch
developers now it's important to realize
that we're going to rely on our text
editor and CSS and HTML to really get
the site powered i'm not using Fireworks
for any I'm not setting up any links I'm
not setting up any menus nothing I'm
going to sit all of that up and CSS and
HTML maybe use a little JavaScript if I
want a cool menu but that's all going to
be done in the in the text editor side
so basically you could use paint to make
your graphics if
you want or some very very basic design
program that has no ability to create
links and make web layouts you can use
an art program that does not have the
ability to create web layouts if you're
following my technique here okay so at
this point if you set it up the way you
like it you won't ever have to enter
your art graphics design program again
and we'll be working in Dreamweaver now
or whatever text editor you use if
you're in notepad plus plus or if you're
just did notepad or wordpad you can
follow along so I'll show you all the
code that will power everything and it's
not Dreamweaver specific code is code
works in any text editor all right so
let's go create a new HTML file and
first thing we're going to do is title
it so you put your title of your website
right there for your homepage because
this is going to be the index file let's
just go ahead and save it as the index
file in our root directory file save as
we're going to navigate to that folder
on our machine where we're building our
site into the root folder you go into
that index and it'll be an HTML
extension let's go to HTML save so we
now we have an index HTML which is the
home page of your website you put it in
a root directory on your server online
and it comes up as the home page of your
website now we're going to add a few
things here into the the head of the
document see the head tags here there's
two things in it already title and the
meta tag right there we're going to add
a few more things for optimizing the
site making it more friendly for search
engine okay as you can see i added a few
things inside of the head tag and if you
have any problems viewing the code any
syntax even down to the last little
period there make sure you full screen
this video and set it to the highest
resolution on youtube or wherever you're
watching it you can set the resolution
and in the the bar below you can also
set it to full screen which will help
you see a lot of this stuff if you have
in trouble what we did was he added a
meta tag for the description and I say
put your home page description
information
should be a couple of long sentences
then the key words which I put key word
one key phrase one key phrase to keyword
two key phrase three you could jumbled
up any keywords and key phrases for your
content into your keywords tag and
Google is reporting that description and
keywords tags are not as effective the
meta tags are not as effective as they
used to be for search engine
optimization Google more looks at the
page content itself but I use
description and keyword tags because
there are still other search engines and
systems out there that do rely and use
those because there's a lot of people
that are hip to description and keyword
tags and they use them and maybe they'll
have a site that doesn't have the sort
of content that their description and
keywords should have in it and they
might use the description and keywords
tag to fool the search engines and I
think that's why Google is focusing less
on these description and keywords tags
but I still use them anyway because it
seems to help my search engine
optimization now the rating tag is
another meta tag that I set to general
and you can research all the different
settings for all these different meta
tags if you want i'm not going to go
through all the different options and
then the made a name tag for revisit
after 14 days so i'm telling the search
engine BOTS to come back and re spider
my site every 14 days re access the
information on it every 14 days and then
the robots tag which is directing all
robots so we're not denying any robots
any search engine BOTS or anything from
coming to our page or allowing
everything the next one is the style
sheet which we don't even have set up
yet so let's comment that out but we're
going to we're going to uncomment that
and apply it when we get our style sheet
set up and I'm gonna name mine main one
let's just name it main main.css and
then we have the link icon for our fav
icon so you have I use both the icon and
the shortcut icon link tag to enable
showing my fav icon which is that little
right there see those little icons w3
has one developed PHP has one and web
intersect is also going to have one so
you see it pops up in the address bar in
the tabs and it's a nice a nice
professional thing to have on your site
so you make yourself a fav icon you put
it in your root directory and these tags
will help the page pick it up then
there's the title tag that's everything
inside of my head tag that i'm going to
put i might add some things later like
if I want to add the jQuery library a
link to the jQuery scripts then I can
add that later on when I'm ready to add
some JavaScript some cool javascript
stuff to my site now each page is going
to pretty much follow the same basic
structure it'll have this kind of
similar information in the head tag but
each page will have a different title
because you might you might get some
errors in the in Google's webmaster
tools if your pages have the same title
I think it throws an error in the google
webmaster tools google webmaster tools
help you optimize your site so having
different title tags and description and
keywords is is necessary for each
independent page on your site has to
have a different description different
keywords and different title I don't
think they cannot I don't think any two
can be alike for any page so when I go
to make my about page I'm just going to
save file save as about HTML and it'll
have the same structure i'll just go in
and change the title keywords and
description everything else stay exactly
the same because you want your fav icon
to show up on every page and you want
these things to be the same for every
page now in the body section is where
the items for the page will
oh that actually show on the page you
see if we press design mode in
Dreamweaver it's blank right now there's
nothing on the page but if i type in
hello world into design view you're
going to see it pop up into the body
section back in code view you see hello
world is now sitting within the body tag
so everything that's viewable on your
web page pretty much it's going to go
inside of the body tag and that's the
content that you want to deliver to
people allow people to see now I thought
long and hard about this whether i
should use tables or dibs i know that
the CSS guys are going to get really
angry at me but i'm going to use tables
for layout and it's a big big no-no in
the CSS ubergeek land but those guys a
lot of those guys don't have very
powerful sites that get a lot of traffic
I happen to have a site that gets decent
traffic and I have tables for layout
everywhere the reason why I'm using
tables because easier it's going to make
the tutorial faster I do know how to use
divs exclusively for layout but that
would take a long time to show everybody
in depth what they need to know to
really master CSS div programming for
full layout come on that takes a lot of
time to master something like that you
guys have to admit if you are a CSS
rubra dork you know that takes a while
to really master layout if you're going
to use dibs exclusively and there won't
be any drawbacks to the way I'm going to
program this so let's go ahead and add a
table hey I'm going to add a table width
is not important and I don't care what
this is going to show me I'm just going
to put one row one column no padding and
no cell spacing okay so you see I have a
table sitting here and I'm going to go
to table style background image and
guess what I'm going to browse for that
root folder and in the style Boulder
there's the header snatch it up
and we're going to have it referring to
style header for the moment we might
change that location soon and now we
have to go in fireworks and check out
the dimensions on our header the
dimensions are canvas size 974 by 195
great let's go into Dreamweaver put a
semicolon space with 974 I think it was
p x 4 pixels semicolon space height was
195 pixels now see what we have see
there within that table you now have
your custom graphics look at this you
just type right on top of it so you can
put any HTML content up in here any
links you can put flash object files
anything you want now watch how easy it
is to center this thing which is why I'm
opting for word using tables it's just
easier to make my tutorial go faster CSS
guys please leave me alone center there
now the next table let's just do this
ctrl-c ctrl-v this one is also set to
Center and it might look off-kilter to
you in the design view but that's okay
don't worry about what the design view
showing you the design view in any text
editor especially Dreamweaver can
sometimes be deceptive to what's
actually going to show on the page so
you should reload rely on your code
skills somewhat so this is going to be
body
it's not going to have a height set on
it because we wanted to auto expand but
we wanted to keep that with now let's
just take that table and it has a space
in it so far and that's all that's in it
now let's put it in the footer table and
we're done with the whole layout and
tell me that wasn't easy all the CSS
guys going crazy right now because of
what I'm doing but look how easy it is
and it's going to validate it's going to
be a power site fast loading awesome and
they look the same in every single
browser we're going to I'm going to show
you how it looks in safari internet
explorer chrome and firefox now this one
has to say footer I'm sorry I'm taking
so much time directing attention to the
CSS uber geeks but I know they're going
to be trying to jump down my throat and
I'm trying to stop them from doing that
beforehand because they don't really
understand and none of these CSS guys
that are going to come and bark at me
have a populist I think it's a lot of
traffic but yet they think they're
awesome so that's all I have to say
about that now let's look at the design
view you see here we have a body a
header and footer and in the body I can
just type stuff in and as I go pressing
you see how it auto expands the body is
auto expanding to whatever amount of
content I happen to have in it and
that's the smart way to design a website
that way you're not limited to page
heights now let's take a look at the
page and try to get rid of any design
flaws we see you can see at the top will
need to set margin 20 to get rid of that
design flaw we don't want that space on
top there we want a nice and snug up to
the top of the browser window and on the
bottom you can see our folder has a
couple of extra pixels there that we
don't want so let's go into the code
let's close that first let's go into the
code and add a height value to this
footer that matches the height value of
the actual graphics that we saved i ght
colon will make this think it was 16 and
works 16 pixels was the height of our
footer graphics and make sure we remove
this space that's in there if you have a
space or any characters in there it's
going to make that larger than 16
usually but if you have a footer that is
maybe 32 pixels high or higher you can
put words and all kind of buttons and
stuff in it but i'm going to have mine a
nice little tiny footer so let's go to
design view and you can see now our
footer doesn't have those extra pixels
on the bottom now it's perfect now let's
go to page properties and i'm going to
show you what this does to the code view
you go to CSS and we're going to add the
background file root folder there's our
style folder and there's the BG let's
load that bad boy in we're also going to
get rid of the top margin let's just
make all four margin zero except the
bottom let's leave that default apply ok
now you can see that our background
image is on there too now we want to
make sure the background image let's go
into the code view and see what it did
it added style tag to our head of our
document we're going to be removing this
style and putting it in an external
style sheet and these stylings in all of
these three tables really this is going
to be the only three tables that we're
going to use for layout everything else
might be lives inside of there we might
use couple tables for a few more
scenarios but mostly we can throw divs
inside of these tables now now that we
have the main layout easily created so
in the let's go into the f12 and see
what it looks like in the browser now
you can see it's snug up to the top but
it doesn't look like our background is
centered on there you see the background
kind of moves and we want that gray edge
to be directly center so we can just go
into the code view and center that
background
see how it says background image let's
just go and put background position
let's put top space center colon or
semicolon and let's make the background
color of our page white it's going to be
wiped by default but let's assign one
now let's press f12 okay you can see no
matter what size the browser window is
our gray graphics for the background
those faded gray graphics I put back
there are centered now on the page like
I wanted them to be so really all we got
to do at this point is get some
cushioning here in this body section and
I can show you how to populate your page
actually so it's not all sunk against
that border right there you want it to
have some cushion and padding in here
you can throw all kind of stuff up in
the top so what I'll do in part 3 and
show you how to validate it will check
validation we'll put the little icon at
the bottom of our footer here that way
we can keep checking validation as we
produce the site all the way through to
completion and I'll also show you how to
get these things set up into an external
style sheet you see in the code view we
have our style directly in the file but
if I went night made an about Us page
and a contact page and all 15 other
pages and I wanted to change the styling
on all the pages at once it would be
very difficult to do if all of this
style was sitting still in all of those
pages directly we want to take all of
this styling classes out of it and I
these that we can refer to in an
external style sheet that's why i put
this style tag here we're going to take
all these styles out put them in the
external style sheet that way each page
to contact page the about Us page the
home page can just have this in it this
one link which will bring all the
styling in so later on if I have 20
pages I want to change my background to
black I can do that very easily if I
want to change the back
our image or the body image the footer
image the header image one set of code
can change the styling on every single
page without having to go back into
every single page and change it here so
part 3 we're going to show you how to
set up really smart by setting an
external CSS style sheet that will power
the entire site every single page to
keep updating the site and managing it a
whole lot easier especially as your site
grows so stick around for part 3 and I
apologize to the CSS guys for not doing
an exclusive they've layout I'm just
going to use these three tables as
simple layout containers within them we
can have dibs or whatever you like to
make you happy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
