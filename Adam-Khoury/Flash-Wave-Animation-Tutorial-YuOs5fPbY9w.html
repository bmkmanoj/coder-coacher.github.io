animation effect that we'll be creating
in this tutorial it's a continuous wave
loop animation in flash 8 cs3 cs4 cs4
whatever flash version you're using
let's get to it
hello everybody in this flash tutorial
I'm going to show you how to create an
animated wave effect it's a continuous
wave and it's a loop animation and I
haven't seen this anywhere so I'm going
to deliver it to the web for free to
everyone so follow along so we'll press
a flash ActionScript 3 project it
doesn't matter if you're in ActionScript
2 or ActionScript 3 or if you're in
flash 8 or flash 9 or 10 cs3 cs4 it
doesn't matter this is just an animated
Timeline technique so let's go to the
dimensions I'm going to change my
dimensions let me show you first what I
clicked on I go down here to the
properties inspector and I click on size
and change my dimensions to 300 you can
make yours whatever you want and the
wave can be any size you want I'm going
to make my height 200 with 300 press ok
and let's change the frame right now
here I could have changed it in the
settings panel but I'm going to show you
how to change it here and we'll change
it to 24 so we have a nice smooth
animation okay now let's go ahead and
draw grab the pen tool and we have a
black stroke
- point of 0.25 so onstage so grab the
you know grab but you you select one
time or you click down and then you go
to the other state side of the stage and
you click again and you hold down this
time this time you pull while you're
holding and this is how the pen tool
works you can make any shapes you want
so you click down and you hold and you
pull while you're holding and you can
make any shape you want so you make an
arc and then you go to the other side
try to meet up at about the same
parallel level and then click again and
it makes an arc to match it and we'll go
up just lower down just a little bit
with our mouse and press and and click
down again and then we'll go back to the
middle and we'll do that same technique
underneath click down and hold and pull
match up the arc let go come over here
click down and it matches the arc then
click to meet the point and now you have
a full closed up shape custom shape and
that's how you make custom shapes with
the pen tool
let's see now we're going to give it a
fill so you highlight it press the arrow
tool then I highlighted it and go down
to fill color and let's give it a fill
of blue now with that let's move it down
a little me about the middle now we can
take the symbol and get rid of the
stroke now it has no stroke
now we're going to double click inside
of it the drawing symbol and you'll see
when you click it now it has a bunch of
dots little white dots on it you press
control C control shift V to paste in
place so we copied and pasted it in
place now I'm going to take the new one
that we pasted it down and match it up
to the end of the other one there and
I'm going to go into about 400 or 800 so
I can make sure I get a really tight
match on these edges here so if I as I
bring it in with my mouse you can see
it's not going to meet up it's going to
be an overlap there or one edge is
higher than the other so you click the
mouse sub selection tool then when you
click on that object you can select the
edges now you select that one edge and
move with your mouse arrows up and down
so now you can see how I'm closing the
gap or changing the height difference
there and that's it now I'm going to hit
the regular selection tool and move it
towards the other one until they touch
now right there it's touching looks like
we have a little edge here which we can
get rid of no maybe not that shouldn't
affect anything it's so small but
normally you would want it really really
smooth and matched up really nice okay
so once you have that we'll double click
back and go to the main scene out of the
symbol and now right-click the symbol
convert it to a movie clip name it
whatever you want press ok and
now what you can do is double-click it
go inside of it convert that to a symbol
to make it another movie clip this way
we can animate it press ok now go out to
frame 25 or frame 30 that sounds good
and then pull on frame 30 you highlight
it and press f6 to create a keyframe so
it puts this same object on stage in two
different positions now you right-click
in the middle somewhere and create
motion tween now with the other you have
your start position here then your end
position to the animation is here
so let's go ahead and drag it to where
it's going to meet so it'll do its loop
you want it to meet up just about
perfectly and we don't want it to have a
difference in its Y position so we're
going to check this one has a Y position
of zero this one has a Y position of
minus 9 so let's get that to zero there
now let's see if it matches up you might
have to move the position about right
there now let's press f12 to render out
and there it is nice beautiful smooth
wavy line that's continuous looping this
is great for advertisements little
banners and I show you another trick
here with it double click outside go to
the main scene take it put it go down to
filters add a filter of blur high
quality blur and blur it out now render
out by pressing f12
look how pretty that is yeah you put a
little border on that some words zooming
in and out you get a beautiful
advertisement there for flash and I'll
leave and show you I'll put a rectangle
on top give it a border real quick get
that black no fill make it four just so
it covers everything and there it is now
your advertisement has a border nice
flash animation back there you can put
several littles going okay and that's it
I hope you find that useful and we'll
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
