learn to script a custom random string
generator it will allow you to specify
the exact characters that your resulting
random string will have after it's
produced and you can pass the length
that the string needs to be through your
function as an argument we will be
adding this function to our social
website in order to generate random
strings when we name files that our
users upload and we'll be using it to
generate our salts for our password
hashes
okay create yourself a new PHP file and
I have also some people ask me why I use
Dreamweaver my response to you would be
why not why not use Dreamweaver what you
think I use it as a crutch no I don't
furthermore you can't code your way out
of a paper bag and beyond that I can
kick your ass physically I can beat you
up I just like the way it highlights my
syntax and the way it lets me customize
things but I never tell people what code
editors you use I I recommend that
people use whatever code editor makes
them happy in their heart it's just text
it's just text people calm down and in
your PHP includes folder right there
with your database connection file you
can save this file as rant string Jen
save now let's start our PHP scripting
block first thing we'll do is we'll make
it start without being modular then
we'll just make it a little script that
we can echo out and see how it runs and
then we'll make it modular okay so what
you want to do is create a variable
called chars net short for characters
and in between your double quotes a b c
d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w
x y z and then you can put 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 and if you want special characters
within your string you can just place
them right here if you want the dollar
sign the underscore question mark
exclamation the - whatever you want to
have in there and if you want to allow
certain characters you might need to
escape them for instance if i put in a
double quote here if i want to allow
double quote to be in my random string
if i put that there you see what it does
is it breaks my syntax so right before
that double quote i can just put a
backslash so backslash double quote and
it will escape that character in the
syntax and let me use it in the string
so if you come across any characters
that bust your string or bust your
syntax you can escape them now the next
line we're going to create a variable
call it char array that's going to be
equal to the string split function open
close parenthesis semicolon and the
variable that you want to pass as an
argument is that string of characters
now string split
that does is it's going to take this
string of characters and it's going to
split them individually so what will
happen is you'll get a resulting array
so the first item in the array will be
the a the next item in the array will be
the B and so on and so forth
the next thing we'll do is set up a for
loop and what the for loop is going to
do is allow you to loop over this array
of characters as many times as you like
to randomly pluck as many as you want
out giving you a resulting string that
is a random bunch of characters so a
generic for loop like this gets three
parameters and it works the same way in
JavaScript so if you use the JavaScript
this will look very familiar to you
create variable I make it equal to zero
semicolon that's the first parameter so
while the loop is running the second
parameter is we assess whether I is
still less than whatever ceiling number
we want to give it so let's say ten so
we can get a random string of ten
characters then you put semicolon and
the next argument is simply iterate or
increment the I variable so I plus plus
increments the I variable every time
that this loop runs and every time the
loop runs I is evaluated to see if it is
still less than ten so when it starts
off it's definitely less than ten
because it's zero every time the loop
runs i increments right here so it
becomes greater and greater until the
loop hits its ceiling which we gave it a
ceiling of ten now within that for loop
the first thing we want to do is create
a variable called Rand item that just
stands for random item that we're going
to pluck out of this array of characters
we do the random plucking by using the
array Rand function and you just simply
put the array that you want to pluck out
of as the argument in that function and
that will pluck at random any of these
characters that you have in there and
then you can simply echo any kind of
string you like so let's just put this
bar here to separate each one as they
come pouring out in the loop then I'll
put a dot and I'll want to grab my char
array variable and the index that we
want to have is the Rand item because
what ran item is going to be is
a number that represents the index for
one of these characters so R and item is
actually an integer and that integer
gets placed right here that is what
pulls the value out of the array so now
run that and see what you get okay so
you can see what I get and you would get
a different randomized kind of string
okay now let's go and we don't need that
bar to render there so let's remove that
bar and up top let's create another
variable called result and it's going to
be equal to nothing at first then down
inside where we're echoing let's put
that result dot equals and we use dot
equals to make sure that we're appending
to that result variable then underneath
we can just echo full result so what I
should get is a 10 character randomized
string let's run this now okay so I got
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten now what if I wanted instead of
10,000 press control less and now run
that on your PHP enabled server so you
see what I get and you can have any
characters that you want in there now
we're going to set this thing up for
modular usage that way we can use it
over and over again and any time we need
a random string of characters of any
length that we specify we can easily
just include this PHP file into our
script and call the function so at the
very top let's type in function name it
ran string gen and then open closed
parenthesis open curly brace go down a
couple of lines and put in the closing
curly brace now what we're going to do
is pass one argument through this
function which is the length because
this you want to be dynamic so you can
actually change that to a variable
called le n short for length and when
it's passed through it's going to be
picked up here as le n so let's take all
of this code right here that we have
initially and ctrl X and place it inside
of that function control V and make sure
you indent your code correctly inside
the function while you're writing your
code anyway that way you don't lose
track of where things are okay now
instead of echoing you're just going to
return the result to the calling line in
your script that calls this function
so now for usage when you include this
file into other files for usage purposes
what you do is say you had some other
file and you would use it like this make
a new variable name it whatever you want
and make it equal to this function we're
going to run it right here open close
parenthesis semicolon and then you just
pass your length through however many
characters you want so let's get 50 and
then we can simply echo that value to
our cell by making that variable output
right there okay now run that let me
refresh my test page so I have a 50
character random string and anytime in
your application all you have to do to
use it and to get a random string
variable made like this you can just run
this one line right there
so there's your modular setup and there
is your usage instructions all right so
you now you have a file and you can
remove that the usage instructions now
you have a file called ranch string
jenna HP it lives in your PHP includes
folder and within any of your pages on
your website you can simply include this
file whenever you want to use that
function okay and we're going to be
using it actually in the next video for
the web intersect series where we're
going to create randomized soft or a
hash and I'm going to remove these
characters because I don't want them in
there I just want numbers and letters
you can actually put uppercase if you
want all of the uppercase letters okay
so I'll see you guys in the next video
where we're going to assemble the signup
page some parsing scripts and the
activation script the activation through
email script will be getting rolling
real soon here now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
