asked me how I got the sunburst auto
shape in my adobe fireworks graphics
editing software so in this fireworks
graphic design tutorial you can learn
how to download and install the sunburst
auto shape and this will also give you
insight into searching out and finding
many different extensions to your
fireworks software that will greatly
expand its usefulness for you so if I
click my auto shapes tool you can see
here I have this sunburst near the
bottom I pull it out let's make it black
give myself a white canvas and I'll draw
myself an ellipse right on top I'll make
that ellipse yellow then I'll make my
sunburst yellow and there you go you can
also make a gradient radial let's swap
those sides to wear the white is on this
edge and it also has settings to make
the Rays wider change the spacing of the
Rays and the radius so it's a really
cool auto shape come in handy for a lot
of your design work first go to Erin
Beals website I'll put a link to this
page in the video's description that way
you can get right to this page on his
website take a moment to appreciate the
design of his website you can tell he
likes graphics editing a lot when I
first came to the website and I saw it I
was like ah live with this guy did with
you things in the transparent Avenue
know it's like is editing ended oh my
god is real with you or when you work
over that it turns red why I would
scroll down on this page and let's grab
the sunburst zip it's going to give you
the mxp and the JSF files so if you're
using google chrome you can click down
here and go to show in folder or you can
just use Windows Explorer side menu here
to get to your downloads folder right
there and you might as well grab all the
other tools the guy's got because
they're all awesome or you can close
that window after you get the tools that
you want from Aaron Beals website
close that out and now in the Downloads
folder let's right click that and
extract here to unzip everything now
there's two ways you can do it i'm going
to show you the manual way to do it
which will give you a whole lot more
power when it comes to adding to
fireworks adding to its shapes or
textures patterns and things like that
so one way to do it to get it installed
in the bio works is use the adobe
extension manager and double click that
package right there but i'm going to
show you the manual way like i said so
double click on the auto shapes folder
go inside and grab those two files i
like both of them and copy and you can
just close that window out you go down
here and hit your little windows bubble
but you go to my computer if your
windows and you go to your c drive you
go to your program files so you find
your adobe folder you go into that and
then you find your adobe fireworks that
you want to add this auto shape too now
you double-click the configuration
folder you go into auto shapes and this
is where we're going to apply it and you
just right-click on the side and paste
and you might be presented with this
prompt that says destination folder
access tonight you'll need to provide
administration permission to continue ok
click now what it did is it put those
two files within that folder along with
all of your other auto shapes now before
we open fireworks and inspect what we
have now in your configuration folder
you can put new patterns just sync them
right in there you can put new textures
right there and you can add all kinds of
other tools to fireworks to extend its
power by using these boulders but now
you can also use the adobe extension
manager which makes it easier you don't
have to go messing around in these
folders but I like messing around in
these folders because it's easier for me
to apply patterns and things like that
very quickly as you can now close that
window and open fireworks now let's
create a new fireworks project and I'll
just make this 800 x 500 ok and now
out in my auto shapes which is over here
or you can go to window auto shapes and
it will pop open scroll down and you'll
see that you now have sunburst like I
said you can apply all kinds of other
things that fireworks might not come
installed with by default that you can
add to it later if you need it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
