getting a lot of requests lately for
spritesheet programming tutorials while
I cannot show the advanced concepts from
the sprite programming mastery book I
can demonstrate some of the free basic
preview material from the book here on
video so in this exercise we'll
demonstrate a basic CSS sprite sheet
animation sequence that renders a
bouncing ball before we get into it
let's take a look at the finished
product you can see we have a bouncing
basketball so if you are programming a
video game that would run on the web you
might want to use some kind of code like
this if you wanted to have a basketball
game now let me also show you the sprite
sheet itself so you see this here is the
sprite sheet that renders this animation
and we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 frames in that
sprite sheet and each frame is 50 pixels
by 50 pixels so you if you could imagine
6 squares within this sprite sheet each
one would be 50 by 50 pixels so each
frame is 50 by 50 pixels all we have to
do is run through all of those frames
fast enough to where it runs as a smooth
animation and we can make it play at any
speed we want so let's go into an
example dot HTML file and let's start
with a div and this div is going to
represent our ball so let's give it an
ID equal to ball and that's it for the
HTML now let's put a style element in
place above that now within that style
element let's go ahead and target the
ball by its ID now we can put our style
rule in between curly braces first thing
we'll do is give it a background
property to the URL image path so I have
my image my ball bounce P&amp;amp;G sprite sheet
is in an images folder that's relative
to this example dot HTML and if you'd
like to see that image again here it is
so I'm just using this sprite sheet as
the background image now I want to set
the width and height for the ball to be
50 pixels by 50 pixels that way it
doesn't show the whole sprite sheet
just wanted to show one quadrant or one
section one frame of that spritesheet by
default now if we look at this in any
browser that's the results you get it's
only the first frame of the sprite sheet
but sprite sheets can be used for many
things they don't have to be used for an
animation a sprite sheet can just hold
all of the graphics for your web
applications or your software or your
website now the next thing we need is an
animation setting in the CSS so what
we're doing in this line is we're
calling a ball bounce animation to run
for this ball element so we have to put
a keyframes animation called ball bounce
and we'll do that in just a second but
the speed of the animation is going to
be 0.7 seconds or the duration it's
going to be 0.7 seconds you can just
think of this as speed you want it to go
faster you make this a lower number if
you want it to go slower you make this
number higher now the steps is directly
relative to how many frames are within
our animation and you can see clearly
that we have one two three four five six
frames in our sprite sheet animation
sequence now this is the first frame
here which is keyframe one and these are
all transitional frames in between that
make up the animation so we're just
going to set up a keyframe animation
that steps over six frames that's why we
put steps six and we want it to loop
infinite we wanted to play more than
once so we put infinite there if you
wanted to play ten times bounce only ten
times or play the animation sequence ten
times and you put a ten there but I
wanted to just keep looping and playing
forever now the last simple little thing
we need is the ball bounce keyframes
animation setup okay so here's the empty
shell for that we have a keyframes
animation name of ball bounce so that
means this element ball since it's using
this animation setting with the name of
ball bounce this ball is tied to this
keyframes animation it's going to play
this keyframes animation now you can set
from and - to make a
an animation that has two keyframes a
first frame and a last frame and what we
do to make a sprite sheet play very
quickly is we go through the background
position setting so let's set that
background position I'm going to put
zero pixels because I wanted to start at
the first frame the first image in that
sprite sheet then I can just copy that
line and put it in the two and we're
going to go to negative 300 pixels and
that will go to the keyframe too and all
of the transitional frames will play in
the sequence automatically so you're
setting the first frame which is
keyframe one and then you're targeting
the last frame which is keyframe two and
all of the transitional frames will play
in between those automatically now let's
go ahead and preview this in Firefox so
you can see we have a bouncing ball
let's preview this in Internet Explorer
nice bouncing ball animation and let's
preview this in Google Chrome which it
doesn't play because Google Chrome is
not up to speed yet with the other
browsers they haven't removed their
prefix from the standardized syntax for
all of this stuff so all you got to do
is go in here and copy this line put
another one right above the animation
line and then put WebKit now you have
your animation property with the WebKit
prefix so for this to work in WebKit
browsers you just have to put a WebKit
prefix on the keyframes animation rule
as well so you put the WebKit here an
extra line for the animation and then
you put an extra keyframes animation
that has the WebKit prefix on it then
you can test this in Google Chrome and
now it works in all the major modern
browsers and it's kind of a pain in the
butt that we still have to use the
WebKit prefix but that should go away
very soon hopefully the Google Chrome
development team
get on that right away and remove all of
their prefixes from all this CSS
animation stuff because all the other
browsers have a while back so I'll let
you guys add your own WebKit prefixes to
everything I'm going to remove it
because pretty soon it won't even be
needed and this is the code example I'll
have on the page now this PNG files the
dimensions is 50 pixels high and 300
pixels wide that's how it has a six
frames that are 50 pixels each and I'm
also going to make this file available
to you because it might be hard to copy
these graphics right out of the video it
could be done but it might be difficult
for you to copy the graphics right out
of the video but I'll make it available
at Adam quarry com I'll put a link in
the description of the video you guys
can actually go and get this file and
then just use the code from the video to
power this sprite sheet so let's say if
we go in there and we take this from
point seven two point two watch how fast
this thing bounces so you see that's
something you can't do with an animated
gifs that's what makes sprites so much
more special because you can actually
program them in so many ways to do
things and dynamically that you cannot
do with animated gifts and some people
would like to disregard sprites and just
use animated gifs but they're
disregarding a whole world of dynamics
for video game graphics and with
anything from video game graphics all
the way to web website skinning and all
that good stuff
can be accomplished with sprite sheets
it's pretty cool and I'll be discussing
more about it I can't put out all of the
advanced information from the sprite
programming mastery ebook but I can show
all the free preview material and that's
what I'll do just to generate some
interest in sprite sheet programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
