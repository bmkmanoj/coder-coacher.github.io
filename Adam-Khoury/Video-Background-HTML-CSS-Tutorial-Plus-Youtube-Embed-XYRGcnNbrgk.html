in this exercise we will demonstrate how
to use video as the HTML content
background instead of using still images
so this means that you can have forms
menus and buttons and text and all kind
of stuff like that sitting right on top
of video the video is going to be the
background to the web page first let's
take a look at the finished effect you
can see that I have some web page
content and at the background I have a
video big HD video playing and what I
did was this morning I went outside my
house pointed up at a tree and just took
some HD footage and we set the video to
loop and I made sure that I removed my
audio from the video after I recorded it
okay we're going to start with the bare
bones of an html5 web document the first
thing I'm going to do is add my video
element with the attributes that I want
I'm going to give it an ID of bheegi
bheegi is short for background the video
source is going to be in a video folder
that I have a video named page BG mp4
now you're going to have to use dot org
videos or another format because it
seems that Firefox Chrome and Internet
Explorer all support the mp4 format
you'll see that the video plays in all
three of those browsers but if you test
this with opera for instance it's not
going to work because opera doesn't
support the mp4 video format it supports
OGG and some other formats but I'll talk
about that at the end and I'll show you
a code example to where you can put
different source elements within your
video tag to account for different type
of environments so just at first we're
going to put that mp4 as the video
source let me set autoplay to true
because we want the video to just play
automatically when the page loads we set
loop attribute to true because we want
the video to just keep looping on itself
so it never ends so that means you're
going to want a video that loops well
and it's best to use a short video so
that it loads fast initially then if
your video happens to have audio you can
set muted to true and that will silence
the audio okay now in the code directly
under the video element I'm going to
place a div with an ID of content and
inside of that div is where all the
content that I want to rest on top of
the video is going to live inside of
this div called content now if I was to
render this right now I'll get results
that I don't want you can see I have a
big video but my content is underneath
it so I have to put my content after
carefully layer things so where my
content is on top of the video now in
the CSS we're going to target the
element with ID BG which is our video
element we're going to give it a width
of 100% that way no matter the screen
size the video is stretched or shrunken
according to the users screen size then
we're going to give this div id of
content right here some CSS applied to
it and the properties are
position:absolute that way it can rest
up on top of the video the top value
we're going to give zero pixels that way
it's at the top where it should be and
we're going to give it a padding of 30
pixels so the text and the content
inside of that div isn't all smashed
onto the outside edge and then the color
of the text I just made it white you can
also target specific elements like h1
and h2 that we have text within to give
a shadow but I'm just going to put a
text shadow here of black on the white
text and I'll make it 2 pixels and 2
pixels so it's a black shadow with two
pixel to pixel offset now if we take a
look at this all right now we have the
result that we want and you see how
quick and easy that was to do now some
of you may ask how do you limit the
height of this element that the video
background is in and you can position
that video element a little more easily
if you just wrap it in a day
so I'm going to wrap that video element
inside of the div and let's give this
div an ID of vid container or BG
container now you style BG container any
way that you want so you can go right
above BG just put in pound sign BG
container open and close curly braces
and start styling it let's limit the
height say 300 pixels you can make it
whatever you want and let's set the
overflow to none or hidden that way the
user won't see anything underneath your
300 pixels except more content that you
want to put let's take a look at this so
you see here let me make the page
background black so you can see that the
content only goes to 300 pixels and then
I can have more content beginning down
here if I wanted to limit the height
where that video is rendering as a
background and then as I change the
width of my screen you can see that the
video with changes accordingly but it's
limited to that height now so you can
really position this BG container and
limit its height in any way that you
want and the video that's within it
that's serving as a background can be
more easily styled and placed where
exactly you want it and its height can
be more easily limited and things like
that okay now what we'll do is show you
how you can use YouTube videos as the
page background video okay what I've
done here is I uploaded a video but I
made sure that I uploaded it as unlisted
so only people with the link to the
video are going to be able to see it
never got published to my subscribers or
anything so I just made it unlisted and
I'm going to use this video as the
example for my web page background in
the example that we have here we're
using a video that's going to be on our
own website server
and using the video element so what I'm
going to do now is just remove this
video element all together and back here
at YouTube you can go down to the share
code the embed code here and just grab
that embed code I'm going to put it
right where the video tag was so now I
have the proper video embedded there
from YouTube now allow full screen you
can remove that we're going to keep
frameborder equals zero right here on
the end of the source URL what we're
going to do or the source video we're
going to put a question mark and then
set some parameters and actually what we
can do is remove this width and height
and let's just give this the ID equal to
BG just like the video element had ID of
BG now the iframe has ID of BG so these
properties right here the width 100%
will be attached and we might have to
set the height also for YouTube videos
so let's see what we have and then we'll
add some more parameters to this URL
okay I FTP the test file on to my live
website at Adam Cory comm and I'm going
to navigate to that file name there's
video background and you can see that it
has the width that it needs but the
height is not there and you can also see
that we can see all the YouTube controls
and the user will be able to play and
pause the video which you don't want
them to have any control over the video
so we'll have to take care of that all
right so back in the file let's just set
some height let's go height maybe 800
pixels actually the height only needs to
be what 500 pixels because that's what
we have BG container set as so let's set
the height for BG to 500 as well now re
FTP that and view it again so I'm going
to refresh now you
see that I have the height that I want
here's my content sitting right on top
of the video ok so right after the video
ID for the source attribute you're going
to put a question mark to append some
parameters we're going to start with
autoplay equals 1 that means autoplay
true so you want the video to autoplay
and you also want to knock out controls
so what we'll do is we'll add the
ampersand code the HTML code version of
the ampersand will type in controls
equals zero that means control false we
don't want to show any controls and we
want the video to autoplay so now let's
read DP this up to our live server and
test now let me refresh and we should
see that there's no more controls now
the controls are gone let's change the
height on this to maybe a thousand and
refresh there we go that's what I wanted
so you just set the height to where it
fits inside of your area that you want
it to be in now we're going to add two
more parameters to this string here we
already have autoplay and we have
controls knocked out so now we want and
loop equals 1 that means looping is set
to true now let's put and show info
equals zero and modest branding equals
one and disable KB equals one and enable
jsapi equals one for true
ok let's go to the little application
and refresh there we go so now you can
see there's no controls or anything but
the user can still interact by clicking
on the video they can pause it and
restart it again which you don't want so
there remains only one little thing you
have to do to disable any interaction
with that YouTube video now you can see
that it doesn't loop and that's because
you're going to need playlist setting
loads so let's go ahead and put in a
play Li even though I don't have any
play
for that video but what you'd want to do
is set that video in its own playlist at
YouTube that way you can set a playlist
ok the last parameter that I added to
that string is playlist equals and you
put your playlist ID here so what I
could do on YouTube is go and make a new
playlist on my channel and put the video
of the tree waving in the wind as the
only video in that playlist then I put
the playlist ID here and then it will
loop on itself correctly ok so that's
very important to remember if you want
correct looping if you're using this
YouTube iframe method or the iframe
approach and you want it to loop
correctly then you put the playlist ID
right there and you have to make a
playlist and have just that one video in
it so that video will loop over and over
again if you have multiple videos in the
playlist you'll have multiple videos as
the background of your webpage so that's
how it works now for me personally if I
was doing this I would use the video
element and have the video on my own
serve as the background for my page
which gives you this effect and it's
very simple and you'll have more control
over things if you do it this way oh
yeah I told you that I was going to show
you how to disable the people being able
to pause and restart that YouTube video
if you use the YouTube iframe approach
if you use the YouTube iframe approach
I'm not going to code it for you it
would be very easy all you have to do is
put an image that fills up the whole
area covering the video so you put
another layer into your page just like
you put your content as a layer on top
of your video you just put another layer
that goes in between your content and
your video and that layer will disable
any interaction just make an image tag
with a clear PNG or you can set the RGB
a vow
use for the opacity to zero for that
image or whatever or you can just have a
clear totally clear PNG image that fills
up the entire space and that way it will
disable mouse interaction with the video
but with this video approach once you
make sure that you have no controls if
you're not giving the user controls then
they won't have any way to interact with
it see if I click on it nothing happens
because I have more control over the way
this video is rendering we're not giving
it any controls at all so if you click
on the video it doesn't pause it or
anything like that now let me quickly
take you to web intersect where this
whole topic has arisen and that somebody
asked for a video tutorial about it
actually right here how to make video
background so I gave a quick code
example of how I would do it showing the
using the video element then I explained
what the iframe was being used for in
those examples it's to bring the YouTube
video embed and then down here for
people who say you're testing in Opera
or maybe you're testing in Firefox in
mp4s don't seem to work but actually
here let's go right here you see how
about I have mp4 let's go to file
preview in browser Firefox you can see I
have videos working fine mp4 in Firefox
so let's go to file preview in Internet
Explorer you can see it works just fine
in Internet Explorer as well now what
you will have problems with is opera so
that's why I was showing you this code
right here web intersect because if you
use OGG or web M type files if you use
odd or WebM video files then opera
supports those so you can put all three
of the versions and make sure you have
all three versions of these type of
files for that movie that you want to
show what the video you want to show so
I just want to mention that in case
you're testing in opera you don't see
the video because opera doesn't support
mp4 all right so now you have two
examples of using the video element
with videos that are directly on your
web server and we also have the YouTube
iframe embed approach and I'll have both
of those separate code examples under
the video where it plays it develop PHP
com
so you'll be able to get your hands on
both code examples that we worked with
in the exercise if you enjoyed the video
