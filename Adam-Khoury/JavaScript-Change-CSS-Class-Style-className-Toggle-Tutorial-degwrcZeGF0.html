you'll learn to change toggle and swap
CSS classes first let's take a quick
look at the finished product of what
you'll be programming the first example
is toggling the CSS class of a clicked
element on and off so if I go to any of
these elements and I click them they
turn on and off so basically it's going
from class 1 to class 2 on and off and
that's a toggle mechanism that we're
going to program in another example
we're going to tackle in this tutorial
is changing the CSS class of a clicked
child element inside of a child array so
all four of these boxes are children of
a parent element and by default I made
the first one lit or active and then if
I click the second one the changes from
the first one being active to the second
if I click the fourth one the same thing
happens where it swaps with these up
here they'll all turn on and off by
toggling them with these you can't turn
them on and off by toggling them but
they swap ok the first thing we're going
to do is go into our example HTML file
and we're going to put into the style
element these two rules for class 1 and
class 2
so whatever on the page is given the
class 1 will have these properties and
whatever on the page is given class 2
will have these properties now in my
body element I'm going to place four
divs each with last one now I can render
this in my favorite browser and I have
my four divs
so for quick demonstration purposes
we'll just put the event handling
directly in the elements so we'll target
the click event for this div and in the
on click event you can run any
JavaScript code that you want so if your
aim was just to change the class from
class 1 to class 2 when that element is
clicked you can simply say this dot
class name equal to and in between
single quotes will put class 2 so now
this first div has an on click event
it's going to make the following code
execute this class name equals class 2
now let's run that in a favorite browser
and let's click the first
see it changed to class two the other
ones are in programmed to do that yet
now we still don't have a toggle to
create a toggle you have to make it to
where when you click the element again
after it's given in class two it changes
back to class one and that's a toggle
mechanism that you have to program in
using JavaScript and we just happen to
be using the on click event but you can
use the click event you can target load
events you can target drag events scroll
events double click events and that's
why it's handy to be able to change
these things in JavaScript now in order
to make our toggle function we're going
to take this control X then inside of
the on click event we're going to run a
custom function called toggle class open
closed parenthesis and in between the
parentheses we're going to put this
which is going to allow us to reference
this div dynamically so the word this
represents this div when it's going
through the function that we're about to
put in place in our head element here so
let's go into the head element and we'll
put in a scripting element and make sure
we close that script element now since
the click event for this div is calling
a toggle class function that's the name
of the function that we need here so
we'll type in function toggle class open
close parenthesis opening curly brace
and closing curly brace now this toggle
class function is taking in one argument
dynamically which is the element that's
calling the function to run and we'll
just put a L to represent that element
now remember the code we had in the
click event that was changing the class
name we can just put that in place here
but targeting the element so we say al
that class name equals class two now
this will work exactly the way it did
before but now we can take this and put
it in place for each of these elements
so they all have the click event and
they all can be toggled now we still
need a little if and else condition
statement here and that's very basic and
that's going to be the toggle logic the
if and else condition statement in this
toggle class for instance if I run this
right now it will toggle the classes but
it won't toggle them back because I have
no if and else condition statement
there's no conditional
Jake in my function yet so for toggling
logic let's put this in place if the
elements class name is equal to class 1
which it is by default then we're going
to change it to class 2 else we're going
to change it back to class 1 so that if
else condition statement is what
provides the toggle logic and you can
toggle anything in JavaScript using a
simple if and else condition statement
so now let's see what we get now if I
turn it on I should be able to turn it
off and that's toggling
on and off on and off so now we're going
to show you the second example where
we're changing the CSS class of clicked
child elements in a child array because
as you see in this example all of them
can be lit up but you might have the
scenario where if one is lit up and you
click another one you want the one
that's lit up to go back to the blue
state you might not want all of them to
be highlighted you might want only one
to be highlighted at a time ok for the
second example we're going to start with
what we have here and I'm going to wrap
all of these divs in a main div called
menu one so now all of the divs that I
had in place those four boxes are now
child divs of this main div called menu
one and what I'm going to do is use
JavaScript to access all of those
dynamically no matter how many there are
inside of it and I'll access them as an
array that I can loop over and we'll
remove all of the code from the toggle
class function and the first div I'm
going to make highlighted with class two
by default so if we look in this in
browser we should have four boxes with
the first one highlighted by default but
nothing happens when we click them yet
because we removed all the code from
toggle class now like I said I want to
access inside of this toggle class when
these divs are clicked I want to access
all of these divs as an array so in
order to access all of these divs
dynamically as an array you can use a
line like this
we'll make a variable named kids and
that's going to be equal to document get
element by ID menu one which is this div
here and then we use the dot
children property which returns an array
of all of the child elements within menu
one so this kids variable is an array
that represents all of the divs inside
of the menu one now my next little bit
of logic inside of my toggle class
function in this case is that I want a
for loop over that kids array and make
all of them equal to class one no matter
which one is being clicked so this
little bit of code does that in four
loops over the length of the kids array
and it makes all of them equal to class
one and then finally you use the dynamic
argument of the element that's being
clicked coming in to make only that one
equal to class two now let's see what
that gives us so now if I click on the
next one this one should go back to blue
and this one should turn green and there
you have it now you're swapping in
between child elements of a main
container element all right so that
gives you two different scenarios
okay so that's how you can use
JavaScript to change swap or toggle the
class that HTML elements on your page
are assigned and anytime you need to it
doesn't have to be the click event it
doesn't have to be a hover event it can
be the scroll event it can be a load
event it can be a drag event it can be a
double-click event so we just add a
little bit of JavaScript to help our
program style perform the way it needs
to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
