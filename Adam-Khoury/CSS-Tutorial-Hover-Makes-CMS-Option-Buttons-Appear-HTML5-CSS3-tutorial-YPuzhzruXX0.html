demonstrate how to make things magically
appear when the user hovers their mouse
over certain elements on your web page
we're going to use pure CSS so this will
work even if the user has JavaScript
turned off in their browser software
they've always dabbled in the simple
code I would like to demonstrate certain
instances where knowing how to do such a
thing would be useful for web developers
who are creating awesome software that
runs online many times when I offer a
lesson people make comments to me like
where would I use this sort of code Adam
how would this be handy to me so let me
make it crystal clear to you all by
showing real world examples of where you
would apply such a thing I would like
you to log in to your Facebook account
and go to your profile hover your mouse
over your profile picture and you will
see that a button or a link whatever you
want to call it a button that says edit
profile picture magically appears and it
appears when I put my mouse over that
item and this could be whatever
information you want it can be a picture
could be text in a box whatever now I'd
also like you to log into your Google+
account and hover your mouse over your
profile picture and you can see that a
button appears at the bottom over that
picture okay so that's what you're going
to be learning how to do and even at web
intersect com which is part of the
social network building tutorial series
that we're in the middle of right now if
you go to your profile and you're logged
in you hover your mouse over your
profile picture I make a button appear
right in the middle off to the side a
little bit that will let people edit
their profile picture right when I put
that programming into place and here's
the actual code example let me output
that so you can see just exactly what
you'll be learning how to do before you
even dabble in the code so when I put my
mouse over this item you see a button
appears and it's very simple code okay
we're going to start with the bare bones
of an html5 web document and you can see
I have my style tag in place with my CSS
and in the body element I only have one
div and it's ID is box one inside a box
one I have a simple link that's going to
serve as my example button for this
tutorial and also in that box is the
picture and that is the avatar that you
see here my avatar and when I hover over
that I use CSS to make that link appear
any place that I wanted to okay so you
see the structure of the HTML and you
know
it's very very simple so let's open up
the CSS and explain that very quickly
first thing we do is we'll target the
div with an ID of box 1 and we'll give
it a border that's a great border to
pixel solid we'll make sure the width of
that box is 200 pixels and the height is
200 pixels and the margin space around
it could be whatever kind of margin
space you want I can actually remove
that and everything will work exactly
the same you see I just had margin space
in there for you as an example if you
wanted that to have any space around it
or whatever then the next line of CSS is
we're going to target the image tag
that's inside of box 1 you can see that
would be this image tag right here we're
going to give it a position of absolute
that way when that button does appear
our image doesn't move around anywhere
it's absolutely positioned that means it
won't move let me give it a z-index of
2,000 we just want to make sure the
z-index is less on the image than it is
on your button you can see the button
has a z-index of 3000 the image has a
z-index of 2,000 then you can just make
your picture be a width 200 pixels and a
maximum height of 200 pixels then the
next bit of CSS is to target the little
link button or the little link that I
have inside of box 1 that's the little
magic item that appears when I hover my
mouse over box 1 and I get that little
element whatever element you want it to
be it can be a button it can be a a B a
div whatever you want that magically
appear when you hover your mouse over
box 1 by simply adding this line of CSS
you target the div with an ID of box 1
you give it the pseudo selector of hover
and then the next thing you put in is
the element that you want to affect when
box 1 is hovered over and you don't have
to be making it appear and disappear you
can make it twice the size it normally
is by default anything you want to do in
CSS to that box can be done here I just
happen to be making it appear and
disappear so when the user hovers over
box 1 I make a display:block
so basically that makes it appear and
you can see by default it has a display
of none so here's all of its default
properties and here the properties that
it gets when the user hovers their mouse
over give one and you can make a link
look just like a button if you want I
made it have a border radius of three
pixels and that's what gives us this
nice rounded looking button thing and
when the users Mouse goes over the
button you can see it turns into the
little hand symbol there and if you
wanted to have this have the hand symbol
div 1 all you'd have to do is add some
CSS to that right here you say
cursor:pointer and then when you hover
your mouse over it now you'll have the
pointer over that as well and over the
button but you might not want that
functionality or you might just have a
link on that by default so you wouldn't
need that so you can see how using pure
CSS to make things magically appear on
the page anywhere you want them to when
the user hovers their mouse over
something else so I hope you have found
this tutorial useful and I'll see you in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
