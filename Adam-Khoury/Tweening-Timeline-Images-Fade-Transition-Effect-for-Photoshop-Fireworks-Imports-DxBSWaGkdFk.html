we're creating in this tutorial flash
cs3 and cs4 tutorial you can press ctrl
enter and we'll look at it what I've
created is a image fade for our forum
users one of our forum users requested
tutorial on how to fade images in and
out from one to another and I added a
feature of when you put your mouse over
that it'll stop it wherever it is in
that sequence see how you can see the
church and the swamp together there and
when you put your mouse when your mouse
leaves it it will resume from where it
was so i can say and look at a picture
as long as I like as long as my mouse is
on top of it the moments my mouse leaves
it it'll just resumed its flowing
showing all the images this flash and
actionscript during tutorial comes
courtesy of our forum and it's a
tutorial requests in right here how to
how Mike immature the title is how make
image fade into next image flash cs3 he
says I've been searching on how to make
a movie in flash or a mint movie clip in
flash cs3 where an image fade into
another image which fade into a thermal
image and so on how is this possible
thanks for any help did you provide me
with the tutorial extra script etc it
would be really great sincerely eric and
then singing one two three came in and
gave great advice and really nailed the
method but he didn't go all the way in
describing the method and actually so i
said that i would bang out a little
tutorial on it and because it's very
simple to do so that's what we're going
to show you how to do in flash cs3 and
i'm going to be working in actionscript
3 because at the end towards the end i'm
going to add a little bit of code to
make the movie clip the transitional
movie clip stop one uses mouse goes over
it
then resume when the users mouse leaves
it okay so let's click flash
actionscript 3 file now we have a new
actionscript-3 file opening here and
what I'm going to do is go into
fireworks and I have fireworks cs4 open
and here's where I'm going to assemble
the three images that I'm going to use
in this example but you can use 10 12
however many images you want so I'm
going to go to file import and let's see
let's go to my pictures my pictures and
I'm going to start with some really big
ones because you guys might have some
really large images that you might need
to know how to get small really quick
and throw into flash and that's the
workflow i'm going to show you how to do
right now so let's just pick this one
looks good
let's import that one looks good they're
huge see how big they are if i zoom out
humongous import one more to get a nice
one and I like this swampy one okay so
they should all three be the same
dimensions so i can highlight all three
see i zoomed out by pressing ctrl and i
use my mouse wheel in fireworks to zoom
in and out on my canvas and so I
highlight all three by dragging and
select all three and then I'm going to
oops highlight all three and then hit
the scale tool then once you can zoom
out and then just scale them to the size
that you're going to want them in flash
and that looks good to me and those are
looks like there I'll 459 351 make them
a little bit smaller that's great and
this is good for like your home page you
see a lot of home pages with a flash
image transition like image fade in and
out effects and so that's what we're
going to do let's grab this first one
here now let's grab this one first and
now I have they're all optimized pretty
much to be sent right into flash you can
just press ctrl C or control x whichever
one you want i'm going to use ctrl c and
then go into flash
you
now I've got that picture in my
clipboard so I can just be on this frame
this keyframe here and layer 1 and press
ctrl V and you'll see flash is going to
import it automatically from fireworks
and let's say import bitmaps to maintain
appearance and that's fine yeah you for
the text i don't have any text so it
doesn't matter and we bring it as a
movie clip or it's okay and there it is
now it's a movie clip so that means
inside of it is the bitmap image itself
what it did is it nested it into a movie
clip automatically so this is going to
be the start so let's go ahead and in
the library where it says copy one let's
just name rename that my image one
really doesn't matter what is named in
the library I just do that so we know
what it is you know now you want to take
that on the route timeline the seam main
scene and convert to a symbol I'm going
to make this a movie clip symbol and
this movie clip is going to be the
container that's going to hold the
transition movie clip so we'll name it a
image oops image fade
container click image fade container
clip registration top left movie clip
okay now we have image fade container
clip which doesn't need an instance name
for this example and if you go inside of
it there's my image one now we're inside
of the main container now what we want
is to create a layer let's say images
let's create a new layer on top call
this actionscript 3.0 and you can be
using ActionScript 2 point 0 that the
code methods would be very similar and
you'll see my code method for
actionscript-3 and you'll say oh I know
how to do that next rescript to that's
easy okay so
now what we're going to do is bring in
the other images well first we're going
to let's set up the transition first
it's an easier method to set up the
transition first and then swap out the
images and I'll show you why okay so you
really don't need any action script for
a basic image fade and I'll show you how
and I'll show you why in a second let me
set up this timeline let's go to maybe
frame first let's set the frame right
here to about 28 to get a nice animation
on our fade in and outs so we're going
to have this one display for 50 frames
let's say 50 frames actually we don't
really need it that high 24v good enough
you can make it higher the higher you
make it to smoother your animations look
but the bulkier your file will be
sometimes okay so let's go to frame 50
press f6 make a key frame and then
images later let's just lock the action
scripts layer so we don't put anything
on it by accident now we can say we're
going to have the fade let's make a good
dramatic fade so let's go 30 frames out
from 50 and press f6 again make another
keyframe now let's go see the fade will
happen right there
in between
let me think for a second how the
easiest way to do this would be
yeah it's probably best to just layer it
image too so I press the insert layer
and created through the layers i'm going
to rename them the appropriate image
image 1 image to a mystery so now image
1 is set to fade out at paint at frame
50 to fame to frame 80 so we can go
ahead and do that now create motion
tween and fade it out go down alpha down
to the color selection alpha drag it
down to zero so we have 0 alpha it means
it turns invisible as it goes from fame
52 frame 80 is a little tween there now
all we have to do is bring the next
image in and bring it faded in at the
same time so press a on image to layer
press f6 run on keyframe make a keyframe
on frame 50 sorry and then let's bring
that next image in so let's go back to
fireworks say we want this one next
Patrol see go back into flash
control V on that layer and that
keyframe let's just put it the same
coordinates 0 0 c x and y of this first
one so let's just put that it 0 very
easy 0 and 0 so now they're at the same
exact position now let's make another
keyframe here and fade this one in so I
press f6 made a new keyframe on 80 and
then I go to create motion tween now
this one has to be invisible at frame 50
so go to alpha 0 now watch what happens
when I drag it's just fades from one
image to the next and now you just make
the image to last for 50 frames to the
visible I 8 to 1 30 press f6 here make a
new keyframe and fade it out on 160 so
you can create motion tween and go to
alpha fade it out so the next one you
know needs to come in right here so on
image 3 layer let's press to make
keyframe f6 and let's bring in that last
one so let's go here and scrub them last
image which would be the swamp here I
think
alright let's make sure
yep okay so we throw the swamp in here
the last layer for our images press
ctrl-v to bring it in make sure it's at
0-0 coordinates x and y so it matches up
to the other guys position now we go
allowed to frame 160 press f6 create
motion tween make sure this one is alpha
0 on frame 1 30 so now you can see how
that would frame this wood will fade
into the swamp picture a little house
picture there a little square little
city would fade into this one now you
just make the swamp last 50 frames 162
what is it 210 press f6 and then 240
press f6 and here we know we have to
fade it out so let's go to alpha 0
create motion tween and now it fades out
but we have to bring the first one back
in remember so press f6 here on that
image one layer f6 here create motion
tween there and let's lock this layer so
we don't grab that one by accident let's
just make it where you can't see it now
let's make this guy alpha 100 no alpha 0
then 100 on 240 so it fades back in that
one fades out let's spin unlock that you
see it swamp fades out and the original
fades back in loops back around starts
all over let's render out
you
there it is fading in and out it's very
simple to do you can do this with text
words movieclips sentences I do this all
the time in headers websites I make I'll
take a few key sentences key slogans is
that the people want to use for their
business and i'll create movie clips
i'll right click them make a movie clips
just like they were these pictures and
fade them in and out just like that okay
now i'm going to show you the code that
you can use to make it to where if the
users mouse were to go over that movie
clip that main container it would stop
and it would pause the image for the
user to look at for an extended period
of time and then when they move their
mouse over it are away from it i'll show
you how to make the movie clip resume
back to fading in and out which is a
really cool effect you see a lot of
websites doing that okay so let's go
back to seen one and i'm not going to
show you the the single layer transition
technique in this tutorial it just it
would take a little too long maybe in
another one if you guys really want to
know how but I think the layering out
your images on separate layers is a much
cleaner nicer method so just use that
one and then so here we have layer one
let's just call this container clip is
what's living on that layer and then
make a new layer and call it
actionscript and I think I put an
actionscript layer in here and I don't
need it well any time you would need an
actionscript layer in here is if you
wanted it to like stop dead right there
or something you can press f9 type in a
stop action and you'll see if I render
out it'll stop dead right in between the
fade
BAM you see that so that's how you can
manipulate that but we're not going to
so let's delete that layer we're going
to manipulate it from here okay so now
all we need is the code set up here in
this keyframe that will control this
container and we're going to like I said
we're going to make it to where the
users mouse goes over it it pauses so
they can look at a picture for extend
amount of time and then users miles goes
away from it it will resume from the
point that they that it was at it will
resume from the point that it was when
the users mouse went over it to pause it
in the first place ok now the code to
pull this off is so simple I'm just
going to add an event listener for mouse
over or Mouse out make little functions
for it and that's it so let's make the
first little function so sorry what I
did there was highlight my action script
layer press f9 to open my actions panel
and I'm typing in code that's going to
affect that movie clip function let's
name this one stop the fade so stop fade
this is event colon mouse event
close up the parentheses let me spell
this right
open the curly bracket close the curly
brace and then inside of that stop fade
function we're just going to simply say
container dot stop that's it tell you
that was easy now for the next function
let's just copy that one go a couple
lines down say container play and
that'll make it resume so let's name
this function resume fade now all we
need is a couple of little event
listeners and we're dead so let's say
container dot add event listener reason
why let's see we have to name this thing
first or this code won't work that's
highlighted on stage down the the
instance name properties panel for the
instance name under the movie clip type
in container keep it simple you can name
it whatever you want really now the code
will connect to it so container that add
event listener open closed parenthesis
hit the semicolon and in between the
parenthesis let's type in mouse event
dot mouse over all caps on this
underscore over and now all we need is
the function name stop fade put that
right here and let's just copy that real
quick
put it one line down this is going to be
Mouse out that we want here and this is
going to be resumed fade so let's just
type in result now we have that event
listener is connected to this function
and we'll fire this function off
whenever this event is met now whenever
this event is met for the mouse over
it'll fire up this function to stop the
container from fading in and out so
let's test it out hopefully everything
go right ok there it is and we see it's
fading in and out now let's put my mouse
on it in mid fade see you still see the
church back there and the diner and if I
mouse out it will resume and it'll stay
on a picture for as long as I want as
long as my mouse is on it it'll stay on
that picture and not fade in and out
then when I move my mouse off the movie
clip resumes is that simple it's that
easy you see how it's in mid fade and I
stopped it see and so that think that's
everything you need to know about it
this is a really cool trick catching the
users I and engaging your users making a
cooler site ok we'll see you guys next
