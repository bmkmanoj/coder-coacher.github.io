the new numeric stepper form control of
html5 as well as tying it to JavaScript
for all of your application processing
needs the numeric stepper uses the input
tag to render to the page just like our
slider and other mechanisms do the input
tag of html5 is much more powerful and
versatile than it used to be this is the
finished product of what we will achieve
in this video lesson you'll have a
mechanism that allows person to take a
number up and down to the selected value
and you can put the minimum and maximum
for those values within the code and
when I press submit we tie this to
JavaScript so it sends that value of 3
through our form processing will once
again begin with a basic html5 web page
structure and build our tiny application
the first thing we'll do is go into the
body tag and establish our input tag and
the type is going to be number this time
and that's how you render the numeric
steppers by using the number type then
let's give that an ID that way we can
associate it to our JavaScript let's
call it stepper 1 now the next attribute
we want is the minimum so you say min is
equal to 1 or whatever number you want
to establish as the minimum and then you
set the max again this will be the
maximum that it can be stepped up to
let's make this just 10 you can make the
maximum whatever you want as well and
the default value that you want it to be
when it renders to the page initially
goes here and I'll just make mine 1 or
I'll just make it 5 that way it's in the
middle they can tick up or down but you
can make it be at 1 whatever you want it
to be now let's go ahead and close our
input tag now let's add a couple of
break tags just so we have some space in
between the submit button and our
numeric stepper so what we're going to
do here is put an input tag once again
this is going to be button type that way
we can have a button right there in the
page type equals button and on the on
click event when the button is clicked
what we want to do is fire off a
JavaScript function and we'll call that
JavaScript function save value
so you can save that value to my SQL
database using PHP or whatever by using
Ajax post in JavaScript what we'll do is
establish this step for one ID as the
variable the one argument that we're
going to send through this save value
function in JavaScript so JavaScript
knows what stepper that we want to
affect with this button click or
JavaScript will know which stepper value
it needs to process with the button
click and after on click then you can
just put a value for that button what
the button will say it's label and that
will say submit close that input tag as
well so if you look in the design mode
you'll see a field and then a submit
button but if you render it in Google
Chrome you'll see the actual numeric
step for now C but if you press submit
nothing happens because we have not
written any JavaScript so now let's
write some JavaScript this save value
function so let's go into the head tag
put our opening and closing script tags
in and let's type in function and you
can grab the name right here save value
function save value and it's being sent
one argument which is the ID of the
numeric stepper so you can just put in
stepper that'll be the variable name
that is associated with this particular
stepper stepper one so if you had
multiple steppers on the page you could
use this function in a universal sort of
way now the first thing we'll do in this
function is get the stepper value we
want to attain the value of the stepper
the number that's in it so we'll save
our step val is equal to document dot
get element by ID and then instead of
target actually we'll name that target
because that makes more sense this will
be the target element which is step four
one in this case so we'll save value for
the target element that way the variable
name but step four one is going to be
target in this case within the function
so you say document dot get element by
ID target which is the tag we want to
get a value for dot value and that's how
you get the number for the step or value
number that's in your numeric stepper
now let's make it alert to pop up a
little box that will show you the value
of the stepper so you can just make an
alert that says value plus step valve
and I wrote alert for testing purposes
only now here I'm just going to put a
couple of code comments in for you you
can use Ajax to send the adjusted value
within the numeric step four to serve
for storage if needed so you can send it
to PHP and then save it in MySQL or
wherever you're saving it so you use
Ajax to send the value to PHP and then
PHP can save it on the server for you if
you need Ajax post video tutorial that's
that developed PHP comm at this link
right here and actually if you just go
to develop PHP comm and you type in Ajax
post tutorial that will probably come up
within the search okay now let's see
what we have let's render this in Google
Chrome and keep in mind that not all
browsers will render this yet in 2014
html5 goes web standard so you can
expect it to work in all browsers 2014
but for now just testing Google Chrome
because okay so if I adjust the value I
can go from 1 to 10 you see 10 is the
max and 1 is the min so I can put it on
whatever number I want and then press
submit and then that value is within my
JavaScript form processing now and you
can use this within a regular form
scenario where you have a lot of items
and fields to fill in you put your
numeric stepper in just like any other
form field and then when they press
submit on the form you can use its ID or
its name to process with PHP you might
want to put a name attribute here of
stepper one as well that way you can
process just like a normal form but you
can always use Ajax post which a lot of
the web forms and web interaction seems
to be going that way when somebody
changes something it automatically
updates on the server ok so that shows
you how to render the numeric stepper of
HTML 5 and also process it using
javascript we'll see you guys in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
