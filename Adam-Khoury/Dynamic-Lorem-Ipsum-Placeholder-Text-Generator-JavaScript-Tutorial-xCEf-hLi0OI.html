developers who would like to remove the
bulky lorem ipsum placeholder text in
their source code when they're designing
websites and replace it with something
that's a little more nerdy that will
slim their source code down a bit too so
for those of you who don't know lorem
ipsum is old latin dummy text used by
print designers and web designers to
hold the place of real copy that the
site author will write later on so the
designer will copy and paste lorem ipsum
paragraphs into the areas where real
copy will go eventually this allows the
designer to complete the design more
easily by seeing how the page looks with
its text on it before the actual copy is
even written so with just a few lines of
JavaScript I'll show you how to output
all of this and you can even output a
whole lot more if you like but really
however much it outputs is up to you and
the script will even let you specify how
many sentences you want in each
paragraph before a double line break
occurs and forms a new paragraph so I
have my little line of code using
javascript to tell the page to write 40
lines 40 sentences and in the script
logic every time it gets to 10 sentences
it gives it a double line break that way
you get the nice appearance of
paragraphs at the intervals that you set
it to be and it can be any text that you
want it to be any dummy text at all
okay all you have to do is go into the
point of your document where you want
the text to render and open up a script
element the first thing we'll do is
create a variable called Epsom that's
going to be equal to a string which
could be any sentence you want I'm going
to use the quick brown fox jumps over
the lazy dog because that is the
sentence in the English language that
uses it I think it uses every character
of the alphabet and make sure after the
period you just put a space now in the
next line we're going to create a board
loop and the for loop gets three
parameters in order for it to run the
first parameter is a variable called I
which is the value that will be
incremented within the for loop we'll
start it off with a value of zero with a
semicolon and the second parameter uses
a condition operator to see if I is
still less than the ceiling that you
want so in my case I had 40 sentences
that I wanted to output but semicolon
and the next parameter is I plus plus
which is to increment the I variable
because in the start of the loop and the
first time it runs the I variable is
going to be 0 the next time it runs it's
going to be a 1 and the next time is it
be 2 and so on and so forth until it
hits the ceiling of 40 and then your
loop stops the third parameter does not
get a semicolon so after the I plus plus
don't put a semicolon there now if I was
to take a simple document write and
write Epsom which is that sentence in my
for loop and then I view the document
you can see I have a whole bunch of
sentences they're all lumped right on
top of each other but I also want to
have the appearance of paragraphs to
give me really good dummy text so I just
add a little bit more code logic so I'm
going to use an if condition and I'll
explain that to you right now pop in the
if condition go down to lines close off
the curly brace and let's copy this and
let's make sure we leave that in place
so it writes the IPPS on line every time
the loop runs right here regardless of
what's happening in this if condition so
in the if condition we want to put in
set of double quotes and then break tag
actually you want to break tags to
create a double line break now let's
explain what the if conditions logic is
so there's really two can
and I'm joining them together using the
and operator in JavaScript so I'm saying
if I as the loop is running and the eye
keeps incrementing I mul doulas 10 and
I'm using the module is to see if I is
divisible by 10 is equal to 0 that that
will give me a true or false so only if
I is divisible by 10 equaling true and
if I is greater than 1 then and only
then do we write the double line break
to make a new paragraph and let's see
what that gives us so you have the
setting of choosing how many sentences
in total that you want you also have the
setting right here for how many
sentences occur before a double line
break gets inserted the only reason I'm
checking this condition to see if I is
greater than 1 is because if you remove
that let me show you press ctrl s and
run it you'll get a double line break in
the front of your content on the top and
that's not cool you want your text to
start at the top of the container so
that's why you have checking to see if I
is greater than 1 and that gives you
this which is exactly what you want now
like I said you can change this text to
be anything you want you can even put
some old Latin in there if you like to
make it look more like lorem ipsum and
just remember that this variable is the
total amount of sentences which you can
also put that into a variable up here
but it's easier to just write in the
number of sentences that you want to
output and then you write in how many
sentences output before a double line
break occurs to make a new paragraph see
if I make this a 2 or a 3 you'll see
what happens every 3 sentences we get a
double line break to make a new
paragraph so you leave that on something
like 10 and it makes a nice bulky
paragraph dynamically and then if you
want to slim this up or compress it just
a little bit you can remove all the
white space and then you'll have after
you write this you can just compress it
like that you can remove all this white
space really
all this all that this one you remove
that white space that white space that
white space that one that one that one
that one and that's pretty slim right
there and then running to make sure it
still goes and you got it so there it is
compressed two little lines can make
thousands of paragraphs so now instead
of having tons and tons of paragraphs of
lorem ipsum clogging up your source code
you can do with dirty nerdy style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
