tutorial you can learn how to create a
vector chalkboard and this is the
finished product of what you'll be
learning how to create this tutorial
comes courtesy of a request that we got
at the world of web craft forums where
the user asks hello all i'm making a
chalkboard application using the canvas
tag where somebody can draw on the
canvas like it is a chalkboard what I'm
wondering is how I would create the
graphics for the chalkboard not the
actual code could anybody point me in
the right direction for graphics I'm
looking for something that would border
the chalkboard like wood or something
and then a little tray where the chalk
would go like in real life I would like
the graphics to look similar to this can
anybody point me in the right direction
so I told the user that I could show him
how to do that using fireworks and he
said that would be nice Thanks create a
new fireworks document and I'm going to
make mine 1400 wide and 550 high you can
make yours any size you needed to fit
into your monitor okay I'll change my
canvas to white and the first thing I'm
going to do is import my blackboard
graphics that I have here now this is
just a photo of an actual blackboard at
a school and I think that's the easiest
way to attain an authentic looking
erased chalk effect but if you want you
can just draw out a black rectangle put
a few shapes on it blur those shapes
give them the blur filter and then also
lower their opacity and then scatter
them around on the blackboard and you'll
have that erased chalk look effect but I
think it's easier just to get an actual
photo of a blackboard or a green board
whatever color you're using but I'm
going to use a black board and turn it
green so let's go to make sure you have
it highlighted click on the filter plus
sign there and go to adjust color hue
and saturation so I'm going to attempt
to make it green so let's see what we
have to do to get it green bring the
saturation up a little bit and then we
can just move the hue bar till we get
the color green we want you can lighten
it up a little bit that looks about
right to me
so press ok then there you have your
green board or you can just leave it
like if you want a blackboard okay I'm
going to grab this see what kind of
dimensions we have 672 by 412 all even
numbers I like that so I'm going to grab
it put it in the middle of the screen
right there now I'm going to grab the
rectangle tool and I'm going to draw
myself a 16 pixel wide rectangle here
and it can be a little bit higher than
the board if you want and I'm going to
change the color to a nice Brown right
about here lighten it up a bit then you
come up here something like that all
right so I'm just going to grab it and
put it right up against that right there
and I'll press control-c control-v to
make another one just like that and slap
it up against the side over here and
then make it match to where the Y
position at 64 matches the Y position
for this one is 64 then I can simply
take one of these again ctrl-c ctrl-v
and then rotate it 90 degrees and I'll
put that on top here like that and then
I'll just hit the scale tool with it
still selected and scale it till it
meets up that other one doesn't have to
be perfect then I'll highlight that
rectangle control-c control-v drag the
copy down to the very bottom until I
have something that looks like that now
I'm going to highlight all four of those
by holding shift as I go around and
select them so you see I have four
objects here highlighted I'm going to go
to modify combine paths and union and
there's my nice little frame all set up
and we're going to add some effects to
that still I'm going to highlight my
green bitmap chalkboard and I'm gonna
make it fit in there snug right about
there and right about there so I'm just
resizing it to where it fits in there a
little bit more snug it doesn't have to
be perfect as long as none of it shows
through you don't see any white lines
you don't see any of the white
background in between the green board
and your frame so I'm going to highlight
the green board and I'm going to give it
another filter effect of inner glow and
it'll have a black inner glow we'll make
it about seven and let's blur it out a
little bit more actually
too much just go back to for blur it out
to about ten then you can bring your
opacity down up or down as you see fit
now let's highlight the frame and let's
go ahead and give that a brown edge and
zoom in holding ctrl and then mouse
wheel so you can zoom in on things and
then what we're going to do is start in
this top corner and we're just going to
put in a little line right there a
45-degree line from here to there and
you just want to make sure it has that
brown color now you can just take that
crystal control-c control-v and then
flip it vertically and then just drag it
down to the bottom either using your
mouse just to grab it and move it or you
can do like I'm doing here and just hit
your down arrow key and you'll see it's
sliding down this way you'll know it'd
be in the perfect pixel location takes
it a little longer or you can just grab
the stupid thing and put it there you
just want to make sure it's in the right
spot looks like it's a little too long
so I'm going to take this and move this
dot right there we'll do the same to the
one on top right there okay that's
perfect now you can highlight this one
let's go back to our regular pointer
tool I like this one and this one so you
have those two little lines control-c
control-v and then flip them
horizontally and then you can just slide
those to the other side those will take
forever so you just want to grab those
and put them close enough zoom in make
sure you're in the right spot with those
looks about right to me yeah that's good
enough
now you can highlight your frame and
play with some textures down here I have
the metal texture selected so you can
see if I bring it up to about 50% see
what that does so I might bring it to
maybe 14 something like that maybe even
a little less you can put any texture
that you want on there there's even a
wood texture down at the bottom right
there yeah so we'll just leave it would
let's take this and that inner glow I'm
going to darken it just a little more
make sure it shows through a little more
now let's take all of that just
highlight everything to arrow key just
move it up just a little bit so you got
room to play on the bottom here
because we're not going to be putting
anything else on top above that now
let's highlight our frame just to be
sure that the next rectangle that we
pull out will have that same color and
we're going to draw it in right at the
bottom here and then we're going to go
to our school tool with it still
selected and we're going to hold shift
and skew this edge outward and that will
give us a little 3d perspective on our
little tray that will be sitting there
then we're going to draw one more
rectangle right underneath that one and
it's not going to be very high right
about like that this one I'm going to
make just a little bit darker and then
this one on top let's go ahead and
highlight both of those and hit your
arrow key up once it'll meet those edges
up a little bit better you can even put
this up here if you like right there to
cover those edges down there but for now
we'll just put it right there now I'm
going to highlight this one and I'm
going to change the wood texture to a
line horizontal maybe this one and then
I'm going to bring it all the way up and
what that'll do is it'll give me
something that looks like a little tray
and it's a little too high so I'm going
to highlight this one and this one and
scale them together just bring them up a
little bit
right about there actually I'm going to
highlight these two again and bring them
up just a little bit more scale them and
this one it's height let's make that
about 8 now it looks like we have a 3d
perspective of a little tray that holds
that's designed to hold chalk and the
little erasers okay let's highlight this
frame once again and let's give this an
inner glow it'll be black for let's
bring the board down to - let's bring
that to for the blur down to - sorry
bring the floor down to a tool in the
blur and then you can play around with
the opacity setting for that to get just
the right look you want and what that
does is just gives a little more depth
and realism to the frame
see what it looks like at 50% it's even
a little bit too much let's blur it out
2/3 and bring it down to about right
about there now these two you can group
those together control G that way you
highlight them they move together like I
said you can move them up to be sitting
right there if you want and I'm going to
change the height on this because I
don't like the angle on it too much
actually I'm going to make them on
grouped by ctrl shift G will ungroup
those two and then I could just maybe
move this one up a little now I don't
want to do that I want to make this one
less high so maybe just make that 10 and
then bring this one up to match it right
there something like that
now that gives us a better perspective
3d perspective to where we can put an
eraser and a piece of chalk on there now
creating your chalk is simple you can
just grab a little rectangle draw it out
make it the size you want it make sure
it has no edge and we can just have a
gradient of linear we'll make it white
on top and a darker gray kind of color
on the bottom something like that and
then you can round that rectangle to
where its edges aren't so sharp
but that would be a full new piece of
chalk there but if you wanted something
with the edges a little rounded you
could do that so you can see what that
looks like
rounded edges so you just drag that down
into place where you want it let's put
it right about there you can put a
couple more ctrl-c ctrl-v
move them around put them anywhere you
want them in there if you want you can
even drop a little shadow on those drop
shadow let's make the angle go up only
about maybe 2 2 or 3 on the length now
for the eraser I'm just going to grab a
rectangle draw it in to the board right
about there
I'm gonna make it really dark so I'll
leave it with a linear like that but on
top I like that and then on the bottom
actually on the top I want a darker like
that you can see it still has that wood
texture on it we zoom in
you can notice there is a little bit of
noise on it because of that wood texture
and that's good now I'm going to round
the edges on that because I don't want
them so shot maybe thirty to something
like that
now we'll zoom in on that press ctrl-c
ctrl-v where you have a copy of that one
you're going to adjust the height and
you can even make it just a little bit
bigger than the one under it then change
the colors to the wood kind of color
maybe something really dark on this edge
then you can highlight this little gray
piece again and let's give that an inner
shadow of white change the angle to
where it's coming directly on the side
there use that to about four then we'll
do the same thing to the other side so
while it's still selected go to shadow
inner shadow make it white and then turn
the angle to where it's coming from the
other direction turn it to about four
okay and then one more inner shadow this
one you're going to leave it black make
it come up about three change the angle
to where it's coming up from the bottom
you can even darken that just like that
actually the bottom is a little dark so
I'll lighten that up a little maybe
sixty right about there you can make
this one just a little bit high up maybe
make that seven there we go
and you can make this top piece any
color you want now finally let's zoom in
and highlight those two items ctrl G
will group them together go back to a
hundred percent go to filter drop shadow
and we're going to drop the shadow up
like we did for the chalk degrees to be
90 for the angle then let's bring this
down to about four let's blur that out a
little more right about there actually
just bring that down to about to see
what that looks like it's not too bad
now let's bring the opacity down
there that looks okay now you can just
press ctrl-a to highlight everything
press ctrl-g to group everything and
then now you have everything in a nice
group and then when you want to render
it out you can just fit canvas to it and
then you go to file export wizard and
then you just use your export wizard
there to make it a jpg gif PNG or any
kind of file that you want to export it
as for the web okay so that's how you
make custom black board or green board
chalkboard graphics from scratch using
Adobe fireworks we hope you found this
exercise useful and we'll see you in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
