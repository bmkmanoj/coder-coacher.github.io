custom content management systems using
PHP and MySQL in this lesson series
we're learning how to create just very
basic systems that you can give to your
clients your friends your family your
dog or your cat or a little hamster and
they can manage the page content if they
don't know HTML if they stupid and very
quickly before we resume production of
our system I want to show you guys where
the playlist is it's right on my channel
so if you're watching this video at
YouTube you can click my little picture
there it'll take you to my channel and
on my channel there's the playlist right
there how to build custom CMS and you
click that and there's all the videos in
that playlist it's in that groovy and
part 6 will be in there when I get
finished with it and then when I finish
with the whole system I'm gonna release
the source code so you can get to it if
you'd like to see it or you can just
build with me as I go ok when we last
left off in part 5 we were creating the
admin center the root or the directory
that the person who is administering the
site goes to to edit pages and make
pages so if we go to that directory we
navigate there we're not logged in as
the administrator it gives us a message
of only the administrator the
administrator can view this directory
click here to head back to the home page
so what I'm going to do is to make life
easy and keep things good and simple but
yet workable right here under this title
line we're gonna place a little form
that says please log in as administrator
and then once they log in using a
username and password then we're gonna
let them see the actual root directory
so let's make that little form now okay
here we are in Dreamweaver and all we
have to do is I'm gonna go into the
design view and then I'm just gonna play
place the form in using design view I'm
going to use a table
everybody yells at me for using my
tables but I'm hooked on tables I know
it's no good for search engine
optimization but I really don't care I
really don't care I love my tables okay
so let's go to let's highlight the table
let's make it maybe I don't know 500
wide 500 pixels that is not percent not
even that much maybe 300 very small
there we go 340 that's great okay now
I'm going to make it two columns table
three rows actually let's make it four
rows there we go now I'm going to merge
those selected cells I'm gonna merge
those selected cells and on top I'm
going to write please log in here
we can move this over and just type in
username and password
all righty now let's go into the code
view and there you have a table sitting
above our PHP we're gonna move that in a
second to put it in the PHP output where
it needs to go so what I'm gonna do is
place a form in here in the table so it
will have a field here for username a
field here for password and then a
button here to submit okay so in the
code view I've started my form tag here
right when the table opens right after
the table opens so everything nests
correctly you can nest the form into a
table using this method and so right
when the table tag opens you put in the
form tag the opening form tag and then
right before the table closes you put in
the closing form tag and it will nest
correctly so let's go into the design
view and now we can just place first let
me talk about the the forms opening tag
we have action form action admin check
that PHP so what that means is when the
submit button is pressed this form will
go to this page you can also use the PHP
server variables to access self if you'd
like or this method works too but the
the page will parse on its on itself so
we're gonna put PHP within this page a
little more PHP to do the logging in and
the checking to see if the username and
password is correct so all this means is
if the form is submit button is pressed
this page is going to be accessed again
so we can parse the born method is post
so we'll gather posted variables from it
and the target itself now let's place in
the design view let's place in the
fields go to forms or you can just go to
insert form
textarea text field we want sex field
okay and then in the code view you can
see the input type is text name is user
name let's change that to user name what
we want it to be IDs user name and now
we can just take that and copy it ctrl C
and put it here for the password field
just name this password and it is a text
type of input okay now let's look at the
design see what we have that's great
you can also style these form fields by
adding inline styling if you go to style
and this place the width at about 98%
to do that to the other one too that way
it'll it'll fill your your table column
just about completely there we go
username and password let's move this
over a little bit put colons there it's
great now let's put a submit button
insert form button okay submit it's good
value that's great
name is button that's good code view
let's check it out input type submit
name button ID button value is submitted
and really all that's going to do is
make the form parse activate it send the
information so these values we have set
are good now since this form is going to
be let's snatch this up out of here
control X let's make sure we have it the
way it the way we want it to look
actually let's Center this column and
let's make this login now
now we have everything we need that's
great control X I'm going to show you
how this works let's see right here
under that tag let's press let's just
put it right there
control V see that now the PHP will
output that now let's place that up on
the server and see what we got okay so
now if we're at the site you try to go
to the admin strength admin Center now
we have a form there so all we have to
do now is when they press login just
make sure the appropriate fields are
filled in and they have the appropriate
data and then they'll be logged in as
administrator and we show them the page
that's the index for the admin Center
and that will allow them to create pages
and edit the existing pages ok so right
in the first section of this PHP script
I'm going to write after the PHP block
starts I'm going to push down a few
lines by pressing enter there and make
sure that this if statement is the
second thing to run on the page first
thing to run on the page is going to be
an if condition to see if that form is
posted to so basically if the form is
not posted they're going to see this
second if statement if they happen to
not be logged in and if they happen to
see this information and then they use
the little form here and press submit
then we're gonna run this top if
statement but if they don't press submit
they don't see this form or they don't
fill out the form for submit this top
section will not run okay now I've got
the little script written that will do
the checking to see if their admin
information is correct now what we'll do
in the first line is you'll see we have
two different PHP blocks now the one we
started with to check admin session is
registered and has a value of the admin
name now we have a new PHP block in
admin check PHP that does the checking
to see if that form is
has values and is submitted and I
changed this from input type text to
input type password now in the form when
it's pressed let's see let's go to the
page let's go try to go to the admin
Center we're not logged in it says only
the admin can view this directory please
login so let's say I just press login
now you'll see that nothing happens
because I was the wise guy and I didn't
put any information in nothing should
happen press login now nothing happens
now if I put a username of whatever crap
and I press login now it says your login
information is incorrect but if I was to
happen to put the correct username in a
correct password which is what you give
to client press login now let's see what
happens
the term innate door and goober nuts
that's the password press login now and
there it is there's the admin control
panel and it's only accessible if the
administrator is logged in with the
correct information now let's look at
that parsing file let me explain it to
you that the admin check dot PHP the
first block up top now is checking to
see first we cook in line two here we
create or initialize a variable of ever
message because we're going to use that
error message remember that red text
that showed up and said you're missing
information or your information is not
correct that error message is going to
show up so we have to initialize that
variable because it's being output to
the page now and I output it here in the
form see every message right there if
there's no error message that comes up
they won't even see that but if there
happens to be one it goes right there
you can see I make the font color red
you're in your login information is
incorrect but let's go through this line
by line so here we initialize that error
message variable so we can use it below
then we have an if condition here and
here is where it closes so if condition
opens here in line 3 closes line 21 and
this is just very basic
and most of the time you would use MySQL
to get this into the preferred format
but just for this example and I have my
SQL functionality for this kind of thing
in the web intersect series you can take
the web intersect series to learn how to
create official logins using MySQL where
the data is stored in the database for
the admin here we're just using
hard-coded variables right there alright
so here's the if statement that opens up
and it's saying if post username so I
did that because if they don't happen to
put a value in the username field I just
don't want anything to happen like I
said they're a wise guy to didn't put
anything in they press submit so they
shouldn't see anything now if they put
variables in it's going to if they put
values in it's going to parse this so
what happens is we create local PHP
variables from the posted variables in
the fields in the form here we access
those fields and here we place them into
local variables now we take we create
our simple hard-coded values to check
the and I just made the name the admin
name terminator and the password is
Gruber nuts so you have to type in
Terminator the Terminator and goober
nuts to get in and nobody would guess
that ever and so the next line since we
established what the form fields are
coming in as what the user put in and
then we established what the correct
ones are here we can do comparison and
that's what this if statement does here
if the username is not equal admin so
that means if this variable and this
variable do not match and if the
password does not equal admin pass that
means if the password variable here that
they put in does not match match the
password variable that is in our
official admin that's our official admin
password then they get this error
message the login information is
incorrect but if they happen to put the
correct admin
information in then we session register
a variable of admin and then we set that
session admin variable to have a value
of username which is the Terminator if
they get everything correct
so the session variable the admin
becomes our has a value of term the
Terminator and then we just throw in the
require once and index.php that's the
admin center index and then we exit the
script so all they see is voila if they
get things right so it's really the most
basic login all really compact and basic
and you would use MySQL if you wanted to
really get it official and have the the
client be able to change their password
and stuff like that if they if you
wanted a system like that but this is
good enough nobody can see your PHP
scripting and correct me if I'm wrong
guys but I don't think you guys can go
onto my servers in any way or on to my
sites and see my PHP scripts but correct
me if I'm wrong so I think this is very
secure way to do it for a basic system
okay now in part 7 all we have to do is
since we're sitting here looking at the
admin control center and I already have
some little forms in here one for create
a new page and one for edit existing
page and they just place the ID of the
page they want to edit right there so
all we need is two more forms or two
more scripts and then we're done so I
would think in part 7 we would do create
new page form and part eight edit
existing page and then we're done
and I'll show you where the good WYSIWYG
czar the good HTML not HTML but the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor x'
that people use for populating or
formatting text and adding images when
they don't know HTML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
