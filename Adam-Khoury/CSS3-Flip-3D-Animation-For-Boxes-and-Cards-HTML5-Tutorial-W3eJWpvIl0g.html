exercise you will learn to create an
animated flipping effect in 3d space
using CSS which allows more content to
be displayed on the backside of any
elements when the user interacts with
them
it's a really creative way to deliver
more content to your users you can make
flip animations for card games show
recipes in the back of food photos you
can even use it for your portfolio
pieces with a project thumbnail is on
the front and the project information
with some links is on the back of the
thumbnail when it flips over the ways
you could use it are only limited by
your imagination first let's take a look
at the finished effect that way you can
know what you're getting yourself into
I have three boxes here when I put my
mouse over them they flip and keep in
mind that the animation would look a
whole lot smoother on your machine
because the frame rate of my recorded
video is going to make the animation
appear a little bit choppy but trust me
it's smooth as butter and you can put
content on the front and the back of
these elements which is really cool
really there's two elements stacked in
there back-to-back and by default the
one on the back is flipped 180 degrees
but then when the animation occurs it is
made to rotate back to zero degrees and
the one that is originally on the front
rotates to 180 degrees okay let's get
cracking crackers
we're going to begin with the bare bones
of an html5 web document mine is named
flip 3d css3 tutorial HTML you can name
yours whatever you want now within the
body element we're going to start with
our HTML just to get that out of the way
because it's very simple we're going to
start with a div go down a couple of
lines and close that div we're going to
give that div an ID equal to flip 3d and
inside of that div we're going to make a
child div and close that and let's give
that child div an ID that's equal to
back and let's just put in the inner
HTML box one back and this is where you
can put all of the HTML all the content
that you want on the back side of the
element now let's just copy that child
div and make another child div called
the front we'll say box one front in the
inner HTML and basically that's the
structure of the HTML it's very simple
actually I'm going to change these to
class instead of ID that way we can
target multiple boxes or multiple cards
all at once with one set of style rules
so change for the ID to class I can take
that div ctrl C and just put two more or
as many as I want and then in the inner
HTML just say box two box two box three
box three so you have box two back box
two front box three back and box three
front now what we're going to do in the
CSS is basically in 3d space we're going
to rotate the back in front of these
flip 3d elements to where one starts at
zero degrees rotation and the other
starts at 180 degrees rotation and then
we're going to simply flip them the one
that was at zero is going to go to 180
degrees or negative 180 degrees and the
one that started at 180 degrees is going
to flip to zero degrees so that's the
logic of what we want to produce now up
in our CSS the first thing we're going
to do is target this class of flip 3d so
you just type in dot flip 3d and open
and close your curly braces each one we
want to have
a width I'll set mine to 240 pixels you
can style these any way you want
height and say 200 pixels margin I'm
only giving the margin space so they
have some space in between each card or
each flip 3d box 10 pixels in between
each I'm going to make sure each flip 3d
block or Box floats left that way we can
stack them horizontally on the page if
you don't float them left they're going
to stack vertically down the page that's
all the styling that we're going to do
for these container to flip 3d container
boxes now we want to target this flip 3d
container box class again and affect all
child divs with the class of front so
we're targeting all divs with the class
of front open and curly brace and put
the closing curly brace now the first
thing I want to affect is the position
I'm going to make it absolute and I'm
going to use the css3 transform property
I'm going to affect the perspective will
run the perspective function and we want
to affect the rotate Y so we're going to
run the rotate Y function as well for
the transform property and the
perspective we want to set somewhere
around 600 pixels you can make it a
thousand pixels as long as it has a high
enough pixel amount to where it's not
really warped if you put this down to
maybe a hundred pixels you'll see that
it's a really warped perspective so I
put it at 600 to give it a nice
perspective now for the rotate Y value
we're just going to put 0 degrees
because the front of the card or the
front of the element is facing forward
by default and the reason why I put
absolute position is just so I can
easily stack those divs in there so I
just put the back in first and then I
put the front right over it so the front
will stack on top now this next set of
properties is just to effect its basic
cosmetics so the front of the card is
going to have this background the width
is going to be 240 and the height is
going to be 200 same dimensions as our
flip 3d container box and I just gave it
a border radius of 7 pixels just for a
cool cosmetic
to round off the edges now we want to
run the back face visibility property
and make its value hidden that way you
can't see the backside of elements as
they're turning around you'll only see
the appropriate side as its spinning now
to animate the transform property we're
going to use the transition property so
we run the transition property to affect
the transform property and CSS and over
a point five seconds so over half a
second it's going to animate in a linear
fashion that's how long the animation
takes to occur point five seconds so if
you want to be faster you make this a
smaller number if you want it to be
slower you make this a larger number now
since this is css3 I'm going to be
testing in Firefox because Firefox
respects the standardized syntax of the
transform property in css3 in other
browsers you might have to use prefixes
but I'll discuss that at the end of the
video and we'll put in prefixes for
WebKit and opera whatever else we need
to put it in for but for now I would
recommend you test in Firefox if you
want to test in Google Chrome and just
wait more towards the end of the video
and I'll put all the prefixes in and you
can test in Chrome now all we're going
to do is copy this whole set of rules
here for the front and we're going to
paste we're going to change front to
back that way we're affecting the divs
with the back class I'm going to leave
all these properties pretty much the
same we're just going to change the
rotation from 0 degrees to 180 degrees
so rotate Y for the backs are set to 180
degrees that way by default before the
user interacts with the element it's
already flipped on the y axis in the
opposite direction that way when the
animation occurs it just writes itself
to zero degrees and then the front card
inverts itself to minus 180 degrees so
what you can do is just take this rule
here or the starting of this rule and go
down one line pop that in make sure you
put in your closing curly brace we're
going to do now is target the flip 3d
hover
pseudo selector and what that does is
anytime anybody's mouse goes over or any
time the user hovers over any of these
containers with the class of flip 3d the
hover State the hover pseudo selector
will initiate new rule and all we have
to do inside of that is change the
transform so we leave the perspective
how it is at 600 and we change the
rotate why for the front element to
minus 180 degrees then we can just take
that copy it and make the same thing for
the back now the back when the flip 3d
container is hovered the back card of
the back of the card is going to flip to
0 degrees no I just notice I have
semicolons in the value area for the
perspective you don't want that it won't
run correctly that way and we also need
to change the background color on the
back so I'm going to go to color and
change it to a nice light blue okay save
and then file preview in browser Firefox
you see now you have nice back to front
flipping animations you put any content
that you want in the back in front of
these boxes you can put as many of these
boxes that you want on the page together
and these CSS rules will affect all of
them now if I go to file preview in
browser Google Chrome I get no animation
no effect it's because I need the WebKit
prefix for the transform property so
let's see if we put in the WebKit prefix
for the transform property if we get a
working application in Google Chrome and
Safari what we have to do is copy these
transform lines the standard syntax and
right above it will put the WebKit
prefix version and we'll do the same
thing down here in the hover State and
we also have to add the prefix for the
WebKit transition transform property so
I guess what we can do is copy that and
right above it we'll just put a WebKit
version right here and we'll do the same
thing
to this one see if that works take a
WebKit prefix and put it right on the
front of this transform property I think
Google Chrome is okay with the back face
visibility and transition and all that
we just have to prefix the transform
property anywhere that it is so now
let's go to file preview in browser
Google Chrome you can see that we have
our animation but we're not getting any
we might also have to prefix the back
face visibility so let me try that
let me put WebKit on the back face
visibility let's grab that and also put
it down here file preview in browser
google chrome there we go
so now we have a working application in
chrome as well as Firefox so we file
preview in Firefox yep now it's working
in all the WebKit browsers Firefox and
let's try it in Internet Explorer yep
it's working in Internet Explorer 10 as
well for older Internet Explorer
versions you might have to use the MS
prefix and for opera you have to add the
Oprah fix so instead of WebKit you also
add to this application the o prefix to
target opera browsers and that will help
you target all browsers if you use the
WebKit MS and o prefixes MS is for
internet explorer older versions always
for opera and I just demonstrated how
WebKit is for Google Chrome and Safari
browser now in Firefox you don't have to
worry about cuz it uses it relies on the
standardized syntax which is cool all
right now I have a homework assignment
for you guys that will test your logic
and your creative skills when it comes
to JavaScript programming because you
have the target more than just the hover
effect the hover pseudo selector because
as you notice our boxes flip when we
interact with them in the hover State
the hover pseudo selector but there's
many times where you would want the
user to actually click on something to
make that animation occur really when
you're playing card games and things
like that the user would click a card to
make it flip and furthermore when people
are on mobile devices there really is no
hover state so then you're screwed there
if somebody is on a smartphone or a
tablet they can't hover they can only
tap so you want to make the click event
the or onmousedown event the mechanism
that triggers the animation to occur and
not the CSS pseudo selector of hover
that we're using here you see we're
using the pseudo selector of hover to
make the animations occur so this is
your homework assignment I want you to
go to develop PHP calm and type into the
search bar trigger CSS transition Java
Script type in trigger CSS transition
JavaScript and search now you're going
to see a video tutorial at the top of
the list
it's called trigger css3 transitions
with JavaScript to control animations so
I want you to take the logic in this
video tutorial and trigger your new cool
flip animation your flip 3d animation
using JavaScript functions which I
clearly show through this whole tutorial
here now remember in your JavaScript you
also have to put the let me just go to a
new page alright so say like in your CSS
you target the WebKit browsers with the
prefix WebKit in this manner you're
putting hyphens around the word WebKit
so that's how you target it in
JavaScript you can target the WebKit
prefix for the transform property in
this manner in your JavaScript and that
might be a little hurdle that some of
you guys run into during your homework
assignment so following this tutorial
will show you how to use JavaScript as
the mechanism that triggers the
animation to run so you can target way
more than just the hover pseudo selector
you can target the click event you can
target maybe when an Ajax operation or
an AJAX request finishes you can make an
animation run like spinning something in
mid
are and saying boom operation finished
or whatever you know whatever you want
to do my point is for the best use of
these kind of animations you would
definitely want to learn how to trigger
these kind of animations in your
JavaScript because while you're
programming card games and things like
that you're going to have to tell those
things to flip on more than just a hover
state more than just when the user's
mouse hovers over it you're going to
need more user interaction events and
that's gained through JavaScript all
right so good luck in your homework
assignment so I want you to make these
boxes flip on the click event when
they're clicked or you can put a link in
the front side of the box that will
click to the back side for instance you
can have a link right in here in the
orange side of the box that says click
to flip and when that's clicked you run
a function that will make the transition
occur using JavaScript because right now
it's just running on the hover pseudo
selector you have to make it more handy
than that and I was considering just
writing it for you guys but that would
take all of the challenge and skill
building away from you it's really going
to test you and build your skills for
you to do it by yourself and it is
definitely possible because I already
did it earlier this morning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
