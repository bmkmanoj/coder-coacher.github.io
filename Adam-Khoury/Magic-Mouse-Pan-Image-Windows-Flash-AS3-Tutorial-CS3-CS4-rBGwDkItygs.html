it's suitable for cs3 and cs4 I'm
showing you how to make magic pan
windows with images behind that I have a
magic pan defect to them the nice easing
on it and we show you how to make it
have an event listener for activating it
and deactivating it so when the users
mouse goes onto the image you can see
this whole white section is the flash
file and our magic window is just on a
little portion of it so when the users
mouse goes on to it it activates the
magic panning when the users Mouse exits
that it stops it that way if you had
menu systems or whatever over here
wouldn't interfere with it because a lot
of people might want to stick this
application on a full flash website and
you can using this one and so we have a
an activator which causes everything to
start panning and stop panning and we
also have a mask that's masking the big
thick that's why you can only see a
certain portion of it and we have the
big pic that's sitting under the mask
and that's how it works we'll have this
source file available free to develop
PHP calm under the flash section and so
you can go ahead and download it and
watch the video if you need any insight
in how to or insight on how to
manipulate it change the size of this
thing size of your big pics whatever you
need to do ok let's rock and roll i'm
working in flash cs3 but you can work in
flash cs4 for this and all the cold will
still apply open a new flash
actionscript 3 project and let's see
first thing we're going to do is drag in
picture from our desktop you can drag
pictures straight into the flash stage
or you can go and import them through
the file menu here ok let's put this at
coordinates of 0 x and y 0 as well
convert it right click it right click
the image on stage converts a symbol
movie clip call it big pic highlight
that instance name and copy it or that
name in the library that we just named
it and give it an instance name here in
the properties inspector where you give
things instance name right now pop the
instance name in so that way you can
connect to it through the code it's at
coordinates of 00 that's good so we're
going to right click it now and convert
to symbol well converting to a movie
clip we're going to call it the whole
magic window and the reason why I'm
nesting it into a movie clip is so it
can be a little more useful to you guys
who use things in full flash websites or
you can use just a little swf on an HTML
website just throw it on the page okay
so now we have a movie clip let's dig
inside that movie clip now by double
clicking it and now you can see inside
the movie clip there's big pick the
original movie clip we made and gave an
instance name so now we're inside the
whole magic window movie clip to make
two more layers on the top let's call
this one a s3 the one under it we're
going to call activate or because that's
where we're going to put our little
activator movie clip and this one we're
going to call big pick because that's
where the big pic resides now let's make
a little activate a window let's see
first we got to make sure we see the
size of our the image that we want to
pan it's eight by eight 800 x 800 and
you'll want to have nice even
coordinates like that or nice even
dimensions but it doesn't have to be
square let's see let's make this
let's just make this 400 by 400 exactly
half the size okay so now we have a
little window let's make that a little
more white that way we can see what's
going on now that little window that
activator let's press ctrl x get it off
of that put it on the activator layer
where it should be control shift be
paste it back in place now let's right
click that convert to symbol name it
activator in the library copy that name
okay now give it an instance name here
activator so now we have activated with
an instance name there and big pic with
an instance name on it as well now we
all we have to do is pop the code in on
this layer and we'll see the magic
happen ok I'm going to highlight that
keyframe press f9 open the actions panel
and pop in my script and now let's press
control enter see what we have okay
that's perfect has a nice ease animation
as it goes through and we're not going
to see anything that's on the sides over
here and I scripted it in such a way so
when I've added event listeners to make
it activate when the mouse goes over the
activator window and when the mouse
leaves the activator window it it
stopped spanning only when it's over
that that way if you had other elements
over here inside of your flash file
wouldn't interfere okay so let's see
some adjustments we can make now because
that's what people will most ask for is
how to modify this thing moving this if
you wanted to move this all from the
corner you could do so press control
enter you can see that it's activated
and still makes everything snap to the
corners and it's still activating
exactly the way it should even though
it's not at the top center of the file
but your picture here your big picture
has to be it
top left corner this can be anywhere you
want okay all right what else would
people want to know how to do change the
size of this activator window i'm going
to show you guys how to mask in a second
but that really shouldn't come to little
you're all set up and have everything
the way you want it then you mask it so
let's go ahead in the activator window
let's go ahead and let's say you've
moved it around on stage and you want
this really to be 200 and not 400 I'm
going to stick with even numbers
divisible or that can be divided by the
800 easily so now we have 200 that's 800
now let's press control enter and see
what happens you can see it's off it's
no worries you want to fix that you can
just go up here and change this to x 2
to x 4 now with it being times for you
press control enter and now there you go
now it sticks to the corners like it
should
that way they can zoom and pan around
the whole image would be just in that
little tiny square okay so that takes
care of resizing it moving it let's go
ahead and bring that back to to bring
this back to 400 and what else would
people want to know yes let's say your
image was not square what you could do
was whatever aspect ratio your image is
just make sure this little window
matches it so let's say this was instead
of 800 x 800 it was 800 x 600 a 4 by 3
ratio you can just make this 400 x 300
so if this is 4 by 3 that's 8 x 6 it
will all match up nice and still act
accordingly act the way it should script
holds true or the script still does its
job even if it's a different aspect
ratio so let's say this was 400 just
make sure this is 200
and everything will still work right
that way you can modify and shape these
things anyway you need to place them
shape them okay now let me show you how
to mask this thing let's put that back
to 400 make this one back to 800 okay
now once you're all set up and you have
it where you want it inside of your
flash file you can right here above big
pic put a new layer grab that activator
press ctrl-c now make it to where you
lock the activator layer and you can't
see it either now in this new layer for
here let's call this mask right there
you just pop in control shift V to paste
in place so it's in the exact same
position is your activated window okay
now you just right click click mask and
it's going to make a mask out of that
layer so you see you can only see that
little piece that it masked of the big
pic now let's bring our activator window
back into where we can see it and let's
press control enter looky there that's
what you want that way you can have a
menu system over here all kind of cool
stuff or you can have a menu system
inside that the window that moves around
or whatever and now just 2 for the
activator window you would just want to
make sure that you can't see it all that
well so you go up to alpha 0
there you go and then you can make a
pretty little border around it any way
you like now let's see since its zone
movie clip back and seeing one you can
move that sucker around anywhere you
want and it will still perform correctly
so that's why I nested it into a movie
clip so there you go everything you need
ok now I'm going to explain the script
very quickly what we do first is we
access some numbers that we need in the
equations down here in the script create
variables out of those numbers that we
need to attain for all lines 2 through 8
the last one is the easing speed the
easing speed is applied right here you
can change this number you'll see your
easing effect change okay now remember i
changed my 22 a 4 during the lesson that
was to make sure that if i happen to
want to move my activator window around
on top a big a big pic that everything
would stick and then you have to adjust
the mat but the size remember i was just
making if my big pic was 800 my that my
activator was 400 my big pic was 400 my
activator was 200 you know what I mean
but you can adjust the math there for
that too and I know what I said is just
confusing you just disregard what i said
and go by what i showed you earlier in
the video but basically after we get
those numbers and i'm not going to
explain how to do math you should have
stayed in school if you want to
understand how to do math because these
are simple equations that you should
have learned in high school and all
we're doing is using variables so
there's three functions the first
function is activate the second one is
add into frame event and the third one
is removed
enter frame event the reason why we have
an ad in the frame event and a remove
enter frame event function that way we
can make the functionality and the logic
we need to wear when their mouths goes
over it it activates and when their
mouths leaves the activator movie clip
it stops it and that's why we have two
event listeners here as well these two
event listeners buy off these two
functions so these two event listeners
arbor activating and deactivating the
magic panning and inside of this
function activate is really where all
the movement occurs so you set some
variables here that really you can't set
these variables up top here because they
have to be inside of this on inter frame
event and really this function is
running in the on inter frame event so
we have to make sure these are dynamic
variables so that's why we claim them
inside here because they're always
changing depending on where the users
Mouse's and depending on where the big
pic is in relation to the activator and
right here the 16 and 17 is where the
movement actually occurs according to
these equations here and that's how it
works but basically the script will not
need to be modified really what you
would do mostly is modify is set up your
size incorrectly and everything to match
nice okay we'll see you next lesson
we'll have this source file available
