with you guys and I want you guys to
give feedback in the form of video
responses or text responses text
comments under the video and what I'm
going to do is have a little fun here
and check out who validates and who
don't and we're going to discuss a few
things of because a lot of people really
are stuck like glue to validation and
those let's just let's have some fun
let's go to let's check YouTube 171
errors 40 warnings check myspace
they have errors to not many but they
have errors a yahoo big giant 4 billion
dollar site or two billion dollar site
one of the most used web sites on the
web it's got every sack Google's huge
one of the most huge used websites one
of the most money making websites what
else we got facebook is one of the
hugest money making web sites Twitter
gigantic money making website yes you
see what I'm saying okay WWE so what
does this tell us this tells us that if
we want a website to do really well and
gain the most traffic and make the most
money following example we should really
not worried about it validating it's you
know this was interesting msn watch msn
the only ones who care haha and it
really doesn't even matter let's go to
who who else did I want to show Adobe
programming God's right programming gods
who give us all these godlike tools for
programming on the web their main
website bang out roars you say I'm
saying you see I'm saying you go to big
cool sites make a lot of money none of
them validate not any of the big ones
who else is a big site most big sites
that you check that really move and
shake online do not validate and they
continue in their success they continue
in their search engine indexing and
spidering and yes maybe they're not up
what's the word
multisystem operable maybe they can't
operate on all kinds of mobile devices
and systems but I you know these are the
biggest money-making sites on the web
and I just proved to you that none of
them validate and so everybody who makes
us think about markup validation and
checking your markup to see if it
validates I don't think it's really a
big concern all you should do is check
to see that it works in all major
browsers your websites all your pages
should render the same pretty much in
all major browsers you should have all
of them installed in your system ok so
you guys tell me what you think about
all of these really huge million billion
dollar websites not validating and all
of the people what do you tell all the
people who are such sticklers for
validation now what would you tell them
would you tell them to continue their
pursuit of one hundred percent
validation and be such an anal prick
about it or would you tell them it's not
really a big deal don't even worry about
it let me know what you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
