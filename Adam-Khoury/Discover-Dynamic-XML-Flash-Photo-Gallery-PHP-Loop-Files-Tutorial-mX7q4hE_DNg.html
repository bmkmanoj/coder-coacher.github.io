Adam here in this lesson we're gonna
discover the magic of dynamic XML PHP
files for those of you who are not fully
comfortable with it yet
I've done a few tutorials on this at
develop PHP that are in text tutorial
form and maybe a few people have been
stumbled upon them yet or maybe a few
people saw the scripts and said well
that looks kind of complicated I'm gonna
try and dispel the whole thing in this
video series and make sure that you guys
fully understand how this works so
basically it's a PHP file that renders
out nice clean XML it's almost like it's
perpetrating as an XML file so you can
then feed that PHP file into whatever
XML processing software or applications
that you have that are fed from XML now
before I start the lessons and give away
any scripts that you guys can go and
snatch up from the site I want to
explain one more thing you can see the
little magician here who is rendering
out the magic XML files he says it
requires no updating once you create
your magic XML file it runs and it will
bring in all the newest data without
requiring updating from anybody nobody
will have to touch the XML file once
it's created correctly it's easy to
create and implement once you understand
just a few things and it's ideal for
flash rendering out XML through my SQL
database results and many many more
things any kind of software or
application that feeds itself from an
XML file this can be used for and
instead of saying my XML XML you just
feed in my XML dot PHP and it gets seen
as XML ok so let's look at the most
useful scenarios of implementation for
this kind of coding here's your client
and here's you you made a client a cool
application that is driven through XML
file and you want it to always grab the
most current information dynamically
from the server this is perfect for that
or if you're a developer creating XML
apps for your own site and you don't
really have clients that you work with
you just kind of concentrate on
maximizing your own sites and you want a
little more dynamics out of your XML
then this is a good way to do it use PHP
to render out XML through loops so the
first thing I'll do in lesson 1 here is
I'm gonna show you how to create dynamic
photo gallery XML files since PHP can
just peek inside of any folder that you
designate see what kind of files are
inside of it the name of the files how
many there are
since PHP can do all of that dynamically
we can have PHP be the brains and be the
system of rendering out the XML since it
has those abilities so if we go to
develop PHP this is in the PHP course
right here PHP course if you click that
you'll see all this stuff in here and
down near the bottom it says working
with files folders and directories the
very last tutorial there is all about
opening and reading directory folder
contents dynamically using PHP if you
click on that you'll see I give a nice
little example about how to make a loop
that renders out every image within the
file within a folder any folder that you
designate so we can get a count and we
can also display every one of those
images within a loop so let's close that
page and let's open the file that I was
able to render out this XML file see
this source ok let me close this one and
show you the actual page when you run
the script you're just gonna see a blank
page like this it's just gonna look like
a blank page to you what you have to do
is view the source you right click view
source and you'll see your XML nice
clean XML you see that so what I've done
is you can see the XML version and
encoding type tag right there and then
the XML starting tag right there and go
down at the very bottom
here's the XML closing tag now within
the XML opening and closing tag
you have picture tags so the picture tag
says set up right here and then there's
a child node inside of the the picture
node that has pic num and this one is 1
this one is pic num to pick number 3
pick number 4 pick number 5 and then it
shows the pic URL which could be sent
into flash or whatever for rendering out
that image and that's it's it's so
simple and that's how it works so if any
of you understand how XML works you'll
fully comprehend this lesson if you
don't understand how XML four works in
the first place this is not the lesson
for you you should really understand how
XML works before you jump into something
like this so now I'm gonna show you the
script that is actually making this
possible and here it is in Dreamweaver
and I'll zoom in on it the best I can so
you can see the code and I'm also gonna
have all of this code available at
develop PHP comm I'm just gonna make a
page that has all of this information in
it with links to all of these files that
you can just copy and paste and
experiment with you see remember that
picture tag that I was showing you I had
about 24 of them listed out in my XML my
magic XML file and you can see there's
only one picture tag in this script but
it's within a while loop so what that
does is within this while loop every
file that it finds in that folder since
PHP can go into any folder and see what
contents is in that folder and display
them we can use that to render out nice
clean XML so we're rendering out picture
node and child nodes of the picture node
for pic num and pic URL and you can have
any information you want sent in there
by setting up new child nodes and if you
don't know how to work with XML in flash
I have tons of tutorials on that in the
flash tutorial section at develop PHP
the flash video tutorial section and
develop PHP there's there's quite a few
tutorials about using XML to populate
data in flash and if you see here what
we're talking about is creating dynamic
photo gallery XML files
- is gonna be creating dynamic mp3
player XML files and then finally lesson
three that I'm gonna cover and in this
series with is rendering out my SQL
database information into a nice clean
XML which a few people quite a few
people have asked me to do a
demonstration on that okay so let's look
at that script one more time so here
what we're gonna do is the first thing
is we claim the content type to be XML
which is not a very necessary feature
especially if you're feeding this into
flash but if you're using it for
something that's more HTML based or
JavaScript based you might want to claim
the content type to be to be text XML
and you can use the header function to
do that so the next thing we do is we
initialize the XML body variable because
really at the end of the script you echo
out the whole XML body for it to be
rendered out as nice clean XML the first
we have to initialize that XML body
variable and we put in the version and
encoding type into the first part of the
variable then we claim our directory
where the images are located and mine
were in a directory that was to parent
directories up from where I had to
script running so I had that dot dot
slash dot dot slash saying go to
directories up go to folders up but I'm
just gonna remove those for you because
you would probably run this file in the
directory where your images folders are
and then your tech icons would be there
or whatever so I'm just gonna remove
that tech icons - and your images folder
can be whatever you want
so say maybe on your server you have
images folder and then you have gallery
one and you want to search inside that
gallery one folder to render out all of
the items within that gallery one folder
into nice clean XML so I'm gonna leave
this just like this if you don't
understand how to set up your directory
structure
how to go up parent directories look
into folders then this lesson is also
probably a little bit beyond you and you
should learn a few things about how a
server folder directory system is set up
and how to navigate into folders and up
into parent directories okay so most of
you would be really comfortable looking
at this saying okay I see exactly what
he's doing there he's glowing into his
images folder on the server and within
that images folder there's a gallery one
folder and within that gallery one
folders where all his JPEGs are listed
that's exactly what that's saying
so I'm looking into that folder and then
what I do is I start compounding that
XML body variable by using the period
before the equal sign there which will
make it not overwrite what is already in
that variable it will just append to it
it'll keep adding to it so we start the
XML tag and you can see that this is not
within the while loop the only thing
within the while loop is one picture tag
which can be rendered out a thousand
times within that while loop but you
want to make sure you start your XML tag
outside of the loop then we just set up
a directory handle to open directory and
look inside of that directory that we
specified directory handle is now a
variable with that information then we
create an incremental counter variable
if it's needed and what this does is it
increments every time within the loop
every time this loop runs this I will
get incremented so if it starts off at
zero the first time it runs it'll become
a one second time it's a two third time
it's a three four time it's a four so it
can kind of keep a count of what's going
on and how many times or how many
pictures are actually in the folder then
we set the XML body to render out
picture tag you can see I already
discussed all this so the XML body
within the loop renders out a picture
tag for each and every image within that
folder no matter how many there are
whether there's 10 or whether there's a
thousand you just have to write this in
once and that's really what makes it so
nice and then what you do is you close
the if statement and what this if
statement is saying is if this is a not
a directory this file whatever file that
it's looking at is not a directory
because say within this gallery one you
had another folder sitting in there
called miscellaneous you don't want that
to get picked up so if it is not a
folder and if it has a dot jpg extension
then we render out a picture tag for it
or the picture nodes for it in XML if it
doesn't have a dot jpg extension and if
it is a folder then it won't get
rendered out within the XML only if it's
a picture and only if it's not a folder
okay I hope that makes sense to you
because that's exactly what it's saying
it's not really hard to understand at
all so if it's not a folder and it has a
dot jpg extension then on an only then
we render it out then all we have to do
is end the while loop right here close
the directory close the XML tag and then
at any point you echo out the XML body
now I showed you what happens when we go
to that page if you look at it online
you're gonna see a blank page and your
blue item script doesn't work view the
source homie so once you view source
you're gonna see your nice clean perfect
XML you can see I only wrote my picture
tag in once but it rendered out 24 times
because there's 24 images within my tech
icons folder okay so you there's proof
that it's working for you because I got
this running on my server right now and
there's the script so that's all you
need to know and I explained how every
bit of this code works and like I said
if you're not familiar with XML a little
bit and you don't know how to really use
XML this is not going to be handy to you
at all this is for people who use XML
within their applications
okay so in the next lesson I'm going to
show you creating a dynamic mp3 player
XML and then the following one will be
how to create a dynamic XML file using
MySQL database results okay I hope
you're enjoying this city and we'll talk
to you later bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
