demonstrates how easy it is to engineer
interactive canvas based imaging
applications and we do it by randomly
generating data or gathering data from
the user through form inputs then we
render the data on a canvas and save the
canvas rendering as an image on the
server that people can share on social
sites or they can just download it and
there's a million different ways that
you could use something like this you
can provide people with all kinds of
different imaging services so first let
me show you how it works let's say the
recipient is John Doe from Adam quarry
then I press the preview button and a
preview of the image that's going to be
rendered comes into view and this is
actually rendered onto an a canvas
element and up here all you see is a
form with the background of the image
that we're going to use and inside of
that form we put some inputs where they
need to be placed inside of the imagery
to where it makes sense and then when
they press preview we're rendering a
canvas element that has all of the
graphics that we want in place and you
see we drew the names now at this point
this is not an image yet now when I
click render and share it says rendering
please wait that's when it actually
becomes an image on the server so we
have to do is send the user to some page
I called it card dot PHP and it has the
ID for that image that's on the server
the unique ID for that image now that
way the user can just take it and share
it online they can download it save
image as and right now it's a JPEG so
basically all we did was render an image
from whatever dynamic values that the
user provided to us now the birthday
card is the example that you're going to
get but I just wanted to show you
another example of having fun with this
online I could put my full name my birth
year the year I died and the cause of
death and it takes all that data that
the user inputs and previews it onto a
canvas
and then when they click render and
share it makes an image file out of this
canvas and then the user once they get
the image file all they have to do is
you put like Facebook share buttons or
Google share or whatever Twitter share
buttons and it'll share the image
automatically on those social networks
or the user can just take the image
upload it or download it and then share
it wherever they like but there's lots
of options once you get to the page that
renders the image so you can do a lot
more than just make greeting cards and
things like that you can have fun with
applications like this you can also have
applications that will randomly generate
some content so the user doesn't have to
type anything in that you just put their
name and then you can have in your
program a an array of data that would
randomly select an element out of it
each time the user uses the application
so there's tons of different things you
can do I'm going to give you all of the
code from both of the files that way you
can just reverse engineer and dig
through everything so you're going to
get card create and card dot PHP card
create dot PHP is the document that has
the form on it that also renders the
canvas preview so this document has the
form you can see right there has the
preview button and it also has the
canvas that the preview image will be
rendered into and this canvas the image
that gets rendered there is also the
exact image that's going to be saved
onto the server the image gets rendered
from the canvas and we're using code
from mr. Shawn Lloyd's video right here
this little bit of code is from mr.
Shawn Lloyd's video I just changed PNG
to JPEG but you can render it as PNG if
you like no problem and what this code
does is it saves the raw post data from
the canvas to an image file on the
server so it basically converts the
canvas to an image ok so you'll see that
there's a couple of JavaScript functions
here here's the function preview that
renders everything into the canvas and
here's function render
which actually sends an AJAX request
that fires off this code up here that
saves the canvas as an image and then it
navigates them to car dot php' with the
ID get variable ID that shows the proper
image then in card dot PHP what you have
is in the top portion you're checking to
see if the ID is set in the get
variables if it is we're going to gather
it up and make sure we filter it that
way we can use it on the page to echo
the image that we need to echo now this
document is basically just for showing
the image so under the image you might
want to put right here you might want to
put Facebook share buttons Twitter share
buttons and Google share buttons
whatever that way the user after they
make whatever image they were creating
once the image is shown to them they can
easily share it or you can give them
instructions on how to download the
image that was rendered dynamically by
your program you see I just used the
time function and the MT Rand function
with the string of card in between those
two strings of data that would be
rendered so it's always going to be a
random ID and unique in the system it'll
be a unique random ID or file name and
all you have to do is click the link in
the video description and you'll be able
to get all the code so you can
experiment on your own server this has
to be run on a PHP enabled server you
have to make sure that you have a
directory called card images you have to
have a folder called card images on your
server because that's where the file is
going to be saved from the canvas
rendering so have a folder ready called
card images or whatever you want to call
that folder but both files are going to
reference the image from that folder as
you see here
and here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
