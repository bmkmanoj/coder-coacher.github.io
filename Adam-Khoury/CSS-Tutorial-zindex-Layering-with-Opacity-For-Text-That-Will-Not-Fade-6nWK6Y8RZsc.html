YouTube people now this is what happened
yesterday I put out a video called how
to render transparent website elements
CSS opacity tutorial three or four
people commented in and said I would
like for the text to be not faded but
still be in that box that is faded but
any images or text that I put in that
box I don't want it to fade out with the
box and I clearly stated at the end of
this video that using the CSS opacity
setting that anything that is inside of
the element is also going to fade along
with the element so people were looking
for a solution to not have the text and
images fade that are inside of that
element people were responding back to
those people looking for a solution
saying use background RGB a on the
element 1 so they were saying instead of
using these opacity settings just use
background RGB a settings which allows
you to adjust adjust the Alpha but it
doesn't work in Internet Explorer 8
which has a large share of the market
still so you don't want to apply
something you don't want to remove
basically you don't want to remove what
I took my time to shows you it works in
IE 8 works in opera Firefox Chrome all
the browsers that matter anyway
it works in all of those the same so you
don't want to take that and replace it
with something that works in all
browsers but like the most popular one
in the world that's just crazy so that's
why my hand is forced to make this video
I'm going to show you now a z-index
approach to layering what z-index does
it allows you to layer one element on
top of the other if you want so all we
have to do is we keep this div element a
nice black little background let's look
at it visually we'll keep this div
element a nice black background that's
faded so we can see our cool colors
behind in the big main background of the
page but what we'll do is take the
content out we'll put that in a
different div and layer it and put it
right on top of this div so it looks
like it's right
inside of the box and all we have to do
is make sure we set a height for this
background faded div that will match
your content and I'll show you that
don't worry about it it's so simple
anybody says that this is difficult to
crazy and this is going to work in
Internet Explorer 8 Firefox are crawling
the Opera I'm going to show you right
now
all right this is the same exact page
and script that was in the last video
where we were showing how to add these
three lines to make opacity work in all
the major browsers of today I'm going to
take this file I'm going to do a couple
of tweaks to it right in front of your
face just so you can see I'll simply do
it right you can worry about it okay
down in the HTML remember we had div ID
element 1 I'm going to press ctrl C on
that go down one line control V I'm
going to call this instead of element 1
content 1 I'm going to remove all
content from element 1 and just put that
tag all on its own line where it opens
and closes all by itself there on line
34 you see okay now I have div ID
content 1 underneath
element 1 that means element 1 is going
to be our background it's not going to
have any text or anything in it so we're
going to have to assign a height for it
but that's no biggie that's very easy to
do you just assign a height that's going
to match your content but whatever
height you want now we put any content
that we like right here so here I'll
just put a couple of go into the design
mode and Dreamweaver here let's put a
couple of paragraphs just hitting Enter
and pasting the same text in okay now
and don't worry about what it looks like
in the design view right now you have to
put some CSS for this content one this
new content container this is the one
that's going to hold your pictures your
text and all that stuff that you don't
want to fade but you want it to be in a
faded box that has a faded background
okay now let's grab this element one CSS
because it's going to be very similar
actually I'm going to take this code I'm
going to put it right under the body tag
that way that's a little bit separated
up top of the normal stuff and now we
have our unique element 1 and now we
have
I just copied and pasted that right
under itself and here's content one now
let's apply some positioning and z-index
but what we're going to do is make sure
that in content 1 we remove the opacity
settings because we don't want those
things to become faded padding switch
out for margin just to make things
easier that way it has margin all the
way around on all four sides top left
right and bottom 24 pixels content one
it's going to be laying right on top of
element one so since the elements are
going to be centered we want to make
sure this one has text align of left we
want to make sure the width is a little
bit smaller so it's not crouched up
against the very edge or borders of your
background your element one background
so let's make that something like 8 40
so it rests inside it a little bit nice
and comfy the color of the text inside
is going to be white that's good
now let's just add the positioning I'm
going to add the position property and
make that relative so it's going to have
relative positioning inside of the
centering tag along with this element
one which will also have relative
positioning I'm adding that to element 1
you see an element 1 I'm going to give
z-index of which is layering I'm going
to give this a z-index of 1 so it's on
the bottom I'm going to give content 1
the z-index of 2 so it rests above the
layer which is element 1 now inside of
element 1 you don't need any text to be
white if you can remove that text a line
you don't need that either I don't think
the background color the border we want
this one doesn't need a background color
or a border content 1 is where our text
and our images are going to be on its
own layer so we don't need for our
background since our element 1 is
serving as our faded background it has a
border
a background-color and let's see padding
we want to remove the padding there I
think that's pretty good now all we need
is along with the width they height
attribute or property oh we need it
along with the width is to add height
now to element 1 which is our background
and I'm going to make mine
oh no 240 240 pixels and I think we're
good to go
actually I have a lot of paragraphs
there see so that wasn't so hard
basically all I did was rearrange things
let's see content here I don't need text
the line twice and make sure everything
is cout margin text the line colors
white with all we have to give this a
top value so it comes up if we look at
it right now let's look at it in Chrome
real quick but all browsers right now
you'll see that this content div is
underneath that one all we have to do is
set the top property so z-index and then
top let's put that a bit the minus 240 I
guess to match this height of the box so
top colon minus 240 pixels let's see
what that gives us press f12 if you're
in Dreamweaver need to render right out
and there you go the only reason that
took so long is because I explained
every step - and guess what it works in
all major browsers all right now let's
test it in all the browsers ok so now we
have a dated background with content on
top that is not faded at all in Google
Chrome
here's Internet Explorer all I have to
do is press refresh here you can see it
looks good and Internet Explorer let's
go
had squished this up let's do a scroll
just to make sure everything's cool when
people scroll resize the window it's all
great that's Internet Explorer 8 so
Chrome Internet Explorer 8 looking great
Firefox refresh bada bing bada boom
opera refresh bada boom bada bing so
there's a good solution for you and now
if you didn't have any experience using
z-index properties now you do so you can
see all I did was simply take element 1
and remove the content from it give it a
height and give it a Z index of 1 that
means it's going to be a layer 1 then I
took a new give layer and put it right
on top Z index with to give it a top
property of - whatever the height of
this box is here and it falls right into
place there so very easy so I hope that
helps clear it up and we can stop saying
crazy things about using RGB a settings
until you know until everybody stops
using Internet Explorer 8 at least or
maybe somebody has you know scripted
workarounds for using RGB a in Internet
Explorer 8 but I don't feel like full
and windy hacks
I'd rather just apply layering it's very
easy to use the index so there you go
