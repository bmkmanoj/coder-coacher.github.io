much so much that it hurts I heard
anyway in this JavaScript programming
lesson you can learn real-time filtering
of text input you'll be learning how to
program real-time strict text fields
that will strip or replace unwanted
characters from the field as the user
types in okay let's start with a blank
HTML file what I'm going to do is open
up the script element so I'll have the
script type text/javascript and then I'm
going to make sure that I put the
closing tag for that element now I'm
going to put a text area let's put a
text area and let's give it an ID of
something simple like ta stands for text
area and if you're going to process this
normally in a normal form type scenario
with PHP is the processor and you're
going to submit the form in a normal
sort of way you might want to put the
name attribute as well for ta that way
you can scoop up that posted variable of
ta but we're going to use the ID to
communicate to this text area using
JavaScript the name is only put in place
if you're going to happen to be posting
this in a normal traditional sort of way
so I'll put the closing symbol and then
I'll close off the text area there you
can see we have a space where you can
put in default values now I want some
event handling on my text area I want on
key up and on key down because those are
the two mechanisms that I want to listen
for so when the user hits a key and it
comes up or when they hit the key down
even if they don't let it go right when
they hit it down we're going to be using
those two so we have on key up and let's
put in on key down get it ready to go
and I don't like those being capital
they'll work lowercase or capital but I
like them to be lowercase so those are
your two event handlers that you want so
when the user keys down and keys up so
it's really a constant thing as they're
typing and the constant thing that we
want is a JavaScript function to fire
off and that JavaScript function is
going to be simply called clean open
closed parenthesis now within the
parentheses where we'll put the argument
the argument is going to be the ID for
the text area so this text area has ID
of ta we just pass that
there is a function called clean now
let's take that and also put the same
exact thing within the on key down event
now we simply go up into the JavaScript
then we type in function clean open
closed parentheses put the open curly
brace and go down a couple of lines put
a closing curly brace and then you'll
have your nice function nest all set up
and ready to go now we know we have to
in take one parameter which is the ID of
whichever text area or text field on the
page that you want to clean I did it
this way so you guys can make it more
dynamic so all you have to do so the
argument is put e that will represent
that element or the ID name of that
element that way we can access its value
within this function called clean now in
the first line of our function we're
going to get the new variable setup and
we're going to call it text field
because that's going to represent the
text area or whichever text field you're
dynamically sending through this clean
function text field is equal to document
dot get element by ID and the ID that we
want is e so now we have our text field
accessed and ready to go
so if we go to develop PHP and the
JavaScript programming library there's
and I'm working on it right now won't be
done until around the middle of the
summer and then I'm going to start on my
PHP library to really enhance things in
the PHP library and spend quite a bit of
time enhancing the PHP library here but
anyways in the JavaScript library you'll
see the Reg X object and that's the one
we want to take a quick look at now
regular expression allows us to set up
patterns that we can match replace
search and split with we can evaluate
our strings against regular expression
objects to change things up search
evaluate if something's in a string or
even replace things so we're going to
use the replace mechanism which is a
string method it's a string object
method you just come to this page and
read all about it here and you can also
see the different all the different
symbols that you can put within your
patterns special characters there's also
the flags that you can use but I want
this replace line so I'm just going to
grab that I'm going to put that in my
file here in the JavaScript ok so now I
have a regular expression
object which is set up to replace you
can see I'm using the string replace
method the text field that value is what
we want to get so we have to change this
let's just say right here text field
value is equal to text field dot value
dot replace whatever you want to replace
it with in this case we're going to
replace it with nothing we want to strip
it and I'm going to show you guys ways
to change this programming to do
different things but I just want to get
the base set up so you can expand upon
it yourself so in the regular expression
object you can see from the example it's
going to globally replace the word cog
within my text so if I was to run this
right now
here let me remove this default data in
the text area we don't need that I run
this right now and say I'm typing along
and I sell cogs see right when I typed
in the word cog it disappeared you cog
see it just goes away that's what we
want now that's stupid just to replace
the word cog but let's say you wanted to
replace the word that word right there
maybe make something nicer out of it
like filter it to say fudge instead so
you can say globally replace F uck with
the word fudge you can actually put I
here to make it non case-sensitive so if
the user types in capital F uck or
variation thereof it'll still catch it
and switch it so let's test this now I
want to say I want to fudge so it's
instant real-time text filtering and in
your PHP you also have these filters in
place that are going to if in case the
person is a hacker and they bypass your
forms or whatever your PHP is still
going to do this same kind of filtering
I just wanted to show you guys how to do
it in real time
on the JavaScript end for all your
normal users so they'll know right away
where they can type in whether they can
curse or not or whether you will let
them type in special characters into the
field or not now that's what I'm going
to do right now let's go back to the
develop PHP and let's go to these
special characters what I'm going to do
is grab this one here that match what is
not in the character set and this is the
syntax for it so I'll grab the syntax
bar right there and I'll put that to
replace my regular expression pattern
now this little symbol here means we
want to replace everything that is not
these characters so I want to replace
everything that's not a through Z with
nothing now let's run it in a browser
let's start typing in and by typing
letters that's all good
it won't even let me type in a space see
it retracts the space if I type in a
number it won't let me type it in by
typing a character special characters
they don't stay and that's what we want
now let's expand upon this a little bit
maybe we want to let them actually the
way it is now with the I in place they
should be able to put in capitals yeah
capitals stay so we put the I to make
this non case-sensitive replace then
let's put a space to allow them to type
in spaces now let's allow numbers all of
the numbers 0 through 9 let's see if we
can type those in now no problem now
what if I want to allow a question mark
an exclamation
maybe comma and a period that's normal
punctuation that would be in normal
sentences so now this way you have a
mechanism to really you're not letting
them place in any special characters so
if I type in an exclamation mark it'll
stay if I type in a question mark it
will stay a comma period etc 0 through 9
space letters but if I was to type in a
dollar sign it's not going to stay or
any of those special characters up top
code brackets see those code brackets
they're not staying slashes forward
slash and backslash you have to specify
what characters you want to let in now
you can go to the page that we were at
develop PHP here the regex project page
and you know just take a look at all of
these special characters that you can
apply they'll give you a whole lot of
different logic to your patterns now
this is it in its most raw basic form
now what you might
want to do here is put a note in okay
this note says search the string first
to see if unwanted chars are there
before you replace them so before you
run this replace method on the text
field value you might want to set up the
search method just to make sure that the
things are actually there before you run
the replace method on it and what that
allows us to do is let's put this in
place right now let's just put it in a
div let's give it an ID that's equal to
status and that's going to tell us
things through the JavaScript and we're
going to make JavaScript use that to
tell us things by saying document dot
get element by ID status in an HTML we
can say whatever we want on the screen
as things are happening so I'm back at
develop PHP I'm going to go to the
string object now JavaScript and there's
the search method that's the one I want
to snatch the little example for right
there and we already have our regular
expression so I just want the if and
else condition statement that has the
search already in place and I'm going to
put that right here first thing in my
script move these down a couple of lines
and pop it in right there now let's get
all this into place indented properly
there now we'll leave the replace line
there and take the two on top of it that
we had originally and we'll make sure
those are on top of everything that way
we have the variable for the text field
and the variable for the regular
expression object because that's going
to be used within the search so let's
just make sure that has the same name
regex right there and text field that
value is what we need to be searching
through so let's grab that and put it
right here instead of string we're going
to put text field that value dot search
for the regular expression pattern and
we'll just type in match and then no
match and instead of just writing that
to the page we're going to write it to
this status so what we'll do is say see
we don't need those parentheses and
we'll just say document
dot get element by ID status close
parentheses enter HTML is equal to no
match found
so we'll make it say that into the into
that div on the page it would say right
there remove these parentheses we don't
need those so if the text field value if
the search finds a match for these
unwanted characters it's going to tell
us in that div and it's also going to
replace it using this line right here
see if that works right so if I type in
regular stuff it says no match found but
if I type in funny character C it says
for a second match was found so we no
match was bounded by put in funny
characters and no match found if we put
in regular stuff that we accept I put in
funny character match was found now you
can make the application make a little
bit more sense by taking this line here
that is the replace method line and
putting that within the if condition
statement for if their search actually
finds an unwanted character and then you
can just remove this else because you
don't really have to say anything or do
anything and really this status doesn't
need to be at play you can just comment
that out I was just putting that there
for your sake or the programmers
referencing so if I type in normal
things that's good if I type in unwanted
character it says match was found all
right that's nice
you could say something like we remove
unwanted now that'll make sense to him
if it says we remove unwanted chars
automatically or you can give them a
little list and tell them exactly what
you do except we only accept things in
those parameters so if they type in a
funny character it removes it from the
field and says we only accept those
characters and if you want make it even
smarter just remove that altogether then
the user is going to know they're going
to know they can't type in certain
things once they get to those and they
try to type them in see they can put a
question mark exclamation comma period
numbers all that good stuff and whatever
else you specify but whatever you don't
specify they can
I'll type that in and it gets tricked
okay so there's a good basic script
that will get you going and you can
research more about your regular
expression objects in JavaScript and
your string object and that way you'll
have a good bit of knowledge on what you
can set up with your regular expressions
using patterns things like that to set
up really complex logic that you might
want for your string searching replacing
matching and splitting and like I said
when it goes to PHP for parsing you
still want to have all filtering in
place just because you know some people
might bypass your form if they're a
rascal am I trying hacky or whatever
don't let them be a rascal
you know filter it on both ends if you
don't want to filter it in JavaScript
the only reason why I showed it filter
it in JavaScript because it gives you
user instant clear knowledge of what
they can type in or not you don't have
to put any notes on the page you don't
have to have a little question mark
bubble pop up and say oh we only accept
these characters just strip them okay so
I hope you've enjoyed this lesson on
JavaScript real-time text input
filtering this will work on your single
line text fields your text input fields
and your text areas and anything that
any that people are typing in where
there's text involved and you can gather
and access that string you're able to
manipulate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
