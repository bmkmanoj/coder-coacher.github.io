web community using PHP MySQL and flash
created by flash building and brought to
you by develop PHP calm and in number
nine we created our edit profile page we
finished the functionality of the the
header profile or the edit profile
button and our header and now we're
setting up our we left off in the last
part we were setting up the forms it's
going to be the first form for the user
to edit the profile which is going to be
the profile picture so let's see how can
we do this yeah let's just add a form to
this whole table so let's go to code
right here we're going to type in form
action edit underscore profile dot PHP
or you can use the server self variables
that are native in PHP either method
work just fine and the insight type
multi-part form data the method is post
and did to do
I think that's good
let's give it a name of
pick form pick one form
now that's all we need
yep yep it doesn't really necessarily
need an ID but you can give it an ID pic
form
and we're not going to use any of the
other options for this form
for this example let's close off that
tag
and now let's just go down a few lines
here with the table nest I put a couple
of lines right here so we can see what's
going on and separate that table a
little more remember this table is going
to be for uploading the picture and
let's go here let's go down to the way
the table you have to nest everything
correctly so when the table opens the
table tag opens you put in the form
starting tag so when the table is going
to close you got to put in the tape the
form closing tag before the table closes
to keep everything nested correctly okay
so all we need is a submit button right
here so insert form
button okay go into the source code
that's fine okay so let's put in our
file upload field just doesn't need a
label and get rid of that label tag and
right here actually let's separate this
one more time let's go over here put the
cursor there go to split into two
columns so you split in that column into
two columns that way this one can be for
the image they'll see their image before
they change it or upload it and we're
going to make it 100 wide not to baking
okay so here we're going to add the sort
of insert form the file field
and just press ok it'll give a default
values you go into the code view and you
look we don't want that label tag and
put type this file the name is file
field that's fine
I might change the name of that so now
what we're going to do is so this pretty
much shows you now I'm going to have
this whole source file for download so
you guys don't have to question through
the video what I'm doing here you can
actually go and get the files and
download and look at it so I'm not going
to take the video time up to make all
these silly little forms when everybody
knows how to make HTML forms if you
don't know how to make an HTML form you
shouldn't be taking this tutorial yet
this tutorial series that's really basic
stuff you should have learned a long
time ago before you start something like
this so this is a basically simple HTML
forms sitting inside of a table nested
inside of a table and should we just put
the fields that we want the components
for the form that we want and print out
the user data into those fields it's
that simple then when the user wants to
submit they browse for the picture they
find it on the computer they put it here
they submit and it uploads so now all we
need is an upload script it's going to
be up here in the PHP section of this
file so what I'm going to do is put in
all the little tables and forms for all
the little data that I want to gather
and change for the user to allow the
user to edit about their profile and
when I get done with that I'll pop the
video I'll unpause the video and we'll
talk about what's in it just briefly
because it's just going to be simple
HTML forms but what's going to be the
part that's a little more complex is the
PHP parsing of all those forms and it's
all going to be on this one same page
all the parsing mechanisms that sync
data into the database when they want to
edit it it's all going to be on the same
page and I'm going to explain that very
thoroughly and that's going to be in the
upper section okay so before I script
out the parsing mechanism for the
parsing mechanisms for all these little
forms here
I just want to show you what I wound up
with this is what we're going to have
for our base system in the edit profile
page and I stuck the account settings
page here or linked to the account
settings page this way they can edit
their account settings do such things as
or do things such as change their
password delete their account or
deactivate it whichever we choose to
have them do and maybe a couple of other
options in there and but this page is
going to be mostly for setting up the
profile display and then the page we
create for their account settings will
be a different page and that'll be in a
later on lesson part of the free package
and so yeah what we have is the first
line is going to put their picture right
there it's only going to be 100 wide and
then 100 pixels wide and and so well
first thing up top is we put a sentence
in and it said 'it your profile data
here and it would say Adam put the first
name then we have the Edit table for the
person's picture the Edit table in form
for the person's first name middle name
last name actually I think I'm going to
remove middle name
I do not need that just do first name
last name and I'm going to remove it
from the database as well I'm going to
do a couple of modifications to the
database yeah in a tutorial maybe the
next one or maybe the one after that
just to show you how to do modifications
as you're planning and building you
might need changes to that main database
table so i'll show you how to do that
through script it's very easy ok so the
next table is set up for the members
location so they can edit their country
state City and zip code the next one is
set up for the members website next one
is set up for the members youtube
channel this one is set up for the
members bio or there about it about
section and each a little form has a
table with a form tag nested inside so
if we look at the code well first let's
look at the design again you see I have
horizontal lines here well actually
let's look at it on the web because I
already ftp dit i logged in and here i
am in firefox i'm going to go to edit
profile and i put up the new header
already also so if you guys are members
of the site you would you would see this
now actually the whole source package
would be updated so you can get to the
source files too but here is the deform
this is how it looks in firefox i just
wanted to make sure i'm looking at it in
all browsers as I build so that way and
here it is in internet explorer that way
we can see if there's any design
problems or rendering problems so it
looks good an Internet Explorer
it's bringing in all my data and same in
Firefox we have know about us data
because we we don't put that in in the
registration form the place that's
edited is right here so and then here
they would just upload a picture and
we're just going to have for the base
tutorial I'm just going to have one
we're going to do like YouTube and just
have one profile picture and that is all
no picture albums I think there's a lot
of sites out there to let you have
picture albums already and it's it's
social networks really aren't doing that
sort of thing anymore that's what
myspace is therefore and Facebook and
all those other sites where you can go
and make picture albums but if you
wanted to code that into your project
it's not very difficult but for this
base tutorial we're just going to stick
with one profile picture and it's going
to display on their profile when you
view the profile it's going to display a
lot bigger than YouTube's 250 bite
whatever height the person's things you
can put a big banner in there if they
like because all the information display
information for the member is going to
be off to the left and then other things
down here so or maybe we would limit the
height we'll get to that we'll cross
that bridge when we come to it so the
edit profile page looks good we have no
parsing script it but that's okay and
now let's see
so now we're ready to build our parsing
mechanisms mechanisms what I wanted to
show you is the horizontal lines here in
between each section and if you look in
the code code view you'll see in between
each form and table for each form
there's a horizontal line tagged with a
width of 680 and it's Center aligned and
that's pretty much that but everything
in the form is pretty basic form
components that you would have in any
other regular form and similar to the
registration form some of these fields
very similar to the registration form
fields like the country drop-down I took
straight out of the registration dot PHP
page here for their country drop down
when you register and the form upload
we're going to set a 50 kilobyte max for
that image can be no bigger than 50
kilobyte and so what I'm going to do so
this video doesn't run too long is just
in part 11 which will be the next part
we're going to build all these parsing
mechanisms in the script up top so this
one file will take care of showing the
user their form and when they press
submit the same edit that boat or edit
underscore profile that PHP will parse
that information into the database and
then if all things go right right when
the page is reloaded after the parsing
it will show the new updated data okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
