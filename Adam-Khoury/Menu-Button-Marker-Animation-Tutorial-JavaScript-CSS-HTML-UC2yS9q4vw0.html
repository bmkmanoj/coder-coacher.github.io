home or office today perhaps someday
you'll feel comfortable enough to invite
me into your bedroom where the real
magic happens now due to the popularity
of Ajax and dynamic data loading into
our pages we can add some pretty cool
effects to menu systems that call data
into our pages dynamically before we get
into the exercise let's look at a demo
of what we will be making and we'll also
look at an example of it placed into an
automated homepage slideshow program
that way you can get a good feel about
what kind of situations you could apply
this to first let's take a look at the
finished product of what you're going to
be making in this tutorial so what
happens is the menu marker is on button
1 by default or on the default button
but when the user clicks another button
the little menu marker animates its
width and it's left position so it's
left position matches whatever button
it's about to roll over so you can see
the width of this button is much wider
than the width of this button you can
see how the menu marker adjusts its
width to match the button and it also
slides along in a nice animated fashion
really letting the user know which
section they're viewing and here it is
working in a homepage slideshow program
now watch the button marker so you can
see as it automatically changes sections
through the slideshow the button marker
follows in an animated fashion and I
think it's a really cool way to visually
show the user what section they're
reading or viewing so we're going to
begin with this code and you can see
it's an application that loads dynamic
data into a little box according to
which button is pressed but there's no
animated menu marker system yet and
that's going to be the real focus of the
lesson so that's why I have all of this
stuff in place already so what happens
is every time one of these buttons is
clicked the load content function fires
off in JavaScript this is a
representation of the button that's
being clicked so when load content runs
here we have access
to the button element and then all I'm
doing is going into the my content div
down here and changing it dynamically
according to the button now what you can
do is instead of this static example I
have you can load Ajax data right here
you run an ajax request if you want to
get dynamic data from the server and
bring it into the box or you can have an
array of data directly in your
javascript and then each button can show
a certain portion of that array and you
can pack all kind of HTML and text into
arrays okay so it's a very simple
beginning now we'll apply the animated
button marker to the application so in
the div with ID my menu here that houses
all of the little buttons right above
all the little buttons we're going to
add a new div with ID of button marker
and if you render this right now you
won't even see that div now let's go up
into the CSS and we're going to add a
style rule for the button marker div
we're going to make sure its position is
absolute this way it can be animated
around the page without affecting the
position of other elements on the page
we're going to make its border black one
pixel solid and then we're going to set
the border bottom to none and that gives
you the effect of having a long line
with two short lines coming down off of
the end of the long line so basically
it's just a rectangle without a bottom
border now initially by default the
width is going to be zero because
javascript is going to be setting the
width the height is going to be a static
10 pixels the top position is set to 67
and that's what pushes it down to where
it needs to live on the page from the
top of the page and it's display by
default is set to none because
javascript is going to make it render
javascript will set its display to block
when needed now the next thing we do is
set the transition property that way
anytime the left position or the width
is changed by JavaScript for this button
marker it's going to happen in an
animated fashion it won't be just an
instant change in those values it's
going to be animated over a period of
time which is half a second in our case
so basically our transition is just set
up to animate the width property and the
left property whenever they're adjusted
in JavaScript and I'm just using the
WebKit prefix for now to make sure it
works in chrome and all the other
webkit-based browsers but this line is
the standardized syntax and that's all
we'll need in the future now we already
have in place the window dot add event
listener in JavaScript for the load
event of the page and when that happens
we're going to run a function called
init menu which is short for initialize
the menu so I'm going to right here and
pop that function into place function
init menu now this function runs only
once when the page is loaded because the
window.addeventlistener 'load event is
calling that function to run and it only
happens when the page is first loaded
we're going to initialize the menu
really we're initializing the button
marker system for the menu you can see
in that function we're targeting the
button marker div on the page which is
this little guy right here we're setting
his style dot left equal to the button
one offset left position that way it's
over button one by default when the page
loads and we're also going to set its
width to match the first button when the
page loads and you see I'm putting
offset with minus two to account for any
border that's on the little button
marker because the button marker is
basically just a border for our
rectangle then it's going to be two
pixels wider than your buttons so you
can just put minus two to make sure it
exactly matches the width of your
buttons then finally we make the button
marker display:block so it shows on the
page now remember that init menu
function only runs once when the page
first loads that's just to make sure
everything is positioned correctly now
what we're going to do is very very
simple here we're going to go into the
load content function because that's the
function that fires off every time any
button is clicked and right above where
we're going to be dynamically adding
data to that little blue box according
to which button is
we're going to run these two simple
lines we're going to target the button
marker div again we're going to adjust
its left position and its width just
like we did here but this time we're
doing it more dynamically by targeting
the button dynamically so it could be
any one of these four buttons so all we
have to do here is put the button object
reference so that way the little marker
can dynamically move between buttons and
that's everything let's take a look at
it so you can see the marker is all over
button one by default when I click
button three it moves over to that
button in animated fashion and its width
animates and its left position animates
okay that's how it works very simple if
