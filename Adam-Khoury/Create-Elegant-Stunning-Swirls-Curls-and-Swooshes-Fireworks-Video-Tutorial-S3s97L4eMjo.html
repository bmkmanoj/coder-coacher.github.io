to you by flash building will be showing
you how to create beautiful and stunning
custom swirls and curls and it's pretty
easy to do when fireworks and I'm going
to go to create new let's make the
document 800 x 500 white background is
good okay so now in fireworks you have a
tool set here and if you hold down on
the shape tools you can grab the spiral
just drag it out onto the canvas and
then you can adjust how many spirals it
has say you can make it have one little
spiral around and or many many many
spirals going around but what I'm going
to show you is how people make those
nice elegant spirals and what's funny is
they usually go into Photoshop or
illustrator and do a whole bunch of
crazy crap but here's an easy way to do
it in fireworks okay so let's say we
have our swirl and let's give it a
couple more spirals say we want it like
that make it a little bit larger
make it soft line up one now we take
that risk control see once it's
highlighted press ctrl-v and it will
paste a copy of it on top of itself now
the trick here is to take the the
transform registration point once you go
to the the skew tool what you want to do
is well you don't want to go to the skew
tool you want to go to the scale tool
first and then what you want to do is
grab that registration dot here in the
center I'm going to zoom in a little so
i can get it very accurate i'm going to
take the center transform dot and i'm
going to put it on the spiral tip right
with the the dot is for the spiral or as
close to it as I can get
see if i zoom in a little more
that's close enough okay so once you
have that then you can just skew it so
you see what happens creates a nice
elegant curl that's tapered it's very
easy to do and now all you have to do
now you have two girls here or two
swirls now you take the pen tool see I
don't think you even have to have either
one highlighted take the pen tool on the
edge click down on the edge here and
then click down on the edge here then
you can go to your fill BAM there it is
beautiful curls swirl everybody is
looking to make these swirly curly
effects nowadays I'm going to press
ctrl-c ctrl-v go up to modify transform
flip it horizontally and there you can
see you have a nice little twin for it
so if you wanted something like that and
then you say you wanted to combine those
paths you can say modify combine paths
Union and now it's one it's one shape
and you see these effects a lot in Adobe
After Effects and an Adobe Flash and I
use them every now and then in flash but
I just wanted to show you how you can
easily make elegant swirls and curls
using Fireworks now you don't have to
you know open your your Photoshop or
your illustrator to be a professional
graphic artist on the web I have a huge
portfolio of websites I've created for
clients and every bit of it is in
fireworks that I've created the graphics
for every bit of those sites every one
of those sites have created the graphics
for in fireworks i I really don't know
photoshop or illustrator that well but
I'm really good in fireworks so that
just you know it just shows you
you can achieve many things and you can
also use the pen tool to create any
custom wavy shape and design you want so
say I click that let's go to right about
here you drag it around and you drag
that around connect it up say you want
to do the Nike swoosh just go from there
to there drag it click down here on that
dot to make a sharp edge click here drag
it around boom nike swoosh it's that
easy so you can do elegant nice any kind
of wavy effects and lines connect all
these shapes into one and bring them
into After Effects to do some really
cool things and really blow the minds of
you your visitors or your the people
you're entertaining a video ok we'll see
you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
