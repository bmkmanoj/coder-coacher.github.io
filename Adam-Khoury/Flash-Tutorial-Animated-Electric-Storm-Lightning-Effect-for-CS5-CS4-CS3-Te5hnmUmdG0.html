finished product of which you'll be
learning how to create in the following
flash tutorial which is suitable for
flash cs3 cs4 cs5 and any ActionScript
version you work in custom animated
Lightning effects alright let's rock and
roll
first thing we'll need to do is create a
new flash file ActionScript version does
not matter I'm gonna change the stage
background to black layer one I'm going
to rename picture that's where I'm gonna
put the picture I want to use and I'm
gonna get my picture from fireworks I
already have it open ctrl C which is
copy and then in flash ctrl V which is
paste it's going to paste this image as
a movie clip on the current frame if you
happen to not be in fireworks and you're
not copy and pasting your picture
straight over you can go to file import
to stage any picture that you want see
you can just browse your folders on your
picture layer you just put that into
place wherever you want it now what
we're going to create a new layer above
that and we're gonna rename this one
lightning now we're gonna grab the
pencil tool making sure that it's set to
white and let's give our stroke maybe
let's make it about two I'm just gonna
come down off the top with a jaggedy
kind of line and then I'm gonna change
the stroke to 0.1 0.1 and I'm gonna
start putting little jaggedy branches
coming off of this little lightning bolt
with lightning it likes to branch off
kind of Forks off of the main bolt and
that's what you what kind of effect you
want to give it just make sure you get
in your lines nice and jaggedy really
you don't need a whole lot you don't
want to go crazy with the effect and
that's good for my needs now I'm going
to highlight all of that make sure I
lock the picture layer so I don't select
him as well
highlight all of those little markings I
just made with the pencil tool make sure
they're all highlighted and dotted
converts a symbol make that a movie clip
it doesn't matter what you name it in
your library press okay now we're gonna
go and give it an effect filter effect
go ahead down here add new glow make it
white strength about I don't know 300
something blur about 14 or 15 and medium
and there you go there's your lightning
strike now what we're gonna do is mask
it and animate it now now we have a
lightening layer and our picture layer
let's go ahead and lock the lightening
layer so we don't accidentally put
anything on that layer past this point
now let's create one more layer this is
going to be the mask so let's just name
it mask now the lightening in the
picture let's go ahead out to frame 80
you can see my frames per second is set
to 30 frames per second for this file so
that's my animation speed how fast my
timeline will travel so I'm going to
extend the lightening and the picture
layers out to frame 80 by pressing f5
while it frame 80 is highlighted that
will effectively extend those frames so
that imagery lives throughout all those
frames when the file runs now on the
mask layer we're gonna grab the brush
tool you can see mine is set to a
magenta color and I have my brush size
is set to the biggest so I'm just gonna
go in and paint where I want the first
frame of the lightening to show which is
right about there that should be good
there's one now I'm gonna go on frame to
highlight it press f6 to create a new
keyframe I'm going to continue painting
to reveal more of the lightning bolt
and then the last one frame three f6
again and let's get the remainder of the
lightning bolt under the mask alrighty
that looks good to me so you can see how
that's going to come down and reveal
that bolt in an animated sort of way now
I'm going to go to frame five now let's
go out on the lightning layer let's
unlock that lets press f6 on this frame
to create a new keyframe then let's go
to frame 6 f6 frame seven f6 frame eight
f6 and frame nine f6 so right here we
want it to disappear the lightning so
we're going to press control X on this
frame which is seven
press control X and on the last frame
which is nine press control X now all we
have to do is unlock the picture layer
and be sure that grab the arrow tool the
selection tool highlight him the picture
and let's make some key frames here now
f6 f6 and all the long through here we
want to put keyframes as well that
correspond to the lightening layers
keyframes alright so in the first one we
can see that we don't want him fully
bright so we want to go to color effect
style brightness and you can see mine is
set to negative eighty three and that's
about what I want when he's in the
darkness but you can see on frame 1 we
have Lightning coming into view so we'll
make it a little bit brighter maybe
negative 70 the next one we have more
lightning showing so we're gonna
highlight him give him brightness of
negative I don't know 40 something and
the next one all of the lightening would
be in view
so let's brighten him up to make him
normal view of zero so he'll be at his
default brightness
then on this frame where the lightning
would be gone you want to make him dark
again so you can go to the brightness so
basically you're just wanting to make
his brightness correspond to the
lightning so let's bring this back to
them 280 this one
lightnings gone so let's get that down
to 80 as well and this one the
lightnings gone so let's get that one
down brightness to about 80 now
right-click the mask layer and select
mask now press control enter and run
your file and that's what you have
zombie standing in the dark and a
lightning strike brightening him up
and you could run your timeline marker
to see exactly what's happening let's
get down into 24 frames per second
press control enter
and there you have a folks custom
Lightning effect that will brighten an
image that's behind it when the
lightning strikes hope you've enjoyed
that one and we'll see you next lesson
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
