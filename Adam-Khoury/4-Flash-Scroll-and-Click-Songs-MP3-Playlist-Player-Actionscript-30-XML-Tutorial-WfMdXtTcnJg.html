so as you can see this part of the
lesson ads going to the next song
automatically and if it happens to be
the last song in the list it'll shoot to
the first song automatically and adding
stop button to make the sound stopped
altogether
hello everybody out of my flash building
here we're continuing our actionscript 3
mp3 XML playlist player here in part 4
and this player is totally awesome and
I'm made up of nothing but sound
vibrations and very in touch with sound
and that's how I know of so much about
some programming and actionscript 3
humans because the the universe I'm from
okay since we're staying real smart and
tackling the project in phases we have
part 1 2 and 3 going so far and they
correspond to the videos that are 1 2
and 3 on my channel and the source files
are also available at developed PHP com
so I'm going to take part 3 copy and
paste and move on to part 4 it's a good
way to work like this sometimes if
you're making complex applications that
way if at any part of the process you
make a boo-boo make a happy little
accident you can go back and delete the
current when you're working on and
revert to the last one you were working
on that was all working nice so let's
rename this pop for that's what I'm
going to the all right now you dig into
that file let's open it actually let's
just rename this rename part 4 let's
delete that because the new one is going
to be created when we press f12 to
render out all the files now we're ready
let's double-click it rock and roll but
we're going to do in this lesson is add
a stop button because I noticed that you
cannot stop the player and on the page
of developed PHP it's kind of annoying
so I got to add stop button now we're
going to understand how to add stop
button that's going to be really really
easy and we're also going to program in
when one song finishes it's going to
automatically move on to the next song
and start playing it and highlight that
cell pretty cool stuff so you want to
know this command okay first thing to do
is highlight our my whole player clip
that's on the scene 1 and double-click
inside of it there's our list component
and all the action script that powers
the application
we're going to put ActionScript on frame
3 for the stop button but first we have
to put and i renamed where it said list
here to play your stuff so this layer is
called player stuff now instead of just
list because we're going to have more
than just the list component sitting
there so on that layer let's go to
window common libraries buttons I'm
going to grab out the pre-made rounded
gray stop button I'm going to put it on
stage now once it's out on stage and
these buttons are already set up with
over out and down effects so you know
it's nice and easy to use those you can
make your own custom buttons design them
okay so that has an instance name that
we've given it up stop underscore BTN
this has an instance name of lists to
remember this has instance name stop
underscore BTN now we can communicate to
that button through code so let's
highlight frame 3 press f9 open the
actions panel and let's put in a couple
of lines here a couple of dashes slashes
rather forward slashes those lines will
be skipped at runtime so you don't have
to worry about it but it's a good visual
separator for your eyeballs okay so
let's go here and let's give ourselves a
comment say stop button listener and
we're also going to need a stop button
function that easy so let's go ahead and
grab this listener here control C
control V and let's put the correct
instance name of the item we want to
control this function so let's stop BTN
has an event listener now and it's not a
change event this is going to be a mouse
event of click so we also have to change
this to mouse event
and we're going to name it stop player
make it make good sense to us so we
don't get confused now all we need is
our little function so stop underscore
BTN has an event listener now it's a
mouse event click and what it does is
fire off a function called stop player
whenever that button is clicked now so
we need to stop player function so let's
just grab this function beginning change
the name on the function to stop player
and make sure this says mouse event so
let's copy that event is mouseevent cold
and void and let's close off the curly
brace now we have our function net set
up this is very simple we just type in
channel that stopped that's it that will
stop the player now you play your stop
buttons all done let's go ahead right
here and put some more visual separators
because under that we're going to have
more functionality for creating the next
track Play functionality when one track
gets done playing we want to make sure c
stops the player no matter what song is
on it's beautiful now uh yeah so now we
get a code in the part where when one
song is playing and it gets finished it
has to automatically change to the next
song in the list and highlight that cell
start playing that song that's what we
do now okay let's highlight frame three
click f9 open the actions panel let's go
down and skip ourselves another comment
here and we're going to call this event
listener for sound complete
when any song finishes that's good and
the function on sound complete
all right now all we need is a listener
so let's just let's just go ahead and
grab all this here that was powering the
stop button let's grab that listener pop
it in let's grab the function pop it in
we're going to change it up now the
function is going to be just event not
mouse event and this is going to be
sound complete underscore complete and
the name of the function is going to be
on sound complete hope I named it in
sound here here so on sound complete or
let's name it on complete playback I
think that's the more common used name
for that and right here function on
complete playback up let's make sure
this is just event and not mouse event
there we go now we're all set up to
where oh no the channel has to be tied
to that so channel that add event
listener event is sound complete we run
the ONS complete playback function
that's right here inside of that on
complete playback function we're going
to type in new track and what this is
doing is referring to a function that
we're going to create right here let's
call this function new track
now so every time any song gets finished
playing it's going to run this function
on come on play the bug on complete
playback and then this function called
new track is going to fire off and we're
going to set that function up right now
it's not very difficult ok so to save a
little time I'm just going to go ahead
and pop that in and here is what we have
lines 31 through 50 or just added in and
it's called function new track just like
I said we were going to call it and it's
fired off or it's executed inside of the
song complete playback function so each
time a sound gets finished on complete
playback is going to command this new
track function here to begin or to
execute so any time a sound completes
this new track function executes the
reason why I just didn't take all of
this code and stick it in the on
complete playback function is because I
might want to use this new track
function for another part of the players
functionality so I can reuse this
function I don't have to create another
one that the similar things so now let's
explain what's going on inside of the
function so here is everything that
happens inside of the new track function
and there's an if and else condition
statement you'll see here pull this back
where it belongs there's an if and else
condition and in the first part of the
if condition we were saying if the list
that selected item song number and
remember song number is claimed in each
individual cell right here see song num
song them has a value of I which is the
iterator in this XML loop so we say list
that selected items song num is equal if
the selected cell so long number is
equal to whatever the total tract amount
is for your player if you have
20 songs this I is going to be a 20 so
if the song this current song num is
equal to 20 you want to go back to song
one you don't want to go to song 21
because song 21 is not there so this
code here takes care of that now we set
up the else part of the condition
statement to account for if we do need
to go to the next song say if we're on
song if we have a list of 20 and we're
on song 12 we definitely want it to go
to song 13 to play the next in the list
and not back the song one so this
handles going back to so long one if
this certain condition is met and else
we just go ahead and go to the next song
in the list and play that one so let me
explain what's in this first part here
this one two three four five lines if
the song num is the last song in the
list we stop the channel then we claim a
variable it's a new array of select
first similar to what we did in the
first frame to make that first list
component cell highlighted by default
we're going to highlight that first list
item again because we know we're going
to be playing song one then we say list
that's selecting disease which is the
way to highlight the item automatically
select first so we just highlight song
one there that cell in the list and it's
going to be track to play is now going
to be set to equal to list component
that selected item song string which is
also defined on frame one each list item
each cell in the list each song when
clicked carries a certain amount of
information that we set into it on frame
one remember if you don't go back to
watch video one I think it was where we
covered that I talked about it very much
in depth so we can access song string so
track to play when it goes back to frame
to it's going to know track to play
which one to access so when one song
completes we switch the track to play
and then we go to and play frame to
which starts the whole player over
and when it snaps back to frame 3 with
the exact song that we want to play
which will be the first one in this case
first song in the list now if we want to
go to the next song if they were on song
3 and we wanted to go to song for and
just keep continuing on through the list
this code handles that and what happens
is we stop the channel once again and
then we claim a variable here of SN and
this is a little bit different from this
part of the code because this is the
list that selected item song num so the
song number which was the I remember the
increment for each cell so we claim a
variable for that here and then we
select make a variable called select
next which is the array variable for
selected indices remember so we collect
we see list that selected indices is
equal to select next what that's going
to do is automatically select the next
list in the cell then track to play is
defined as list that selected item that
song string so here we selected the new
next song and then we know which track
to play by the song string in that
selected item it makes good sense then
we go to and stop play to to make that
all happen and play the next song now at
the very end here I added always set
pause position back to zero here because
we want to have the pause position set
to zero if any song starts anew because
we're going to add a pause button I
think okay let's check out the result of
our hard work press ctrl + Enter to test
it
and let's go to a shorter song this
one's kind of short and when it ends if
it goes to five we know all is good we
also want to test you can hardly see
automatically went to the next song now
if we go to the last song when this song
ends it should go back to the first song
let's check and see if it does should
have made these tracks a little shorter
and the stop button also works so
everything we set out to do in this
lesson is complete and must prove it see
there i predict teacher that's the new
jam playing when that last one in the
list finished it shot back to song one
now let's press the stop button see
everything we set out to this complete
now we'll we'll just continue on we're
going to make this thing awesome i'm
going to show you everything volume
slider is what else can we deal with the
player we can show the load progress for
each song we can make a play head
drÃ¤ger to go anywhere in the songs play
head you're pretty cool stuff so this is
a lot we can do so stick around for par
5 and where will continue on with this
project and i guess the next logical
thing to do would be to i'm not even
sure yet we'll wing it we've been
winging it this whole project let's wing
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
