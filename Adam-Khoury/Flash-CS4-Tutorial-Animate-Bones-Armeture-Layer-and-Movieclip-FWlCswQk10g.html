to animate the armature layer on the
using the bones tool you can animate
your armature layer set keyframes and
then also animate the parent movie clip
to do various things and this is not to
showcase my animation or drawing skills
because obviously I have none this is a
rigging in the timeline animation
techniques tutorial in this lesson I'm
going to be showing you how to do some
cool animation techniques using bones
the timeline maybe some scaling in flash
cs4 professional this is a flash cs4
only tutorial because we'll be using
bones so I'm going to click
actionscript-3 project that you can
click the action script to project we're
not going to be using any action script
here already so now what we're going to
do is start with let's just make our
character start with the Oval tool and
we're not going to want any stroke so
let's remove the stroke before we start
drawing ovals out okay so there's our
little guy there's a head there's a
torso there's a thigh there's a shin and
foot and here's a bicep
forearm and a hand okay so let's go
ahead and move this head out of the way
put it in the center highlight all this
stuff and get it over here all
start piecing them together and then
we'll show you how to rig them up I'm
sure you guys have seen bones rigging
before but i'm not sure if you've seen
bones rigging the armature animation
armature timeline animations and that's
what i'm going to be going into actually
let's move this over a little and just
highlight all these ctrl c ctrl shift v2
faced in place go up to modify transform
flip horizontal and you'll get copies
those copies that we paste it in place
will flip on their horizontal plane then
bring this back you there we go now
let's start piecing them together and
once we bring all these drawing cymbals
together and they go into place becomes
one shape one solid shape you'll see
what i mean and you know what i mean if
you work in flash a lot because you do
it all the time okay so let's get these
stuck in here
actually before I do that yeah sku those
legs just to be just a little big not
that I ago it's oh shootin okay there we
go God all right now take the other went
on but I think bout up a room it's funny
some guy is commented on one of my
tutorials and he said it sounds like a
good fellows tutorial i said hey crack
me up it's one of my favorite movies
okie dokie all rights not perfect not
pretty but it's mine the spider-man
actually I'm going to give my little
horns and show you how you don't know
how to use the pen tool get this
rehearsal furniture putting something
like that bring this up he'll some minor
shape it the way you want it
Paint Bucket paint it double click it
single-click actually double click just
the reg press ctrl x get that out of
there we don't want it now will put the
up that's too big and try and make it
match up my little guy my little guys
horns little guy get on my profile or my
channel page here we go let's ctrl c
ctrl shift p do that modify transform
thing horizontal get it into place Booya
okay now we have one solid shape little
devil or whatever character you're
making and then we're going to go to
actually let's go ahead and right click
them convert to a symbol movie clip call
them level whatever yours is whatever
you want to name it and center
registration is fine movie clip okay now
what we want to do is double-click
inside go back to where we can access
our symbol here just like we were before
and now we're on its inner timeline you
can see we're inside of a movie clip
here named devil and there's the main
timeline if I click this oh yeah I'm
back at the main timeline double click
into the movie clip symbol and I'm
inside of that movie clips timeline and
it's good to know if you're a beginner
watching this tutorial these are
separate timelines you do different
animations and tweens on both okay so
what I'm going to do is rig this bad boy
up so you don't even have to have it
selected and once you select this bone
tool here you start rigging your your
armature it's going to give you an
armature layer automatically right above
your layer here okay and it's going to
make the symbol and the armature one
it's going to unite them okay so let's
just start right here
actually let's zoom in a little to 200
that's better let's start right here
we're going to come down to where point
to where the shoulders we can come off
with another axis there another rig
rigging axis or center point whatever
you want to call it when we go to make
the arms and I'm just clicking and
dragging it's very simple the bones tool
kind of goes where it intuitively should
it wants to go it'll kind of guide you a
little bit I'm sure you've seen rigging
before but maybe not on a whole
character a complete skeleton that's
what I couldn't to show you go to hear
yeah that'll work or maybe I should put
it there yeah let's go to there then too
there then to the hand so we go from
center rig point
shoulder for arm drag to hand I'm just
clicking and dragging alright so now we
have a full rig full skeletal rig on our
little dude all right and you can see if
you grab any part of them it stays
together just like a skeleton would and
that's the beauty of bones and you see
it's going to deform your character a
little bit but this example I don't care
you can rig up with movie clips if you
wanted I do believe so let's get them to
where we want them to be in his starting
position and I don't know what I'm going
to make him do but I'm going to animate
him somehow let's bring this thing up
well let's do this and then let's grab
his shoulder bring it back up
that's not what I wanted to do
oh well
it's gonna deform my face but that's all
right okay so let's just have him jump
in the air how about that
so we'll make them kind of look like
he's ready to push into the ground like
Keanu Reeves did in the matrix and break
the cement when he flies into the air
that's what will make no I'm just
kidding but we'll get him to where he's
going to jump into the air and that will
be the animation so there he is ready to
take flight we're ready to jump so now
we have our starting what do you call it
form you have a starting form for your
armature frame one
so in order to get it to animate the
armature to animate and I'm going to
make my goal like really slow mode so
you can see it really really good let's
go out to maybe frame 50 and press f6
create a keyframe and it puts an
animation tween there automatically if
you right click it you can remove the
armature if you like and there's a
couple of other options there you might
want to dig into but I don't have all
the time in the world so I'm not going
to so now at this point here at frame 50
we're going to reposition the armature
to kind of be like he's he has jumped
and he's in the air and what's cool is
the the timeline in the tween will take
care of all the transition frames all
you gotta do is key frame it it's kind
of like the old cartoonist used to work
the master cartoon would draw the key
frames out and the other cartoonists and
not so good cartoonist well really good
carts wanted to put the not the master
cartoonist would come in and do all the
transition frames in between the
keyframes so that's what that does you
see
so your artist would draw that and then
he would draw it frame 50 and then the
transition artist would draw 49 say a
Disney back in the day 49 from to 249
main the main artist would just do one
in 50 okay so now that we have that part
of the animation we can go out and it's
the main artist and click 100 f6 and now
it'll give us another keyframe there and
on that keyframe what you want to do is
have another repositioning of the
armature maybe kind of like he landed or
something or maybe we'll just make them
splat if I can let's see actually let's
make one more worries he's coming down
make them kind of like
we're just looking like he's one in the
land
hello there listen
just knee up a little this is okay and
so that would be him landing then do one
more out 150 press f6 and now we'll kind
of bring them back to a relaxed a
relaxed state grab this
oh that's not relaxed
you can do some pretty interesting
things with the volatile i'm getting all
kind of ideas just as i play around here
there
face stretching okay well this is more
about just an armature animation so
let's create another frame another layer
sorry and put it on top make a keyframe
press f6 and then we're going to access
the actions panel to make sure at the
end of the our animation it stops and
doesn't loop on itself and why is my
panel so smart stupid pattern okay so
let's type in press f9 to open that by
the way ft 0 p open close parenthesis
and semicolon that's a stop action so
now if we we should see something if we
press control enter now adays there's a
little animation that's crappy but this
is just in armature I'm no animator I
just wanted to show you how to animate
the the armature of the bones to the
timeline and keyframes now what you can
do is back in the main scene if you
wanted to you can put this little guy
anywhere and do anything to him so let's
say you wanted him to move from here to
there and maybe scale let's see let's go
let's try and scale them see what
happens make him really small
put it down here and then let's go out
to maybe frame was at 150 we did go to
frame 1 50 c try to match up timelines
yeah it's 150 go to frame 1 50 and press
sep six creates a keyframe right-click
anywhere in the center of those two
keyframes and create classic tween maybe
the other tool and let's see what
happens let's drag them over here oh and
make him bigger
linked it press ctrl enter
yep so you can see with just a few key
frames ok that one's looping you would
have to put a layer new layer here press
f6 press f9 st ope open closed
parenthesis semi-colon for a new snap
action on the main timeline and that's
that so that shows you how you can rig
up your this is an Internet Explorer now
and yes I use Internet Explorer
sometimes I also use safari and firefox
so get off my back so yeah that shows
you how you can just set a few key
frames and do a little cartoony
animation you know maybe a little help
your workflow a little if you like
making I know some kid in India or
England nine years old sitting on his
computer is going to love this one I
don't care what any of y'all say haha I
know man took crappy animation too all
right we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
