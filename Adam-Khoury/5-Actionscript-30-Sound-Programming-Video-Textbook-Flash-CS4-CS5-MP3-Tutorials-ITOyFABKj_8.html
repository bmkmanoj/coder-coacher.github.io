three points and programming video
textbook in this part will demonstrate
how to create the popular play/pause
style of media play button one that
changes from a play button symbol to a
pause button symbol magically and vice
versa depending on what state of play
the media is in now it's important to
keep in mind that you can do this for
any style of button that you've created
custom button or if you did like I did
you went to the window common libraries
you grabbed out buttons from there you
can do the same thing and I'm about to
do using any style of button whether you
create a custom or you use one of the
stock buttons so right-click it convert
it to symbol this time you're going to
convert it to a movie clip just put the
registration to the top left what it's
named inside the library is not
significant really but you can name it
whatever you want press ok so now that
we have a movie clip there let's give
that movie clip the instance name of
play underscore BTN just like our button
head now if we double-click inside this
movie clip we'll see that there's our
button with instance name play
underscore BTN let's remove that
instance name on that button we don't
need it anymore because now we're the
audio code is this button is now a movie
clip with name of play underscore BTN so
it'll still function in the same way it
did before if you test your file right
now let's change this to false let's
test the file see still plays the file
but now it's a movie clip symbol the
reason why we do that is so we can go
inside of it now and we're going to have
two layers top layer we're going to call
just type in actions right here you're
going to put a stop action so in layer 1
you can rename this one buttons so in
this frame you know you have this play
button sitting here so what we're going
to do is add another keyframe here press
f6 on that keyframe I'm going to press
ctrl x i'm going to go into the window
common libraries buttons and I'm going
to pull out the pause button from the
same set that I pulled out the play
button from right there I'm going to
bring it out to stage pop it right where
I think it should go if it's not in the
exact same spot as the play button I'll
put it in the same exact spot so let's
see this one's a coordinates of 14 and
11 let's put this one at 14 and 11 that
way there's no difference in its
positioning in there so you can go from
one frame to the next and you can see
one's a play symbol one's a pause button
so you have the play and your pause
button is still there you can also put a
stop action here if you like it's not
really necessary but it won't hurt
anything and it'll make sure things stop
when they get to that frame so now all
you have to do is in your audio code
let's go back into the audio movie clip
close that out now this button is all
set up now to where we can code it to
where when people press it or when the
song starts playing or finishes playing
or whatever we can change what that
symbol displays as depending on what the
state of play of the media is in we can
just command this little movie clip here
to go to either frame one or two
depending on what our needs are now the
first thing we need in our action script
if we plan on making that a play/pause
style a button is to create a new
variable this one we're going to call
pause position this is going to be a
number it's going to start off with a
value of zero at the top of the script
and that value will change as people are
hitting your play pause button because
that number is going to hold the exact
number four where the person is in
listening of the track or the media
that's playing just so if the track
starts playing twenty seconds into it
they press the play/pause button means
we have to record that position they
were at at that very second and that's
what that number is going to do so we
take that variable let me sync it right
in here where it says sound play put the
paws position
variable right there and you can even
put it down here remember where I said
in the last video I hinted upon taking
these five lines that are identical to
these five lines and putting it within a
universal function that way you don't
have the same five lines written out
twice because that's pointless in
programming when you can put things in
custom functions so I might wind up
taking these five lines and assembling
them into a custom function that way
when I need to execute them I can call
upon those five lines but they're only
written into the script once but for now
I'm just going to leave it in there just
like it is same five lines in both
sections and really up in this one you
don't even need it but it's not going to
hurt anything because sedative pauses
ition of zero it's going to start from
the beginning of the song there no
matter what if autoplay is equal to true
when the player just initially loads
this here is for the play button so
inside of the play button function that
we created in the last lesson all you
have to do now is add an else condition
to that if statement go down a couple
lines closed off your curly brace and
now you have an area to play some code
for the condition of if is playing is
equal to true because this code here is
going to run if is playing is equal to
false but now we want to run some code
if is playing is equal to true so this
else condition will supply us a
mechanism for that so inside of that
part of the condition statement you put
this code first thing is you establish
what the channels that position is and
you make that deposit positions value so
whatever position the song is currently
at when they press that button we're
going to record that number then we're
going to say channel dot stop this stops
the sound from playing then we instruct
the play button that's now a movie clip
to go to and stop on its frame one that
means it's going to show its play symbol
so the person can start the song back up
again then you last thing you do an
energy take your is playing boolean
variable and you put that to false so if
you're going to change the frame
name of the play button here you have to
change it here too if is playing is
equal to false in this part of the code
this is where we're going to make the
play button go to and stop frame to then
it's going to show the pause symbol so
if the song starts up and it's playing
somebody presses the play button we want
that to show the pause symbol on the
button magically so all you have to do
is put play on the scroll BTN that go to
and stop to that will go to frame two of
this movie clip which shows the pause
symbol right there okay simple enough I
think it is and you might have to do the
same thing up here let's just do that
for good measure right there but like I
said we're probably going to take these
lines and compile them into a universal
function so we're not writing them over
and over again when they're the same
five exact lines or same six lines now
so just keep in mind coming up soon I
might take these six lines and make a
universal function out of them so if the
player is set to auto play false that
means when they hit the play button it
should go it should give them a pause
symbol let's see yep it's a paw symbol
on the button now by hit it again it
actually pauses the song and it gives me
the play button back so there's your
magical play pause type button you hit
the pipe to play button again it doesn't
go back to the beginning it resumes from
the exact polish position that you had
it
and then right here in your own playback
complete event you just make sure our
paws position gets set to zero equals
zero so let's see if we need to update
this text field in here let's see status
text might need to say the song is
paused right here the song is paused and
I think that alert the status text is
not going to stay there very long we're
just using that for production purposes
song is paused so he's not playing song
is paused and there you have it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
