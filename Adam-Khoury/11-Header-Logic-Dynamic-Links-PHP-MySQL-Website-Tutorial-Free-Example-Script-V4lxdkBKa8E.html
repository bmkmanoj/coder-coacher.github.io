going to cover creating dynamic links in
your template top dot PHP file which is
essentially the header or the top
portion of your website design we're
going to now add some PHP script to that
file to create the dynamic links we need
let me first demonstrate to you how it
works if the member is logged in on your
website they will see now dynamic links
up top that actually work so if the user
clicks their name they will go to their
profile and you see that I have some
friends listed here and that's only
because I added some things to user dot
PHP and I added the notifications dot
PHP page but this video is not covering
the notifications a PHP script not yet
we're covering just the top logic here
for your header or your template top dot
PHP because you want to make sure that
if the user is logged in they have
different links than a normal visitor
that's not logged in so I've set it up
to take it to your notifications page
and your profile and you can also easily
log out right there now like I said
notifications and the extra code added
to user dot PHP is going to be covered
in later lessons so if your system isn't
showing that to you right now don't
worry about it because you don't have
that code yet what you want to focus on
right now is getting these top links
working and dynamics so if I click
logout you can see it logs me out it
really Gray's out that little envelope
and I have the regular login takes me to
the login page or signup so you see how
that works the member is not logged in
they'll see this arrangement on the
header and if the member is logged in
they'll see a whole different set of
links targeted just to them and some of
you guys might say hey Adam I noticed
that a lot of modern social networks
they don't take the user to a page to
see their notifications or check their
friend request they open up a magic box
with the user right there near the
header kind of like Facebook and other
social networks too but I'm not
programming up for you
okay this is the updated code for
template page top PHP which you guys
already have so what I did was I just
went into that little div that was
holding those dummy links up top
actually they weren't even links I just
had the word login and sign up with a
slash in between them before just
replace it with this PHP you're going to
echo envelope and you're going to echo
login link and these are just space
characters then up in the very top of
template type PHP you're going to have
this PHP script and it is very important
for any file that includes this template
top PHP file to have check login status
PHP included at its very top so here I
opened up the index file for my website
which is the home page you can see
included into the top very first thing
the very first line of code in the top
of that script is including that check
login status dot PHP I have to do this
in any file on my website that shows
that template page top dot PHP okay
because template page top has to make a
query it has to make several queries
depending on how much functionality you
want to have up there so mine
it just shows a envelope and basically
there's three versions of that envelope
it's a flashing blue envelope when a
person has new notifications it's a
still gray envelope when they have no
new notifications but they are logged in
and it's a blacked out envelope if the
user is not even logged in if it's just
a visitor to your site and they're not a
member they're not logged in it's just a
blacked out envelope so there's three
versions of that graphic and you can see
the first one is it blacked out here in
my images folder note dead JPEG so let's
go to the site and you guys can grab
that you can just go to images folder
and then go note underscore dead dot jpg
or whatever the extension was and you
can see the little graphic right here
and all you have to do is right-click it
save image as and you can keep it
mind if you guys use the graphics for
these tutorial files now the same thing
would be for you to grab the note
flashing gif and note still JPEG so you
need all three of those versions if you
want yours to be just like mine
now note flash is the one that flashes
bright blue and get to the user
attention if they happen to have new
notifications and it's very easy to make
the evaluation to see if they do have
new notifications so the first thing
we'll do up in the top of this file
which is your header is we're going to
set up the default links and actually
header options I'm not even using that
link I'm removing that I had that in
there from something I was messing
around with but I didn't keep it in
place so the first thing we do is you
set up the defaults and this is
basically the envelope and the login
links that the people will see if
they're not a logged in member of the
site if they're just a visitor or maybe
they are remember but they're not logged
in yet you want to serve up this
material to them this HTML content for
the envelope and the login link then you
simply check from check login status
type PHP you have that user okay
variable that you can evaluate so you
say if user okay equals true then you
know that they're a validated logged in
member so you can go ahead and make a
query that says select notes check from
the users table where username equals
this logged in user limit one and you
get that date field for there the last
time they check their notes right here
into this variable so once you have no
checks variable you can run another
query that says select ID from the
notifications table where the username
equals this logged in user and the
date/time of any notifications happens
to be greater than the date/time of
their last check notes and actually
notes check that should be notes check
and don't worry this all works just fine
even though I'm changing the code while
I'm explaining it
it all works just fine because you can
see the notes check variables right here
you want to make sure you're comparing
the date/time of your
chins to see if any of those
notifications happen to be greater than
the day time of when they last check
their notifications it's very simple
logic so you run that query and you get
the numbers result from that query to
see if there's at least one notification
that has a day time greater than when
they last check their notes so you say
if the numbers equals zero that means
they do not have any new notifications
then you give them the envelope to their
notifications dot PHP page the envelope
will be a link this way they can always
get back to that page or see that data
if they want even though they don't have
any new notifications and you want to
give them the image of note still it's
not flashing because they don't have any
new notifications but it is a brighter
gray than that default black so that way
they know they can click it and get to
that area else numrows is greater than
zero so that means there was at least
one notification found that is new that
they have not seen yet and you want to
give them link to that notifications
page again and then you can give them a
different title for it and say you have
new notifications and it's going to be a
bright blue flashing animated icon so it
won't be like it is when they don't have
any new notifications when they do have
new notification setting a flash like
crazy and get their attention you can
also check the numbers of how many new
notifications they have like I said I'm
not going to do all of your work for you
and this lotsa logic that you guys can
add to these things so basically up in
the top you can have numbers next to
links showing how many friend requests
or how many new notifications that user
happens to have before they click to
look ok so just remember that just
because I don't show it and give it to
you here doesn't mean it's not possible
get creative
there's so many millions of things you
can do to enhance upon what you're
learning how to do right now all you
have to do is become gifted in
programming PHP and JavaScript and all
that crap then finally the log in link
if the user happens to be logged in then
you want to give them a link to their
profile with their name
and you want to give them a link to the
logout script so this last check notes
or this notes check from the users table
you're going to update that every time
they check their notifications that way
you can evaluate to see if they come at
a later time and they have new
notifications you can evaluate to see
when the last time they check their
notifications was that way of any
notifications or a time later than that
last check time then that's the way you
know that they have new notifications
that they have not viewed yet because
the time of those notifications being
created is more in the future than the
time when they last check their
notifications is that make sense
I hope that makes sense and that's
pretty much all there is to it
now in the next video I'm going to be
showing you the actual notifications
page where you click your notifications
and this is a page where you can have
people check their friend requests and
also see their notifications and we'll
probably have a home dot PHP file
created for people checking their social
interactions or their friends
interactions and things like that and
like I said you don't even have to have
a notifications that PHP page you can
have special boxes magic boxes pop up
wherever you want when the user clicks
these links up top so you can have your
notifications be in a little box that
just pops up anywhere no matter what
page the user is on and then the next
video will also show you the logic for
accepting or rejecting these friend
requests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
