JavaScript programming tutorial my name
is Adam and I will be instructed
throughout this lesson now to give
yourself a good sense of what we're
going to be creating throughout the
lesson you can go to Adam Cory calm and
click my little doomsday countdown link
here and we'll open up this little
window that shows a doomsday countdown
this is what I decided to play with to
build my application for a doomsday
countdown December 21st 2012 because
there's a lot of people who believe in
the doomsday countdown and maybe they
want to put all the money in their bank
account in my bank account before the
world and I can take their money and
maybe do something nice with it you know
since the world is going to end anyway
but that gives you a sense of what you
can do with this kind of application you
can also count down till Christmas 2012
if you're a Christmas nut or you know
somebody that's Christmas nut you can
build them a countdown to Christmas so
they can anticipate it that much more or
Hanukkah or whatever kind of holiday or
cultural traditions that you have
focused around some kind of gate ok ok
we're going to start with the humble
beginnings of an HTML file so we're
going to start with in the head element
we're going to open up a scripting block
will make its type equal to text
JavaScript and close that and make sure
we put the closing tag with a script
element now we're going to put all of
our JavaScript within a function that
we're going to name CD TD short for
countdown to target date open closed
parentheses open a curly brace go down a
couple of lines and close off your curly
brace that way you have your nice
function nest all set up and ready to go
we're putting all of our code inside of
a function that way we can execute the
code over and over throughout the
countdown as we need to now the first
line in that function is going to be
creation of a variable that we're going
to call Xmas short for Christmas and
that's going to be equal to new date so
we're going to use the date object here
then within the parentheses for the date
object we're going to type in double
quotes a set of double quotes and within
that set of double quotes we're going to
put the date and time that we want to
count down to so I'm going to target
December 25th 2012 which is Christmas of
this year and it's going to be one
minute
after that day starts so one minute into
December 21st 2012 is going to be my
target countdown date and there are
different formats that you can supply to
the date object if you would like to
assign a specific date like I have here
this is just one format that I thought
was very clear and simple this type of
tutorial
now the next variable that we have to
compare to that first variable for
compare against it is going to be called
now and that's going to be equal to new
date object as well and that's going to
be left empty that way it can be set for
today whatever the current date and time
is for the current day is going to be
put in this variable called now so
you're going to calculate the difference
between now and Christmas 2012 now we
can get that time difference very simply
by creating a new variable and call it
time diff that's going to be equal to X
miss dot get time we're using the get
time method to create a specific format
that we want to perform the equation we
want a specific format so we're going to
put now dot get time as well so to get
the time difference between Christmas
and now we use Xmas get time method -
now dot get time so what we can do is go
down a couple of lines we're going to
create a new variable we're going to
call it seconds that's going to be equal
to time diff divided by 1000 and what
that does is it takes the raw
milliseconds of the time dip here and it
divides it by 1000 to give you how many
seconds are in the time differential
because the timed if R is milliseconds
so all you have to do is divide those
milliseconds by 1000 and you'll get how
many actual seconds are in that time
difference now we're going to have to do
one more thing here we're going to say
math dot floor because we want to round
down the value that we get from dividing
the time diff because it might be a
decimal and you don't want it really to
be a decimal you want to perform the
math.floor on it so that way it rounds
the number that we get back down so it
doesn't have a decimal so at this point
you have access now to
how many seconds are in between now and
Christmas 2012 and you can display that
to yourself if you want but at this
point we're not going to do that yet
we're going to assemble the minutes now
and the minutes is going to be a similar
equation so let's call this variable
minutes and we're going to divide the
seconds by 60 very simple and that will
give you how many minutes are between
now and Christmas 2012 now let's just
copy that minutes line and we'll do the
same thing for the hours we'll call this
one hours and we can divide the minutes
by 60 to get however many hours are left
between now and Christmas 2012 now let's
just copy this line and we can get the
days now how many days are left between
now and Christmas 2012 by dividing the
hours by 24 let's save our file so we
don't lose any of this work now at this
point we can begin to display things to
ourselves especially once we put a timer
in place because we're going to have to
put a timer in place that's going to
tick every second it's going to make
this function run every single second
and as it takes down we want to render
things on to the page so what we'll do
in the body section at this point is
we'll pop in these four div elements you
can see that each one has a unique ID
this one has days box hours box mins box
and sex box so what I'll do is put the
values for those things within the
corresponding box in the HTML so right
here under our days bar we're going to
pop in four lines that are going to
populate the innerhtml
of these four little divs down here by
saying document dot get element by ID
and then you target which development
that you want by its ID here then you
say dot enter HTML property is equal to
days so you can just populate that with
today's variable it will render to the
page in the appropriate HTML container
that you want it to go in now to get
this function kind of looping on itself
what we're going to have to do is create
a timer so we'll say bar timer you can
name that whatever you want I'm just
going to
my timer I'm going to use the set
timeout method on it and this is what
creates our timer and this gets two
parameters the first parameter is the
function that we want to run which is
this one right here
and since we're setting the timer within
that function that means it's going to
loop on itself and then we the second
parameter is how often you want the
timer to execute this one will be one
second so I'm going to put 1000
milliseconds and that's equal to one
second so what this line does when this
function runs the first time it's going
to hit this line down here at the end of
it and it's just going to loop the
function make it run again so that way
the function just keeps running every
one second until we use clear time-out
on it to stop the timer and we're going
to do that only if the target date has
been reached if now is equal to
Christmas or if now is equal to or
greater than Christmas now to get these
things rendering we're going to go under
our last div element here and it's
important to put this script element
under those HTML elements that way
they're recognized by the JavaScript
because if you try to run something that
targets certain HTML elements before the
page is fully loaded and those elements
are loaded to the DOM and JavaScript is
not going to find them so you got to put
this underneath
so we'll put script type same thing as
before javascript will close that and
we'll make sure we close off our script
element and within it all we want to do
is fire off the function c DTD the
countdown to target date and you can
break that statement there with
semicolon or not it doesn't matter I'm
going to put a semicolon there so what
this is going to do when the page hits
this line when the DOM is loaded this
line right here that means this function
c DTD is going to fire off it's going to
execute one time and when it does
execute that one time it's set to loop
on itself every second so now when we
run this page we're going to see values
being populated into these divs and we
still have one more calculation to set
up we just want the remainders of
certain things here I'll show you what
I'm talking about
so you see what I have here is two
hundred and forty-nine days five
thousand nine hundred eighty six hours
left this many minutes left until
Christmas and then this many seconds you
can see the seconds are ticking down and
the minutes would tick down too also and
the hours if you sat there and watched
it that long now this is not the kind of
values that you want to show the user
you want to show them just the
remainders you want to show them two
hundred and forty-nine days but you
don't want to show them five thousand
nine hundred and eighty six hours you
want to show them only how many hours of
remainders if they were all divided by
the days you know what I'm saying it
would never be more than twenty-four
hours so you can have 249 days left it
may be six hours and that's a very
simple conversion or calculation that we
can do here right under this day's
variable and we'll use the mul doulas
operator to grab only the remainder of
dividing those numbers by 24 or 60 all
right so right under this line let's pop
in those three lines that will calculate
the hours minutes and seconds remainders
only you don't want to show the full
amount of hours till Christmas you only
want the remainders so you use the mole
doulas and what this line is doing is
basically saying hours is equal to hours
module is 24 and if you want you can go
to develop PHP and I wrote some
information about the module it's
operator recently and I notice a lot of
sites don't really explain module as
well so if you want to click on mind a
module as operator in JavaScript within
my JavaScript library I explain it well
so I only mentioned that because some
people might be looking at this and
saying what the hell is this equation
even doing it's saying hours is equal to
hours module is 24 minutes is equal to
minutes module is 60 and you can just
shorthand that equation by saying hours
modulus equals 24 minutes module is
equals 60 so now once we get those
calculations in place let's run the page
again and see what happens now we get
something that
a little more readable to our visitors
and understandable
you got 249 days left till Christmas
2012 10 hours 50 minutes and 10 seconds
or have many seconds they are counting
down and when this counts down to zero
you'll see when the seconds get down to
zero this will turn into 49 the seconds
will go back to 62 okay so now you've
got your countdown running no problem
and I'm going to throw in a little bit
of bonus logic for you guys and here's a
little if condition that you can throw
in place that says if time diff is less
than or equal to zero then you want to
run the cleartimeout method on the timer
that will stop your timer from running
and then you can do whatever you want
when you know that christmas is here
your script will know that christmas is
here but you can execute any kind of
code you want maybe you want to send
people to some other document or you
want to write something to the page like
I did say Christmas is here so it'll
stop the timer remove all the other
stuff and it'll just say Christmas is
here but really I just wrote this so you
can put there I put a comment run any
code needed for countdown completion so
when the countdown is finished when it
gets down to zero or if the target date
happens to be in the past of whatever
now is then you want to run some special
code that's what you do right here at
this point that way this application you
can start it now for a target date way
in the future and then when it gets to
that target date you don't have to do
anything it's already it'll already be
programed to show them some kind of
alternate content once the date has
arrived that is what you do in this if
condition right here now let's just go
down into the HTML and you would really
want to use HTML and CSS to really
design it give it a really nice look
like I did on my website but I'm just
going to write for example sake days
remaining I'm going to give it a
semicolon I can copy that line go into
here put hours remaining there and this
will give you a clearer depiction of
what's going on so you have days
remaining till Christmas 2012 2 1
49 hours remaining ten minutes 45 and
the seconds 50 like I said when this
gets down to zero in real time on the
page in an animated fashion the user is
going to see the minutes tick down as
well
and if they sit there long enough
they'll watch the hours tick down but
nobody's that much of a freak but it's
still a cool application to run so like
I said you take CSS and you target all
of these divs you can even give these a
class if I wanted to give these a class
attribute of say time box and I give all
of those divs a class of time box just
like that now what I can do with my CSS
is target that time box if I wanted to
make all the numbers that are taking
down really big put them in a nice
bordered box whatever I just target that
time box and JavaScript can target the
divs independently using their ID but
I'll take that out of there and I'll
leave the designing or the visual
aspects the eye candy of the application
those oldest aspects I'll leave up to
you guys and your own individual
creativity okay so that wraps it up we
hope you've enjoyed this JavaScript date
and time countdown tutorial we'll see
you in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
