down anyways I was on my channel
checking out the comments I get see if
anybody wanted to argue or fight with me
Knight Templar seven asked could you do
a Thanksgiving pumpkin theme with a
pilgrim hat so that's what we're gonna
do in this video tutorial there are some
requests that I get here that are very
complex scripting requests but if it's
something like a design request I can
easily accommodate that and this pumpkin
the pilgrim hat on a pumpkin thing I can
do very quickly and since we already
made the pumpkin we're halfway done
let's just make the pilgrim hat on top
of the pumpkin and let's go come on
and here is the finished product of the
pilgrim hat that you're going to be
learning how to create in this lesson
okay here we are with the pumpkin that
we left off with after lesson one of
creating the vector pumpkin and you can
tell if you're dead center by that line
showing up you see when I move it is
that dotted line that shows up in the
center that lets me know it's dead
center and then I have lots of room on
top to draw the Hat now let's grab an
ellipse and you want to draw that out to
the kind of the 3d view that you want to
have and I want mine to have a 3d view
sort of like that I guess maybe a little
bit wider like that then I'm going to
take it and bring it down a little bit
and make sure that's dead center I'm
gonna click my pumpkin and see I have a
width of 534 of my pumpkin so let's make
sure this is an even number as well and
it is it's 670 and when I move it it
hits dead center and I leave it there
now you just bring that down onto your
pumpkin wherever you want I'm gonna put
mine right there and remember in video 2
we carved a face into that pumpkin and
you can have any kind of face you want
carved into this if you want to face in
it but a lot of people might just want
to have a pumpkin with a pilgrim hat on
it as a little icon or graphic on their
website so this thing we are going to
make solid black now let's press ctrl-c
ctrl-v to make a copy of that you see
but you don't have to move it leave it
where it was and just use your keyboard
arrow keys to move it up you can even
make it a different color let's make it
this orange for now let's move it up so
about right there till we have a 3d disc
looking thing and if you go up too much
you'll see that you'll ruin the 3d
aspect of it on the edge here so you
just bring it down a little bit and if
you want you want to have a lot of depth
you can put it like that and then just
connect these two points with the shape
I'll show you how to do that let's go
here let's zoom in and all we need is
really a really tiny rectangle and just
draw the rectangle in to match those two
areas and make it solid black or
whatever color you want to be
behind there now grab this two ellipse
the orange running him press
control-shift
up arrow key to bring it to the top and
then you can give that disc any kind of
depth that it needs that's gonna be the
brim of the Hat let's see let's bring it
up one pixel right there looks perfect
we'll do the same thing to the other
side and really the best thing to do
would be to get this shape to be all one
piece and let's see let's highlight
these four items let's just highlight
everything and then deselect hold shift
to deselect the pumpkin so you can see I
just have this stuff up here highlighted
but don't move it now what we're gonna
do is deselect by holding shift we're
gonna deselect this orange disc on top
so now I have just three items selected
the black ones I'm gonna go to modify
combine paths and I'm gonna union those
now that's a solid shape that I can then
punch out with this one so I'm gonna
press ctrl-c ctrl-v
and I'll make this shape whatever color
I want you see how it's blue I'll
highlight that one that's on top of my
orange one and I'm gonna highlight the
black shape underneath it those two
shapes
we're gonna go to modify combine paths
and punch now what you're left with is a
nice little 3d perspective little brim
type thing but you don't want to move
that one on top and you can give
gradients to this now which might come
in handy for you if you want to make it
say you wanted to make just the edge
shine you can add gradients to that to
make it look shiny or beveled whatever
you want
now let's highlight this and put a
gradient on that gradient linear and
where it's white on top let's go ahead
and make that black and where it's
orange on the bottom let's go ahead and
make that a gray like that and I'm gonna
move up now and you'll notice that any
character that you have underneath this
would sort of need some kind of shadow
move this down a little bit it'll need
some sine of shadow because the brim of
the Hat will be shadowing their face a
little bit so if there's any light
coming from above
you'll want to take shadowing into
consideration and that's easy to do you
can just come here and put a point here
and then come all the way across put a
point right about here and then let go
and then get your mouse on this point
again click and hold down this time and
then just pull you see and you can pull
the shape that it's gonna shadow the
face there and we'll make that solid
black solid black now we're going to
highlight these two and bring them to
front by control shift up arrow key and
then this one we're gonna give a filter
of blur Gaussian blur and you can set
that to be as blurry or as crispy as you
not need it to be I'm gonna put mine
right about there press ok then I'm
gonna bring the opacity down to
something like that then you'll see
you'll notice that whatever background
that this might mess up your background
so you if you don't want that shadow to
be in this white area here you can go to
modify flatten selection and then just
take your eraser and simply erase that
OOP I went too far
control-z there just don't go too far
and you won't show any of the pumpkin
but you'll erase that that might be
interfering with your background all
right now let's move up and start
working on the top of the hat now
pilgrim happens have a distinctive shape
and I noticed a lot of the times when
people make them they're shaped all kind
of just square it off and pointy but it
has some roundness to it rounded edges
sort of so what we're gonna do is start
right about here I'm gonna click let go
so right about there we're gonna click
hold down and curve that line just a
little bit then we're gonna go up and
once we get right about to here we want
it to curve but not too much so we're
gonna click down here and then we can
let go after that click and we're free
to put the next point now so we're gonna
put the next point right about here and
right there you put a curve you click
and hold down and let and leave a curve
and then you come out to right about
here where it's kind of flat on top
around
a little hold and round it just a little
bit click down and come down to meet
this point down here and then right
there and if your points don't exactly
match you can grab just this one by
grabbing the sub selection tool here and
grab just that point use your arrow keys
and your keyboard to move it down so
everything is lined up then you give
that thing a black fill remove the edge
on it and this top one I'm gonna bring
that point up here down just a little
bit right there then I'm gonna highlight
that shape using my regular pointer
highlight it press ctrl-c ctrl-v now I
have a copy see and I'm going to flip
that copy flip it horizontally I'm gonna
put it in place where it looks like it
should go then I'll select both of those
modify combine paths and union and if
the Union lines seem funny you don't
even worry about it doesn't even matter
but what you want to do now is take that
object and get a dead center with
everything else put it on the Hat where
you think it looks like it should go
there and then we're gonna give it a
gradient gradient of ours and you'll see
that you want the outside bars to be
black which they are and the inside bar
you want that to be very dark like that
you can even make it a little bit
brighter if you want it won't hurt it
right about like that there we go
now this next shape that we're gonna
draw you can just deselect everything
hit the pen tool again I'm gonna click
down there and let go then I'm gonna go
to right about here click down you see
I'm not at the very edge yet then I'm
gonna go right down a little bit and
beyond the edge a little bit click down
let go
curve that point a little bit and then
to where I'm going into a downwards
direction with my mouse and I haven't
let go of that point yet now I'm gonna
let go I'm gonna come down so right
about here make sure I get over this
point here right about there and then
I'll come to a 45 degree angle down and
to the right this way and then click
down and hold and drag again to where it
gives it a rounded corner then you want
to get your mouse direction going
towards this way when you let go
right about that direction not up like
that and not too far down right about
like that and then let go and then come
to a right about here to the center
click down and curve that edge not too
much maybe right about there
then click down on this point to make a
sharp corner and then click down here
and now we can give that a black fill
and remove the edge on it make sure it's
in a good position something like that
looks good alright now we're going to
copy this control-c control-v flip
horizontal move it over to the other
side make sure it matches up and we want
that one to be about right there so what
we'll do is connect them let's go ahead
and union those highlight both of them
by holding shift as you select them
modify combine paths Union now we can
make sure that this thing is a little
bit wider now just grab your scale tool
and widen it that looks pretty good and
this point I'm gonna bring up just a
little bit actually I'll zoom in and
both of those points have to go up to
where they match and there you go that
looks like a good curvature for that now
all we need is to buckle the gold buckle
and actually before I put the buckle on
there I'm gonna grab these two items and
I'm gonna widen that brim so I'll just
grab my regular selector tool grab those
two things I'm gonna move the brim over
here I want it to be about that wide
instead and then move this side over to
be an even number as well and then I can
move those to where they hit dead center
once again
and you can make the the brim of the Hat
as wide as you need it to be all right
I'm gonna show you a cool little trick
on this brim now you can highlight your
subselection tool and go ahead and make
a box that covers those three points
that are going to be there or there's
three or four points there just make
sure you highlight that whole edge and
you'll get all those points now watch
this if you push down on your arrow key
just those points will move down and
that puts a curvature on the brim you
see and I'm gonna curve it down just a
little bit I don't want a very dramatic
curve so I'm gonna press ctrl-z to where
it's flat again and I'm gonna go one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
then I'm gonna go over here same thing
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten okay now the buckle is simple
we'll just grab a let's do a rectangle
draw it in right about you know and you
can make it perfectly square by holding
the shift key while you're dragging that
or make it about that big I'm gonna make
sure it's dead center I'm just gonna
make that solid make it a gold color
somewhere right about there I guess okay
I'm gonna round that rectangle what
about like that then press control-c
control-v to make a copy I'm gonna make
this copy black I'm gonna put it on top
again I'm gonna resize that with my
scale tool once I get it in the dead
center of those two items let's see that
one's 123 wide this one's 147 let's make
this one 48 wide make this one 124 wide
so the bottom would be 148 as well this
one 41:24 as well there I think that's
about right well maybe that's more right
there we go
just as long as that black ones in the
dead center and you can make that black
one in any size you want I'm gonna make
it actually 120 so I have a more thick
buckle up there now I can highlight both
of those together go to modify combine
pads and punch now your your shape is
just that gold buckle shape then you go
to filter
double an emboss inner bevel make the
type smooth bring this all the way up
bring this all the way up bring this all
the way up then move your angle to where
it's 90 degrees 90 right there and if
you don't want such a dramatic beveled
effect you can you can lessen that bring
this down to maybe something like that
41 something like that okay that looks
decent and you can add any kind of
gradients you want to this thing now you
can also kind of make this look wooly if
you want by giving it a texture of let's
try that grain see what happens see
makes it look a little wooly you can
also add the green to that and you can
add to make that look felt you can give
that swirls or something swish and bring
it down a lot maybe it's even too right
about eight and that that'll look like
felt a little bit now this I'm going to
give it an inner glow in that buckle
glow inner glow bring it to about 265
looks good put that on about three and
that looks good to me and I'm gonna
remove the textures I was just showing
you that if you wanted to put texture on
those to make it look wooly a little bit
you can but I'm gonna shrink this down
it'll be a little icon or graphic on the
page I really won't even be able notice
that and if you want this shadow to be
darker you can press ctrl-c ctrl-v and
just put another copy of it on top of
itself now we can go to it's a little
bit too much and you bring the opacity
down on one there we go now I'm gonna
highlight all that and see what its
gonna look like as a shrunken graphic
for a webpage press ctrl-c ctrl-v to
make a copy of everything go to modify
flatten selection and then we can really
make this thing small the size that we
would really reduce it to to be on a
webpage so let's look at a hundred
percent and I would want it on my web
page maybe write about that size so that
looks really good at a medium size and
then at a really small icon size it
still looks really good you can see all
of your effects on that looks like it's
3d and shadowed and everything is great
but it
taina pilgrim hat you can put on all the
pilgrim pumpkins</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
