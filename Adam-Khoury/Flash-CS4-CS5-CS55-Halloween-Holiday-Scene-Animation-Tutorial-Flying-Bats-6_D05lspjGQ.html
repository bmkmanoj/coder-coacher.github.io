product of what we'll be learning how to
create in this flash cs3 and cs4
tutorial it's a holiday Halloween
animated bat scene and if you want to
see a witch going across the moon in an
animated fashion just let me know now
I'll teach you how to do that we'll make
the the broom and her hair flap in the
wind and everything is she's going
through there but in this lesson you can
learn how to create this whole scene and
these bats flying throughout the scene
in a loop animation so whether you're
making banners or a little scene for
your website if you want to get a little
holiday theming on it this one will show
you how nicely okay let's go into flash
and create a new ActionScript file it
can be ActionScript tool or ActionScript
3 whatever you like
we're not going to rely too much on code
as much as we are going to be playing on
the timeline so let's go to rectangle
primitive I'm going to draw out a
rectangle and you can be in cs3 or cs4
for this let's go ahead and transform
this gradient in this rectangle if yours
doesn't happen to have a gradient
already you can go to the cutter
selection give it a gradient now we're
going to transform the gradients where
the lighter part is on top let's get
this straight
okey-dokey now I'm going to change the
color to a nice amber sky
and you're right about there it looks
good for starters and now I'm going to
create a new layer let's call this one
sky let's create a new layer let's call
that one moon create another layer let's
name that one bat or bats let's create
another layer and make that one
mountains okay so on the sky layer we
want to have that at the very back of
our scene the furthest layer back and
the moon is going to be on top of that
so let's draw the moon out grab a oval
primitive hold shift down while you're
dragging it out to keep it circular and
let's just make that white convert to
symbol right click it convert to symbol
movie clip call it moon okay now you can
give that moon a filter effect of glow
bring a blur all the way up and change
it from red to white I thirst up moon
okay now make this background just a
little darker
just a little bit maybe right about
there
perfect now let's draw out the mountains
let's grab the mountains layer highlight
that layer you can lock all the rest to
make sure you don't put anything on
those for now
and grab the pen tool and let's go ahead
and draw some mountains out
doesn't have to be very precise or
anything whatever works
now we'll highlight that blind tool that
we just made by the line that we just
created and connected and we're going to
give it a fill of a dark color right
there that's good maybe even all the way
black or closer to black that's good we
don't need that edge there we go now
when you press control enter you'll see
that it fits in there real nice okay so
now we have a moon the sky in the back
in the nice mountain range going now all
we need is two animated bats but all
kind of cool Halloween stuff so let's do
it okay first we want to get the back
Slayer to the top and the mountains
layer locked let's unlock the bats layer
and now we can draw out our bat
okay let's draw a wing a bats wing so
let's click here with the pen tool I
grab the pen tool click down go right
about here click down and hold and click
on that dot and go right about here
click down and hold and drag get the
curvy one again then click down here
then let's go right about here click
down you can make a little bulge there
if you want or it could be straight and
let's go right about here
drag it up there
then let's connect this
now let's grab it let's give it a fill
black alright that's good looking back
swing now let's take the edge off or
that we don't need any edge and it's not
going to be that big but now we can
duplicate that and have both sides but
really what I'm going to do is just
animate this wing to be flapping and
then I'm going to duplicate it and we'll
have our both of our left and right
wings ready to go and all you do have to
do is make one so what we'll do is first
we'll highlight that wing and convert
the symbol movieclip let's call it wing
okay and now let's go inside of that
timeline inside this symbol it has its
own timeline and everything we have see
what's this layer name how'd they get
there let's put that back over here are
where it belongs okay so the layer name
we can call this wing okay now once
we're in this timeline it's a simple
matter to animate it just right-click it
convert this object instance here to
assemble call it inner wing or wing
inner
okay yeah that's good and so what we'll
do is skew it and scale it so what we'll
do is bring the registration dot to
right about here where you think it'd be
hinged to the bat you know what I'm
going to turn that upside down actually
let's flip that modify transform flip
vertical I think that would look like a
better bat swing okay so now either way
it would work
so let's go ahead and grab the free
transform we have our pivot there so
let's go ahead and make a new keyframe
on mono no I wanted to flat fast so
maybe five and then make another
keyframe on nine create motion tween
create motion tween i just right-clicked
and create a motion tween between those
dots you can remove the tween if you
need to create a motion tween all right
so the dot in the center we want to have
maybe right about there and then we want
to scale it in a little bit where it's
not same size to where it looks like
it's moving in 3d space just a bit let's
see what we have let's go ahead and drag
this
that's good very simple
okay so we have that let's bring it over
here let's resize it down a little bit
to the size we need it and now let's go
ahead and press control C control shift
V modify transform flip horizontal and
now we have the other sides wing ready
to go so let's go ahead and press
control enter see what we have that's
pretty key all we need is the body in
the middle really let's get this frame
rate up to 30 so we have good animation
control enter perfect now let's draw in
the body
so what I'm going to do is draw in the
body and then after the body is drawn in
then I'm going to group all three items
together into a movie clip themselves
that way we can animate it further like
we'll need to okay so let's grab the pen
tool again and let's just draw a half
the bat
really let's give it a maybe right about
here so right about there then click
down here on this dot click up here then
click right about there maybe go right
about to there now we can go straight
down meet up over here
let's take that
give it a black fill remove that line
don't need it double-click inside of it
first press control C control shift V
then modify transform flip vertical
oops that's the wrong lip modify flip
transform flip horizontal and now you'll
see that it will just attach to itself
okay now it's one shape and there's the
bats head we can give them little beady
eyes if we want bring out oval primitive
make them white or red red would be cool
there we go
okay so there's the bats head only needs
a little buddy so let's grab an oval
primitive something like that
nice fat bat just sucking a lot of blood
hey okay that's good now let's take that
grab all of those and convert to symbol
make a little movie clip call it bat
body this is a hundred different ways
you can do this but that's how I'm doing
it and registration let's give a
registration Center just in case we want
to animate that but I don't think we'll
be animating that now let's bring it
over to where we want it and scale it
down
oh my god is bodies huge let's double
click inside let's make the body not so
tall there we go that might even be too
tall still let's try that that's much
better
he's still a little fat okay now let's
see what we have press ctrl enter here's
a bat lick it to him now he's still a
little bit too big so let's just scale
them down further here bring them up
that's more like it there's a cool
looking bat okay so now all we have to
do and his head's a little big as well
I'm scale him down some more then it
takes care of that that should even
actually look better because of the wing
on the bottom the bottoms of the links
yes much better
that's perfect Hey okay now let's grab
all three of these items convert to
symbol and let's just name this all bat
the whole bat
okie-dokie
now at this point with the bat in its
own movie clip it's a simple matter to
double click inside of it make sure we
grab all of those three pieces again the
body and the two wings convert to symbol
let's call this and it made it fat you
can name these things symbol 1 symbol 2
it doesn't really even matter okay so
now inside of here's the main timeline
you double-click inside of the bat and
you have another bat movie clip all
compiled into one piece if you double
click inside of that there's a three
independent pieces which are all movie
clips as well but we want to be in this
layer here so here's the maintain double
click there alright now all we have to
do let's call this bat one you can put
many bats in here and use the same one
duplicate it just put them in different
position different sizes and tweening
two different places right so now let's
click first let's get them where we want
him to start out so let's go and put him
right about here and scale them down
really tiny teeny tiny let's make the
alpha none now let's go to frame I don't
know maybe frame 10
so we'll see how it looks if we need to
change it we will create motion tween
and on frame 10 let's grab it give its
alpha back to 100 let's scale them up
and let's move in maybe to about right
here then let's go to frame any way you
want right there
create motion tween you can set these
frame distances any way you like
now let's bring them maybe over here
make them really freakin huge something
like that let's fade them out oh that
might not look good
hey let's just make them big and bring
him up out of the out of the way now
let's press control enter see there you
got a bet flying across the screen like
he's coming in from the sky somewhere
and going up he's going a little bit
fast so all we have to do to remedy that
is drag out these frames see how that
looks oh that's sweet man you don't even
really need the fade in part
and you can also skew him let's give
them a skew right here and then over
here
let's skew him this way make sure he
gets out of there okay see what that
looks like
see now he's kind of skewing around
I'll show you want to skew this one the
other way
nice okay now all we got to do is you
can make some more make some more bats
so I'll leave that up to you really
I'll show you how to make another one
let's make a new layer you can call that
bat 2 or whatever grab that central bat
one in the middle the middle layer there
or the middle of the timeline control
see let's put him right there
control V and what we want to do with
him is let's put him on the other side
of the moon skewing back right about
there scale them down
put them into place
actually let's make him start from the
bottom over here by the mountains and
then let's go to frame no anyway you
want right there
okay I'm not going to give this guy
alpha out
so right there and bring them out - on
that keyframe let's create motion tween
here on this keyframe let's bring them
out first let's scale them up so we can
see them better
let's bring them out to about right
there with the skew then let's do the
same thing to him where he goes off the
scene create motion tween let's grab
them
put them up here
make him really big
now let's control-enter there you go got
bats flying everywhere
let's bring this guy in the first one
down here instead in the mountains let's
see what that looks like awesome so
that's how you can create all kind of
flapping bat animations in the moonlight
for your Halloween scenes to impress
folks or make advertising banners for
holiday themes or whatever if you want
to animate things that's a good way to
do it okay we'll see you next lesson
maybe I'll put a witch going across an
animated witch on a broomstick going
across if you guys want to see an
animated witch on a broomstick going
across the scene here flying across the
moon I'll show you how to do that and
just let me know in the comment area and
rate this video hi to let me know you
like enjoyed this sort of thing that's
how it works okay so if you want to see
the witch going across the moon just
leave a nice fat comment saying yes I
want to see the witch going across the
moon
do it now Adam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
