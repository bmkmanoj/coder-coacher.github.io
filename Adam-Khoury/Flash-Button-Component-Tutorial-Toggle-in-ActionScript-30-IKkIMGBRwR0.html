that also has a free source file that
goes with it you can download from
develop PHP com
you'll learn how to dynamically create
button instances put them on stage
through code and using the button
component that's the first component in
the user interface from the components
library and I show you how to program
that add it to stage and program it to
have toggle functionality so you can
access the toggle property of your
button components and then program
things accordingly you see how it
changes what it says on the button when
the clip is gone it says show clip when
the clip is there it says hide clip and
I thought that would be a good way to
show you guys toggle the toggle
functionality and tapping into the
native toggle property of the button
component and you also learn a little
bit about the visibility property of
display objects
let us begin I'm in flash cs3 and I'm
going to create new flash ActionScript 3
file now I'm going to create just a
quick example display object I'm gonna
create oval shape there and I'm gonna
put some text on it my little name EBU
flash brother and then I'm going to put
that in place there I like both of the
item convert to symbol
movie clip my underscore MC is named in
the library I'm gonna copy that name
okay put that name in the instance name
properties inspector or spot right there
my underscore MC so now this is my
display object and it has an instance
name here in the properties panel so in
order to use the component the button
component we have to drag it to stage
because if we start here I'm just gonna
put object this will be my object layer
and this will be cold alright so on the
cold layer if I go in and I put in the
first night line that we need to
dynamically use the button the button
component
you'll see we'll get an error I'll show
you okay import that fell without
control stop button now watch this I'm
gonna publish out by pressing control
enter or I'm gonna export definition so
we have definition that FL controls
button could not be found that's because
we don't have that in our library you
see here it's only that my MC movie clip
this thing I made so what we do is we go
into the components library again we
pull out a button put it on stage and
then just press control X and get it out
of there now what I did is I added that
to the library you can see we have
component assets and now the button it's
in the library so now if I press control
enter looky there no error that means we
can continue let's go okay so the
mission is to create a button have it
placed on stage all through code and
have it toggle the visibility of this
display object here so you'll learn a
little bit about the visible visibility
property of display object and but
mainly we're going to be focusing on
button toggle functionality the button
components toggle functionality and so
let's open our actions panel
let's click the code layer there put
what kind of code this is a s3
ActionScript 3 and press f9 and you see
we have that one line there already
okay so let's code this puppy out so
what we're going to do is access and
bring out a button by claiming a new
button instance my button colon button
equals a new button
open close parenthesis semicolon now my
button dot label this is what's gonna be
on the button itself the word on the
button or the words on the button equals
and if it's going to be visible at the
start we should say hide click so the
user can hide the object and I thought
using visibility would be the best way
to show you guys the button components
toggle functionality I think it's a good
way to and I'm just gonna show you see
you can put a name on this button as
well but we're not even gonna name it we
don't have to go that far but if you
wanted to name value on it I'll put it
and I'll show you name equals BTN 1 VT n
1 the next property will be my button
toggle and this is how you allow the
button to know that it is supposed to be
a toggle button now so it acts
differently and I'll show you how now 1
more is my button and this is where it's
gonna be located on stage my button dot
move and you just put the x and y values
in between these parentheses let say 2
25 and 30 so it's in the middle near the
top in a little space here
okay then we just add child and child
puts the display object on stage or
whatever object is supposed to be going
on stage that you've created through
code here or any object in your library
now let's go and add a listener to this
button which is going to be a change
event okay so we access the name of the
button that add event listener this open
parentheses close parentheses semicolon
in between the parentheses claim the
event not change right here then the
pulldown if you have the code help on
comma and the name of the function
that's going to fire off on this change
event okay so we write in the function
function grab that name function change
handler you open closed parenthesis then
we type in : void and open the bracket
curly brace let's go down here and close
the function off now we have a nested
function there nice ready to go oh yeah
we have to put in the event
there we go that way we can access
certain things about the object in the
event I'll show you that right now
okay so what we're gonna do is I'm sorry
what we're gonna do is make an if-else
condition inside of this function so
let's go ahead and set that up
here we go now we have beautifully
nested if-else condition and inside of
the if condition we're going to grab the
event dot current target dot selected
and that will let us know whether
because it knows this button mode though
this button has toggle mode set to true
so it's going to know whether or not
it's selected its current target it's
selected or not
I'll show you target that's selected
equals true now right here what we're
saying is it the event that current
target which is my button that's
selected equals true which has to do
with this toggle mode which it is going
to be by default when person comes to
the application let me say my underscore
MC that visible and this is how you set
the visibility property to your display
objects you can make them just disappear
and reappear at will so what's going to
happen is and actually we're gonna
change the name that's on the button
change the label on the button so my
button dot label is gonna be hide clip
no sorry it's already hide clip then
when it comes so it's gonna be show clip
because it disappeared since since the
object disappeared the movie clip being
this guy when they click it the first
time it'll disappear so we want the
button to say show clip so for the next
time when it reappears so let's grab
that code and say else my but invisible
or my movie clip visible equals true and
then hide clip again you want the button
to say hind clip that's as easy as it is
I think we're we should have a button
thrown right about here that's going to
say show clip and hide clip according to
whether or not to click the showing or
not let's try it
control-enter
but tune see I won't edit that out just
to show you guys everybody messes up a
little bit instead of naming writing
button in my code somewhere I read in
wrote in but tune on line three
that's an easy fix usually go in line
three but tune it's not cool all right
now control enter see it says hide clip
show clip hide clip show clip hide clip
show clip you can see the button takes
on a gray appearance when it's in it's a
toggle mode when it's not in toggle mode
then it can it just shows its regular
appearance but it takes on different
properties so let me show you if I zap
out the saga mode or make it not have
that property press control enter you
see it doesn't go into toggle mode at
all it's just like a regular button so
that is how you can give your dynamic
button components toggle functionality
now let me go see what my little puppy
once outside the door here I'll have
this source file available free for
download like most of the others at
develop PHP comm in the flash section I
just wanted to go ahead and throw this
on the tail end here that you can
instead of using all code here if you
want to do a little bit manually you can
go into the actually you just go into
your library and drag out the button but
it where you want it give it the
instance name of my button like we were
using before go into the code instead of
creating the button
and importing the controls we can just
give it the properties we want we don't
have to add child either because the
child is added manually by us by what we
just did but everything else should be
just fine so this is more of a manual
method you see it says label right now
but that will change because of the
properties we give it I got an error
oh because I tried to change name
property and it's not a dynamic item
anymore see you got to read your errors
I'm not gonna edit that out either that
that will teach you guys to read your
error as well because it just showed me
what I had to remove from my code that
was causing the error but now you can
see manually everything works the same
and here's a PS PS let's break it down
some more let's see label let's get rid
of that toggle let's get rid of that and
we didn't need that in the first place
look at that let's slim it down okay now
we have my button now let's put those
parameters back in that we just took out
let's do it manually here toggle true
label hide clip and that's it now
control-enter see they're breaking it
down for you breaking it down so that
should give you a pretty good full
understanding of how the button
component works well not complete but a
good start on it anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
