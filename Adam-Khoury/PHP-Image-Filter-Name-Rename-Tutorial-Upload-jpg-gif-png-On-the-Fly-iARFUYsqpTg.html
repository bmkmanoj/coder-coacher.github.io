filtering the name of the file that is
uploaded in case it has any spaces funny
characters in it extra dots and things
like that so you can see here we're
running the explode function on the file
name we already discussed all that in
the previous tutorials for this video
textbook so we're not going to go to in
depth about that again what I'm going to
show you here is right above that how to
filter the file name before it even runs
through the explode function there and
this will help you remove any spaces of
money characters that you have so we're
going to use the preg replace function
on the file name variable and the preg
replace function will take three
parameters here first parameter is what
you want to be replaced in the string
the second parameter is what you want to
replace that with in my case I'm going
to replace it with nothing so I have
nothing there between those single
quotes you see so it works as a way of
stripping it out it's not replacing if I
wanted to replace them all with capital
H then I just put a capital H there but
I want to replace it with nothing so I'm
stripping it and the third parameter is
the string that you want to send through
this private place function so in this
case what I want to be removed from the
string target everything except a
through Z any letters A through Z in the
alphabet
it'll also accept the dot you see the
little dot there so the dot can be in
the file name as well and any numbers 0
through 9 can also be in the file name
anything else like a space and
underscore a - a question mark whatever
else might be in it will be removed from
the file name so you'll have nothing but
letters and numbers and dot that's it
and this the I on the end means it's non
case-sensitive so being non
case-sensitive if there's a capital A or
a capital X within the file name that
will be retained just fine because we're
signifying that it's non case-sensitive
replace by putting the I there
so if you wanted to allow underscore you
simply just add underscores in there you
want to allow comma you just put a comma
in there that will allow it in the
string but if you don't want it just
make sure you allow just numbers and
letters and dot okay so that takes care
of filtering the file name now let's say
you want to not filter the file name but
replace it altogether and rename the
file so what you do is go under here
after you get your file extension from
the kaboom array you can easily use that
extension now to help you rename the
file so you put the file name variable
there because we're about to change it
now to something new I'll show you how
to make it a number that will more than
likely never be used twice within your
system so first we'll put the time stamp
which generates a number for today then
you add to that or concatenate to that
the rand function which will give you a
random number then add to that the
string of dot and then add to that your
file extension finally so what that will
give you is a nice number let's put a
semicolon on the end here what that will
give you is a nice number because times
because time generates the number that's
a timestamp for today Rand generates a
random number then you just put the dot
and the file extension back on to the
file name so what that will do is
effectively rename the file with a nice
long number that will probably never be
used twice within your system because
you're adding time plus Rand does that
make sense so it uses time and Rand to
generate a whole bunch of numbers that
won't be used twice within my system the
likelihood of two numbers being
duplicated using this method is I don't
know the chances are very very very very
very very low that it would occur now
I'm going to comment that out because
I'm not going to use it but you guys can
opt to use that kind of method I'm going
to use this filtering method where I
just remove everything but letters
numbers and the dot if there's multiple
dots in the file name that's still no
problem because we're using the
end function on the kaboom array to just
grab the file extension so having
multiple dots in the file name won't
hurt anything</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
