tutorial you can learn the simplified
logic behind alternating colors of table
rows list elements new lines or any
element that you require alternating
styles for but first let's take a look
at what this lesson code will render to
the page here I am viewing it in Chrome
and you can see that we have alternating
styles on those table rows it's very
simple to achieve that using css3 child
not sure how you pronounce that
it's mm mm all right so this can be done
for list elements paragraphs where you
want to create a visual alternation
between every other line okay now let's
get to the code and I'll have this code
available for copy/paste so you guys
don't have to type anything out really
in the video and the videos are going to
be very short and quick because this is
so easy you can see I have my doctype my
HTML tag starts right here and it ends
all the way down there and then my head
tag starts here ends there and then my
body tag starts here and ends there you
can see I have a simple one little
simple table in my body tag expand this
information here so you can see the
whole table sitting there you can see I
just have table Row 1 2 3 and 4 for rows
each one has one column and you can see
that it has a class set of my table so
let's go ahead and collapse that back up
because we don't really need to look at
that code now let's take a look at the
CSS and I'll explain the CSS to you
pretty in-depth the child logic anyway
because that's really the point of this
lesson is to demonstrate the child
selector css3 these first two rules are
really not part of the logic that makes
the alternating styles for the table
rows that would be right here but I
added these two just to style my table
up a little bit so it doesn't look so
bland so you see I have border like gray
border around all the cells padding set
and things like that this is all very
simple we have a width set on the table
of 100% and the border is collapsed see
if I remove that border collapse and I
run it you'll see that is division the
separations
within the cells which I didn't want you
might want that but I didn't want that
so I put a border collapse then in my
table TD tags which are all these little
guys in there those are all being styled
with a padding of eight pixels and the
border color that I wanted so that way
they have a nice gray border that goes
around everything see you can make that
any color you want and thickness now the
reason why I'm using a table that's set
up with all CSS styling is because html5
deprecating all of the table attributes
that were used to so if those are all
being deprecated you really can't use
the alignment or padding or anything
that you're used to using you can put a
style tag in here or a style attribute
rather and then just style it up but you
can't use any of the like the old guys
like a line that's getting deprecated
what else is there there's I think
there's be a line
that one's deprecated the horizontal
line is deprecated the way you set
padding on the table if you go to table
padding the cell padding and cell
spacing those are deprecated so I just
wanted to mention that real quick
because a lot of you guys might be
saying oh I don't want to just put table
padding right there in the table you
really can't for html5 okay finally
let's take a good look at the CSS that
renders the logic for the alternating
styles in the table what we do is we put
the class name my table then we put a
space and then the tags that we want to
affect or the elements that we want to
affect within this logic and that would
be the TR the table row then we're using
the child pseudo class selector of css3
and we're assigning an even value here
you can set up your values like this
using numbers and that way you can
assign any number you want here like if
you wanted that to be four or whatever
or you can just put the word even it
accepts the word even also as a value
there this one is equal to odd so I was
just putting the numbers in it so you
guys can see how the numeric values
would be set up and you can use any
numbers that you want in there
so I'm going to just put odd you'll see
that when I render out I'm going to have
the same results you see alternating
table rows by even and odd or you can
leave the numbers in place and play with
them a little bit change those numbers
up and you'll see all the results that
you get but if you just want the simple
way to alternate every other row then
you can just use even odd it makes
things really simple so we use entailed
with even and odd to set up the
alternating rows or alternating list
elements alternating paragraphs lines
whatever you doing I'll have this code
available for you guys to copy and paste
if you want okay we'll see you in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
