number three this lesson you will learn
how to use PHP header function to set
the content type to JSON use PHP file
get contents to read a static JSON file
and make PHP echo JSON data back to your
Ajax request so your Ajax request is now
going to call a dot PHP file rather than
a dot JSON file we're going to resume
with the same exact files that we left
off with in lesson number two we have
JSON tutorial two that HTML and my list
JSON so just make sure you have those
two open and ready to start so we'll
take JSON tutorial two and save as JSON
tutorial three save now we can close
JSON tutorial two and in JSON tutorial
three all we have to do is change this
to a PHP extension dot PHP and we'll
change the name of it - my underscore
JSON underscore list dot PHP this way
you can begin to make your JSON data
come back to your applications
dynamically now press ctrl s to save
JSON tutorial 3 that HTML let's
highlight the name of this PHP file ctrl
C let's go to file new just create a new
PHP file for yourself and if you're in
Dreamweaver you can just remove all of
that data and press ctrl s you're going
to press ctrl V to save it as my
underscore JSON list save and now you
have my underscore JSON underscore list
dot PHP the first thing we'll do is put
our opening PHP tag then we'll close
that few lines down now the first thing
we want to do is make sure that the
browser and the application that is
going to be fed this data knows that
this is JSON data and this is a JSON
application instead of being a PHP
script we want to trick the browser to
believe that it's a JSON file so to do
that we can use the same method that we
used in the PHP and MySQL video
tutorials discover Magic XML we can
probably scoop up this one right here
because XML and JSON are very similar
type of technologies so let's see let's
click on this script I clicked on
discover magic XML MySQL PHP vector
player and now here's the script and see
that header
I want that first line so I'm going to
take that line and I'm going to pop it
right in there and actually you don't
have to go to develop PHP and grab that
you can just type it right in but I just
wanted to show you guys it developed PHP
we showed a whole lot of different ways
that you can make your XML technology a
little bit more dynamic by integrating
PHP and MySQL into it we're going to be
doing the same exact thing with you
regarding JSON showing you how to make
it magical by blending PHP and MySQL
with it now you simply want to change
the content type to the same content
type that our Ajax request is using
application JSON so instead of text XML
you're going to put application slash
JSON so what that does is it effectively
lets the browser know and the target
application that's requesting data from
this while it lets those things know
that this is official JSON data because
some applications might not accept a dot
PHP extension to be processed through
the application so this is a good way to
ensure that the application or the
browser understands that this is JSON
data and the application can go ahead
and parse it just like it was a dot JSON
file now in the very next line let's
just create a new variable and let's
call it JSON data and let's make that
equal to single quote single quote
semicolon and then open up my list JSON
file that we made in the second tutorial
press ctrl C highlight all of the data
within that file press ctrl C go back to
your PHP script just paste it in between
the two single quotes there then under
that you're going to echo the JSON data
variable press ctrl s and you're done
now what you want to do is FTP my JSON
list PHP along with JSON tutorial 330ht
mell up to you live web server because
this won't work on your local machine ok
here are the live results from JSON
tutorial number two so let's just put a
three in this place where the two was
and run that script and we should get
the same exact output you see it's JSON
tutorial three you can see clearly that
we're requesting a dot PHP file and that
PHP file is handling the data returned
so what does that mean that means you
can use this PHP script to access the
database you can pull random things out
of your database you can use this PHP
script to pull a folder full of images
dynamically but all you have to do
really with PHP is point to a folder and
you can just dynamically pull all of the
images sitting in the boulder without
knowing how many are there with their
names or anything and you can make an
image gallery out of it really any kind
of structured data interchange and data
handling that you want to happen between
the server and the client side of your
application I'll show you one more
little trick let's remove all the
content within the JSON data variable
and since we have my list dot JSON
sitting on the server I'm going to show
you how to use PHP to get the file
contents so remove those two single
quotes and type in file underscore yet
underscore contents open closed
parenthesis the semicolons already in
place so within the parentheses let's
type in double quote double quote and
within our double quotes let's type in
my list dot JSON so what are we doing
here we're telling PHP to get file
contents of my list JSON and pack it
into a variable called JSON data then
we're going to echo that data back to
our application so this shows you how
you can actually work with static JSON
files and as some of you guys know if
you're a little advanced in PHP PHP can
manipulate JSON data and PHP can also
write vials dynamically so you could
manipulate some JSON data within your
PHP script and then rewrite the static
JSON file to where it holds new updated
information but we'll get to those
things in later
now let's press ctrl s and make sure we
FTP this backup to our live so ever make
sure you have my list JSON still sitting
there from the last tutorial on your
server because our PHP script is going
to try and get its contents okay and
just so we can see that things are
changing let's remove a few of these
from our list let's make it to where
there's only seven users here and let's
make sure we get rid of this last comma
because there should be no trailing
comma on that last little object alright
press ctrl s now FTP everything up so
let's refresh JSON tutorial three HTML
and there you go
pete is 18 lives in italy so you can see
in our my list JSON file
they had pete 18 from italy was the last
little object in there alright so now
you know how to make PHP appear to be
json to the browser software and the
application that's requesting the data
and there's really an endless amount of
things that you can do once you have PHP
and MySQL mixed into the game and we're
going to go much further with it we'll
show you guys how to do a post mechanism
a post ajax mechanism and send a dynamic
variable that way you can have a dynamic
variable be sent with your ajax request
and affect the way that the PHP file
would get its data whatever the variable
might be incoming from Ajax into your
PHP script here that's how the PHP
script will know maybe how to query the
database pull files out of the file
system read folder contents and things
like that it makes the whole process a
lot more dynamic when you start using
your Ajax request to post dynamic
variables because right now we're just
using the get method and actually you
can also use the get method to send
dynamic URL variables over the headers
so but we'll use post as a more official
way to post dynamic data to the PHP
script to have the PHP script react
differently in a dynamic sense okay
we'll see you in part 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
