creating our actionscript 3 mp3 scroll
view and click playlist player it's XML
configured let's take a look at what we
have this one we've added graphic
equalizer it jumps to the beat any song
is playing we're getting creative now
with it
and if you'd never see my beautiful face
here's me look how pretty I am now with
the player you'll have equalizer I have
speakers on mine nice boombox speakers
check them out now I'm going to show you
how to make an equalizer sort of like
this thing I've already shown how to do
the speakers and everything with a boom
box tutorial but now I'm going to show
how to do a custom graphic equalizer
like this one and we're going to add it
to this bad boy farts in the way end or
already let's open this Fla this is one
that we left off with par 5 add to it
going to i'm on scene one here CM
double-click inside of the whole player
my whole player movie clip sitting right
there double-click inside now let's uh
what are we going to do we got to put a
skin before we can put the eq in we got
to put a skin so let's put a layer at
the bottom add new layer name its skin
then do any kind of design you want for
your skin i'm going to make one right
now real quick okay i have a skin that
I'm happy with and I'm going to what it
is just a movie clip inside of it is a
rectangle and as a filter effect on it
we open this Fla if you download my
source files you'll see what I have
going on there now I'm going to take the
list and position it somewhere where it
seems like a good spot I'm going to take
the stop button and let's put that over
here under that maybe we'll add some
more controls like a play maybe a
play/pause toggle type button and
forward and back buttons the forward and
back buttons will probably be the
trickiest part of the application
because they'll have to maneuver this
list now we have a lot of room here see
a lot of room for graphic equalizer for
you to put thumbnails whatever you want
to do there what I'm going to do is that
graphic equalizer to this location
I'm a amplitude junkie I'm going to make
this a solid black and give it an edge
of a light color so it looks like it
stands out as a window there let's make
that maybe 1.5 to give it a nice smooth
edge okay it's beautiful so that's the
window that our eq will display through
okay now what I'm going to do is make
about 20 little bars let's get this edge
off completely and I'm going to make
these what color should we go with I'll
figure that out later right now i'm just
going to make them white no roundness
and the height maybe four I don't know I
might make the height different let's
get that at even coordinates make sure
the little window is and the skin so the
skin is at coordinates 20 3.3 i'm going
to put its solid 2003 solid 121 it
doesn't matter where you have these
things position than they're everything
will work correctly okay so there's one
little bar ctrl c ctrl shift well let's
make sure it's even coordinates first I
don't like those uneven coordinates
which will see ctrl shift V to paste in
place copy paste in place give those a
little separation there it looks good
then you can just go ctrl c ctrl shift v
keep moving them to where the spaced
apart correctly or you can highlight all
together if you think they're not
spaced-apart correctly and go to modify
a line and distribute your Heights that
will make all of them have the exact
spacing they need so I'm going to fill
this up to wherever many it needs I'm
going to try and land on 10 or 20 a good
even number like that
10 or 20 little bars alrighty I decided
to go with 10 bars 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 yep
10 bars and they're spaced apart pretty
good that way what I'm going to do is
add some glow to this to these effects
the graphic equalizer bars so I don't
want them exactly right on top of each
other because when i add the glow you
might not see the separations that will
and i want to have distinct visual
separations and all those bars now just
take a look at this thing let's press
control enter it's pretty cool so far
it's looking good let's continue so i'm
going to highlight all of these bad boys
don't highlight that window back there
just all those i'm going to right click
convert to symbol i'm going to call it
bars eq bars now go movie clip
registration top left is good okay now
we can duplicate that ctrl c ctrl shift
v as many times it's needed just give
those some space as well maybe we'll go
with 1205 maybe or maybe there should be
an even number I don't even know let's
go with 63 for the right three for the
left channel so we have three for the
right channel 34 the left channel and
that's how we'll program hey look at
that they fit all in there perfectly
it'd be a good idea at this point to
separate the layer so we'll do is right
above skin insert layer and call it eq
grab all of those eq bar movie clips
also excel them control x go on to the
eq layer ctrl shift be ok now we're
going to do is double-click inside of
one of these bar eq movie clips and
we're going to adjust its inner timeline
and since it's all the same movie clip
all six of these if we adjust won all
six would adhere to those changes so
let's go inside and you can see here we
have all ten of those little bars what
we're going to do is make mmm let's
insert ten key frames let's go to
insert keyframe well that didn't work
rule let's press f6 this is probably a
way you can just insert keyframes
automatically all the way through there
but I'm an idiot and I don't know how
and I'm sure a thousand of you are going
to tell me hey hey play what a moment
okay so what we'll do is we'll make sure
that this corresponding amount of bars
for amount of frames you can do this
with 50 frames and 50 bars if you want
it but that'd be a little extreme or you
can make really thin bars make a nice
detailed one so what I'm going to do is
on each frame i'm going to remove that
many bars to it there's only that many
showing corresponding to the what frame
number it's on to watch this only should
be one on that frame on this frame there
should only be two on this frame there
should only be three I'm going to do
that all the way up okay I'm all done
setting it up look that's what you have
there so frames one through ten you have
a nice bar that's going to go up and
down let's insert a new layer right
above go to that first keyframe there
press f9 or open your actions panel by
going the window actions type in stop
action that is a stop action we do that
so this thing just doesn't keep going on
wild by itself and looping we want to
control this time line with the sound
amplitude of the song playing so let's
go back into my whole player clip and
now we can program these things to be
tied to the sound amplitude and make
them have different heights that they
will reach and be tied to different
channels to left in the right channel
but I think a smarter way to do it would
be to put left channel right channel
left channel right channel left channel
right channel that way the bars won't be
so even as they bump up and down okay
here's the important part is giving them
instance names
and if you want let's add the glow
effect all right now before we do that
let's go to filters plus sign put glow
I'm going to put a white glow in mind
let's make it high quality glow or maybe
medium now let's give them the instance
names so let's go to the properties
section of the panel here and the first
one let's say e q bar left one so let's
just copy that let's make this one a
left also eq bar left two and this one
would be a left as well so eq bar left
three now this will be a right eq bar
right and we're naming them left and
right because that's the sound amplitude
that channel it's going to be listened
to the left and right channel which have
different amplitudes if the songs are
set up right by this own creator which
most r eq bar right that should be one
this one is eq bar right to this one is
eq bar right 3 and that's it now they
have instance names now we get to the
code let's highlight frame 3 where the
bulk of our applications code is go to
the bottom hit enter and here is the
code so I'm starting at line 53 now
watch how easy this is so all we have is
54 through 61 it doesn't even need to be
that many really but it's only going to
be powering to eq bars at the moment let
me explain the code to you and then I'll
add the rest of the other eq bars the
law makes sense to you after I explain
it so what happens is we set an inter
frame event and what that does is it
sets gives you a way to loop code or
animations over the time that the frame
is accessed so if we're running 30
frames per second each one of these
frames will get hit 10 times a second I
do believe so 10 times a second this on
into frame event is going to fire off
now let's look at the code in action
before I explain to you what's happening
inside of the on into frame function
that fires off on inter frame event so
every 10 seconds this code happens I'm
sorry 10 times the second this code
happens I think correct me if i'm wrong
i'm at 30 frames per second and there's
three frames so let's go to control in
to see what it does nice huh
exactly to the beat alrighty now what's
driving that is you can see we put the
instance name for the EQ bar that we
want to power with the code go to and
stop usually you see on a movie clip my
movie clip go to and stop brain 3 so
basically that's what I'm doing here but
I'm just using code or math to get to
the exact brain that I want I multiply
the left peak and the right peak by 10
because that's the amount of frames
that's in my EQ bar see so when it's
maxed out it'll go all the way up to 10
which shows here it's perfect now i'm
going to set the rest up for the other
four bars with four more lines here now
i have all six of the lines that i need
to power all six of those eq bars and
what i want to do let's take a look at
it and you'll see why there's a problem
if you leave it exactly like this i'm
going to explain this math to you in
just a second actually i'll explain to
you right now what we're doing is saying
math dot round which is essentially
rounding the number that we attained
from taking the left channel peak and
and multiplying it by 10 we're taking
that number left channel p multiplied by
10 and we're rounding it that's all it's
doing so we're saying go to and stop
booming we're making it hit a certain
frame number inside the movie clip
alright so now let's take a look you'll
see that there's three sets of bars that
are all the same jumping exactly the
same which is not good we want some
variation in there so we can just adjust
the math in that case all the movie
clips can stay the same so let's say we
want the last two to be kind of high
peaks and then let's make this one a
seven let's make this 1a
on all five make this one a six and this
one and eight and there there's your
variation
and you can set up a wave anyway you
want to look like an actual equalizer
wave but I think that's cool that's not
bad maybe make this one go a little
higher but you can adjust those values
to make them do whatever you want put
this 17 as well and understand that the
left and right peaks are different so
you can get a good bit of variation out
of it alrighty so that pretty much wraps
it up for making the equalizer you can
see it looks pretty decent its operating
well it's nice and big on my player you
can make your player any size you need
any skin you need any kind of buttons
you want we'll go a little bit further
with this if you guys are interested let
me know if you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
