tutorial I'm gonna teach you how to rip
up packages and cut classes there's a
lot of times will you run into code
online and in the ActionScript 3 help
file that's wrapped in package and
classes and it doesn't work in the
timeline I'm going to teach you how to
adapt it to work in your timeline so we
press flash ActionScript 3 project and
now we have a new project here and what
we'll do is open the help file and like
we were a beginner looking for code and
there's a package right there but what
I'll do is I'll type in package it's
already typed in I'll type it in and
I'll press search it'll be a whole bunch
of examples in here and the one I'll
choose is the one they they set up the
example in the help file for scrolling
text in a text field in ActionScript 3
so you'll notice that here's all the
text and I'm going to press C to copy it
and you'll see it says the following
example creates a text field that is set
in the size you contains more text in
the field can display at one time as the
user clicks on the text field this text
Scrolls vertically alright great
thanks for the help flash help file and
then you go and you put it in your time
line so I put all that code in my time
line that they told me to
let me make sure many cases and yep
let's see if it works it's publish out
oh no I get errors see what they say
packages cannot be nested so as a
beginner you don't know what the hell to
do with that you're just like okay
packages cannot be nested so let's
remove the package so we move the
opening bracket and let me show you what
I did I remove the opening bracket and
the package and the closing bracket for
the package let's remove that now let's
run the code press f12 oh darn it I get
more errors now it says the public
attribute cannot be used outside of the
package or if the public attribute can
only be used inside of a package so what
you do is you remove the public anywhere
it says public you remove that
now let's run it again another ever
let's take care of that when classes
must not be nested okay let's go in
let's get rid of the class let's cut
that class right out of there now let's
run the code says the private attributes
may only be used on class property
definitions interesting so private
anywhere it says private remove that and
it'll tell you each time when you render
out the errors will tell you what you
should do or what you should try and
remove and so now we have the privates
out now publishing and here is the
results it's just totally blank what
what the hell am I supposed to do with
that I'll tell you what you're supposed
to do with that you go back in the flash
you look at the code real good you need
you realize that there's a function here
that tells the text field to display so
let's take that function with the
opening and closing parentheses there
ctrl C go down to the very bottom of the
script press control V and then put a
semicolon after now press f12 booyah
baby now you can see now I can use their
example for easily scrolling tech
scrolling any text I want in flash and
you can see that inside of the file that
text line is right here hello world and
welcome to my show it's really nice
butter pepper butter bath and when on
the page you'll see there's all that
text hello world and welcome to to the
show and it lets you easily scroll the
text the users mouse just goes inside
the box and they scroll their wheel so
that's an easy way to scroll text
there's a little tutorial for you and
this toriel is really based about around
ripping up packages and cutting classes
that's how you do it
you have any questions need any help
we'll format developed PHP where we talk
about code and geeky stuff like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
