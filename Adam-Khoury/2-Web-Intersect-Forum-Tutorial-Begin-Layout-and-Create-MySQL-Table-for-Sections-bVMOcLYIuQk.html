develop PHP calm here once again with
part two of our little tutorial series
on building custom forms into your
website before i even create the forums
directory or start setting up the layout
that I want the forums to have I want to
mention one thing to you guys you can
have your forums be in the main
directory of your website along with
your home page and everything like that
since it's not going to be many files
that powers it I'm going to choose to
put mine in a separate directory that
way it can be more of something that can
just be plugged in by people with
various types of websites but you can
have it in its own directory like I'm
going to set it up and it reflects your
layout of your site exact for instance
here at web intersect I can make my
forums have this exact layout just like
I have it at develop PHP com if you
click the forums it has the same layout
with all my menus and header bar and
everything all the way through the
forums even when you're viewing forum
topics put in the web intersect website
I'm going to have a button up here that
says forums and when you click that it's
not going to look like this directory
does not going to have that header bar
it's not going to have their profile
links or anything like that it's going
to be a whole separate directory but
we'll still be able to sense when the
users logged in no problem so my point
is you could have your forums be in the
root directory of your website along
with all your other files that are there
now or you can do like I'm going to do
and put it in a separate directory
called forums that way people will have
to get to it like this and that's the
link to the forums that's how we're
going to set it up and I'm going to have
a different header up top but like I
said we'll still be able to sense the
user session variables and all that good
stuff all right I'm going to go here
where the website files are on my
computer system and I'm just going to
put a new folder in
i'm going to call it forum and there's
my forum directory for my web intersect
website i can just minimize that here in
dreamweaver i'm going to create a new
PHP file i'm going to go to file save as
forum index so the index dot PHP saved
into my forearms folder and we'll be
able to see that we go into the forums
folder okay all right now that's the
home page of your forums this is the
page where people will see all the forum
categories that you have now here in
fireworks which is my graphics editing
tool I have a couple of graphics ready
to go this is going to be my header file
my header graphics for my forums this is
going to be a repeating div it's going
to go across the top so working with
this and this repeating div I should
have a pretty nice bar going all the way
across the top it says web intersect
forums so in the file and go right in
here into the body section and actually
if I wanted to look right let's go into
design view let's go into the page
properties put left margin zero let's
make all the margin zero apply and
you'll see what that put as CSS see that
in the body tag or in the body style
definitions you have margin left top
right bottom all 0 you can make those
any numbers you want so in the body tag
let's put it in a dip remove the content
that's in the div I'm going to give that
div a background image which is this
file here and that's going to repeat on
the x-plane so I have to export that
first so I'm going to export this file
and this file as optimized jpg so I'm
going to export them out of fireworks by
going to the export wizard here I'm
going to put them in the style folder
that's going to be in my forums and I'll
show you I'll make that right now inside
the forum folder
new folder style there you go so that's
where I'm going to save those two image
files so now inside of this div I can
simply go to style background image
browse style and I'm going to use that
forum top barbg I'm going to make sure
that has background repeat' set to
repeat x now let's check out the size of
this canvas size was 240 x 160 so really
all I'm interested in is the height the
160 number so back in Dreamweaver set
this height to 160 pixels let's see what
we have in design view ok that's exactly
what I wanted actually I'm going to go
into firework so i'm going to change
this file I don't need all of this let's
get rid of that and that and I'm going
to save this as transparent PNG let's
get the canvas up on it a little bit to
where it's about 150 maybe make sure it
comes down from the top beautiful now
it's file export wizard I'm going to
save this as a PNG with no background
Matt clear PNG export forum header BG
save and now that's the one that I'll
put on top here that way everything will
be real smooth so what I want in here is
a header div that's going to be inside
of this div so I'm going to go into the
code view in this div I'm going to make
sure this has text align of center that
way everything inside of it will be
centered all right now within that dip
we're going to put another div here ok
remove the content this one let's give
this one a style as well with the
background image this PNG file or put
that right on top of that other div or
inside rather
this one also needs a height so let's
make sure we check the height on that
canvas was 900 wide 150 high so we can
go in Dreamweaver and put those
attributes here with was 900 pixels
semicolon and the height was 150 pixels
semicolon save design okay that's what
we have well the text align Center
didn't work out like a plan so I'm going
to div align center that whole div and
that should give me what I want okay so
that's what I have the start off with is
custom header graphics and then i'm
going to start underneath that with page
output now the reason why i put PNG file
up there's now watch when i move this
window around that's a pretty smooth
effect huh that way you don't have
graphics that are cut back there and
making making a funny effect when people
are resizing that window or whatever or
no matter what size it is it'll always
look smooth those head of graphics will
look smooth on there and keep in mind
that you can have any kind of HTML or
flash going on up inside of this div
because remember this is only this
graphics here is only a background for
that div so you can put whatever you
want inside of that div still could be a
table also if you wanted more columns
and rollers inside of any sections going
on up here I might have some links up
top here maybe a link going back to the
main web intersect directory the main
part of the website I can put whatever I
want in that div and here it is this
little box right here I'll just put a
space in it for now so in this page you
don't really need to have a check to see
if somebody is a logged-in member of
your site because you want everybody to
be able to view your forums if you
wanted only members to be able to view
your forums and the topics and
everything then you only want to give
then you'd want to check the sessions
see if they're elongated member of your
sight on this home page of the forums
but most forums operate to where anybody
in the world whether they're logged into
your site or not any visitor can view
any of the forum topics it's only in the
page where you would add a new topic or
reply to some topics where you want to
make sure that people allow them before
you give them certain forms and
abilities to interact but what we do
have to do on this homepage is put some
PHP code to get the forum sections out
of the database we're going to have to
have a little table in the database and
it's going to have to be holding the
forum section titles whatever their ID
is for them and the order that you want
it to display on the page here in the
home page because usually a forum is set
up say like develop PHP's forum for
instance let's go there and look at the
homepage of the forum you see how this
sections these are different forms
within the message board so you click
that one you go into the PHP and MySQL
form you go in this one you go into the
flash form so that's pretty much what
you want on your forums index page the
home page for your forums and we're
going to query those out of the database
you can manually put them in if you want
but we're going to create a system that
holds the forum sections titles and
everything for the forum sections in a
little table in the database all right
let's set up the table that will need to
get started here and we'll call this
forum sections so log into your PHP my
admin software on your server create a
new table on your database let's give it
let's see we need ID in title and we
also need the order really I think all
we need is three fields for now I need
to add more I will press go is a little
button off to the side says go press
that now the first field you want to be
ID second field title third field
ordered because you can't just put the
word order there you'll get an error if
you try and run scripts like that
key term as a field name so make it
ordered or orders orbs order whatever
you want as long as it's not the word
order this one int make sure you make it
primary and click the auto increment
checkbox their title is going to be bar
char with a max of oh no no 64 88
whatever you want and ordered is also
going to be int let's just put a 10 on
that so we're not going to have very
many actually you could have a tool on
that if you want I'll just make it 10
then down at the bottom press save now
insert put in the first section okay so
this is the title of my first section
PHP PHP dynamic scripting help and the
second section is SQL syntax and mysql
database help those will be my first two
forum sections my ordered values are one
of the first section 24 the second one
it's very simple i'm going to press go
okay so you can clearly see what i have
in my forum section stable in my
database so this table is called forum
sections here's my title for my sections
the order that they are to display in
and here's their ID numbers which these
will never change but you can go in and
change these and even make yourself a
little admin panel where you can change
the order of these numbers but we're not
going to go that in depth you can just
go straight into PHP myadmin here and
change these numbers up now with this
dynamic information will go into the
index page and right up top we'll start
a PHP block because we're going to have
to put in a little script here that's
going to access the data in that little
table we just made make us a nice little
list according to what's in it first
thing is connect to your database and
for that you're going to jump one folder
out of the forums directory into the
main directory then go into the scripts
folder and connect to the MySQL dot PHP
file now here's a little query that you
want to
right so we're putting the query into a
little variable called SQL and the query
string is select all from forum sections
order by ordered ascending limit 10
because I only have four sections in my
forum right now so I can limit that to
10 that'll be real safe i get actually
limit that to four but i'm just going to
leave it on 10 case i add a few more
sections now on the next line we're
going to initialize a display list
variable it's just going to be a
container that's going to hold things
for us inside of this while loop so
right here inside of this while loop
we're fetching the array that is the
MySQL output from that query and in each
one we can access the sections ID and
the sections title you put into a little
link that's going to go to a page called
section PHP ID equals section ID so
it'll have a URL variable attached to it
when it goes to that page that way
section dot PHP will know what section
to display and then you slap the section
title in the link word display area that
way that title itself will be a link and
you can set that up to be any kind of
display you want it could be a big give
a little block container whatever you
want but I'm keeping it simple I'm just
going to have a link and then a break
tag maybe even to break tags and to make
this display on the page we just simply
go into the body section where we want
maybe put a couple of line breaks there
echo the display list and that's that
let's see what that does for us okay so
you see what that gives you that gives
you a dynamic list of all the forum
sections that people can go into and
post topics in or help people out inside
of now you can format that any way you
like and I'm going to add a little bit
of CSS to it maybe to bring these things
off of the edge get them centered into a
container in the center of the page
maybe you know you slap ads on the page
through whatever you're going to do but
now you have your dynamic listing of all
your forum sections ready to go you can
see each one has a link
section PHP and its corresponding ID for
that section all right we'll pick up in
part two we will create section PHP will
keep it going in logical sequence here
so when the person clicks that is going
to be a listing of all the topics that
happen to be inside of that section and
you're also going to add a create new
topic or create thread button inside of
that page only for people who are logged
in if anybody clicks to create topic
button that your opportunity to
recommend that they join the site
alright so stay tuned for I say part 2 I
meant part 3 because this was part 2 so
stay tuned for part 3 what will make
section dot PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
