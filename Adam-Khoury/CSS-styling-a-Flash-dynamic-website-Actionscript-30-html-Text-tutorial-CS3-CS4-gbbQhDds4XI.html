bringing this dreamweaver stylesheet
just like any other style sheet you
would have for your HTML website
documents or whatever I'm going to show
you how to bring this into flash cs3
using ActionScript 3 to render it out in
this dynamic text field that we use
render out through code and set the
styles that are in that style sheet and
I also take you from all levels of
understanding how to render the HTML
text if you want to set tags you can see
in the code right here this HTML tags
set in the strings and i'll show you how
to render it out hello in this flash
tutorial i'm going to show you the ins
and outs of CSS in flash using CSS style
definitions in flash text fields HTML
text fields in flash and this one comes
courtesy of Clint longtime member
develop PHP he says I'm interested in
CSS in flash can we get some guidance or
some examples of how to set this up I'm
familiar with HTML and CSS but I can't
grasp the flash and CSS concept i have a
few books on the subject but they seem
to be for advanced programmers i need an
example to look at and then i can take
it from there Thanks yep we can set you
up with that no problem I can show you
what I'm going to show you is the some
complex things you working with an
external file and also the basics of it
just popping CSS and HTML straight into
your text field strings straight into
the strings that are going to populate
the you know the words that are going to
populate your text fields you can pop
the CSS HTML right in and this is in
flash actionscript 3 if you're an
ActionScript to working in flash 8 this
won't work for you you might have to
retro code it translate it back okay so
let's get started here I have a new
actionscript-3 file in flash cs3 and you
can be in cs4 it'll all work the same
and first thing we're going to do is I
set my stage 2 550 x 240 and that's all
I've done so far and now i'm going to go
to let's just open up Dreamweaver i have
CS dreamweaver cs4 or two but i like
using dreamweaver 8 i'm stuck on it ok
so i'm going to create a new CSS and now
we get rid of that first line and let's
set up the style definition for the P
tags like we wouldn't normally in a
normal HTML document so there's the beat
Agnes and let's go ahead and sit a few
things like let's just go ahead and do
this and these things will come down
automatically you press enter from the
first curly bracket or curly brace let's
see let's set the font
family where is that font family did it
all right set the font family too vered
an or whatever you want you guys know
how to work in CSS and we'll set the
bond sighs so let's go to fo to see 24
make it nice and big and let's set the
font weight as well
to kind of thick not exactly bold but
almost bold maybe 700 okay and now we'll
make a style definitions for the or
attributes and values or a couple of
custom classes that we want to create so
we'll say my text style one sounds like
a good name let's give that its opening
and closing tag and let's make another
one put a dot my text style oops too
and you can just fast-forward through
all this if you already know how to set
up your style attributes and values in
classes
okay so now let's just probably one in
here so we'll go up to the first curly
bracket there presenter and all the
options will come down and we'll just
set the color and we'll make this first
one ring then the second style custom
style class we're going to make that
color red nice dark red and then also
let's make let's make it bold let's go
to font weight fold it out okay that's
it so that there's a style sheet and
let's go ahead and save it to the
desktop and let's call it detected at my
style sheet stylesheet my style sheets
CSS will be the name save it so since
that's on the desktop it's good save
this flash file there too so it's in the
same directory so we connect to that CSS
file let's say this one as desktop CSS
style name it as3 actionscript-3 CSS
external file look dokie now like I said
towards the end of the video you'll see
they're really easy just pop pop and CSS
straight into your your text field
string but I'm going to first show you
how to bring in that external style
sheet so you can use all the styles that
you would have defined in there which
might make life easier for you so the
first thing we're going to do is
highlight key frame one there and press
f9 open the actions panel we're going to
type in bar CSS loader and seriously if
you want the real easy methods just go
towards the end where I'm talking about
how to just pop it in and you're seeing
where I writing in this code where I'm
writing the string that would be in your
text field but if you want to know how
to do it all dynamically in the dorky
coder way this is how now let's a colon
and this is a URL loader because we're
going to load the CSS from a URL
wherever it is on the server is a bar
and here we're going to put in our text
string for the this is where you'll see
how I pop in the Styles string equals
and let's go ahead and double quote
double quote and inside we're going to
put a P tag remember we set it p style
attributes in our external CSS file so
now we can use them here paragraph let's
just say paragraph style in the external
CSS file and then that one's ready to go
with close up the P tag there and now
we'll say we're going to add to this you
know how you add other string segments
to a text field here you can just type
in whatever you want blood river and it
would pop it onto the end of that so
what I'm going to do is just go down a
line so we can keep it all in view here
but normally you would you would add it
like that okay so the next one wants to
be let's just make this one a regular
line that way you can see the difference
is regular line of ticks not styled
there then we'll go down one more put
another plus sign keep adding to this
thing spring our semicolon that closes
the string down we'll put it back on the
end when we're finished and this one
we're going to say span and now we're
going to add those class those custom
classes that we created the span class
equals
and here we're going to add single
quotes one single quote my style oops my
text style we named it one and then
close it with a single quote and then
closed off your bracket and then you can
put your whatever sentence you want
right here and then you close off the
span bracket now you're the span nest
and right here we'll just type in an
actual sentence will say this is can't
type today this is style one from
external CSS now let's just take that
copy the whole line go down one line
paste and so we'll just say my style to
in this class definition and then to
tipped up right here we'll just say this
to this is style to from external okay
now we have the string set up and let's
go ahead and close the semicolon off
back here that closes off the string
like I said normally these would all be
in one long line but you can set it up
like this and it still works okay so now
we're going to set up the variable
that's going to make a text field
magically and dynamically onstage
remember i told you i'm going to show
you the dorky way and i'm going to show
you the manual way then all the easy
stuff and break it all down by the end
we'll really delve into how it all works
the logic of it but first i want to show
you the you know the complex methods in
case you're you're after those and you
might be thinking hey why didn't you
show the easy stuff first i don't know i
think i think it's better if you see
these kind of methods before you
presented with these first before you go
into the manual methods because you
might like the dynamic
you know external methods a whole lot
better and then you'll have you'll be a
more powerful coder that way too okay
okay so through the magic of video
editing I've typed in all the rest of my
code with lightning speed so quickly you
couldn't even see me typing it and so
and I'm just going to go ahead and
describe what's happening in line 7
through 24 here since you last saw me
typing line 5 okay so what we're doing
is proclaiming a function here that's
CSS loadcomplete and it's just like it
explains in the function name this fires
off the stuff happens when the external
CSS file here is completely loaded in
and it's ready to be displayed or used
within the interface and so what happens
inside of that function is we set the
bar for the new style sheet and then it
has a name of sheep and then she we set
the par CSS data method to the CSS
loader and then which is this URL loader
here and then the my text field is
that's going to be rendered here which
is already rendered on stage actually
before this function runs is set to
style sheet and it equals the stylesheet
here so it's set to have a style sheet
on it in this line that's what that line
does the text field that's going to be
rendered out now the text field also
gets another line attribute that sets
the HTML rendering on it just the same
as if you had a text field on stage and
you set to render as HTML which I'll
show you how to do in a second but
that's all that does right there it
makes it all the code inside of the
string here these tags if it will make
them render as HTML so you won't see
those tags it'll display them as it
would in an HTML document it's really
cool so here we have on line 15
setting the variable for the text field
the dorky way like I was talking about
rendering your text field dynamically
that's all that's doing it makes a new
text field magically makes it have a
width of five hundred percent makes it
multi-line makes it have word wrap and
then we add it to stage by using an ADD
child method and then line twenty we set
up the URL request that actually brings
in the external CSS sheet then we set
the loader for the URL request and we
set the add event listener but when it's
completely loaded in and there's our
function that fires off here bang
remember so when when stylesheets loaded
in function fires off sets up the text
field and then the text field is already
set displayed on stage and then it gets
its attributes a second later that's how
it works a split second later and if
it's not fast if it doesn't work fast
enough for you that way you can change
where the code is and maybe make it even
leaner and meaner than I made it and and
faster make it process faster or just
process smarter I don't know if this is
the best way to set up this is the way
I've set it up and let's see what we get
now let's press control let's just
render it in the browser okay so you can
see it's adhering to the stylesheet but
we don't want it like that we want those
lines to have brakes so what's cool
about is you just go in add HTML
straight to this thing anyway you want
so we want to break here so you just put
be our space forward slash and then
close the tag grab that control C make
sure there's one here put a line break
and then one here now the paragraph tag
makes a line break automatically by
itself we're going to add an extra space
sea booya there it is remember in the
style sheet we made our red text bold
green text didn't have any boldness set
on it and you can see that here and
those things are being colored from the
external CSS file made in Dreamweaver
which is pretty cool stuff now I'll tell
you about making this stuff manually now
and you know maybe I'm equipment a quick
method of working with CSS if you were
just out to throw a couple of HTML HTML
tags inside of your your flash dynamic
text field i'm sorry i just turned
retarded all of a sudden ok so let's get
a text field a dynamic text field and
let's name it what was it my text field
so now that it has this instance name
that it needs the code to connect to it
let's make it bigger let's make sure it
has all the proper settings on it let's
make it render the HTML it doesn't have
to be selectable make sure it's
multi-line and I think that's about it
that should render it ok so now with
that if we go into our code see this is
the manual method now for bringing in
external styles you can just not just
get rid of all of this let's see where
is it
I text to my text stream there it is
right there so yeah we don't need any of
this you can block all that out it cuts
off like six lines of code five lines of
code let's see if it works same thing
see so that would be a manual method and
you can embed the text to make it really
clean and look good right here set the
embed the uppercase lowercase numerals
punctuation and that makes your dynamic
tech field text fields not look the text
look pixelated looks a little smoother
okay so that was that method and then if
you wanted to not even bring in a style
sheet you just do this and you would
have to just set your colors and stuff
in here oops I'm a dummy
let's get rid of everything except that
one line that you need that sinks the
string into the text field on stage and
see there you go see how it's rendering
the break tags and the P tag so all you
would have to do is set the styles in
here that you normally would in an HTML
or CSS document so that's pretty much
how it all works and if you didn't if
you wanted even yeah actually you could
do away with this and just put this here
no loader wouldn't need that my text
field text that HTML
how does that go HTML HTML lowercase no
stain it's got to be it there it is okay
let's see what happens see there's the
leanest method say so I show I told you
I would take you from the most complex
to the most simple and that is what I
have done like my work here is done I'm
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
