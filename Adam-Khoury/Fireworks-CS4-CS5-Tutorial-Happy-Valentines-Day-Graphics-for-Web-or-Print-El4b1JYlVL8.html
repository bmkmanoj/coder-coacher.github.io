today we're going to instruct more adobe
fireworks design work well so everybody
can see what an easy and powerful tool
that is for web design print design logo
design as well as any illustrations that
you want to make this little simple
illustration here is what we'll be
showing you how to create from scratch
so the first thing we'll do is get a new
file going I'm going to make mine eight
hundred by five hundred you can make
yours any size you want and any
resolution you like when you're dealing
with print design you might want to up
this resolution when you're dealing with
web design seventy-two is just fine
press okay so now I have a blank black
canvas eight hundred by five hundred I'm
going to bring up my properties bar and
the first thing I'll do is get the
rectangle that will be the kind of like
a background so I'm going to go to
gradient radial or that rectangle and
change it from white right there
to red maybe even a little darker red
and I can position this radial to be
anywhere I like on that rectangle that I
just put in place I'm going to keep it
right there in Center for now I'm
probably going to move that rectangle up
a little bit but I can stay flexible
with that I'm going to put down the
rectangle on the bottom now and this is
going to have a radial gradients as well
of red I'm going to put the light focus
point to be right at the top this one
I'm going to make just a bit darker
there we go bring this one up I'm going
to make it a little bit taller so it
kind of matches the other one I have
going there I'm going to make the main
heart in the center I'm going to show
you how to draw out a custom heart using
the pen tool which if you're using
fireworks you just go into the shapes
and drag out a heart and there it is and
then you can manipulate that but I'll
show you how to do a custom because
that's how we roll
so now let's grab the pen tool and with
the pen tool you can give it any fill
you want any border color you want I'm
just going to leave it with a fill of
bright red now click down in the center
I'm going to draw out maybe like an ear
shape so I'm going to click down there
click down here and hold and drag
click down here hold and drag a little
bit then I'm going to click down right
about there and then right here I'm grab
the sub selection tool and I'm going to
move this point 90 degrees and you can
zoom in on your scene by holding ctrl
and mouse wheel in and out so you want
to make sure that that line you saw how
mine was off like that a little bit so I
want that blind to be 90 degrees because
I'm going to copy that control C control
V now I just put a copy of it right on
top of the tail now I can go up here to
flip horizontal and just make sure they
meet up in the center so right when I
see they meet up and there's no line in
the center I can go to modify combine
paths and Union so that's how you can
get custom symmetrical designs that are
even perfectly even on both sides
you just make half of it draw a straight
line up the center copy flip it over and
you have a perfectly symmetrical thing
it could be a face that you're drawing
maybe some any kind of shape that you
would need to be perfectly symmetrical
on both sides now the reason why I
showed how to do that with the pen tool
custom like that and not use the hearts
that's right in the shapes library is
because I wanted to give you guys a more
hands-on education in fireworks so you
can create your own custom graphics when
you need to that sometimes you'll need
to create a face of something that has
symmetrical ears and symmetrical chin
and it's not a heart so that's why some
people might be beefing at me right now
more introduced cool the shapes library
pull out a heart you stupid you stupid
you don't even know fireworks and you're
trying to teach it yeah I know fireworks
and I know what's in the symbols
libraries okay so let me along I just
wanted to show people how to do this
custom they might have other things they
want to apply that know how to like
drawing a head the shape of ears and
chin and the head it's very hard to do
that perfectly symmetrical on both sides
all you have to do is half of it flip it
over
Union and you're done now I'm going to
make this thing the size I want for the
gold piece or the actual bright metal
gold put it right about there on this
surface down here this rectangle surface
right about there looks good I can make
that a little bigger because that's
going to be the main focus of the
illustration
I'm going to give it a color the best I
can of gold that looks on the money to
me now what I'm going to do is bevel
that bevel and emboss inner bevel I'm
going to leave it flat I'm going to make
sure this is all the way up on the
softness bring up the width just a
little bit all right now I'm going to
give that an edge of this dark Goldy
looking brown color thing okay so now
all you have to do is press ctrl-c
ctrl-v make a copy of that get rid of
that inner bevel I'm going to remove the
fill so it's just a border so there it
has a border of three I'm going to make
it a little bit smaller so it fits
inside of that other one so you just
play with it until you get it desired
size that you want so I'm going to give
that an edge if maybe four then I'm
going to bevel that as well bevel and
emboss inner bevel I'm going to make
that smooth bring that all the way up
that all the way up and that all the way
up so you can see you're ready there's
the light the way our bevel is set it
looks like the light would be up here
and shining down this way so you want to
make sure that you keep aware of that
with all of the lighting effects that
you might put on things now I'm going to
take that one that's just the edge I'm
going to press ctrl-c ctrl-v I'm going
to put a red fill on it dark red I'm
going to remove the edge this time the
edge is kind of independent of this
other one and you can grab this one
that's just that Brown edge and make it
fatter if you like see is making fat
they're skinny as you want now that's a
little too fat and if you have trouble
grabbing any of this stuff you can just
go into your layers
whenever you highlight something you can
see it light up here so I'll highlight
this if I want to lock that so make sure
I can get to that heart behind there I
can do that just by locking it there so
now when I click down I'm surely going
to grab that one that's just the outline
let's bring that back down to a
reasonable number
okay let's unlock that red one and let's
highlight it I'm going to remove that
bevel now let's highlight that one press
ctrl-c ctrl-v so there's a perfect copy
of it right on top of itself see but
don't move it leave it where it is this
one you're going to give a gradient of
linear and it already has the colors
that I want on it so that's good but on
the red on the bottom I want to bring
the opacity all the way down now I'm
going to take my pen tool I'm going to
go maybe right about here and then right
about here and I'm going to click down
and hold and drag and arc that to be
right about like that then click down
here just go somewhere way down here
here and then there and you can use that
shape to punch out this shape so I have
the those two select it now I go to
modify combine paths and punch and you
can manipulate that gradient still so
that's what you're going to do let's put
the light focus over here bring that
about like that and that looks good
so you can see it kind of puts a shine
and a bulge almost on that so now to
create the little Ruby kind of effect
that this one has we're going to put a
little blurred shape inside of this one
we're working on here so let's go ahead
and grab the shape tool and ellipse just
draw out an ellipse any shape you want
really make sure it's bright red go to
filters blur and Gaussian blur you can
blur it as much as you like okay and
then bring the opacity of it down a
little bit so there now you'll have your
nice ruby glow inside and like I said
that can be any size you want any shape
you want so now when I get done with
everything that'll have a nice Ruby
effect to it because it will have a
shine in its center I'm just going to
make sure that this one is on top of
that one by pressing ctrl shift up or
you can use these up here to bring to
front so this one is on the topmost
layer of everything
working on and if you want to at any
time you can make this one bigger just
by resizing it holding shift while you
resize it so it doesn't lose proportions
I'm just going to make mine a tad bigger
and I'm going to make that inner bevel a
little deeper a little wider so it comes
where it should be looking good to me
boss now it looks like it has a nice
golden metal rim or casing and a ruby
red Center like a ruby red jewel type
Center we're going to work on it a
little more here so now let's take this
symbol here that's just the solid dark
red heart we're going to add a filter to
that of inner glow bring that out a good
bit make sure it's blurred all the way
and you see how that gives it a lot of
depth now it looks like it's kind of
coming out of there and I'm going to
make that a little bit smaller that
looks good to me now we're going to
carefully take our pen tool and let's
give that a white fill solid solid white
and I'm going to zoom in just a bit here
so I can draw more precisely where I
want to I'm going to start right here at
that point with those two items meet let
me come up to about right there
and I'm going to draw an arc I'm going
to hold down and drag to where my arc
meets just about perfectly and I can
still manipulate those points after I'm
done doing this then I'm going to click
down on that point so I get a sharp
point when I come back down I'm going to
go right about here click down I'm going
to drag here as well I'm going to taper
that so where it's a sharp point up top
and then it gets wider down at the base
click down there and click down there
back up take a look at what you have
alright now let's take that and bring
the opacity down on it so right about
there so you see that adds another level
of shine to things I'm going to put
another little one up top here then go
about right there make the arc to match
up with your heart click here
and click down right here and hold and
taper and you can give it any kind of
taper you like I'm going to remove that
edge make it a solid white and bring the
opacity down so there now I have all the
shines going on that I want you can put
as many kind of lighting effects that
you want on the thing okay now at this
point I'm going to grab the star symbol
I'm going to put a big old star right
there I'm going to get a fill of white
no edge or no border and imma zoom in a
little bit on it bring the radius in way
in so it's very thin lines and then here
you grab this and you can adjust your
points to give it over many points you
want I'm going to give mine one two
three four five six I'm also going to
spin it just a little bit by grabbing
the scale tool and using the skew effect
of it now let's back up to 100% put that
at the brightest point of the gold and
then you make sure you give that a
gradient of radial where it's black just
make sure it's white and bring that
opacity on that edge all the way down so
you see what that did gives it a nice
shine I'm going to put one more over
here and I can resize that and also spin
it a little bit so it's not perfectly
identical to that other one and add that
right there now let's take our mouse
over here and highlight everything right
in that region then hold shift and
deselect the big background with the
radial on it that rectangle and also
deselect these shines these stars we
just put on so the only thing you should
have selected is the heart without the
shiny stars on it but everything else
that we put into the heart would be
selected press ctrl-g so now it's
grouped so if you move that heart it all
stays together in one piece now I'm
going to highlight it press ctrl-c
ctrl-v and i'm going to flip it
vertically I'm going to bring it down to
match the point here and I'm also going
to I'm going to zoom out while it's
still selected I'm going to go to my
distort tool and I'm going to distort it
cock it on its side maybe like that
something around like that to where it
would match up with the reflection of
where the lights are coming from make
sure those points look like they're
matched up pretty good and go up to
command creative Auto vector mask and
just make sure you pick the one where it
fades out on the bottom if you pick this
one it'll fade out on top just fade out
on bottom apply and then you can
manipulate this gradient you see I can
make that gradient fade much more
dramatic and then move it up to where I
get something like that so you see what
that's done it gives you a more
realistic reflection when you kind of
distort like that according to where
your lights coming from now all we need
is some hearts in the back so for that
you can just go into the shapes and grab
the heart or you can use your custom
heart draw out a new custom heart
whatever you want to do I can manipulate
this one now I'm just going to make this
solid red and I can manipulate the
vertex the vertex arc and also the cleft
I'm going to put mine right about like
that I'm going to take that I'm going to
make it really big by going to the scale
tool holding shift while I drag to keep
proportions make it about that big and
I'm going to bring the opacity down on
it to about 20 something so I'm going to
put this one right about here press
ctrl-c ctrl-v put another big giant one
like right here somewhere close that I'm
just going to pop those in and make
different sizes so this is kind of like
a variety going on you'll see control V
just keep copying and pasting and
resizing or putting it where you want it
that little guy right about there that
looks good to me I don't want to overdo
it
so I'm going to select all of those
hearts by holding shift and grabbing all
of them as I go just those hearts that I
just put ctrl G make them into a group
now grab this background gradient that
we put on first the one that has that
radial gradient back there that
rectangle it doesn't look like that
rectangle is even big enough for the
scene or maybe I moved it over there
that's where it belongs so we'll grab
that rectangle back there way in the
back and this new group of hearts and
press control shift down arrow key you
see what that did that brought all of
those to the back so now you should have
something that looks like that
now bring my properties back up and I'm
going to grab a text tool I'm going to
type in down here happy Valentine's Day
and that text that I'm using that font
rather is a script empty bold you can
bold it or leave it on bolded now let's
also put some text up here with that
same font that say I love you that looks
great make sure it's centered into heart
this one as well I'm going to bevel
those also I'm going to give them inner
bevel and you can see they have my gold
color they already have the gold color
when I created them and that's cool with
me I'm going to go to bevel and emboss
inner bevel and bring that fade all the
way up not all the way up maybe six and
I'm going to bring this smooth then I'm
going to give them another effect of
glow and that's going to be red but I'm
going to bring it all the way down to
zero and 100% so there you have it very
simple ways to get some pretty cool
custom graphics for print web design
logo design whatever you're doing
alright we hope you have enjoyed this
one and I'll see you next year sweetie
