lesson you can learn to create beautiful
animated repeating tile backgrounds for
any content boxes banners or headers or
any area of your web page will be using
css3 keyframes to accomplish this task
now before we get our hands dirty let's
take a look at the finished product now
keep in mind it's going to appear a
little choppy in my video because of my
optimized framerate when you run this on
your machine you'll notice that it's
smooth as butter you run it on your
website smooth as butter like usual
we're going to start with the bare bones
of an html5 web document so everybody
can see the production workflow now in
my body element and I have mine named
test.html and you can name yours
I have buckteeth dot HTML and in my body
element I'm going to place this simple
HTML code let me give it some space
around it so you can see how simple it
is what I have is a div with an ID of
banner and inside of that div there's
two child divs there's one child div
named banner backdrop and another child
div with an ID of banner content and
that's right you guessed it you put your
banner content whatever HTML content you
want right here and your banner backdrop
is the element the graphic element that
animates it rolls along and that's all
the HTML my friend okay now let's start
applying the CSS to our page first we'll
affect the body element on the page so
we have a new rule for the body element
here and it has margin 48 pixels all the
way around the page for all four sides
background is black and the font family
for the page is Arial if you were to
render this in your favorite browser
you'll see that you have nothing on the
page yet well you have text on the page
but you can't see that text because it's
default black because pages always have
default black text now let's put a rule
in that affects this banner div so we'll
go under our body rule and let's affect
the div with an ID of banner I'm going
to give a width a thousand pixels height
200 pixels the margin zero pixels Auto
that way it centers that element in our
web page or it centers it in whatever
containing element that
and then our border is a light purple
one pixel solid and the overflow for
that box is hidden and this is a pretty
important property the overflow hidden
because if you don't hide the overflow
people are going to see how your
animation is rigged and everything is
just going to look all yucky so you got
to hide everything that's outside of
that box because it's children its child
elements like this banner backdrop it's
going to be animated and rolling along
now take a look at this in your favorite
browser and you should have this and if
you highlight everything in the page
you'll see your text now we're going to
pop in some CSS that is a rule that's
going to affect this banner backdrop div
so we specify the div with an ID of
banner and it's child ID banner backdrop
element so we're targeting basically the
ID banner backdrop where make sure the
banner backdrop that's going to be the
animated element has a position of
relative and a background property of
repeater jpg and we're going to repeat
that image on the x-plane on the
horizontal plane within this element
because this element is going to be 1320
wide but my repeater jpg is only 320
pixels wide and the height of this
banner backdrop is going to be 200 to
match the height of the banner itself so
you see how the width of this element is
going to be 1320 and remember I told you
repeater is 320 pixels let me show you
that you see this is repeater JPEG here
in fireworks you can see it's just a
small little rectangle let me bring up
the properties window and you'll see it
has 320 width and height of 200 now I
can give you a a graphical
representation of how we're going to be
animating this if I was just to change
the canvas size here to 1000 pixels wide
which is the dimensions of my banner so
what I'll do is have this in here and
I'll press control C control V and say I
have an element that I repeat this
background in it's going to look like
this okay so once I have this I can
group these and let's say this is the
banner backdrop element with its
repeated graphics in it what we're going
to do is just animate it 320 pixels
until
it's next a starting for that tile
graphic does that make sense so we're
only going to animate it this way just
far enough to where it meets the next
tile we're not going to animate the
whole element all the way through it
people will see what we're doing so you
all you have to do is make sure you make
this element the banner backdrop larger
than your banner itself and then this
element your banner backdrop will be
large enough to animate from starting
point 0 left to minus however many left
you need to go to meet the next tile so
that's a graphical representation of the
animation we're going to be creating and
it helps to see that visually so let's
go over banner backdrops properties
again remember has position of relative
that way we can move it no problem
inside of its parent element the
background property is the JPEG graphic
I have
that's my repeater that JPEG and I
showed you that image and it only had a
320 wide dimensions that's why I set the
width of my element banner backdrop to
1320 1000 is the width of my banner 320
is the width of my repeating tile
background okay got it let's move along
okay now the last CSS rule that we're
going to put in is the one to affect the
banner content element here so in the
CSS let's put that last rule we're
targeting the banner content div and
giving that a position of relative the
width 96 percent that way you can get it
off of the space of the here let me show
you what I'm talking about
first let's take a look at it in our
favorite browser so you see what I have
everything is in its correct position
but it's not animated yet and the way I
got that text to be where it needs to be
positioned is giving top minus 200
pixels for the banner content you can
also animate the content within the
banner so you can have all kind of
animations going on but in this case my
my banner content is going to be just
text and if I give this a border you'll
be able to see it better let me give it
a border of some bright color one pixel
dashed and then run that in your
favorite browser and you'll see see how
I set it up to where it's padded in
there a little bit and it's not all up
against the edges so that way when you
put con
in there it won't look retarded so you
just remove that blue border now and
continue working now the last step is to
animate that backdrop and that is so
simple to do so right under your banner
backdrop rule we're going to put a
keyframes animation here I'm going to
use the WebKit prefix because I'm
testing in Chrome and I want my
keyframes animation which is called
backdrop roll I want that to go from
right zero pixels to right 320 pixels
and there's different ways you can go
different directions
to make the the atmosphere look like
it's going one way or the other right or
left so you can target the left property
or the right property whatever and
remember in the last keyframes tutorial
we did with the head bobbing up and down
we used 50% 100% now we're using the
front and two keywords so you can just
if you go I'm going to have two
keyframes in your animation you can use
from and two we're animating it from its
right position zero pixels to a right
position of 320 pixels and after it
animates that 320 pixels it's
automatically just going to snap back
now to make this backdrop roll keyframes
animation tied to this banner backdrop
element all we have to do is place one
line to establish that this is the
element that's going to utilize this
keyframe animation so we say WebKit
animation property and in the future we
won't need the WebKit prefix and all
that like I've been saying we can just
use animation pretty soon and I'm going
to show you the other prefixes you need
for Firefox and Internet Explorer so in
the animation property for this banner
backdrop we're going to specify backdrop
role as the animation that this element
is going to utilize and backdrop role
key frames animation is going to happen
in a linear fashion
so that's your timing function that can
be ease ease in ease in and out or
linear and for this example linear is
the one you want a 15 second interval so
it's going to take it 15 seconds to go
the 320 pixels and it's going to be an
infinite loop and this would be your
speed 15 seconds so all you have to do
is put that on something like 5 and
you'll see how much faster that my
animation runs now and you can test it
now it'll run in Chrome see see how fast
the backdrops going
so you can set this number to whatever
you want something like twelve might be
good or whatever whatever speed you want
okay so that's the completed work and
all you have to do is make sure you test
this in Firefox Internet Explorer
another popular modern browsers and if
it doesn't work in those then you have
to set up prefixes and you also have to
put in prefixes if you want to target
older browsers but all it takes is I
think three prefixes what we'll do is
we'll take the animation property
because we're going to have the
standardized syntax of the animation
property last after all of our prefixes
and we're also going to take this which
we can put all into one line like this
if we want put all that together in one
line if you like then you're going to
take that line copy it and right under
it put the regular keyframe syntax
without the WebKit prefix now let's test
this in file preview in browser Firefox
and you can see Firefox does not require
the animation prefixes so we're using
WebKit we're not using the molds prefix
so multiplier Fox is picking up this
keyframes property and the animation
property its default syntax which is
really nice
now let's go to file preview in browser
Internet Explorer Internet Explorer is
working as well but these are the modern
versions of these browsers the newest
ones so I wonder what happens if I
remove these WebKit references let's see
if it works in chrome save that file
preview in browser Chrome nope
we need the WebKit prefix still for
Chrome and Safari I believe let's check
in Safari okay we working in Safari with
the WebKit prefix that's good now for
older browsers like older Internet
Explorer or older Firefox versions we're
going to add the prefixes needed so
let's just grab this line right here and
under WebKit let's put two more of those
and let's change this one to moze and
this one to M s for internet explorer M
s is internet explorer moze is Firefox
WebKit is Safari and Chrome and now we
just have to do that same thing for
these the keyframes animation itself to
take two more of those samos and MS now
your little application will be working
across the board no matter what browser
you tested in even some older Internet
Explorer versions like Internet Explorer
9 this animation should work and older
Firefox versions as well okay guys I
hope you've enjoyed this css3 html5
animated repeating background tile
