can learn to use the viewport length
values to size elements in relation to
the entire viewing area the way that it
differs from normal percentage lengths
is that these lengths are always
relative to the viewport and not
relative to their parent elements and it
also helps to make text and other
elements sized relative to the viewing
area to keep things more in proportion
for this exercise we're going to start
with a blank document that we set the
body margin to zero now we have a style
rule all set up for our div and you can
see our div is sitting right here so if
we take a peek at what this renders not
much going on okay so first thing we'll
do is set the width property 250
viewport with 50% of the viewport width
now let's give it a background color and
let's take a look at what that renders
so you can see our div is 50% of the
viewport width and even as we resize it
now let's do the same for the height 50
viewport height 50% of the viewport
height see what that renders so now you
can see as we resize the viewport it's
going to be half the width and half the
height now let's go ahead and set the
font size to 3 vw3 percent of the
viewport width see what that renders now
watch as I resize the text is going to
stay pretty much relative because we set
the font size to the viewport width now
let's go ahead and set the margin
property for you how we usually Center
things and set margin space around
things we'll set this to 25 of the
viewport height for the top and bottom
margins and then 25% of the viewport
width for the left and right margins now
we should get a box that's centered
directly in the screen or in the
viewport now
and as we resize it it stays directly in
the center now if you tried to set the
font size using percentages or e/m or
pixel values you wouldn't get that
effect and if you tried to set this to
percentages normal percentages for the
margin watch what happens you see it's
not directly centered in the viewport so
that's where it comes in a little handy
okay now we're going to do experiment
with the viewport minimum and viewport
maximum so I'm gonna set this to V Max
and I'm gonna give you guys details
about what these actually mean and what
they what they're relative to at the end
of the video I'll show you a little
sheet that explains it let's go ahead
and comment out this centering margins
so let's change the height to be max and
let's see how that responds I think if
we view the height it will give us a
better representation okay so you can
see as I change the width the height is
growing
see how I'm changing the width of the
browser window or the viewing area the
height is also getting bigger along with
the width so when you set V Max its 1%
or in this case 50 percent but the V Max
represents 1% of whichever is larger the
viewport width or the viewport height
and you can do the same for V min which
it will be a unit that's equal to 1% of
whichever is smaller the viewport width
of the viewport height so let's take a
look at that now as I'm resizing but
once the width gets smaller than the
height watch what happens you see the
height is now scaling down so those are
things that you can't get with regular
percentages all right so let me put this
back on VH and uncomment this and this
is the example that we'll have on the
page now in my new CSS code reference
library at develop PHP comm I have a
little value reference section and here
we're discussing length values and here
at the bottom you can see where I've
detailed what vwv hv min and V Max are
equivalent to they're one percent
relative
the viewport so if you put a 25 that'd
be 25% of the viewport width or the
viewport height or the V min and v-max
and you can also check out the other
length values that we have here because
all of them can be used in your CSS and
where they say experimental here that
means they're they're new so they might
not work in old browser software but
they work in all the new popular ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
