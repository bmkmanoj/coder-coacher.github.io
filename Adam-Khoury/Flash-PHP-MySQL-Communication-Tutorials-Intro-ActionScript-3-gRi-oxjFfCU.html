the web and there's not many tutors
covering it I'm gonna start delivering
some lessons on flash PHP and MySQL
communication and I just wanted to show
you my little diagram here that my
little illustration that'll help
understand the circle of communication
that happens when flash sends out it
requests to PHP and so the file the well
also I'll also show you a couple of
examples of where I use this online live
so you can see if this kind of thing is
you might want to learn how to put into
your flash applications okay so and just
so you know before we describe explain
things here this PHP file will be one
PHP file these arrows are points in time
and this PHP file will be the same exact
file as this plot PHP file on that side
MySQL is the database and flashes what
the user sees in the browser okay so
step one is where the process starts is
flashes access by a browser whether it
be Safari Internet Explorer or Firefox
it's open and by some user in the world
somewhere and your Flash application is
displayed to the user now at that point
you have the option to command flash to
send out the call to PHP to get the data
first thing or you can wait till after
your Flash intro plays or wait till some
movie clip part of a timeline anywhere
you want is is you if you want to wait
to send the call out to PHP you have
that option you don't have to send the
call out right away but you can send it
out right away just put it on the first
frame the first time line all by itself
and make the function when it calls when
the information comes back snap to frame
2 and let your flash file play like
normal but what happens is the flash
file will send a call to PHP or a
request to PHP for information
PHP says ok flash I've been waiting for
you I'm a special made script just for
you and
I'm going to gather what you need I'm
going to MySQL now and I'm gonna call
and request a certain result set of data
and MySQL then says ok mr. PHP I hear
your call I see what you want I'm gonna
gather it up put it in a package and
give it back to you
PHP says thank you I see the package I
see what's in it
I'm gonna parse it and I'm gonna send it
back to flash flash says Thank You mr.
PHP I'm gonna show the information to
the user now in the browser in a cool
animated flash kind of wait and it's
really the whole process and it happens
in a split second flash makes the call
PHP makes a call MySQL delivers PHP
delivers back to flash and then that
process is done the user is then seeing
the information and let's see let's show
you on the site on develop PHP I'll show
you a couple of places where I use this
right here where it says welcome visitor
my whole header is flash and up here
where it says welcome visitor it changes
after they log in it changes to say the
user's name and a button so they can get
to their control panel that's some flash
magic right there and it's PHP MySQL
integration that makes it possible for
me and also here in my poll the witch
says Adams web tutorial poll and you can
see these these applications by going to
develop PHP com
but here there's a flash poll that I
custom-made and it has PHP and MySQL
functionality and it stores the users
options and it makes sure that the user
is logged in if you're not a logged in
member of my site
you can't boat sucker and that's how it
works so that's the beginning of the our
whole flash PHP and MySQL coding
endeavor and we're gonna start some
tutorials real soon so look forward to
them we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
