we've created in this fireworks cs4
tutorial in just a couple of minutes
with no programming knowledge just using
a folder full of images isn't that nice
in this fireworks cs4 tutorial I'll show
you how in just a few minutes you can
create your own flash based image
gallery slideshow that has slideshow
mechanism and manual thumbnail click
mechanism for your users and you can
make this all within just a few minutes
and you don't have to have any flash
knowledge and all you have to have is
you know common sense on how to click a
few things and that's really all it is
clicking on a few things so let's go
into commands in fireworks cs4 and you
go to create slideshow there now once
that comes up you go to add and says
current open files you just go to the
little browse button here and you can be
in say you're in my documents go to my
pictures any folder you have could be a
hundred pictures in it and I'm going to
go to my uncle ed's pictures here and
control a to select them all and press
done and now they're loaded in there you
just press ok and there it is as Ed's
see there's all the images right down
through there and you can rename all the
images here if you like and you can go
ahead and set some parameters for the
slideshow you title it right here just
put
edge pictures uncle ed's pictures
and then you put in the description his
pics
and here you pick the player you want so
say you wanted a black flash player
there it is there you can see it it says
it has an auto start feature and allow
clicking of the images you click that
and it allows you to users to open the
image in a new window if they click the
images or you can choose to not select
that feature auto start feature for the
slideshow or not and select the album
then you select all kind of other
properties here like the thumbnail for
the album you select that here the
background for the album the description
that would be near the thumbnail caption
settings filter settings apply filters
to all our albums and
the slide show properties are here now
this is how a duration of how long the
images will stay on if they're going to
be in order or randomized and all kinds
of settings you can set there and export
options are right here now after you go
through all your settings it says export
images so what it's going to do is it's
going to resize all your images and
create thumbnails as well it's going to
make an XML file and you create
slideshow you just put it on my desktop
so let's go to all the way to desktop
select desktop and here you can set the
width for your large the large images
i'll just say 640 by 480 I want them a
little larger the thumbnail size is
great we're just going to export
thumbnails image quality is eighty
percent and large images to fit that
sounds great create tell me that wasn't
easy now you don't have to be a flash
programmer you don't have to be any kind
of programmer to do this you saw the
steps involved I just grabbed some
folder full of images there were really
big images as well and right now what
it's doing what you're saying now is the
resized process the batch resize it's
doing a batch image resize of the large
scale images and the thumbnail images
making little folders and setting what
my desktop and all I would have to do is
upload this to my server in the correct
directory structure and bada-bing
bada-boom in two minutes you got a
full-blown flash slideshow a thumbnail
click gallery with as many images and
galleries that you want in it you can
put extra galleries in it as well
let's go ahead and launch it it's going
to active X allow okay and there's the
edge album here and if you would have
set more albums if you want to define
more albums while setting up they would
be all listed right there as many as you
want and then when you click an album
its thumbnails show up here it's really
nice cool little effects on the
thumbnail when you go over them and
that's a great picture and my uncle ed's
wife is at an artist she says really
nice paintings and I really dig that one
too but I didn't set a thumbnail if I
were to set a thumbnail in the prop in
the settings where I was showing you the
settings it would show up right here and
then if you had more albums they would
all show up it's a really cool set up
and you can also take this HTML page
here that is rendered out I'll show you
and we're all finished there so the
let's drag this over a little so you can
see what was put out okay we have the
folder called Ed's which it created
automatically thumbnails and the 640 by
480 s that I define and there's a
scripts folder there's a sea of our
active content script and the index file
that's the one you can just open a
dreamweaver open that in Dreamweaver and
manipulate the way it looks and put your
head or your website you footer and all
that good stuff ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
