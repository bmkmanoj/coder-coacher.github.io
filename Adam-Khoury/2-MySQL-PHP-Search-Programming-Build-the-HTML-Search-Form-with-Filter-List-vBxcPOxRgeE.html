programming courtesy of develop PHP com
moving right along with no time to waste
now that we have our exercise tables
created and populated we can start with
basic search programming but before we
work on any SQL syntax we need an HTML
form to give the user something to type
their search query into so I'm going to
go into the body tag and I'm going to
type in the form tag and the form action
I'm going to make PHP so you if you undo
a label you can go up here to the PHP
tab and just echo if you hit echo you
can echo serve yourself like that now
what that's going to do is make this
file parts to itself and equivalent to
that is me typing in search PHP that
makes it also parts to itself you know
what I'm saying so I'm going to leave
mine like this echoing server so just
because I'm a cool dork and we want the
method to be post and then I'm going to
see if I can just get by with that I'm
going to close that off and then go down
one line and close off the form tag try
to anyway
puron and actually if you're in
Dreamweaver while you're building forms
you can go inside your form tag there
and let's see up here they have a
selection performs and they give you all
these nice things you just click E and
it goes in you don't have to know
anything like right now I don't know
anything I'm gonna click this and I have
a field look at that
I'm gonna name this text field a search
query would that be a good name search
query' yeah that makes total sense
okay and now if I look in design view
Hey look at that I get the form
I get the field now all I have to do in
front of the field is put search me the
word search that works for me I'm going
to go ahead and set up the max chars
to be 88 and then my character width for
the how long that field is going to be
you can also use CSS and use a pixel
amount or a percentage to the width on
this text field but I'm going to use the
char with here and set
maybe I don't know eighty all right so
that's what it's going to look like and
above that form maybe I can pop in
search the exercise tables and we can go
ahead and highlight that press control
two and that will give us a nice h2
header that'll say search the exercise
tables okay
okay and then what we'll do is under the
form we'll have an output section so
let's go ahead and make that real quick
let's just put in a div close it off go
down the line and close the div tag
search output output and then put a
semicolon on the end of it on the front
of it for the dollar sign highlight the
whole thing go up here to PHP and echo
that's where we're going to echo the
search output okay and what will happen
is when the person presses submit with
their search query we are going to have
PHP up top here so we can just go ahead
and put that in place let's go ahead and
put a PHP block and here is where we
will process the search query okay the
first thing we have to do is put an if
condition open the curly brace go down
one line close the curly brace and
inside of the parentheses we're going to
type in is set which is a PHP function
to see if a variable or global is set
and the variable we want to look for is
search query I'll type in dollar sign
underscore post Open bracket single
quote single quote close bracket in
between those single quotes that's where
that variable name goes so if it's set
post search query then and only then
will this code here
run we're going to put in one more
little condition we're going to put the
end operator we want to make sure this
posted variable is not equal to nothing
so if it's set and if it has a value
then and only then are we going to run
this code here run code if condition
meets here okay
so here's the logic if this posted
variable is set that means if they use
that form they type something in and
actually we're going to need a button
through so let's go back up here to
forms and hit the button and let's make
it a submit type okay there we go
name can be my BTN so let's see what we
have there that's good now back to the
logic what's going to happen is if they
press that button they type something in
code is going to process here the code
that you want to process here is looking
in your database to search for things
that they whatever they typed in that's
what you're going to search the database
for right here and you're going to
assemble that into a variable whatever
output comes out in the loop you're
going to assemble it into a variable
called search output and then it comes
out on the page here under the search
bar very simple very nice and I've
decided to add something real quick
early on so we can put it under that
button there so what we're going to do
is add a list not the text area where is
that select list right there let's name
it filter one okay and in the Select
list go ahead and make the select a
closing tag go down one line and inside
that open space you have there now in
between the opening and closing select
tag we're going to put in option space
value and the first one is going to be
by default it will be searching the
whole site the person will be searching
the whole site and then you close off
your option tag and in between the
option tags opening and closing there
type in whatever this value is here and
let's take that copy it and here what
did we have we have tables called pages
that's the pages section of the site so
you can allow the user to search only in
that section of the site and I'll show
you how to do that and then the other
one was blog so you can allow them to
search independently within the blog
maybe they don't want results from the
pages they don't want results from the
whole site they want only results from
the blog and they want to search for
certain things only in the blog
you can allow them to do that with this
little list and let's make sure that we
have that select down a couple of lines
put in brake tags let's make sure make
those cementec by putting on the closing
tag in those brakes yeah that's good now
in front of that we can type in right
here in this line search in search in
whole site it'll say by default and then
they'll be able to select pages or blogs
too now with all of this set up inside
of this area here is where we'll
evaluate to see if they use the filter
or not because if we'll know if its
whole site it's going to be whole site
by default we'll see if it's if it's not
whole site then we're going to query the
database differently okay I'll show you
how to do that so now that we have all
of the cosmetic mechanisms the really
the user interfaces for searching and we
have a little display area here we'll
pick it up in the next video where we're
going to actually get down and dirty
with some SQL syntax showing all the
different ways that you can query your
database in a search type scenario</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
