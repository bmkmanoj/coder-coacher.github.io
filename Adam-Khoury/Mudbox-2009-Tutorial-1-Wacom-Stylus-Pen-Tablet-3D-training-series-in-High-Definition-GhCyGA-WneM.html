number one from flash building and this
is the first thing that every mud boxer
or graphic designer should know about
and a lot of you guys already know about
it if you're heavy into digital arts but
some of you might not yet so I'm going
to showcase it and what I'll be
discussing is a stylus pen that's this
little guy here and a graphics tablet
it's this thing here and i use the Wacom
graphics tablet comes with a nice little
mouse mouse input and it comes with the
stylus pen the stylus pen comes with
extra little white tips that you can
replace that one with and the pen has
simulates the mouse with this little
button here and it's not clickable in
the center but both edges of the mouths
are clickable and you can see that it
controls my my mouse on my computer just
like a or it controls my pointer sorry
just like a mouse would but it gives you
certain advantages that a mouse camp and
i'll show you how in Mudbox in just a
second i'm also going to show the
advantages of using a stylus pen and
tablet in illustrator photoshop and
fireworks and things like that but for
this video we're just going to focus on
mud box and then in the next video I'll
uh I'll demonstrate the interface and
talk to you about the interface of mud
box 2009 and I'm also here in Mudbox one
if you happen to have mote box Mudbox
one point 0 from sky matter I bought it
a long time ago when the sky matter
first came out with it years ago and I
love it it's just a great little tool
because I i sculpt with the super
sculpey I don't know if you guys know
with what super sculpey is but it's a
great little polymer clay that allows
you to sculpt little characters and then
bake them in your oven and then you can
paint them and stuff so this mud box is
a super sculpey somebody who likes super
sculpey you're gonna love mud box
because it's just like having a lump of
clay and all of the tools especially in
2009 there seems to be i like the tools
better in 2009 I like the interface
better and has more more preset stencils
stamps and all this other stuff but mud
box 1 point 0 and mud box 2009 the way
you use the stylus pen and the objects
that you can create it's pretty much the
same thing so if you have mud box 1 or
Mudbox 2009 you can follow along with
some of my lessons but i'll be working
in Mudbox 2009 and primarily and so you
might not have all of the tools that
i'll be using and i'll always be using
the stylus pen and tablet for the for
the mudbox tutorials so if you don't
have this stylus pen and tablet and you
can't get one and you can do everything
that that i would do but i would do it a
lot quicker because there's certain you
know a little tiny pressure-sensitive
things that I'll be able to do really
quickly that you would have to go over
here in the sliders and gauge things
really fine-tune things to get it to do
the same effect that I've got it so that
that's good to note ok so we talked
about the pen and we talked about the
tablet let's see what else the tablet
let's see if if you're on a slider say
you're on a slider and you have the
Wacom tablet or a similar tablet let's
say I hi I have that slider and I'm
sliding it back and forth with my pen
but I want a little more precision on it
this is a little slider here you see
this thing right here right there this
little track
if you highlight one of these markers
and you're sliding it you can see that
look at this and look at the precision
it allows I'm just stroking it back I'm
stroking it but I'm stroking it length
uhh vertically you can see it just
tracks the decimal points slides them to
ever so minutely and it's really nice
for precision so that's another
advantage of having the the tablet so
not only do you have a
pressure-sensitive pen but you also have
a nice precision slider and then you
have buttons here that simulate the
mouse buttons but this thing simulates
the mouse buttons as well and so let's
go ahead and show you what the deal is
with this and why it's so important in
Mudbox or any graphics program for that
matter so you go to create mesh let's
bring out a spear spear and then let's
let's do the same thing in Mudbox one in
case you guys work in a mud box one
create mesh and you'll notice that
there's not as many mesh presets in
Mudbox one is only three let's go ahead
and subdivide it now and I'll be going
through the basics and other later
tutorials but I have to show you the
tablet in this first tutorial let's see
if we want to go to mesh subdivide
selection let's do it again let's just
do it three times so it has a really
fine detail
so let's go to this one and do the same
thing mesh add subdivision add
subdivision add subdivision okay so now
it's got really fine detailed to the
model to this object here there's more
polygons it's a bigger polygon count in
it now alright so when you have depends
you can press alt on your keyboard and
click down you can see how moving the
pen will let you view any angle of your
scene there you can you can also click
the little buttons here on the pen and
they will let you pan or not pan but
zoom in and out so what I'm doing is I'm
holding alt on my keyboard and then I'm
holding this pen this the the front
click button on the pen I hold that down
you can see if I don't touch the tablet
if I'm holding actually I don't even
have to hold alt let yes I do hold alt
and you it'll let you drag the scene
around but then if you press down on the
tablet you see that it lets you zoom in
and out and i'm still holding with my my
index finger on that button and that's
how it's allowing me to do that and now
if i pick my pen tip up off of the
tablet watch what happened I'm not
zooming anymore now when I go up and
then it doesn't do anything it just
drags the scene around so that's what's
cool about that and if I click the other
button oops
the other button will let me zoom in and
out if I have it held down without
touching the tablet and then when i
touch the tablet you can see it cancels
it out so there's a lot of whole
different ways you can control this
thing let's see so if you hold alt and
you that will let you view all around
you seen and what are the views are
that's about it you can zoom in and out
all around it and the Alt key makes that
possible now let's show you why it's so
important to have the this is the real
kicker about why it's important to have
the stylus pen what I'm about to show
you right now okay so let's go back to
Center now the go down to your tools and
you hit sculpt here in 2009 and let's go
ahead and draw on to the sphere okay
so you see the lines i drew using the
pen now i'm going to draw a little i'm
going to push a little harder with my
pen this time you see how much thicker
that is so i'm going to draw a nice and
soft this time with the pen ready watch
nice and soft nice and soft see how
light and thin that line is it's
beautiful now i'm going to grab my mouse
do the st. try and do the same thing
nope it's just a big bulky thicker line
no precision no detail and there's no
way I can match those little lines it's
not even possible i would have to go
over here mess with my size and my
strength the whole bunch and so you can
see how much more time that would take
it's a pain in the butt but you have the
pen and you get onto that sphere and
it's just my god the difference is
amazing I can't even you have to do it
yourself to to even understand but I
guess you know the visual here helps so
if and my box one same thing let's draw
on it with the pen now let's push hard
with the pen see thats a nice thick line
let's push soft with the pen nice thin
detailed line
now let's get the mouse let's draw with
the mouse on it oh man it's such a big
bulky bit so you can see the same
setting set on this and in Mudbox one
it's called soft so off to be and soft
day and then in Mudbox 2009 is called
sculpt but it's the same thing and i'll
show you how to use all these tools in
future tutorials but that's what i
wanted to demonstrate was the power of
the stylus you must have the stylus if
you don't have the stylus with a
pressure-sensitive tip i'm going to be
working 10 x 20 x maybe even 50 times
faster than you and if you you want to
follow along with my tutorials i'm going
to be working just understand i may be
working that much faster than you
because like i said you'll you'll be
having to come over here to the sliders
and manipulate things as I'm just
zooming along with my pen so that's
lesson number one and we'll see you in
lesson number two and like i said i'm
going to demonstrate the advantages of
having this pen and tablet in fireworks
photoshop and illustrator for you guys
too so peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
