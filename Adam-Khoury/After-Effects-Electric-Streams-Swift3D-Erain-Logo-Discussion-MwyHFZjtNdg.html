here and we are threading in the
developed PHP forums and ricky rights hi
everyone I was wondering if anyone knows
how to make an electricity effect like
Iran calm so if you go to Iran calm you
see that cool electricity effect like
their logos all electrified nice flowing
animation and so I responded with like
lightning or like an electric laser
stream and I'm an idiot because I didn't
even see the electric rain link or I
wouldn't have even asked that question
and then Ruby PHP SQL hes3 answered I
think that was done with after effects
which is the correct answer and let's
press play see there
it's just a line animate and animated
line that has a wave set to it and a
warp a wiggle sorry a line wiggle
applied to it and a warp animation and
that's how I achieve the animation now
mine doesn't look as good as earrings
because they probably took you know 30
40 minutes making that nice electric
stream and mine took about two minutes
you guys want to see how i made it i can
do a short tutorial on it only took two
minutes and if you want to see how i
made this you can tweak this out anyway
anyway to get these waves to look any
way you like curved pointed whatever
flowing at any speed you like okay so i
just wanted to show how exactly that was
done and i do believe that they were
doing it in after effects as well they
just took a lot more time to tweak out
the line animation but basically that's
how it's done and if you guys want to
see it from start to finish how I made
this crappy looking one then just let me
know and I'll do a little after effects
tutorial on it okay see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
