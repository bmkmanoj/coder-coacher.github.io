nature of this tutorial a few important
things have to be discussed before we
can begin coding this tutorial is
intended for intermediate users that
deal with the rendering dynamic database
content on web pages it is not intended
for people that have static content
written directly into a web page you can
learn to begin programming a custom code
syntax highlighter for displaying code
in the document with colored highlights
and other styling features this tutorial
was requested by a friend of mine on
Facebook last week now as some of you
already know many pre-baked
syntax highlighters already exists so
you do not have to learn anything here
you can simply go grab an existing
program that someone else wrote using
their knowledge of regular expression
logic but there are a few reasons why a
developer may have a desire to build
their own from scratch I'm not going to
be supplying you with the complete
robust program but I will start you off
in that direction if you would like to
continue the program and make it your
own
now here are several reasons why a
developer may want to program their own
code syntax highlighter from scratch
number one you may not like how much
existing syntax highlighters slow down
your documents
number two you may want to gain
reputation by offering your finished
program to other people on line number
three you may just want a few key
features instead of a very bulky program
like most syntax highlighters are number
four you may get a certain satisfaction
from programming it yourself number five
you may have this as a programming
assignment in your school or for some
kind of class and number six you may
want to learn more and get better at
regular expression programming for web
projects completing a syntax highlighter
program will assure that you gain
experience in knowledge dealing with
regular expression logic so you can
really expand your skill sets by
programming something like this yourself
first we'll take a look at how it works
and what it's all about now let's say
you have this webpage that's rendered
from
Namek database content that you might
not even have prior knowledge of what
the code is it might be for a forum that
you've built or some other purpose or
maybe you're showing people how to code
on your website and you want to display
the code with syntax highlights so as
you can see there's no highlights yet
which means it's not an ideal visual
display for code
now I've reinstated the program and I'm
going to refresh the page now you'll see
that all of the HTML elements have a
nice syntax highlight I've just turned
them to orange which helps the viewer
distinguish certain aspects of the code
more easily now we'll go a little bit
more in depth than just highlighting
HTML elements but I just wanted to show
you that quick example before we get
started okay we're gonna start off with
this static example which renders this
and our first goal is to highlight all
HTML elements and as you can see I'm
using the code element which is ideal
for displaying code in a web document
and then I'm just targeting all code
elements in CSS here to give them the
various properties that I want them to
have and you can have more than one code
element on a single page and the program
that we're going to write will affect
all of them so even if you have 20 code
elements with different little code
blocks on the page all of them will be
highlighted by our program so right
under the style element I'm just going
to pop in a script element make sure I
close that script element now you can
externalize this program into a dot J's
file that way you can reuse it for many
different types of documents we'll just
make it a reusable module if you
externalize it into a dot J's file and
then just call it into your program
using the script element just like you
would call in any third-party framework
or library for JavaScript but for the
lesson I'm gonna code directly in this
document but keep in mind that you can
easily externalize this program you can
also share it with other people online
and while we're discussing that you can
also externalize all of this CSS into an
extern
dot CSS file so any of the pages that
need code syntax highlighting you can
just call in the CSS file and the
JavaScript file now the first thing we
want to do in the JavaScript section is
we're going to add the window load event
so we use the add event listener method
for that we target the load event and
we're going to run a function called
syntax highlights when the document is
loaded so let's just copy the name of
that function and right above that line
we're gonna type in function syntax
highlights open close parenthesis
opening curly brace and closing curly
brace and within this function the first
thing that we want to do is create a
variable that's going to represent all
of the code elements like this code
element we're going to access all of the
code elements in the document and we're
going to create an array so I just
called it CA for code array and that
variable is equal to a document get
elements by tag name code so if you
wanted to access all paragraphs or divs
or buttons you can use this method to
access all of those type of HTML
elements and they'll be put into an
array represented by CA now the very
next thing we want to do is loop over
that array so we can access each code
element in the document so let's write a
for loop that's going to iterate over
the length of the CA variable which is
code array that means this for loop will
run one time for each code element in
your document now each time this for
loop runs we want to access the data
that's inside of the code element so
basically all of this code so we'll do
that by creating a variable called data
and we're going to make that equal to
the code array and the index number for
whichever code element is being passed
through the loop we're going to target
its inner HTML property that will give
us all of this data now we're going to
simply run the string replace method
over that data using the two arguments
that the replace method expects so we
say data is equal to data
dot replace and here's your first
argument which is a regular expression
and your second argument is what you
want to replace it with regular
expression logic will allow you to
replace things so we're going to use the
global flag to make sure that we're
replacing all instances where this
regular expression is targeting data so
what we're doing is and lt and GT so
that's basically your code brackets down
here C and Lt and then NGT that's the
that's the greater than and less than
symbols that HTML elements are wrapped
in and then here we're just targeting
everything that's in between them so
everything that's between the less-than
and greater-than characters is also
going to be highlighted and not just the
brackets themselves so where those
things are found they're going to be
replaced with this so we're just going
to wrap a span tag around them and give
it a class of code LM so in the CSS
we're going to add that right now so
class code element we're going to color
orange and for the replacement you just
put the brackets back in place around
the variable that the regular expression
produces and I'm going to lead you guys
to a document that shows you all the
basics of regular expression logic and
what all the little characters mean
within your regular expressions that way
you can learn firsthand more in depth by
yourself and then finally the last thing
we're going to do is target that code
element it's inner HTML property and
we're going to put the data back in it
now that it's been replaced and
highlighted and I think we have a
working program so let's go ahead and
render it and see what happens tada now
we're gonna work on highlighting strings
so if we go ahead and put another CSS
rule I'm going to call that code string
STR for short and the
just give that a color any color we want
and I'll turn strings green now above
where we did the first replacing for the
code brackets for the HTML elements
we're going to first replace strings to
make them green and that gets this line
with this regular expression logic we're
going to do a global replace for
anything that's in between double quotes
everything and the double quotes
themselves and everything in between
them will be styled with green using
this span class code string now the
order that you put these things is very
important and the structure of your
regular expression is also important so
you might have these and quote in your
code so you would put that here instead
of the double quote character so you
just have to feel your way around it and
as I said I'm not gonna build a very
robust perfect program for you you're
gonna have to feel your own way around
it as you continue programming it I'm
just gonna start you off in that
direction with the very basics so now
let's go down here into our little
static example and let's add something
to this h2 element like an ID equal to
in between double quotes call it my h2
or h2 one and now let's run that with
the strings being replaced with green
style so you see anywhere there's
strings in there they're going to be
styled green or whatever color you want
to make it it's really up to you and
your strings will also be styled green
if you're highlighting PHP code or
JavaScript code this will work for all
of it so to show you what I mean I'm
just gonna go ahead and bring that code
down one line and I'm going to add a
stripped element here and then go down a
couple of more lines and make sure I
close that stripped element from my code
example let's see what we get okay
that's good and in that screw
element we'll just put a little bar name
equal to in between double quotes Adam
now let's take a look at what we get so
your string is highlighted in the
JavaScript as well or if you had PHP
tags or whatever and keep in mind in
your code you can just add another
replace for single quotes as well so
that way all strings that are in between
single quotes will also be highlighted
in green you can do the same exact thing
and as I mentioned before down here in
your code whether your code is rendering
into the code element
it might be an quote or and a pass so
that's what you would put here if you're
in your code element if you're not going
to have double quotes or single quotes
directly in there you might have the
HTML encoded reference for that symbol
and not the symbol itself so you would
just have to adjust these and take this
and put it here instead like that you
see what I mean and here's another quick
little tip you can just string dot
replace methods one after another you
don't have to keep making a new line for
data to replace each time you can just
put a dot replace right here and keep
going like that and make a long string
but I just wanted to set it up this way
so you guys can more clearly see what's
going on and now to close up the
tutorial I'll just give you one more
little example that will show you how to
replace multi-line code comments or you
can use them as single line code
comments so that means we're going to
need a CSS rule for that let's put that
in place and let's go ahead and make
that a color of a light gray whatever
color you want and now let's just go
ahead and stick a comment here in our
script where our script example is and
so this is a multi-line code comment and
then we'll say create a string object
variable now let's see what we get all
right so you see we're highlighting code
comments now
okay so as I said I'm not gonna go too
in depth and create a very robust
program for you and really honestly you
doing it yourself and making all these
nice little highlights and style effects
in your code will give you a great
understanding of regular expression
programming you'll be forced to learn
regular expression programming and
regular expression programming bleeds
into all kind of different programming
tasks not just making a syntax
highlighter regular expression
programming is so important for a lot of
advanced programming tactics so it's
really worth investigating and learning
all the little tactics that you'll need
to learn in order to make your syntax
highlighter very robust and nice now
here a develop PHP in the JavaScript
nuts-and-bolts section I have the rake
reg X object which is the regular
expression under object section you have
reg X which is regular expression
programming and down in the page we
discuss how regular expression objects
are set up the flags like the global
flag the non case-sensitive flag and the
multi-line flag and then the special
characters that are involved with
regular expression logic so researching
these can help you really understand
what kind of logic you need to put in
place and accomplish all the little
tasks that you're going to need to
accomplish to target things effectively
and replace them okay I hope you found
this tutorial helpful and trust me you
don't want to chintz
on your regular expression education you
really want to get that down pat if you
plan to become an advanced programmer in
any language because it works similarly
in PHP and every other programming
language so once you learn it you can
take it from one language to the next
and honestly you could hide all of like
this for instance is going to be open
source viewable to every
badi if they just view your source code
of your document and then they go check
out your external javascript file they
can just steal your code but if you did
all of this replacing in PHP nobody can
see what you're doing which would hide
all of your source code for all of this
syntax highlighting logic for me
personally I would just do it in
JavaScript and I don't mind if people
steal my code so that's that okay I'll
see you guys in the next tutorial and
please before you comment under the
video please listen to the discussion
that we had in the very beginning of
this video because it the discussion we
had might address something that you
might feel like commenting about you
might want to link to some pre-existing
third-party syntax highlighter and I'm
just going to delete that comment
anybody can just Google search for a
syntax highlighter program they don't
need you linking to the one that you
like best okay so please refrain from
doing that and if I see other comments
that are reiterating things that I
already said in the video I'll probably
delete that too because it's it's just
regurgitating what I already said and
there's no reason for those comments
to come up but if you have a question or
a legitimate comment please comment in
and we'll try to get an answer for you
okay bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
