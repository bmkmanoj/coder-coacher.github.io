here once again with another flash
animation tutorial using actionscript
3.0 and this one will demonstrate how to
create cool looking 3d sorry animated
cool looking 3d animated Spyro graphs
DNA strands wormholes and tubes using
simple line graphics and shapes before
we get our hands dirty in the
programming side of this lesson I'm
going to showcase these four examples
that I've got here for you guys and
they'll all going to be free for
download at develop PHP calm and you can
inspect them to see exactly how each
example is set up and they all use the
same code but they just have different
animations going on so this one is the
tube and I will have you guys know that
it might look choppy in the YouTube
video it's only because my frame rates
nice and low when I create my videos the
animation looks a whole lot better when
you go and download it and look at it on
the page or on your own machine 3d
spirograph remember these all use the
same code it's just different animations
and tweaking numbers just a little bit
this one is DNA strand 3d animated DNA
strand this one's my favorite I like
that very cool and this one is but i
only have it set to render these out for
a certain amount of seconds and then the
animation just runs loops over itself
and you want to be careful with how many
graphic elements come out to the page if
there was thousands it would definitely
bog down your machine okay I'm going to
be using ActionScript 3 and flash cs3
professional you might be using flash
cs4 or flash cs5 professional but
actionscript-3 works in all three of
those so it should be universal what
we're doing here
alright let's create new actionscript-3
file I'm going to change my background
to black I'm going to bump up the size
of my sage just a little bit here 20 650
and 500 frame rate I'm going to put up
to 30 okay all right now I'm going to
grab my pen tool and draw out of shape
give it a color magenta make sure I
highlight the whole thing right click it
converts a symbol Center registration is
good symbol one in the library is going
to be its name that's fine make sure
it's movie clip and actually let's
export this for action script right here
let's call it element 1 we're exporting
for action script because we're going to
pull it from the library rather than
have it sitting on stage well script it
to pull from the library and place it on
the stage with inner loop so element 1
is how will refer to that library
element press ok when this comes in ok
now we have a class definition set up
for that object so we can just go ahead
and remove it if we want let's zap it
off stage control x now let's go into
the library there's that symbol one
double click it here now what we're
going to do is edit it inside here right
click it and convert to symbol once more
same thing when we clip Center
registration symbol to ok now that the
line is a movie clip inside of symbol
one we have symbol too that's a movie
clip we're going to manually animate it
on the timeline so we're going to be
using a mixture of manual timeline
animation and scripted animation but
first we'll do the manual timeline
animation and then next we'll cover the
scripted so I'm going to go out to
keyframe 10 highlight it press f
X to create a keyframe there I'm going
to go to the transform tool grab free
transform I'm going to skew this thing
i'm going to hold shift i'm going to
skew it to the right one turn two turns
so it kind of flipped it I'm going to
right click here create motion tween or
classic tween whichever you have you can
see what happens it's just spins over
now let's go out to frame 20 f6 again
right click create tween and then with
this one we're going to skew this again
to go all the way around which you can
use code to rotate this but I just feel
like doing it manually I'm going to go
almost all the way to flip it again and
stop right there that way my animation
doesn't look wack e okay let's go back
to see in one and you can see if we go
into the library we dragged out symbol
one we press ctrl + Enter you just see
that thing spinning around there that's
good let's get that off the stage
control x now on this layer one you see
we have nothing there and that's where
we're going to put some code so you
highlight that layer press f9 or you go
to window actions get your actions panel
open press f9 usually opens it and what
we're going to be using is a timer and
an inter frame event the anti frame
event is going to allow us to loop and
the timer is going to work sort of like
a stopwatch in this instance ok so I'm
going to paste in some code that I have
ready that is readily available within
the flash help file let me explain what
it is these first two or simple
variables their number type variables
with a value of zero both of them this
one's name position that one's named rot
for rotation so I just made our OT short
for rotation this little bit of code
is an event of enter frame which is what
we're going to use as our looping
mechanism so whatever happens in this
enter frame event is going to happen 30
times every second and now here we have
a timer set up and this is basic code
that you can get from the flash help
file as well and I named mine sex so you
have bar sex which is the timer object
set to four seconds so it'll count up to
four and then stop and when it timer is
complete we fire off this function
called on time or complete and here it
is right here function on time or
complete remove event listener which is
the enter frame event so that way we're
removing that event that way we don't
keep compounding more and more movie
clips to the stage and bog down the CPU
or GPU if it gets up into the thousands
of the little movie clips that you're
throwing out to stage you don't really
want it to get too high in the movie
clip count and here this line actually
starts the timer so if you didn't have
this line here the timer wouldn't start
counting so we add this line to make the
timer start counting that's how the
timer works and this timer is set up to
when it gets complete at four seconds
we're going to remove the inter-frame
event see here we added the inter-frame
event so if you don't want it to just
keep going you can remove that event and
it'll stop now here inside of our enter
frame event we're going to pull the
movie clip out of our library and add it
to stage many times so we're going to
put bar e one will call it e 1 because
inside the library its element 1 so to
get something ready that's in the
library and you've exported it for
ActionScript you want it ready to be
used within the stage here this is how
you set it up element 1 which is the
name that it was exported for in the
ActionScript equals new element 1
that's it it's ready to be used now we
can position it rotate it do whatever we
want to it and then add child so what
we're going to do first is we'll put it
on stage and see what happens right now
not much is going to happen because we
haven't messed with the position or
rotation but now it should pull it out
and put it on stage within a four second
timer it'll keep adding it to stage but
it probably won't move let's see
control-enter well it's spinning around
but you can't really see it because it's
at a coordinates of zero so that's why
it's in the top left corner and that's
why we have this position variable and
we're going to apply that right now so
let's give this ad child down a couple
of lines right under where we bring the
element from the library make ready for
use we're going to put in a 1 which is
that element that object dot x
coordinate is equal to position which
you can see has a value of zero up top
and we're going to do the same thing for
the y coordinates we're going to set one
more property for the rotation and
that's going to be equal to r 0 T which
is our variable name for the rotation
which is also a 0 right now now we can
change this position number to say
something like 200 and it's going to put
it at a coordinates of 200 x + 200 why
so X 200 y 200 for that object so you
see it's in a different position now to
make this really come alive we need two
more lines and then that's it we're done
position
+ + which iterates it which is very
quickly and a lot but we do have a
ceiling on it now let's go ahead and
control enter and see what happens you
see there takes on a whole new life now
we tweaked it I'm going to take my sex
timer down to a one and you can see what
happens many less instances of that on
stage now what if i take it and make
that a seven it's going to put a whole
lot of them on stage and they'll all be
spinning around all nice so you see
there's a whole lot more of them so you
can see how the timer determines how
many things get put to stage and the
loop is the actual mechanism that adds
things to stage now watch if I didn't
have this position and rotate their
remember and you know they have the
rotation has a value of zero but yet it
still iterates and works to do what we
wanted to do see right there it looks
like it just stops so that's why we have
the rotation say it keeps it going and
the position keeps it moving now we just
go in the library and we have fun with
the symbol double-click symbol to and
let's move it around a little bit let's
cue it
let's move it up let's move it up a
little more I'm going to go right about
here i'm going to highlight just this
piece of that line I changes to white
and I'll change this to maybe a gray and
we'll change this to a nice bright blue
now let's see what happens that since
we've moved it off the center coordinate
is going to be an empty center to that
animation you'll see you see there let's
say you can make your spirograph and
wormholes all right so that's pretty
much it you're back the scene 1 and you
toy with the code you say you put this
on five or six or seven you'll see that
many more instances of it come out and
it starts to make a little to be to type
thing there and the more instances that
come out the more it's going to move
around depending on the way you have
your manual animation set up so if i go
back into symbol to i put something else
in there on the other side it'll fill it
up a little more let's just make that a
nice dark gray
so I think it's a pretty interesting way
to animate and that's pretty much all
there is to it an inter frame event for
looping and the timer event for making
sure we remove that enter frame event so
we don't get too many instances coming
out to stage and you can see the
position iteration and the rotation
iteration is necessary see if I comment
out position you see what it does it
behaves much differently actually that's
a lot more like a real spirograph so
there's a lot of ways you can tweak this
out to get all kinds of different
looking animations change the rotation
and looks like the whole thing kind of
just moves off to the side but with the
position and rotation you get something
that's alive you see even though the
rotation is zero actually this could be
a 02 but that's just if you put it on 0
there it's going to be up in the corner
and you don't want that you want to have
it down in your stage that's why we put
that on 200 ok so I hope you've enjoyed
that lesson and there's going to be
these five examples in the free source
package that you can download from
develop PHP calm and I'm going to put
the link to get to that page where you
can download it in this video's
description here YouTube ok peace guys
have fun and if you make anything really
cool and interesting I'm always
interested to check stuff out just give
a link and i'll check it out please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
