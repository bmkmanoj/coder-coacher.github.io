building video tutorial series this is
going to be just a very short series
this is part one there might be two
parts or three parts I'm not sure yet
but they'll definitely be more than one
part we're going to show how to make a
dress-up application within flash using
ActionScript 3 so you can be using flash
cs3 for this flash cs4 flash cs5 or 5.5
we're going to work with ActionScript 3
we're going to show how when the user
clicks any of the garments on stage or
in the window that garment is
automatically placed onto the doll at
the correct position that it needs to be
at the correct size and any previous
garments for that category let's say if
the doll was already wearing a shirt
here and we click another shirt we want
to take the shirt he's wearing off and
put the new one on so we're going to
show that logic in flash and I mean
that's not all we're going to show how
to have multiple windows so you can have
a shirts windowpane pants windowpane
hats windowpane and footwear just by
having buttons up here or maybe you have
multiple shirts you maybe have like 87
shirts you can have shirts 1 shirts -
shirts 3 button you know what I'm saying
and you can have any kind of menu system
you need for showing these categories of
garments ok I'm working in Flash
Professional cs5 and I'm going to create
a new ActionScript 3 file I'm going to
set my stage size to and say 900 wide
600 high I'm gonna make my background
black my framerate 30
okay now let's double click this and
name it background elements and this is
where you're going to draw any
background elements as things that are
never going to really change on the
scene let me click this so I get more
room here oh I need to open it again so
I can give this around this a little bit
of roundness there now I can close that
again ok so that's what the doll will
sit on top of now let's create another
layer and let's name that one doll now
let's go into fireworks or whatever
program you're working in maybe you're
in
Photoshop and you want to import assets
from Photoshop you can just go to file
import to stage or the library any
assets you want but I'm since I'm
working in fireworks I'm just going to
bring my assets straight in from
fireworks because it's handy like that
so I'm just going to take this doll
which is made up of a whole bunch of
little pieces I drew then none of them
have any filter effects so it'll look
pretty much just like that when I bring
it back in and it'll still be a native
shape it'll all have these native shapes
that I can edit still within flash and
they won't pixelate and things like that
but if you're using photos of things and
you need to have them cut out you can
cut them out in fireworks you can cut
the mallet in Illustrator or you can cut
them out in Photoshop and then import
those assets into Photoshop so I'm going
to press ctrl C and once in flash of the
doll layer I'm going to press control V
and that's going to import and I'm going
to keep all paths editable for mine for
yours if you have photo type cut out
things you want to import as bitmaps so
they maintain appearance and actually
mine is not going to be resized or
anything like that so I could import
this as bitmaps if I want but I'm going
to keep all paths editable so you see
that now if I double click on that
you'll see I have all of my objects
there if I open this up you'll see that
that's a drawing object so it's a native
shape in flash that I can animate or
whatever so it's really handy to know
that kind of you can bring that kind of
stuff straight in from fireworks and
other Adobe products ok I'm going to
lock the doll layer so I don't
accidentally put anything there then I'm
going to highlight the background
elements layer I'm going to draw out a
rectangle primitive and I'm going to
make a simple button and with my
rectangle drawn I'm going to right click
it convert that to symbol that's going
to be a button type symbol okay and I'm
going to give it an instance name of
shirts let's call it shirts 1 now I can
go inside of that button given over
state by pressing f6 on this keyframe
and f6 on this keyframe to make new
keyframes and then give it a different
color just make it turn white whatever
you want to do alright so now you have a
simple button there
I'm going to duplicate that let's say
three times control C control shift V
slide it over and highlight those two
control C control shift V slide those
over to and you can also be bringing
these buttons in just like the doll was
brought in from fireworks you can bring
in your buttons from fireworks Photoshop
or whatever you want I just prefer to
draw a line and flash now let's grab
some text put it on that button make
sure we have classic text static this
one say shirts shirts one and let's make
that black so we can see it and that's
just going to be a label for that button
make it a little bit bigger I'm going to
do the same thing for these other three
you can see I'm not putting my text
fields inside the actual button symbol
in its inner timeline which you can
choose to do if you like I'm just having
some text right on top just for this
simple demonstration okay so this button
is instance name shirts one let's make
this one pants one it really did the
label that you put on them with the text
it doesn't really matter the instance
name does so this one will be hats one
oops
hats one and this one Footwear one
alright so now we have all of our
buttons ready to go with instance names
on them now the reason why we're putting
buttons there and giving them instance
names is because in a moment we're going
to have several windows that we're going
to create one to hold the shirts the
pants the hats and the footwear each
individual little windows and when these
buttons are pressed is going to be bring
that window to the top or you can have
all of your windows sitting off stage
here and when those buttons are pressed
for the corresponding window just make
its X location B over here so you can
choose to do it several different ways
and I'll think for a second which way I
want to do it alright I'm going to draw
another simple rounded rectangle to be
the background for the shirts selections
okay so there's my window where I'm
going to play some shirts and let me go
ahead and save this file before I get
too far and let's press control enter
and see what we have so far see just
simple buttons now there's always four
or five different ways to skin a cat and
flash and I'm just going to show you one
method that I just happen to think is
the very simplest method to use
but apart from using the method I'm
going to show you you can choose to pull
things dynamically out of the library
but what I'm going to show you how to do
is dynamically change the elements
within a movie clip to change the
garments rather than pull them out from
the library we're going to structure out
a movie clip that's going to have all of
the shirts in it another movie clip is
going to have all of the pants another
movie clip will have all of the hats etc
etc okay so that's the method I'm going
to show you and like I said if you want
to be a super dorky expert you can put
all of your movie clip garments into the
library in flash export them for
ActionScript and then call them when
needed it's a very simple thing to do to
export an element in your library for
ActionScript and then script them out
from the library when needed and I have
tutorials on that but we don't want to
over complicate things do we why don't
we keep things simple if it can be made
simple let's make it simple okay so I'm
one for I'm one for having very complex
code and doing things the ultra geeky
way but I'm also one for getting a job
done getting a project finished and
getting paid okay now I'm going to go
back into fireworks or if you're in
Photoshop or whatever or if you're in
flash and you wanted to just import any
graphics for shirts or whatever any
garments you just import them to the
stage now but I'm going to take mine
from fireworks here you can see it's at
the exact size it needs to be from my
doll I'm going to press ctrl C and then
back in flash I'm going to make a new
layer I'm going to call that dynamic
garments clips and I'm going to paste
that new element control V to that layer
I'm going to keep all my paths editable
if you have pictures you want to import
as bitmaps okay okay so there's my fur
shirt and what I'm going to do is put
that directly on the doll where it
should go and let me open up this so you
can see the properties panel and
everything
now let's highlight that movie clip that
we placed exactly where it needs to go
on the avatar or on the doll let's check
out its coordinates let's make those
even coordinates I don't like those
decimal coordinates and my doll is on
even coordinates as well let's bring
that right about there that looks good
now if you double-click inside of that
you'll see that you have a drawing
object or you would have maybe a bitmap
image in there alright so there's the
doll there's your dynamic clip garments
with the shirt on it on that layer we're
going to right click that converts a
symbol and I'm just making this in
contained into another movie clip I'm
going to call this shirts in the library
it has a registration of top left point
and make sure that's not a button but a
movie clip press ok now let's give it an
instance name of shirts now I'm showing
you this method that way when you double
click inside this is still a movie clip
and it's not that drawing object like it
was because inside of this now we're
going to bring in all the shirts and
we're going to put each one on a frame
and then we'll have frame labels under
it so let's put a new layer here and
let's call this labels or you can have
the labels on top it doesn't matter
let's call this shirt movie clips shirt
clips these are going to be imported
movie clips that you import to each one
of these frames I'm going to show you
how to do that now if you're using say
native shapes like I am you really
wouldn't have to import anything else I
could pretty much change the color of
this native shape here within flash and
then just put a green one whatever
colors I want in these different layers
but most people would be using maybe
garments that they clipped out and mark
eat out of Photoshop or fireworks or
something like that but keep in mind if
you're using raw native shapes like I am
here these can just be
placed the drawing objects can be placed
within these frames here and you don't
have to bring in different movie clips
but as you can see in fireworks here I
have tank tops so I'm going to have to
definitely bring in the tank tops but
we'll set it up like these were all like
cut out photos of garments and things
like that that you would bring in from
Photoshop or fireworks
now the shirt needs to go in the shirt
Clips later so let's press control X and
let's put it on the shirt clips layer
control shift V actually let's make a
new keyframe on frame two and let's pop
that black shirt right there because I'm
frame one you want your guy to be naked
or whatever the default garment is when
the application loads for the person
who's going to play dress up
you put that default item here in my
case it's going to be a naked little
doll or avatar sitting there and then
they can proceed to dress him with the
clothes
so my frame one is going to be empty
there so let's go ahead and make one
more layer actually and let's call this
a s3 and we're going to put a stop
action on this layer so this little
movie clip doesn't loop the role it's
frames on its own we want to control the
frames so it'll stop frame one and not
proceed down through any of these other
frames until we direct it to that's how
it's all going to work and let me show
you how we're going to set up the frame
labels now you can go to labels key
frame one and you can type in default so
now if you extend that out you could say
you can see that says default as a frame
label there now let's press control
I'm sorry press f6 and make a new
keyframe on frame two let's call this
black your different type of shirts you
know tank top whatever actually we'll
have to name this black tea black tea
and then you can put a blue t and then
when I bring my tank tops I'll name it
like black tank blue tank red tank so
you want to have them all different
names for each different shirt now I'll
just show you how to add the second one
so let's make a keyframe here and really
you don't want that movie clip there you
press control X and let's bring in the
next shirt and fireworks
alright let's press control-c and
fireworks and back in flash right there
on this keyframe control V okay now I'm
going to pop that right where it needs
to go to meet up with the crosshair in
top left corner and there you have it
219 and 304 so that way when the person
might select the green t-shirt to go up
it'll go from whatever it is by default
or maybe it's on the black shirt it'll
go from that to the green shirt and
that'll be like effectively removing the
one that was on before it and going to
the next selection so right here you
just press f6 and you make this one say
green tea I'm going to repeat that
process for all of the shirts that I
have okay so you see what I have inside
of my shirts movie clip is stop action
on frame 1 on the a s 3 layer then I
have the shirts clip layer which has the
black shirt the green shirt and the blue
shirt and those are black tee you can
see the frame label for that keyframe
corresponding to what shirt name it is
so this one's blue t for that frame
label this one's green tea and this
one's black tea and this one was default
to remember now what's going to happen
is when we actually put these shirts out
in this white area here we're going to
make it to where when the user clicks
that shirt we direct this inner timeline
of this movie clip to actually put that
shirt on the doll okay so let's go
double click over here in the grey or
you can just click on scene 1 here and
now we're back and you'll notice that
you if you have no default garment like
your doll is naked like mine you will
not have
actually you can stick a little handle
in here if you want so you can make
another layer and name it handle this is
a little trick for you guys that if you
happen to not have things on frame one
but you still want to see it on stage
you can make a handle you just make it a
little rectangle or something and put it
offstage see now on my handles layer
that's on frame one so I'll always see
that off to the side there so I can
click to get into my shirts movie clip
anytime I want now let's just lock that
handle layer let's go back in the scene
one you can see you can't see your
shirts at all but you can still see this
and get to it easily oh yeah let me show
you one more thing in case you didn't
catch on to it we're going to add one
more here so let's put a keyframe there
and keyframe there and let's label this
black tank that'll be a black tank top
there and since those tank tops are a
different width there are different
sizes in the shirt so I'll show you how
to put those in the correct place let's
extend that out extend that out by
pressing f5 which is really not
necessary but I like to keep all those
even now in this layer let's remove that
get the black tee or the black tank top
and put it there okay pasting from
fireworks again and what I want to do is
put that into the correct position and
it doesn't have to be at the same
coordinates see others where the top
left corner is at the top left corner of
this crosshair you just put it on the
doll exactly where it looks like it
should go all right there you go so as
you can see it's at a different
coordinates but all you have to do is
eyeball it and put it where it needs to
go that's why this is the simplest way
to get this done you can see this one
says black tank as its frame label and
there's a black tank top on it and it's
pretty gay looking actually but that's
okay so I'll define okay now we go back
to the main scene it's do the same thing
for the pants let's import some pants
now okay so to the dynamic garments
layer I'm going to import the first set
of pants and place them where they
should go onto the doll make sure
they're coordinates or even because they
like even coordinate
that's good now let's do the same thing
convert to symbol in the library let's
call it pants registration top left
movie clip okay
now I'll give it an instance name of
pants just like we did for the shirts
movie clip here this one has a movie
clip or an instance name now of pants
we're going to do the same exact thing
that I did for the shirts movie clip I'm
going to give it a handle and everything
inside of this pants movie clip here
I shouldn't have to repeat that process
because you guys watched carefully and
you know exactly what to do now for the
pants the hats and any footwear so I'm
not going to waste your time by
repeating those steps okay so now you
see how to structure out those movie
clips to keep things really simple so
we'll pick up in part two where I show
you how to make these buttons enabled to
bring in different windows of garments
for instance shirts pants hats etc and
then once those windows are showing up
for us we'll show you how when the items
within those windows are clicked it
changes the shirts movie clip and pants
movie clip to the corresponding garment
that it should that'll be in part two
and maybe there'll be two maybe three
videos in this series I might be able to
knock it all out in the second video but
I think most of you guys have a grasp on
where I'm going with this and how I'm
going to structure it out and set it up
and you can almost go on your own and
try and get it going but I'm going to
make the second video anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
