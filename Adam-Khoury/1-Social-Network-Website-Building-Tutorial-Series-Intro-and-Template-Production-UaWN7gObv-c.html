2.0 social network website building
series in which you can learn how to
build the foundation of a custom-made
social site that you can expand with
your own custom applications after you
go through the series and get your
foundation laid out in this first video
I'm going to talk for just a quick
minute about some important things that
you may want to know before the series
begins then we'll jump right into
production of the site this series will
move faster than the last social
community series we offer three or four
years ago this series will also replace
and completely deprecated the older
series of videos because three or four
years ago we were using standard code
that was standard then that has now been
replaced by cool things like html5 and
css3 that weren't available back then
we're also going to use MySQL I this
time around instead of MySQL and that
will give you better database
performance in your scripts all right
now let's take a look at the hot points
of what we're going to be covering we'll
be covering a little bit more than what
you see here but these are just the
major applications that we'll be showing
you how to produce now in this first
video I'm going to start with the html5
plus PHP website template design and
construction and we'll make sure that it
validates 100% all through production
that way you can show your viewers or
your site users that you know what
you're doing with your code then we're
going to move along to database creation
and the table structure for any
information storage that we need on the
site will also have register login
logout and all of the initial forms that
you'll need for your site and these next
five things or things that were highly
requested by you guys the viewers who
had gone through the last lesson series
you are asking for things that were not
shown in that lesson series like a new
type of friend system then another thing
that is really highly requested by you
guys is the conversation system really
the blab system completed so what will
happen is if say I'm your friend on the
site I'll be able to go to your profile
and say what's up to you I'll be like
hey what's up dude and then you can say
you can
apply to me directly under where I made
my comment to you so it'll work like the
google+ or twitter or facebook
conversation systems on the wall because
a lot of you guys requested to see how
do you let somebody comment on another
person's profile and how do you reply to
that comment that they made and how do
you let others just join in the
conversation if they see it and they
happen to be your friend we're going to
cover all those things in the new
conversation system also have a
notifications system and you guys know
what that is anytime something happens
on the site that you might need to be
notified about will send a notification
to the database for you and then when
you come to the site next you'll see all
your notifications for all the activity
that's happened that you might be
concerned with and you guys also asked
for photo gallery system and I can show
you how to do that it's very simple to
setup a gallery system for your users
since each person gets a folder when
their profile is created or their
account is created on your site and we
can easily put more folders into that
folder for their galleries so we'll let
them upload pictures and if they want
they can also start galleries and we'll
just magically create folders using PHP
when they want to go start a new gallery
and then finally we'll cover a block
member system because some people will
be annoying to other people on your site
and you'll want to give your users the
ability to block annoying people so
those are the major things that we'll
show throughout the lesson series and by
no means will it be a complete super
polished ready-to-go
site but it'll show you the foundations
of building your own social site from
scratch so you can get your own custom
applications and have a really unique
feel to your social adventure that you
offer to people all right let's rock and
roll we're going to start with the
website template design and construction
we're going to use html5 CSS or css3
whatever you fancy and PHP to make smart
region templates for the for the header
of the site and the footer and any other
sections that might be the same on all
the pages and we'll make sure that it
validates 100% all through production
okay I have my header graphics already
created for the site
and if you need video tutorials about
how to make vector graphics for the web
you can check out my fireworks playlist
on YouTube it will show you how to use
fireworks to create vector graphics the
way I do and it's important for you guys
to realize that you don't have to use
fireworks you can use Photoshop
Illustrator GIMP or any graphics editor
that you feel most comfortable with okay
so don't give me a hard time about what
graphics editor I choose to use just use
whatever the hell you want and leave me
be with the graphics editor that I enjoy
using you can use whatever you want I'm
not trying to push any Adobe tools and
you guys or anything alright alright so
like I said if you want to understand
how to create vector graphics the way I
do in fireworks you can watch all of my
fireworks effective tutorials on YouTube
so I'm not gonna bore people waste
anybody's time with showing them how I
made any of these graphics here you can
see I can just move them around they're
just shapes place there that's just text
to place there and this is just my
little logo thing you can see under it
is a half a black shape for the bottom
portion and then on top there's a faded
white shape okay so you can see how it
gives it a little depth in there now
this is the color palette that I choose
to work with I'm going to use shades of
white and gray I'm going to use shades
of this color green and I'm also going
to have blue because all of my links are
going to be blue so I'm going to throw
blue into the design as well okay now
what I'm going to do is take these three
shapes here what I have is one rectangle
one little line shape you can see there
and then a rectangle on top let me put
those back I'm going to take them just
as they're sitting there ctrl C go to
file new okay and paste now fit canvas
and then go to canvas size and let's go
ahead and change the width to you can
make it as small as 4 pixels if you want
but I'll just make it 10 pixels okay and
so you can see I have just a sliver now
that I'm going to use CSS code to make
it repeat I'm going to make that sliver
repeat all throughout my header that way
I can have really light loading graphics
that'll load really fast
take up a lot of space in the page
basically it'll repeat all through the
width of the users browser window in the
header now go to your desktop real quick
because you're going to need a new
folder for your website you can just
name it name that folder whatever your
website is named maybe you don't want
any spaces in there you can put a little
underscore so mine is web intersect and
then double click inside of that folder
and you'll see it's empty and the first
thing you want to do is put a new folder
inside of it called root and that's
going to be your root or your like your
public HTML folder where your index file
will live inside of that root folder and
then we'll make another folder next to
the root folder and we'll name that
source imagery and you can save the
imagery that you're working on maybe all
the PNG source for the imagery that
you're working on inside of this folder
that way you never lose the initial
files that you're working with via
graphics and stuff you can save them all
right there and then your root system
will be right here where your index file
and everything will live in there ok you
got it so now let's go to file and
export this little sliver for the header
continue the web continue exit and then
I'm going to save mine as a PNG 30 to
export and you go into your site folder
for your new website and in the root
folder with your index file and all your
pages are going to live basically we're
going to have a new folder call that
style that's going to be all your CSS
style sheets and all your style graphics
so you double click inside of style now
and you're going to save this as header
sliver so it'll be header sliver dot PNG
save and you can actually close that now
now let's check what the height of these
shapes are going to be for the header
sliver and that's going to be 90 so what
I'll do now is take my little logo icon
ctrl C go to file new and instead of the
height be in 96 I'm going to make sure
the height is 90 okay and I'm going to
leave the canvas transparent like that
okay press ctrl V
then I'll just try to put it in the
center the best I can if I needed to
move it around later or whatever I can
change the graphic and re output the P
and G and replace it on the web and fix
it up so let's take a look if it needs
to be a little higher one to right about
there
file export wizard continue continue
exit and let's make this PNG 32 as well
with a transparent Mac export and we're
going to put this in the images folder
so we don't have one of those yet all we
have is a style folder in our route
public HTML so far we have a style so
let's go ahead and put in images folder
because we're going to need that in the
images folder let's just name this logo
dot PNG it'll be a dot PNG you save now
you have let's see what we have here in
our folder system we have our root or
our public HTML and then we have our
style and images folder inside of that
and shortly we'll have an index page
here next to these two folders in your
images folder you have your logo and in
the style folder you have your header
sliver okay you can go ahead and close
that untitled file now and this little
guy should be the last graphics i need
because these are all just going to be
text or buttons that I create through
CSS this is all going to be HTML CSS
rendered and actually I'm going to need
this one too so I'm going to do the same
thing I'm going to save these items I'm
going to go to control C file new okay
pop it into place make sure canvas fit
is tight make sure it's PNG with no
canvas transparent canvas file export
wizard continue that bit blair go
through all that go to PNG 32 matte
transparent export and then put that in
the images as well call it the home
so to be home dot PNG save I'm going to
do the same exact thing for this little
magnifying glass here that's going to be
used for my search mechanism and I'm
also going to show you guys how to put a
search page in place maybe I might show
you how to make a search page using
Google custom search engine but I won't
make any promises on that that way you
don't have to program anything in Google
search is a really smart search with
nice algorithms really indexes your site
well and pulls the appropriate data out
when people search it works really well
in develop PHP com Adam Cory comm
anywhere I have it in place it works
really well I might show you guys how to
do that whatever and another important
aspect of this whole training series is
that you have to be on a live server
with your website online you gotta buy
com you can have free hosting usually
most hosts will offer free hosting
packages if you buy the dot-com or maybe
if you buy hosting they offer you free
com usually some deal like that but
usually for 10 bucks or whatever you can
get started so I'm not going to
recommend that anybody use wamblam
Poor's amp or any locally driven systems
that are on their local computer
I would like anybody following this
series to work directly online on the
actual site that they're going to be
running that way there's no conflicts at
all when it comes time to migrate the
site from local to the real live server
you're going to be working on the live
server the whole time there won't be any
conflicts no migration issues okay
that's why we do that okay so that takes
care of all the work we'll have to do in
a graphics editor for now now you want
to open up your code editor and
whichever code editor you choose to use
is just fine I happen to be using Adobe
Dreamweaver cs5 I don't care what code
editor you use and I don't recommend any
over any others you can use notepad plus
plus BB edit whatever the hell you want
to use all right so create a new PHP
file and we're going to just save this
right off the bat your website folder go
to root and right here in the root
folder with the images folder in the
Styles folder you
name this index this is your homepage so
you have index.php ready to go go ahead
and just remove all of that code because
if you look at that code it's using
xhtml 1.0 transitional so that's like
HTML 4 and we're able to use HTML 5 now
and everything validate so we might as
well use HTML 5 and get rid of this HTML
4 in order to do that we can just run to
develop PHP comm so you go to develop
PHP comm in the HTML section I have a
couple of pages that have a skeleton for
an HTML web page before you put any
content in it so I'm going to grab that
right here and this is under the HTML
primary elemets page so under the HTML
primary elements page just grab that
code right there ctrl C go into your
document that's index dot PHP ctrl V
okay so let's just make the title now in
the head element you're going to want
let's put it right under the title let's
put a style element style type text/css
make sure you go down a couple of lines
and close your style element now we have
a place to put all of our CSS now where
this h2 element is let's get rid of that
and just place a div this div let's give
it an ID equal to page top now while
we're at it let's just go ahead and add
two more divs one two this one we'll
call page middle and this one page
bottom so basically you have your header
footer and your page content areas
alright let's target the page top div
with our CSS so we can put a pound sign
and that ID to target that element open
the curly brace go down close with the
closing curly brace the first thing we
know that it must have a height of 90
pixels because that is the size that our
little sliver was and let's make sure
the sliver is in there as a background
so background URL go to your
style folder and header sliver PNG put
space repeat and let's make sure we
repeat X repeat X is repeat across the
horizontal plane repeat Y is repeating a
graphic on the vertical plane so we just
wanted to make sure it'll do it by
default but we just put this in here to
make sure it repeats it will do it by
default though you really don't even
need that there and it will repeat by
itself all right so we press ctrl s and
if you want to view this in your
favorite browser now you can look at it
and you can see that the header graphics
are in place that's liver now we want to
make sure you saw how that space was
around the page that marginal space
around my header graphics I don't like
that so what I'm going to do is make the
body I'm going to target the body
element and make it have a margin of
zero pixels all the way around top right
bottom and left that way when I look at
it in the browser now it's perfect it
goes all the way and it fills all the
space there now all I have to do is put
my little logo in place where I want it
we're going to need a new div inside of
page top it's going to be 1000 pixels
wide and what will happen is let's look
at this in the browser you can see my
browser window is 1600 pixels wide
because that's the screen resolution
that I have so my header graphics repeat
all the way through those 1600 pixels no
matter how many pixels it is but what I
want is in the center of the page is a
1000 with div so that way I can have my
logo about right here and then maybe
search over here and log in links over
here and stuff but you could have
everything spread way out to where your
logo is way over here your search is
over there but I want to constrain mine
to the middle of the page and by the way
we'll be taking all of this CSS within
this style element and we'll be putting
it in a dot CSS stylesheet to
externalize it when we're done so inside
of the page top let's indent with two
spaces and then let's put div and close
the div let's give it an ID equal to
page top wrap so all we need is CSS rule
for that
HRM so let's grab that ID we can say
page top page top rep so inside of your
ID of page top you target ID page top
rap and you give it the CSS properties
that you want first thing I know I want
is the width of 1000 pixels but like I
said you can make yours 100% and it'll
be all the way across and actually if
you're going to do that you don't even
need this page top rap if you just put
everything in Page top because it's
already 100% across and we have to make
sure we set the margin to zero fix Auto
and what that does is it sets the top
and bottom margins to zero pixels and
the right and left margins to auto that
way it's centers that div and I can show
you what I mean by giving us a border
let's give it a border color some bright
color one pixel dashed and I'm just
putting this border here so you can
actually see it and let's give it a
height of 90 pixels just like the page
top div now we go to our browser and we
refresh the page you can see it's a div
1000 pixels wide correctly in the center
of my header graphics and I want my logo
right about here and I want my search
over here login links here and I'm going
to want my main menu links to be next to
my logo here on this bottom bar so I can
remove that dashed line because I just
wanted to show you guys how it's going
to show up there where it's going to be
positioned so let's remove that border
and now we're going to need one more for
the logo so let's just copy that CSS
rule let's get rid of all this and let's
go into a child div of page top wrap
that we can name page top logo so if we
take this div we can just copy this div
go inside of it down a couple of lines
open it up indent two spaces and put a
new div and call it page top logo so
inside of page top you have page top
wrap and then inside of page top wrap
you have page top logo we're
so going to put some other divs inside
of page top wrap because remember page
top wrap is this div that is a thousand
pixels wide it's just going to be
containing all the other divs that we
want inside of there that are holding
all the the elements within our header
so inside of the page top logo rule
we're going to add the background URL
image that's within our images folder of
logo dot PNG you can make that height of
90 because that's the height that the
image has 90 pixels so let's go to the
browser and see what we have
refresh you can see it's repeating
through there so let's make sure we have
no repeat in the background property
space no-repeat actually you know what I
change my mind I'm going to make it an
actual image tag instead of having a
background in there I'm going to go into
page type logo right here and I'm going
to put image and for the source
attribute I'm just going to browse for
that image logo because I want that to
be an actual image that is indexed
within search engines and things like
that or just an image that people can
grab if they want ctrl s and let's give
this an alt attribute that way our code
validates when we go to check it you can
just name that logo or web intersect
logo whatever you want now if we look at
that we can see we just have the one
there and we just want to make sure that
that div let's just go check the width
of that image the width is it's 108
width by 90 height so I can go and give
that a 1:08 width as well 108 pixels now
if I look at the page it looks the same
but when I put any other content
containers up in the page top wrap
they'll just go next to that div because
we'll float all of them inside of there
so we'll maybe float three divs this div
should be floating actually page top
logo let's make it float left and that's
how you can make divs being horizontally
right next to one another in an area of
the page if you don't do that they'll
stack on top of each other horizontally
go
down the page but you want them to stack
next to each other vertically going
across so you can float each one left
that's inside of the page top wrap okay
so down in the page top logo div the
image element we have we can also give
that a title you can say web intersect
2.0 and now we're going to wrap that in
an a element so what we can do is bring
this div down and inside of that div we
know we have to indent our image tag and
then wrapped around that image tag we're
going to put an a element that way it's
a link to our homepage a href HTTP colon
forward slash forward slash WWE domain
and the moment we'll put this on line
and we'll actually validate it through
the online validation service the
official place to check your code
validation on line and if there's any
little syntax mistakes or whatever we'll
fix it right up but I don't think we'll
have any problems so now if we press
ctrl s and save and we refresh our
browser view of this we should have a
link and when we go over that icon or
that logo it says web intersect 2.0 so
now you have your header graphics in
place your logo is in place and you know
you can float any other divs right next
to this logo div across the page this
way within that 1000 with page top
wrapped container so let's make a div
that floats right next to the page top
logo and we'll call it page top rest
that will hold the rest of your page top
content because I'm just going to put
two divs in there and they'll stack
horizontally automatically so that'll
take care of that and I'll show you what
I mean so all I need is a div called
page top rest let's take this one page
top logo let's go right next to page top
logo inside of page top wrap and let's
place that new div and let's make it say
page top rest instead of page top logo
now since our wrap is 1000 pixels wide
and the logo within it is a hundred and
eight pixels wide this width could be
892
8 9 to 8
now let's just give it a background
color temporarily just to see where
we're working let's give it this light
gray now let's view this in the browser
refresh that's just about right now I
know everything that I put in there will
be just right because I'm going to have
two divs inside of this container that
little gray container there that new one
we just put in one div is going to rest
in that top bar the other Dave is going
to rest right under it in that bottom
bar so I'll have space to put all my
junk I'll show you what I mean right now
let's go inside a page top rest and then
twice and put two divs and we can make
their Heights virtually the same so the
target those two divs in your CSS just
copy this go down here and we're going
to go into Page top breast any divs any
developments within page top breast will
be affected by this CSS so what we could
do is see how they stack up by giving
them a certain height say we give them
45 each or let's say 42 each something
like that they don't have to float:left
because they're going to stack
horizontally their default behavior and
we don't need a width on those at this
point we'll remove this background color
off of page top rest because that was
temporary anyway that solid gray and
we'll leave the two divs solid gray that
way we can just see him give it a border
color whatever bright color you want
this is just temporary so you can see it
and now let's run this in our favorite
browser locally you can see what you
have so judging by my borders I just
need to make these a little higher than
42 maybe 43 actually 44 and then no
border that should do it now if I look
at this it'll be just a grey block but
there'll be two divs there don't you
worry so now basically within this first
div you can put all of the links or
whatever items that you want to be in
this darker top gray bar and then in the
bottom div that's under that one you can
put all the links and junk that you want
in that bottom gray bar so now you
have the content areas ready to get that
done so let's take the background color
off and we can start to put things
within those now I know in this bottom
div I'm going to want link to my home
page which was the little house right
here that little graphic I want that and
some more links right next to it so we
can copy this href if it's going to go
to the home page of the site you can
just copy that href put it right there
and you can take this image tag if you
want and put it right inside of that a
tag just make sure we have the right
name so let's look at that folder root
images and it's home dot PNG so this is
home dot PNG alt home and title I don't
really want yeah we'll just put a title
of home that way when the users mouse
goes over it
a little caption of home comes up now
see what you have and it will be
probably tucked in the right corner or
the top left corner so you see how it's
tucked in the top left corner there's a
few different ways in CSS to skin this
cat you can push this down several
different ways in CSS I'll just show you
one way to get this down into the middle
actually I've decided I want to target
these two divs independently so I'm
going to put menu one for that one and
then the one under it I'm going to have
menu to our prep and then up here in the
CSS we just put a pound sign here since
menu one and menu two are nested inside
of page top rest we can just target them
their page tab breasts go in there and
tool menu one and let's make another
rule for menu 2 this way you can style
them independently because you might
have different heights they might need
different heights they might need
different padding they might need all
different setup so within menu 2 right
by my little house I'm going to have
another a element and I'll just put
pound sign for now and instead of an
image that's going to say menu item 1
now let's put another menu item in there
ok so you have 3 al
instead of your menu items it's called
this menu item - and they can navigate
to any address that they need - you just
put the address right there any page now
in order to push all of those links down
without attempting to give them padding
or anything like that silly I'm just
going to put a div to wrap around those
three links indent them into that div
and then I can use this sort of rule
menu - div and let's give that a border
of a bright color dashed line to give it
a height let's say I don't know 24
pixels whatever you want and let's take
a look at that see what we have okay so
now you see what we have to do we have
to push that div down a little bit so
let's see what happens if we give it a
margin if it doesn't work with margin
top will give it inner padding say 12
pixels now let's see what that gives us
okay that works that's about right in
the middle - actually I'm not going to
push it down so far maybe eight pixels
and I'll give it an inner padding of
about four pixels and I'll remove the
height completely now let's see what we
have okay that looks good all right so I
can remove that dashed line and I can
target all of the a elements that are
within that div and we can give that I'd
give it a unique ID if we need to as
well so let's target all of the a
elements within that div and let's make
their color the light gray and their
text-decoration:none because I don't
want underlines on those links so now
let me see what I have all right now
what you can do is make these all block
elements or you can just give them more
padding let's see let me let me pad them
I give them padding top to bottom of
zero pixels and padding left and right
of 24 pixels let's see what that does
see how it spreads everything out but it
also makes the link bigger you might not
want that you might just want maybe
marginal space between there so to get
marginal space between those and not
padding to separate them like that you
can just make them all float and be
block so you say display:block which
makes them a block level display element
and then you can float them left float
left and then all you do is remove this
padding and just make it margin space
and top bottom zero pixels left right 24
pixels so now if you refresh you'll have
pretty much the same thing but they
won't be extending the links into area
where they're not residing the links is
just the word or the button whatever
you're using you can make these turn
different colors when the users mouse
goes over it as well by just giving the
a element a hover State so you go a
colon hover and then then you can change
you don't have to have text decoration
the margin any of that crap all you have
to have to change the design on it is
the color and all the other properties
will stay so you can change it to
whatever color you're working with
whatever you want okay now if we go and
check it out you can see they turn that
bright green these are mouths goes over
them let's just make this 16 sorry about
that there that looks good to me and at
this point you'll want to choose your
font now that you have text on the page
so let's go to our body element and you
can target the body element if you want
and just choose a font family and I'll
choose Tahoma and a default font size
for all the regular bonds on the page
let's make it I guess 14 and be good you
make it whatever size you want and then
refresh and you'll see how everything
looks and you can change the size the
fonts on these independently using
this rule right here you can just put an
extra property of font-size in that rule
and you'll effect just those menu items
okay now let's go into the menu one div
and let's also give that the inner
structure that this menu too has one to
indent and there you go now we can
remove all of this and here we're going
to type in signup login and that'll be a
link to your login page but we're not
going to put the address to it yet
because we don't even have that page
created now in the CSS since we're
working inside of menu one we can just
copy this one right here this rule
control C go up underneath menu one and
put that new rule in place change this
from menu two to menu one and you're
going to target the div that's inside of
menu one and you can go ahead and give
it a dashed border just to see where
you're working so if i go and i refresh
my page you can see I have a new div up
there now and putting that in place the
way I did made it to where these menu
items got pushed down so what we can do
is fix their padding see that margin top
eight pixels just make it margin top
zero pixels but menu two div refresh and
they go back up to the middle actually I
might leave that on to pixels yeah
that's good now everything that I want
for the user let's go ahead and change
the color on that all right remove the
dashed green border and what you can do
is copy this rule and use it for menu
one as well but we don't want our links
to be display:block we don't want
anything to float:left we do want that
color for our links and we want that
text decoration to be none and for now
we don't need any margin on those but we
do want everything inside of the div
menu one div to be aligned to the right
we put text-align:right control s and
then go to your browser or see what you
have there you go now you have to do
exchange the color of that make sure the
text decoration is none oh this should
be menu one sorry and now if we look
there you go
now that's a link and you can give that
as hover State just like the other one
has and we're only doing these so
specifically and independently because
they're going to be special links or
special menu items up in the header of
the website let's change this from menu
to the menu one div inside of the div a
tags any a tag is the hover they turn
green on hover so let's test it out
those do and now that does as well okay
so when your user is where your visitors
are not logged in this is the link
they'll see but we'll have some dynamic
PHP and place soon enough to where when
they are logged in we're going to have
special stuff up there but you logged in
members and you have that whole space
that whole stretch of area to give them
things we're going to put a search
mechanism right here so you got plenty
of space for all kind of stuff using a
header of this type alright so let's go
back into fireworks and see just the the
graphics that we were messing around
with so this is what I started with and
fireworks this is how it's translated to
the web using code all custom code we're
not using any code that fireworks
outputs which is using fireworks for
make our separated graphics and then
we're using CSS to position everything
correctly and it's all hands on custom
code that way you can make sure it all
validates in its all proper all right
now up in the head element let's go
ahead and link to our fav icon and you
know the fav icon is that's a little
graphic you get up in the browser
address bar and stuff like that okay now
let's start to modulate this template so
what we'll do is add another link
element to our style sheet which will be
in our style folder and it will be named
style dot CSS so all we have to do is go
and create that file now so go to new
CSS
you can get rid of all that press ctrl s
to save it and you can see we're in our
folder system here go to style inside of
the style folder style that CSS that'll
be the name of it so you can see we have
style dot CSS here now all we have to do
is grab all of our CSS that's within our
style element control X and remove it
and you can also backspace that style
element if you want now when you have
control X all of that CSS you press
control V and you can paste it into your
style that CSS page and all you have to
do is change this link to the head
sliver that PNG you don't have to go
inside the style folder to link to that
anymore because you're already in the
style folder with this style dot CSS
page so you just link directly to header
sliver that PNG so now if you go to your
index file you'll see no none of our CSS
is there but if we check in the browser
all of our CSS is applied to the page
that's because we're linking to that
style sheet now if we make another page
or fifty or a hundred thousand different
other pages we don't have to change our
style on all of those pages in the head
tag we can just change the style inside
the style sheet and all of our thousands
of pages will reflect those changes that
we make in one little place okay that's
why it's good to do that so all of the
major part of your site design layout
you can put within style that CSS there
now before we go any much further with
the design template we have to put it
online make sure it passes validation as
html5 so you now have to FTP this file
up to your web server your live web
server that way we can properly validate
it okay here I am with the start of my
design actually online at web intersect
com I'm going to open a new tab and I'm
just going to type into the search HTML
validator and then I'll click usually is
the first link there it's the world wide
web consortiums markup validation
service and I'll just put the address
from my com right there check
okay we pass this document was
successfully checked as html5 that means
everything is clean and as it should be
within the files code so far the doctype
is HTML by our encoding type was
detected so you have to have an encoding
type and your doctype to make sure it
all validates is html5 you can also just
go directly to index dot PHP if you want
to make sure it's targeting the right
file that you want to check and
revalidate you can see everything's good
let's check a CSS validation
congratulations no errors found in our
CSS so far that's great so we're doing
really good
so now when you finish your site or as
you're working on it you can have in
your photo you can have a link to check
the pages validation you can that way
people visitors come to your site
they'll know that your page is validated
okay okay now I'm going to use HTML and
CSS pretty much the same way I did for
the header just to customize my little
page bottom footer and I'm not going to
show that on video because I feel it'll
be redundant you guys should have a good
grasp on how HTML and CSS works if
you're venturing into building a social
network for Christ's sake you better
have a good grasp on basic HTML and CSS
if you're trying to build the social
network I'll punch you in the face okay
now in the page middle div I put a space
character and then in the page bottom
div I put the copyright symbol 2013 web
intersect so in my style dot CSS I
targeted those two elements page middle
and page bottom so I gave the page
middle height of nine hundred pixels
just temporarily because there's no
content in there yet Page middle here in
the index when you add content here you
go and remove the height 900 here all
right so let's take the header or the
page top let's collapse all the code
inside of it so you can still see that
we just have those three divs that we
started with page top page middle and
page bottom now inside of page top you
have some more content containers to
hold the things that you need inside of
page top now what we want to do is make
this website design even smarter
using PHP so what we'll do is we'll go
to file new and create a new PHP file
remove all the content that's with
within that PHP file press ctrl s or
just go up to file save you're going to
save it right next to index type PHP and
you're going to name it template
underscore page top and you'll have a
dot PHP extension save so you have
template page type PHP so now if you
don't have PHP running locally this will
fail to display for you
well it'll display in Dreamweaver but it
won't display in your browser if you
don't have PHP running locally so you'll
have to test online once you go and
modulate is template this way so right
here take all the code that's div ID
page top its opening and closing tag
control X go into template page top that
PHP ctrl V and now just save that go
back into index dot PHP and you're going
to add PHP code to include once so we'll
use the include once function we'll
close our PHP block and inside of that
function we'll specify the file that we
want to include one two a to template
underscore page type PHP press ctrl s
and now in Dreamweaver go to design view
and you'll see that all of your graphics
and your page top and your header is
there even though in the code view all
you're doing is running and include once
to that template page top that PHP now
the reason why you do this is because if
you have a thousand pages on your
website or even twenty or fifty pages on
your website you don't have to go into
all of those different pages to change
whatever you want in the header let's
say a month down the line you want to
change this link to say something
different or you want to move things
around in the header or whatever add new
content you don't want to change have to
change it in all 50 or 100 pages so what
you can do to help you is use a PHP
template which can just really basically
hold all the HTML code that you
- or whatever code you want you can have
PHP in here as well but now if you go to
your index out PHP and you run it in
your favorite browser locally I turn to
PHP off just to demonstrate this on my
local machine you see I get nothing so
you can't really test your design
locally but you can if you're using
Dreamweaver by going into design view
what you can do is put this whole thing
online along with template a page type
PHP and see what happens so put up the
new index style sheet and the template
page type PHP FTP those three files to
the web now now if I go to the web where
this is live and I refresh you'll see
that I have all of my header graphics
and all of my HTML content that is
within template page top that way if I
make a contact page your listings page
of some sort or whatever all I have to
do is include once like I'm doing here
in index our PHP include once template
page top we're also going to do the same
thing for the page bottom so let's copy
that line go right under here under page
middle and change this to say page
bottom dot PHP so we'll make a template
page bottom type PHP all we have to do
is grab this page bottom tip ctrl X then
go to baíal new PHP get rid of all of
that code and paste the page bottom code
in press ctrl s to save it as template
page bottom save and now you have the
same thing you can actually close those
template pages if you want and now in
index dot PHP you can see how modulated
this file has become it really it only
has 14 lines of code in it now visually
to you it's including a whole bunch of
CSS and a whole bunch of other HTML but
to you the programmer it's nice and
clean look how nice and clean that is so
really on your pages all your going to
have as HTML is the content that is
within page middle div
that will be changing on all different
pages so that has to be directly on all
of the different pages so you see what I
mean
put your page top you page bottom even
side menus that you want on the right
and the left
those can be template regions made in
PHP so let's re FTP everything onto the
web my new template page bottom dot PHP
and all that good stuff and you can see
it within Dreamweaver if you're using
Dreamweaver it will show you all of the
files that are associated even if I
don't have them open it will show you
the Associated files to this index page
but I'm going to FTP all those files now
template page bottom yada yada
and now back online I refresh on my live
web server for web business I calm and I
have my bottom at my top and everything
is good you can see my index file it's
nice and lean for production purposes
and in Dreamweaver if you go in a design
view you can actually see all that stuff
in there okay now let's get page middle
ready so we'll go to file open style
style dot CSS and down in the page
middle rule we have already in place
what we're going to do let's give that a
background color of a light gray because
I want you to be able to see the box the
content container that is created here
let's make its width
thousand pixels you can make it a little
less if you want and let's give it a
margin of zero pixels Auto remember Auto
this is the shorthand for a margin
property and you can put zero pixels for
top and bottom and auto or right and
left when auto for right and left does
is it centers that 1000 pixel div in the
middle of the browser window okay and
that's what that gives you so you have a
Content container right in the middle of
the page that matches the dimensions of
your header things in your header okay
but you don't have to give it any color
I just wanted you to see exactly where
it was and I have it set to nine hundred
pixels but like I said you would go to
style and remove that 900 pixels height
when you start putting content into that
and you would want to remove the
ground color if you don't want that gray
on there I'm going to be removing that
color remove the background color and
I'll leave the height there for now but
I'm going to remove it shortly so now
you have Page middle already to have
content put inside of it so we'll just
bring that down a couple of lines and
right here is where you start putting
your content where I have this space
waiting now when I go to make my next
page which might be my signup form or
whatever all I have to do is go to file
I'll take this index page I'll go to
file save as and I'll save this index
page as login dot PHP and what that will
do is it'll load in the template bottom
the template top and all the CSS so all
I'd have to do to differentiate each
page is change its page middle and that
is a smart way to set up a website
that's going to run online and
dynamically so if it's going to be a PHP
driven website and have PHP script in it
you might as well use some includes like
this to make yourself some handy
templates that way you don't have to
change things in multiple files okay so
I think in part two we'll do just that
we'll create a sign up page a
registration page using this template
and then we'll just put a form within
the page middle section that people can
use to register their their credentials
to the site but I wanted to spend a lot
of time showing you guys how I assembled
that header just so nobody was confused
about how I custom placed all my
graphics exactly where I wanted them to
be and I'm not going to put in the
search field until we have some content
on the site and then I'll show you guys
I might show you guys how to go and get
yourselves a Google custom search engine
for your website that way you don't have
to do any complex programming when it
comes to searching all the pages and
indexes on your website ok so I will see
all interested parties in lesson number
two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
