once again with another web design video
tutorial thinking well we're showing you
how to do in this video tutorial is how
to create opacity settings for your web
page elements so if you have divs
paragraph tags image tags pretty much
any kind of XHTML tag we're using a
couple of CSS properties to affect that
tag that way we can see through it now
if you're somebody that likes to use the
flat page background color this probably
won't do you much good but if you're
somebody like me that likes playing off
of the background within my web designs
then this lesson will go over well with
you if you have no idea how to get web
page design backgrounds going for
yourself you can go to develop PHP com
and here in the CSS section you'll see
create backgrounds for your HTML web
pages you'll see various examples there
that you can check out the one I'm using
is custom large image background in this
case okay let's jump into the page code
let me show you how to get this going
for yourself first let's take a look at
this let's run it in Google Chrome so
you have a page like this and you have
this div element there maybe that's a
table or paragraph tag or whatever and
you want to make it to where you can see
through that element a little bit so
you're starting off with something you
can't see through one of your normal
page elements and we're going to make it
transparent so what you do is and I'm
going to warn you right now you're going
to have to have a little bit of CSS and
HTML experience to get this going for
yourself and understand actually what's
going on you don't have to have any
experience to apply this code to a page
but to understand how it's working a
little bit you have to know basic CSS
and HTML not so severe but just a little
bit okay so what you do is you find the
element on page that you want to affect
you can see this div align Center tag is
wrapped around the element that I want
to affect because I want that element
centered in the page you can see my
element has an ID on it
of element 1 and in my CSS that's where
I style up element 1 you can see it has
a width of 700 the color text-align the
background color is black the border is
an orange color 1 pixel solid padding 24
pixels so all I have to do is affect
that element you can see inside that
element is all those paragraphs of lorem
ipsum so that element 1 the CSS is where
I'm going to put these three lines I can
zoom in on them nice and big so these
three lines right here what you're going
to add to where the opacity is set to
70% in all browsers all major browsers
anyway and you have to put all three of
these lines in to effect all the various
different browsers I know it's a pain in
the butt but that's the way we got to do
it
so if you wanted it to be an opacity of
let's say 20% let's see what that looks
like
ctrl s to save it run in Chrome let's
check it in Chrome so you can see it
barely shows up it's really cool the way
that works but for this case I like
something like 70% there so there you
have it you simply apply those three
lines to any element on page you want to
effect in that elements CSS and we'll
take one last look at the finished
product here in Firefox and that is
pretty cool you can see all those nifty
colors and effects going on in the
background text is right on top of it
anything that you put inside of that div
or that container will also be affected
its opacity will be affected</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
