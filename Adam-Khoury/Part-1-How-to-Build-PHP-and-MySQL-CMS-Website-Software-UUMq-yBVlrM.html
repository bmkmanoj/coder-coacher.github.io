custom content management systems using
PHP of MySQL and if you happen to miss
the intro you can catch it in the
playlist this whole series is going to
be in its own playlist on my channel ok
so first things first let's discuss
let's go to the MySQL course I'm at
develop PHP calm right now and I hit the
MySQL course tab there and here is the
MySQL learning course which is not
completed yet but it's a good ways into
it and what we want to know for this
system is how to create a MySQL database
if we don't know yet if you already know
you can kind of fast forward a little
but creating a MySQL database on your
server you click that and then these
seven steps show you exactly how to get
it going and it may differ according to
what hosting control panel interface
you're used to or you your web hosts use
they might use cPanel or if you're with
GoDaddy they have a whole custom control
panel that the users have but many hosts
use cPanel and cPanel it's simple to
create MySQL databases and connect to
PHP myadmin
so that's what we're going to be doing
we're gonna create our database and this
I'm gonna follow these seven steps and
then once I'm done creating my database
I'm going to click this link in step
seven which is gonna show me how to
connect to my database and here I put a
little message about how we're going to
be using the MySQL hi family of
functions rather than the old MySQL
family of functions so here's the the
page that talks about the difference
between the two and why
and it'll explain why we're gonna use
the mysqli family of functions it's very
similar it's just you put an eye on
everything and then the way things are
formed is a little bit different but
I'll show you everything you need to
know and the scripts will be available
so no worries okay so I say the best and
easiest way to program connections to a
MySQL database is using a connection
include file that's what this little guy
is you take this little guy and you put
your connection data from your serve
from your MySQL host I'm sorry you put
your MySQL database information here
from the newly created MySQL database
and if you don't know how to get
connection data to build in all these
lines with the database host the
username and I put a little bit of hints
here in the code in the comments there
but if you can't get all that data it's
not easily found for you at your web
host you can call them or look in their
help files about how to get the MySQL
connection data calling them a lot of
the time there's a lot easier because
they'll say oh just click here then
click that and then there it is and then
what you do is you just place your data
in these spaces here where I have place
your this place your that place your
this and then what it'll do is use those
variables in the MySQL connection UC
equals mysql I connect so right here
we're connecting so whenever you run
this include file and and here's a test
file you can use to see if you're
connecting to your include file but
anytime you include this you're
connecting to your database and that's
how it works it's ready so that's what
I'm going to do right now
okay I'm back and I have my MySQL
database created on my server and I got
the connection data I put it in a little
file right here see a MySQL connect data
and now I'm going to open Dreamweaver
and I'm going to make that connection
file by using page um develop PHP I'm
just gonna grab all that script press
ctrl C highlight it all press ctrl C go
into Dreamweaver create new PHP and then
just get rid of all of that
and put the code from the page in now
I'm going to put my database host here
which is a lot of the times it's a
string that looks like MySQL dot some
servers net and then a lot of the times
it's localhost some a lot of servers use
our hosting companies just connect to
MySQL through localhost and then you put
your database username here and then the
database password and then the database
name which is a lot of the times the
same as the username and then this line
will connect at all you don't have to
touch this line this line is already set
up and ready to go it's going to be
using these variables that you place in
there so I'm going to do that now I'm
going to change mine and then I'm gonna
let me just go ahead and save this file
to its location where I want it so let's
make a main project file here on the
desktop let's go to new folder and let's
name it
my custom CMS
I don't want any spaces in there let's
get rid of those my custom CMS now
inside of it this is gonna be like my
root directory where I would have my
index file my main site directory
reflected on my system here and then
we'll just FTP everything up so here
let's go to new folder let's call it mmm
actually let's call this root root
directory and this will be my root
directory well this will be my version
of my root directory on my local machine
but I'll be FD peeing everything up to
the web so let's go ahead and double
click inside of that there's the root
directory let's make a new folder call
it scripts let's just make it lowercase
their scripts now inside of scripts we
can save this new file that we have here
called and we'll call it what do we name
it here at the page connect to MySQL dot
PHP let's just grab that ctrl C make
sure we just grab the letters ctrl C now
in Dreamweaver file save as I'm gonna
save this file on our desktop in the
editor where are ya my custom CMS root
directory in the scripts folder okay so
it's not going this connect file isn't
going to be in the root directory it's
going to be in the folder called scripts
and we'll connect to it like that make
the file name connect to MySQL it's
already a PHP file so we're gonna need
that extension there and unless you're
in notepad or WordPad you might want to
make sure it has a proper dot PHP
extension for save and there it is now
I'm going to change my connection data
or my MySQL database data here replace
this dummy data with the actual data I'm
not gonna show you what mine is but
that's what I'm going to do and then
we'll move along okay my little connect
to my SQL file is successfully tested
and it's saved to a location it should
be saved
on the server and now all we have to do
is build an index page let's go to
create new PHP and we'll use the default
dark type they have a sign there and
let's go to and if you want to add your
meta keyword and description tags that's
up to you just for this lesson I'm not
going to add it I show you how to deal
with that in the web intersect series on
how to make those keywords and
description meta tags dynamic to all be
different so they don't generate errors
because all your meta tags for
description and keywords should be
different for each page so let's go and
put a table in let's go back into full
design mode for the table in so what I'm
going to do is just pretty much design
how I want this thing to look let's see
let's make it one one column 800 pixels
okay
now let's go down here highlight it and
Center it now go to page properties
let's set the appearance first I'm just
going to lay mine I'm not gonna record
me going in fireworks making a header
image bringing it in I'm just going to
show you the kind of finished design
that I've got and then we'll keep going
because it would get ridiculously long
if I did that okay okay I kind of have
this thing structured out for basic
demonstration purposes the way I want it
and I'm gonna go in the fireworks and
show you I feel I should show some of
you guys this because you might not
understand the relation to where these
files are in relation to the site okay
so I'm going to show you that right now
I made a little graphic here I'm in
fireworks cs4 I made a little logo image
and it has no background color the
canvas is set to no color and I'm going
to save it as a PNG 32 so let's go to
file export and I'll show you where I'm
gonna export it to the web yes yes and
then PNG 32 PNG 32 with no color on the
mat and then this it will render out
this file here export and let's save it
to desktop where's that custom CMS in
the root directory right there by the
scripts folder we're gonna put another
folder with that one in the root
directory we're going to name this one
style and then the style folder that's
where we're gonna have our CSS file if
we choose to have one and any images
that go along with the template so let's
go ahead and put it here logo that's a
good name for it logo dot PNG and it's a
PNG thirty-two high quality that way
it'll look good on any background even
if you have
repeating image background or something
or something behind these letters it'll
look good
okay so let's proceed and now I also
have a background strip which is an 8
pixel wide but very tall image file and
I'm gonna go ahead and export that out
to the web and then I'm gonna use JPEG
bring it up to about 88 press export and
in the same style folder let's name that
leave it what it is named right there
strip BG that's what I'm gonna name mine
in short for strip background save now
once I'm in Dreamweaver I can go into
the now if you go into the code view
which I'm gonna have all this code
available if you want to check out the
actual code because I'm working a lot in
design mode I know I said I wouldn't but
it's just gonna make things faster and
easier so let's go to right here with a
header logo file supposed to be insert
the image using the common tab insert
image icon there and scripts style let's
make sure we're in style folder and
let's grab the logo file my magic site
novo okay
okay there it is now let's go to the
page properties add that background
appearance background image strip BG
okay let's do a couple more
CSS design tweaks here and the design
view let's go to page properties
appearance text color let's make that
white good background image
wait a second how's that background
image even there in the code we have
body background and it's just not what
we want you don't want it there we you
can put it up it you can go and design
view and put it in the actual CSS there
we go repeat X not Y apply there we go
now let's look at the code and now
you'll see in the CSS we have a body tag
or a body identifier here and it adds
the strip bTW right there from the style
folder right in and it tells it to
repeat only X ok so now we should have
white text no we do not
let's put it in the buddy just go to
font or just color color make it white
there now all the text unless we assign
it to be any other color will be white
okay so that's where the menu system
will start we can push that down a
little if we want with a rate tag and
the body will start here push that down
with a rake tag as well it looks good
you can even make the background of this
cell black if you want that way all your
text will show up nice and even on the
menu system as well let's make that
background color like this dark brown
there we go
it's ugly but it works it's a quick
design okay so now we have everything in
place okay I was going to jump into PHP
myadmin and pre populate some data into
the MySQL database but I think this
video is gonna get too long in length if
I do that at this point so I'm gonna
we're gonna call it quits on this part 1
and in part 2 we'll jump into PHP
myadmin
get some default data populated and then
we'll query it out and show you how it's
going to come out to the page and show
you how the mended menu system will be
dynamically rendered according to what's
in the database ok we'll see you in part
