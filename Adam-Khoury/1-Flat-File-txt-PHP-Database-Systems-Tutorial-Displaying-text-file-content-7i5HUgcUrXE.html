introduce beginners to flat file
database systems using simple txt text
files to store change and display
dynamic data much like you would use a
MySQL database to do those same things
and this would be applied when a MySQL
database is not available for use or
would be overkill to use for a tiny
application in this first lesson we will
show two methods of how a PHP programmer
can call an external data from a text
file first let's take a quick look at
the dot txt file that you're going to
have to create before you try and run
this PHP code so you can see the file I
have is named file 1 dot txt and you can
clearly see the text that I have within
it now in later lessons I'm going to
show you guys how to allow your clients
to change this text add line breaks and
other things like that but now we're
just going to show you how to get this
one little string brought into the PHP
script so that we can access the
displayed or whatever but this is the
text file that you want to have
file1.txt you can put any text that you
want within it like I said if you want
line breaks that's going to be in a
later lesson I'm going to go into a lot
of different things about all this
here's my file dot PHP which could be
any PHP file on your server I'm going to
open up PHP code block now inside that
code block we're going to add some code
to bring in the data within this text
file and display it in this file dot PHP
page now the first method I show you is
not as effective as the second method
because the second method will allow you
to manipulate the data and potentially
put it back into the file adjusted this
first method I'm about to show you is
only really for displaying the data
that's within the file you really can't
adjust it or anything like that unless
you get it into a variable form which
the second method shows okay so let's
pop in the code and I'll explain it to
you real quick it's very simple what we
have here is an in condition statement
and inside of that if condition
statement if it meets true then this
code will run so the if condition says
if the file exists which we're using the
file exists function in PHP to see if
the file 1 dot txt is actually on the
server an sometimes you may want to run
this if file exists function if
condition statement because if the file
is not there
is not found it will render an error to
the script sometimes if you try to
include a file this include function
will render an error for you if that
file is not found so basically if the
file exists then you want to include it
once into this page file one dot txt and
whatever line that you run this if
condition on that is where the text will
display if you use this method one
method to I'm going to show you has it
set up into a variable form so you can
echo the variable anywhere you want but
you can include this anywhere you want
in your page as well so now let's press
ctrl s save this and put it on the
server and see what output we get okay
so here's my page when it was empty now
I put that little bit of code in it now
let me refresh it and here's my text I
came in from the file 1 dot txt file so
now let's demonstrate method number two
okay so here's method 2 for checking if
the file exists first and then grabbing
the file contents whatever's in the file
the string data and putting it into a
variable called my data so once you use
the file get contents function on that
path or on that file name and all of the
string data within that file gets placed
into this my data variable so you can
echo that out wherever you want for
instance you can echo it right here my
data now let's put that on the server
and see what we get all right now let me
refresh and I really should see no
difference because it's just going to
bring the string data in similarly to
the way that method number one did but I
think method number two is the preferred
method and for me anyways because I like
having my contents of that file to
string that I put into a variable that
way I can echo without anywhere on the
page that I want for instance if I
remove this and I have HTML tags here so
let's say I have a regular page where I
have like my HTML and my body tag
they're like normal we can just put it
in PHP code block and then we'll echo
that data right there close off the
block and that way it'll be in your body
section and you can say hello world on
top of it
add break tag now let's see what that
gives us alright let's refresh the file
you can see it bring
exactly like it did before but this time
if we view the page source you'll see
that there's the body tag of the HTML
and all that stuff okay so that's method
number two we're getting the file
contents out of a text file that you're
going to use this flat file database
you also have method number one which is
the include method or you can require
require and include act similarly in PHP
those both of those functions and
include once and require ones are just
variations of those functions where the
file contents can only come once into
the page but you can use include you can
use require or you can use include once
or require once it'll all work now
throughout this series I'm going to be
showing you how to do different kind of
things like make sure that there can be
line breaks within this text file that
the client may be adjusting adding this
my data variable to an HTML form text
area to allow the client to actually get
in and change it so once you get this
variable here you can put this into an
HTML form the text area and one-state
once you put that data into that text
area the client then has the ability to
change that data up and then I'm going
to show you how to save that data into
the text file called file1.txt sort of
using it as a database for dynamic
content so stay tuned for lesson number
two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
