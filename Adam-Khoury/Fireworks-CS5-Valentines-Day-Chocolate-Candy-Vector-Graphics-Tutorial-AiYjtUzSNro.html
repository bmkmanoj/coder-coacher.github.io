with another fireworks valentine's day
graphics workflow tutorial in this
lesson you can learn how to produce
delicious-looking vector chocolates for
any graphics which suites are involved
let's get right to it okay the first
thing we're going to do is grab out an
ellipse draw it out and then you want to
make sure it has a fill of that brown
color and no edge then we're going to go
into our auto shapes and we're going to
grab out the heart and that already has
the brown color which is very convenient
now I'm going to mess with the cliff and
I'm also going to mess with the vertex
arc and the vertex itself i'm going to
zoom in right about that looks good I
don't want too much curve on the end of
that that looks good to me tweak it out
ok now I'm going to make it about the
size of that ellipse now let's highlight
both of those by holding shift as we
select them and we can go and give it a
gradient of ellipse now we don't want it
so bright on that edge so what we're
going to do is go and find a nice creamy
chocolatey color let's see let's try
that aw that looks really good now with
both of those still selected I'm going
to go to distort now I'm going to grab
them and distort them this way sort of
like death now I'm going to add a shadow
of solid shadow and
with the angles to where it looks
correct that looks pretty good somewhere
around in there you can also manipulate
the distance that it's going okay and
you can also specify a solid color if
you like but I'm not going to do that
because I want some gradients to be in
my on my edges on that 3d looking part
so I'm going to leave it just like that
now I'm going to take these gradients
and move them around a little we're
going to make that bigger actually not
like that move it around over here and
then this one I'll do the same thing
i'll make it a little bigger I'll move
it around a bit all right now I'm going
to grab both of those bring them up a
little bit now i'm going to highlight
them again and i'm going to give it
another effect of inner shadow and i
want this to come from the very bottom
so i'm going to angle it the other way
and i'm going to specify it to be this
dark brown color here and make sure
that's a hundred percent actually
believe that back where it was around 75
is good we want to bring up the distance
of it to where it covers you see as I
bring it up actually let me make it a
little darker because you can see as I
bring up the distance setting it will
fill in your edge real nice if you have
it angled correctly so let's get that
angle just right that's it I think that
does it so now when you look at them
you'll see that this one they both have
a rounded look they're not so squared
off so if you want to use effects like
those shadows it works out really nice
okay now i'm going to select this one
and i'm going to make it a little bit
deeper than the other one so i'm going
to set the distance on it to about 50 or
60 something like that okay and then i'm
going to set the inner shadow a little
bit higher to kind of meet it just
you can see how you can really make a
big chunky piece of chocolate I'm going
to rearrange these I'm going to put this
one over here and then this one over
here because i like the heart-shaped
chocolate better now grab this one and
adjust that inner shadow the fade on it
and you'll see a difference in the
roundness that your little candy takes
on you see how it takes on a nice
roundness it almost looks like an mm
sitting on its side I just want this one
to have a nice rounded top so that's why
I'm doing that and I can manipulate this
thing a little more put it over here
that looks great I'm going to actually
make one more heart so you guys can see
one little added effect we're going to
actually write on this one by the way to
zoom in i press ctrl and I mouse wheel
zoom in and out I'm going to grab this
one now and before I distort it let me
get it a little bigger first scale it
let's move this one over here I'll scale
it up to a good size and I'm going to
put the word love on it so I'll grab out
some text type it in and you can see my
font is font Leroy Brown and i'll raise
that up to be a good size that way we'll
see it when we do distort everything
will see the word level and they're real
nice so what I'm going to do is make
this a very light brown sort of like
that or you can choose to make it dark
or whatever you want and I'm going to
give it a filter of inner shadow so it
kind of looks like it will engrave and
I'm going to change that shadow color to
this dark brown bring this down to about
two or maybe even one and this down to
about three maybe or even two then bring
this all the way up to a hundred percent
bring this down 2-1 see what it looks
like it looks pretty good actually I'm
going to put it at two again I like the
way it look better too and maybe not so
much not not maybe not a hundred percent
there that looks good enough to me so
now I'm going to take both of those
together now I'll distort those and you
can go any angle that you want and then
you simply add your effects like you did
the other one or I can just put that
right there and it would make sense and
you can change the font to get something
that you like more there's Oliver is
Barney I can bring the size
on that a little bit put it into place
and then that's what my inner shadow
just a bit and it will really look like
it's sunk in there that looks pretty
good to me so I can get rid of this one
control x grab this ctrl-c ctrl-v make a
copy put it over here let's take the
word love off of this one control x
we're going to put some sprinkles on
this one and this one as well so we'll
put sprinkles on these two here let's
see if we can get this to look better if
it was darker in its Phil so let's just
change it for one of these darker colors
maybe like that actually that might even
look a little better make it a little
lighter not that color maybe like this
color looks a little more authentica
either way now to make these little
sprinkles is very easy you can just make
circular perfectly circular sprinkles by
adding gradient radial and you can
change that to any color you like I'm
going to make little pink ones so i'll
go up to read make that a really bright
pink in the center and then a darker
pink on the outside color sort of like
that then i'll just grab my pointer tool
and move that a little bit and even make
that a little bigger if you like and i'm
going to make the pink on the bottom or
on the outside just a little bit darker
okay that's very good now you can
highlight that and just make it I don't
know four pixels by four pixels and
you'll have a little tiny looking
sprinkle type candied candy shell type
sprinkle thing now you can just zoom in
by holding control the mouse wheel and
ctrl-c ctrl-v make a bunch of copies it
at spread it around you can even make
multiple colors if you like we might
change the colors on some of them I'm
going to grab this guy I'm going to make
this a little bit darker on this edge
it's a little bright there we go
actually i'll do the same to the others
too there's just a little bit bright on
that side of the gradient yeah that's
better so let's highlight some sprinkles
control C and ctrl v press ctrl-c ctrl-v
you can highlight more sprinkles control
c control v once you get a bunch on
there then you can scatter them around
real good but you got to zoom in if you
really want to grab those little things
or else you'll be grabbing the gradient
so I'm just going to spread them all
along the top of that now I'm going to
go through here and highlight all of
these little sprinkles by holding shift
as I select them now once they're all
selected I'm going to press ctrl G and
that will set them as a group that way
if you move any one of them the whole
lot of them will move now with them
selected I'm going to give them a drop
shadow not so much maybe three bring
this down to about two and then fade it
down you don't want it too dramatic
let's bring this to an down to about to
this to about three yeah that looks
about right you can also mess with the
angle okay so now it looks like you have
nice little candy pink little candy
sprinkles all on top of your chocolate
now let's grab the little sprinkles and
the heart itself right there ctrl G and
then you'll have that in a group now
this guy I'm going to go ahead and put
different colored sprinkles on him so
actually let me ungroup this control
shift g and
grab these sprinkles ctrl-c ctrl-v and
I'll transfer them over here and what
I'll do is just lay them on top like
that and then this one I'll group back
again by grabbing the heart and the
sprinkles ctrl G so now you get that
back into a group now these you can
ungroup and start manipulating the
colors of control shift g ungroup those
get rid of the ones that are on the side
there and then reposition these to where
they make sense I'll highlight certain
ones of those scattered around maybe
that many and I'll change their color
let's try a green and then make a dark
green on the other side that looks
pretty good and I'll grab a few more and
change their colors as well maybe we'll
try yellow on these make that yellow and
then a very dark orange on the other
side maybe let's move these up a little
bit now what I'm going to do is
highlight all of these actually i can
probably highlight everything if I move
this and then just do this
right about there and then deselect by
holding shift deselect that that that
your border and your background then
you'll have just the candy and it's
sprinkles selected so you can press ctrl
G at that point to group this whole
little guy you know put them somewhere
over here press ctrl-c ctrl-v and then
modify flatten this new one and then you
can scale it down let's put this one off
to the side there bring this one back up
into place let's go ahead and group
these two ctrl G then let's put this one
right in the middle there and we're done
so let's take some text it's right on
top Valentine vector chocolate bring the
size down a bit let's just change that
to white I'm going to change the font to
good old script Tina I can find it make
it a little bigger set it right in the
center there and let's make it a nice
milk chocolate color it may be a little
bit brighter than that you can also play
with some effects on that too well
that's pretty much it that shows you how
to make cool little vector candies or
chocolates or cakes or whatever you're
making and if you want you can highlight
these and then give them a filter of
glow or something like that just to make
them stand out a little more you can
glow them any colour you like maybe I
dare bring that down a bit yeah that
looks pretty good ok that's it guys
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
