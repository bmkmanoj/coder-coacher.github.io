basic actionscript three basic web site
structure tutorial and free Fla file
that you can download from develop PHP
com so it's part two and let's keep
going here so when we left off in part
one we added our button menu we gave it
a layer and its in its own movie clip
and we made a pages a layer and it's
empty right now but I'm going to go
ahead and make a movie clip it's going
to be my pages so make another rectangle
let's go right here and draw out the
rectangle on stage make it a little bit
higher to fit in there nice there we go
and we will give it a bill to match the
buttons sort of that looks good and then
let's see pages make another layer let's
call this logo and header logo and
header and then we will bring in let's
import let's go to file import import
directly to stage and see see if I can
find some my graphics here
see if I can fly my logo that I actually
use on my website and where are we
somewhere around there it is okay sorry
it took so long and it says import
fireworks document import as bitmaps yep
yep as movie clip that's good okay there
it is and it's in my logo and headed
layer already and there we have it okay
so we got site logo up now we're going
to go ahead and make the structure of
the pages movie clip so you left click
that rectangle symbol we drew on stage
on the pages layer and convert it to a
symbol it's going to be a movie clip and
call it all pages and ok and then
double-click inside of it and this is
where you set up all your pages so you
want four layers in their top one you
want to call actions the one under it
you want to call labels labels is how we
tell the page is to go to which page and
i'll show you how to set those up and
then this is going to be page content
page content later and this one here is
going to be adi da let's see let's just
leave this undefined right now i might
use that layer i might not but i think
all i need is page content layer and
actions and labels for the simple
demonstration here so on the page
content late first of all let's go ahead
and make the the actions
actually we'll make them all fade in so
let's go ahead and put the page content
here call this home page okay now turn
that black and you can see it on that
light grey and make it a little bigger
because its title bold it out and let's
make it static text instead of dynamic
there and let's go ahead press ctrl c
ctrl shift v paste in place and since we
have a preloader set into this we can
load all kind of images straight to the
stage by using import import to stage
and then you just go ahead and find your
images and I'll bring my ugly face in
since this is the home page I'll put a
picture of myself okay there we go home
page and this can be home page copy so
we'll make it smaller
we'll say welcome to my home page
and you can say a whole bunch of more
blabbity blah blah blah down to there
but that's all I'm going to say for the
demonstration okay so now you have your
home page what you want to do you have
all the items with a home page on their
press shift to select all at the same
time as you go through and none are
selected you select the first one hold
shift down select the second keep
holding shift and select the third then
right click one and convert to symbol
and now now we're going to convert all
three of those inside of the same movie
clips and bone just call this home and
press ok and now you see we'll call this
home okay so now we have an instance
name on this movie clip that is our home
page and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
