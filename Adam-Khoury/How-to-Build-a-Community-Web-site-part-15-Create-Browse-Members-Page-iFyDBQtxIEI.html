community website using PHP and MySQL
brought to you by flash building and in
the last lesson when we left off at web
intersect we showed you how to list as
many of your newest members that are
joining your site and this is put in
dynamics into the home page to
automatically bring in these newest
members so if you joined right now you
would show up right there and he would
move over one and this guy would be gone
that's how it works and so now in part
15 which I still have to put up the
links in the source files to 14 and 15
when I get done with this but we're
going to create a member search page or
a member listing page for the site and
I'll just show you a few things and then
hopefully that'll get your wheels
turning to get you to learn more
mechanisms to build into your site for
yourself so let's go to open which one
should we open let's just open the index
page
let's get rid of all this PHP
on top
so we zap that out and now let's save
this page before we overwrite the index
file save it as
remember listing
remember search
perceived
now you want to change I'm going to
change these tags like we've always been
doing all the way through the tutorial
just so we get some better optimization
and indexing so I'm going to change
those in them over zone ok so i change
the tags the keywords and the
description so you web intersect member
browsing ok
now we can go into design view we have a
page called member search file open
footer template member search
put the link go into code view the link
on it should be not undefined but member
SC AR CH remember underscore search that
PHP perfect save that close it ftp it up
the footer template now there's no file
there yet so that would be a dead link
but we're going to put this number
search page up in just a few minutes
okay so now we have our member search
page just press ctrl s to save it close
the index page because I don't think we
need that anymore and let's make sure I
didn't ruin the index page on the top
there it still has its PHP now we'll get
rid of this box actually we'll keep this
box and we'll just give it columns 3 in
that table three columns so there's
three columns so I'll give you three
examples and let's make name this one
well first let's just put the forms in
okay we got rid of the break tags in
there so now I'm going to go up to
insert form
now we have a form and inside of the
form looks like its Center aligned
div align center we don't want those
center oh no
we want the table center but not these
get that class center stuff out of there
ok so in the design view that's good now
we'll add to the form insert form button
ok
and we're going to give it a value of go
you can give it any value you want and
all we need on top of that is to say
well no no no not on top right there
we're going to say browse to two newest
members
go
that works should we will even shrink
that little Go button you can give it a
class
if we had some text sizes that were a
little smaller so you can put any
classes you want on see how to change
the text orange but I don't have I
wanted to make it smaller and you can
make them smaller if you have it set up
in your CSS right okay so now let's go
into that code view for that form we
need an action value there for the
action attribute and it's going to be
the same page remember underscore or
search dot PHP so now when they press
that button that go button this is going
to post those variables whatever
variables we set here for the search
mechanism to post to this same page and
then on top above the the doctype tag
there we're going to have our PHP script
kind of like we did on the homepage just
like we did an on page so now here we're
going to add a hidden field so you can
go to open tag and type in input
type
hidden
space
and name
this will be a list by Q short for query
list by query and then we need is a
value for it and if this button is going
to be for brows and newest members this
form and we're going to have to make it
say newest members because I'm going to
have my page my member search page
showing oldest to the newest members by
default so we want to give them people
an option to search from your newest
member see oldest members by default
okay so and the whole list in the
database so let's see the doctor newest
members that is give it now we're going
to make two more forms we have a hidden
type variable going in of newest members
name is the spike you valued members oh
what did i do I broke it the label tag
we don't need a label tag but we do have
to close this sucker up but we don't
have any problems there we go
now everything is cued you take that
form and just control C control V and
Sue it right here to put in this one
we're going to have detected this is
going to be browse by name I'll show you
guys how to browse with a search field
an input field and browse by name
so all we need to go into the code view
and now you want to make sure your names
and your forms don't conflict so we have
ID and name form1 for the first one we
made the second form is ID form to make
sure that's his name form to button to
it's good good good hidden this bike you
make sure that's list by Q only list by
Q list by Q newest members this is going
to be browsed by YouTube members if they
happen to be you to remember and have
their youtube embedded will we want to
search be able to just search those
people out of the database so that's
what we'll do there and in this one by
first name
ok
okay let's take a look at this here make
sure we have everything right this needs
to be form three and that all looks good
so let's go into the design view make
sure we put in this field for searching
say search by name and go to form insert
form text field
ok
okay go into the code view on that text
field will give it a name of what should
we name it just F name i guess first
name fname for short for the first name
ID f name and put type yep yep it's not
going to be any initial value no label
we have a label set already we're good
to go there to say search by name above
it or right next to it
get that brake tag out of there
okie dokie that looks good now all we
have to do is pop in the script it's
going to parse these three forms
correctly so well first let's go into
the home page get all this crap out of
here that we don't need any longer so we
keep that table there make sure we use
this table as the display holder for the
dynamic results so let's go to the code
view make sure there's no links in there
we don't need that paragraph tag to get
rid of that design view again instead of
ninety percent let's just go sixty
percent seventy percent there we go and
just give it one one row that looks
great maybe a couple of break tags under
it 12 by pressing Shift + Enter shift
enter gives you automatic brake tags
here so now here we're going to print
the results but first we got a script on
top just go up to the doc tag tag bring
it down a couple of notches or a couple
of lines by pressing enter and go ahead
and grab our script and I have it
pre-written because it's a little bit
long and I don't want to sit here coding
out for hours in front of you when you
can just go and get all the source files
but I'm going to explain the code live
by line that's what will make it nice
see ok there it is
instead of printing output list here
because I tested on another page we're
going to print it here in this little
table seventy percent table there that's
centered press V control V we got to put
some PHP tags around that sort of
renders out you can print or echo and
that's it the output list from this
script will now display let's put a
space in there with it
let's put it n SBP control shift space
now you can see it okay that's where it
prints out right there now let's explain
this script that powers this member
search page okay so the first thing we
do is open our PHP tags connect to the
database on line three there's the
connection to the database include and
you can also use require but if it
doesn't find your connect script this
whole script won't run so I just use
includes for my connections as long as I
know my connection script is there and
then default query string is on line
five and what this is is it it creates
the default query for when people come
to the page initially before they even
search anything we want to have a
certain query set up and show a certain
member listing that we choose any anyone
you choose any kind of query you want to
put on your database and any results
that you want to display in certain
orders or whatever so in what I'm going
to do is pick everybody in the database
where their email it activated is 1 i'm
going to order by ID ascending so
that'll bring everybody out the database
who is activated through email and will
list them on a page by default and
people search they use those little
buttons and little forms we just made
then we'll give them different results
so that's why we need a dynamic query
string and so what we're doing here is
pretty much setting up dynamic queries
queries made in the database according
to what the user wants to see you give
them the control interfaces in the
design view you see these are the
control interfaces for them to see what
they want to see
so when they pick something we just have
to set the right query string this is
the default query string here's the
default message we can show on the page
above the results and i'm going to add
that in using print or echo as well okay
now on line 11 what we do here is we're
setting up for search criteria query
switch mechanisms see we have the
default query there so what we do is if
it's if they're searching the newest
members or members with the youtube
account or if they're searching by first
name we have to switch up the query each
time so we change the query string to
where email activated equals one order
by ID descending this time instead of
ascending so if they search to see or
browse to see newest members we have to
switch that query up and that's what
that does and this is should say newest
to oldest
showing newest to oldest and the next
one is if they look for the Browse the
YouTube members we change the query
string to be where YouTube channel does
not equal null so that means an email
activated order by ID descending so what
this means is where the youtube channel
so we're picking everybody out of the
database where the YouTube channel is
not empty that's all that means so if
they put in a value for their YouTube
channel that means they have a youtube
channel we want to show them if they
haven't we want to make sure we don't
show them for this query and then we say
showing members with embedded YouTube
channels and you can list them ascending
or descending whatever you like and the
last one last example I'll show you is
the list by first name and then what we
do is we grab the posted f name variable
from this form right here see how it
says f name for that input text type
so we grab it grab the posted variable
put it into a local variable then we run
filtering to make sure nobody is going
to try and you know get it gain access
into our database and these are you know
mechanisms you've seen all throughout
this tutorial or you know filtering that
you've seen already and then we change
the career the query string here is a
little special and different than the
others and this one is we're picking
everybody out of the database or select
you can see I'll show you the query
string here right here select all these
things from my members table query
string that means select all these
things from my members table where
first-name blah blah blah blah blah or
where youtube channel or where email
activated ascending see let's see what
that does and if they don't pick
anything the default query goes right
here for this value which is where email
activate is one order by ID ascending
that's how that this dynamic query works
so here in this when they're looking for
the first name we have to run a special
query that uses mysql functionality to
search and we use the like method so we
say we're select all from the database
where first name like f name variable so
he was searching for somebody named
joseph so it would be this variable that
came in from the form that text field
would be Joseph so it says where first
name like or is like Joseph and what
that does is it looks for those those
letters that string within other strings
and it will pull out all that data
that corresponds to that and email
activate this one then we say showing
members with the name you search for so
we run the dynamic query that I just
explained second ago and here we build
the output the output list like we did
in the in part 14 same thing we check to
see if their picture is there but this
time we're gathering the country and
their website and the output list is
each one gets their own table now so
each one gets their own table and you
can take this table and a horizontal
rule separates each member see this HR
tag down here that's a horizontal line
that separates each member so let's
press control C so you can see this
table you can go to file new just open
in an HTML page just to view it in the
code view press ctrl V and go to design
and this is kind of what the table will
look like when it's rendered out on the
page see the horizontal line there and
then each member gets a little table for
their data ok now let's just close that
but I was just showing you for example
sake so you understood what's going to
be output in this while loop this
dynamic while loops going to bring
everybody out with their own table and
their own horizontal line
and that is it then we closed the while
loop close the PHP tag bring the stock
type back up to meet right under the tag
there press ctrl s and now we're going
to test it out but before we do we have
to make sure everything looks cool in
design view browse YouTube members this
should say browse newest browse search
by name that's good to go and we want to
print out right above this
let's see turn that into a break tag
pressing shift enter and let's print out
the query message control C on that
double click it control C and right here
print out query message our save control
s let's reconnect to the server we
already put a foot template up that has
the button that gets to that page so
let's just put member search up see if
this worked and the code might be busted
I might have to fix something but we're
going to find out refresh the homepage
go down to member search and it works
beautiful so it says showing newest to
oldest members by default which is wrong
it should say searching senior
two newest members by default there
and let's put a brake tag right above
this one more right between this query
message and the output list file search
all right now let's test it out see if
we got our little forms work and right
up top here and you know you would
probably set yours up different but I
just wanted to show you real quick an
example of how to set up forms and
buttons for searching let's see refresh
now let's press browse newest members so
this whole this should change and it
sure did
these are the newest members
now we're going to browse YouTube
members this should show it's showing
nothing that's not cool let's see if
this one works Adam go look at that it
shows all the atoms that joined that is
Q so that's how that works so we have
two working let's go and look and
investigate so put this YouTube thing
maybe it's the query where you too let's
try that
like file open its open the register see
what the youtube name is in the database
yep it's just YouTube that's where we
were wrong now let's put that member
search page back up and now that's about
it let's see let's go to refresh it's
fine
browse YouTube members there we are
here's all the YouTube members and I
should be the last in the list there's a
lot of us here so all these people have
their own YouTube channel you can check
out on the site okay that does it folks
that's your member page and I'm going to
be sticking a link up in the flash file
2 i'll show you how to make a link to
this page up in the flash file will put
a couple of links up here in this bar we
want to be able to get to this page also
from up top not only just the footer
because nobody will find it down there
okay so in part 16 we're going to wrap
this thing up by both 16 won't finish it
it might it might even make it to 20 but
we're we're just about done we're going
to show you how to do some some social
networking things that a popular social
networking site does and i think i'm
going to model Twitter's what are you
doing now tweeting type thing run a
dynamic feed of all the member tweets
combined together on the homepage that
way once every once somebody tweets they
get the top spot on the tweet list on
the homepage and we can call it
something else so we don't get sued
liked work but chitter twice watching
how about twatting that'll be a good one
okay well we'll see you in part 16 where
we'll take this system a little bit
further into integrating some social
networking type things and the base
system is just about complete see you in
part 16</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
