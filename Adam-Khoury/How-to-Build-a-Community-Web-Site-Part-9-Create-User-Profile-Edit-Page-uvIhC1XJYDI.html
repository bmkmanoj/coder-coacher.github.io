community website using PHP MySQL and
Flash created by flash building brought
to you by develop PHP calm in the last
lesson we left off by creating the view
profile button functionality and
creating the view of the profile that
PHP page which is the universal page
that is used for anytime anybody's
profile has to get viewed on the site
and so let's go back into flash here and
we're going to put up the functionality
now for the edit profile button and that
will complete all three buttons here on
the header for the logged in user so
let's give this button edit profile
button an instance name of edit
underscore BTN and it's going to be a
very simple matter to go into the third
keyframe here press f9 on the actions
layer there and copy all the code from
that last button we created in the last
tutorial
just those few lines there then I pasted
them and right under that section of
lines and I'm going to rename all this
to edit so it'll say code for the edit
profile button instead of code for the
view profile button and I'm gonna change
these words to edit or us will get
duplicate variable name and functions
here if we don't change it so anything
it says view profile should be edit
profile this should say edit this should
say edit and this is going to this one
should say attitude this one's going to
a new URL of EDI T underscore profile
which we haven't created yet I'm gonna
create that now so that's pretty much
all the functionality you need for all
three of those buttons now and it's all
in this one keyframe the third key frame
on the ActionScript 3 layer and they're
sectioned off pretty good so you can see
what's going on it's pretty clean and
since there's only three buttons we
don't have to do a huge button array or
set a dynamic loop for rendering out the
buttons and their clique functionality
because it's not really necessary if you
had a whole stack of buttons like 20
buttons you know more than six or seven
buttons then it's handy to do that but
you have less than five buttons there's
no problem okay so let's go to
Dreamweaver and here we have profile dot
PHP which we created in Lesson number
eight and we're going to rename this
save it as file save as EDI t underscore
profile
now we have a new PHP script too called
edit profile that PHP and pretty obvious
what this one's going to do the users
going to be able to edit their profile
on this page so the first thing we want
to do is make sure we do a log in check
because we don't want anybody coming to
this page if they're not logged in we
want to say hey you're not logged in get
out of here or go register and join so
we'll go ahead and do that first so
right here where it says session start
we're going to add under that so I just
automatically added it in and you'll see
I have claiming sessions start to grab
any session variables that are present
for this logged in user then we run an
if condition here this condition is
nested in these 1 2 3 4 5 6 lines and it
says if is not set session ID then we
give the message to user saying only
site members can do that register or
join here and we give them a link to the
register page then we include message to
user dot PHP and immediately exit the
script if they're not logged in so this
message here that's in HTML format there
you can see get sent to the message that
our message to user dot PHP and that
page is brought in and this paid
descript exit right away so none of this
other code will process so that ends the
login check that line right there ok so
now they if they are logged in it's
business as usual so we connect to the
database using our include script and
then we don't need these if and else
statements that we had in the regular
profile dot PHP page so we can just zap
all that out but we do want to keep that
ID that session ID right there and I'll
tell you what that's doing in just a
second
so what this is doing this line here is
placing the session ID variable into a
local PHP variable which does not need
to be filtered so we can remove these
two lines because it's not a posted or
URL variable it's a session variable
that can't be manipulated by the by the
user
okay so or by the member and then what
we're gonna do is take that ID and run
an SQL statement now we're an SQL SQL
query selecting all fields from the my
members table where ID equals this users
ID then we run a while loop we set a
while loop to run in that SQL queries
array and then all the items will come
out and we can access them and put them
into local PHP variables here like we
did in the in the last tutorial for the
profile page and we don't need the last
login date for this section and we don't
even need the signup date to show them
in this section we don't need the email
should shouldn't really ever show
anybody's email any of your members
emails directly on their their email
address shouldn't be laid out directly
on their profile most sites do a
in-house commenting system so where
members can get in touch with one
another or they put the comment system
like YouTube does right on the page
there or myspace you know or Facebook
right on the wall okay so and maybe
actually I will show something like that
in this tutorial series I'll show you
how to do a comment area on the person's
page on their profile so each member
will have a section where other members
can leave comments for them
so here we're gonna access all these
variables yes yes yes and maybe I'm
gonna change a couple of things because
of one of the members that joined web
intersect already asked me why I was
gathering phone numbers and that's a
good question I have no need to gather
anybody's phone numbers and it's in the
database that field so I'm gonna remove
that database field that column and and
put a new column in there or a new field
name and use it for something else and
I'm gonna show you how to do that maybe
not next the next part of the series but
a couple of parts down where we'll need
to do that before we get in any heavier
okay so here we're gonna keep all these
same mechanisms we don't need the
stylesheet link actually that should be
up top
because they're gonna need to access
that so that should be up here maybe the
phone can be traded out for the
stylesheet preferences okay so we'll
just add that there for now even though
we don't have anything in database to
access that information so it will just
comment it out but we're gonna use it
and what else do we have here okay now
we're gonna change some things in the
HTML section now that we're done
changing what we need to change in the
PHP section of this page because
basically we want to grab all this data
put it into forms and have them be able
to to edit it edit all the data real
time on this page kind of like MySpace
and YouTube and all that does it's not
gonna be as fancy as those guys it's
just gonna be base functionality I don't
have all year okay so yeah we're gonna
change the HTML stuff now okay so we
want to make sure we don't get any
duplicate description and keyword tags
here in our head section of the HTML
file or the HTML section here and so
we'll just put web intersect web site
profile edit area for this users name
and keywords will be edit profile data
information
we don't need their city and country
State and that one okay so those will
all be unique web intersect change this
to edit profile area for username we'll
just put the first name in that one
actually no leave the last name there
actually there would be duplicates if
John Smith joined a bunch of times then
all these tags would say with intersect
profile editor for John Smith
so maybe we should add something in
there like their ID or something to make
them all unique you could do whatever
you like to make sure your system runs
right there's a there's gonna be a lot
of things you have to address that I
don't address here in this tutorial
series there's gonna be a whole lot more
research that you'll have to get into if
you build a serious system that's
running online with live users you'll
have to learn a lot more okay so but I'm
going to show you the base functionality
to you know maybe get people excited
enough to go and learn the whole gambit
okay so print style sheet this is going
to turn to main that CSS back to main
that CSS
our default style sheet and
okay so let's go to design view now here
in design view let's take that table
this was the one that we used for the
profile page it's still here on this
HTML section of the new page we're gonna
put two columns we can get rid of this
PHP include they're actually now we'll
leave that there and this column here
will be for a button an edit button that
way they can have a button that
corresponds to each section that we put
in here so we're going to go to this PHP
include make sure it's gonna bring in
the picture that's what we want and then
right next to it we're gonna have an
upload form so to keep the videos
relatively short I'm going to stop and
we're gonna continue in part 10 where
we'll continue on with the edit profile
page and lay in the things that we need
to lay in I'm quickly going to show you
how to make that change in the database
field like I was talking about before
okay so see you in part 10 and I'll just
continue it on right now so there's not
too much of a time lapse here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
