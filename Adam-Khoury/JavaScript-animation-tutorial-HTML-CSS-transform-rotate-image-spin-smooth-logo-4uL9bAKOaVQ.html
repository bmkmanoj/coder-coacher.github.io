you can learn to write rotation
animations from scratch using just a few
lines of very simple code will be using
javascript to animate the CSS transform
property and apply rotation to it one
could also use pure css3 to do this by
using keyframe animations but there are
problems that arise when you wish to
change the speed or animation features
while the animation is running if the
user happens to interact with that
animation or that element with their
mouse perhaps if they hover their mouse
over it or if they click it you might
want to be able to change animation
speeds very seamlessly and other things
like that so that's why I'm going to
demonstrate it using JavaScript even
though we could use CSS keyframes
animation before we discuss the code
let's take a look at the finished
product
okay this is my HTML image element it's
named cog one PNG new I put a little
status down here that shows within an
HTML h2 element that shows the exact
degrees taking place as the animation
runs so you can see it goes from 0 to
360 degrees and you can spin any HTML
elements that you like here I'll quickly
change the code and I'll spin this this
h2 element I'll spin that round and
round it's pretty bugged alright I'll
make them both spin together okay so
that's what you'll be learning how to do
okay let me just check check okay let me
just remove these things that you guys
don't need that was I just wrote in
there for the demonstration and we don't
need to animate this text around again
that status text will remove that
animation so you can see in the body of
my html5 web document that I have an
image element I have a scripting element
and I also have an h2 element this h2
element is simply to show you the
degrees as they run which you can remove
that that's only going to be for
developer purposes now the script
element has a function called rotate
animation and it has two arguments that
it's passing the first argument is the
element on the page that you want to
rotate round and round in this case I
want to rotate ID of image one and then
the second argument is going to be the
speed at which we want the animation to
run so if you want this to go faster you
put a lower number the lower the number
the faster your animation will run and
then you can see all we have is left is
the image tag which has an ID of image 1
now quickly explain the JavaScript world
the magic happens ok so the first thing
we do in the JavaScript is we set up a
variable for the looper which is going
to be our set timeout method and I just
put it outside of the function that way
if you guys want to clear timeout on
that looper set timeout you can stop the
animation from running anytime you want
you just use clear timeout on this
looper variable and we establish the
degrees which we're going to start at 0
degrees now here's function rotate
animation and this function gets called
when this line in the script executes so
the animation doesn't actually start
running until this javascript line runs
and you want to have that right under
the element that you want to spin and
actually I should name this at them
instead of cog 1 because you might be
passing any element through there so let
me just change these cog 1 to LM and
it'll be more sensibly dynamic and let's
make sure it still runs
okie-dokie you can see I have it running
in Chrome Firefox Internet Explorer
opera and then if none of those browsers
are found to be used by this user is
viewing the page then this default css3
transform property is going to be put
into place but for now we have to use
all of the prefixes the WebKit prefix
the moles prefix the MS prefix and the
old prefix in the future maybe in about
a year's time this script will be it'll
look just like this let's see we can
remove that remove that put that right
there put this right there and that
script will run perfectly just like this
in the future but you know how we have
to work with different browsers all
these crazy quirks and even if you're
using CSS pure CSS animations you'll
still have to put in the reference for
all of these prefixes for all the
different browsers just because not all
the browser's are up to speed with using
the standard default transform property
which this line executes that so the
first thing we do is we put this el
variable which is the element that we
want to spin round and round we put that
into a variable called LM after we run
document dot get element by ID on it and
this rotate animation function it's
running very fast many times per second
because we have this set timeout looper
in there set at the specific speed that
we want it to run so once you have an
object for that element we run the if
conditions that are only in place for
now until the web catches up to standard
css3
but these if conditions are set up to
say if the user's browser matches chrome
then we use the WebKit transform
property else if the user's browser
matches Firefox then we're going to use
the molds transform else if the users
browser equals Internet Explorer MS
transform and if the user's browser
equals opera o transform else if it's
not any of those standard transform
then once you have rotated that object
just a little bit you're going to run
the settimeout looper on it what that's
going to do is keep running this
rotation animation over and over and
over again and your degrees are going to
change by running degrees plus plus
basically it just adds one to the
degrees every time that the function
runs it will keep compounding that
number and finally down on the bottom we
just say if the degrees are greater than
359 which means when it reaches 360
degrees you're going to make degrees one
that way that number starts over and
this document dot get element by the
status that innerhtml is for showing the
rotation degrees as they run basically
this little text right here and you can
remove that or comment it out because
you don't need it and it's important for
you guys to keep in mind remember in the
future this is going to look just like
this you won't have to have all those
stupid if conditions in there for the
stupid prefixes for all the stupid
different browsers in the stupid world
okay so it'll be a lot slimmer that's
why it's just a few lines of code and
it's nice to play with JavaScript in
this way to really understand how you
can animate all of the CSS properties
any way you want using some fun
JavaScript let's take a look at the
finished product one more time and there
you go if I wanted to have to go really
really fast I can just set the speed
down here to two and it'll fly see I
wanted to go slow I just put that on
something like 150 you can make it go
really really slow make it just creep
along but I think for a fluid looking
movement somewhere around 30 should be
good that gives you a nice smooth effect
and it might not even look so smooth on
my video because of my rendering but if
you run this in your browser you'll see
how smoothly
that's animating in a circle all I want
to quickly add one more little tip if
you want this to go counter clockwise
instead of clockwise basically the
opposite direction
you just - - and you change this to less
than put a minus on this 359 and a minus
on this one so the degrees are now d
chromatic instead of incrementing and
you want to check to see if degrees are
less than negative 359 if they are you
want to go back to negative 1 for the
degrees let's run that let's see if when
it gets back to 360 what happens when it
gets to negative 360 it should reset
back to negative 1 yep we're good to go
so that's how you can make it reverse
and you can add dynamics to this
function if you want to have the
argument basically you can set this
argument here for clockwise or CCW
counterclockwise and then you can adjust
your function to make that kind of magic
happen
okay so just in creative okay let's test
this one more time make sure we're still
running okay and I'll put these back to
the way they were make sure we get it
going the right way again okay
and this is the code I'll give you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
