PHP image processing video textbook here
you want to learn how to resize user
uploaded images on the fly you want to
know how to make thumbnail images from
large images on the fly you want to make
sure your site only houses optimized
images for web rendering if you answered
yes to any one of those three questions
you're watching the right video because
I want to show you how to do those
things some people say my functions are
so funky and my code is so lean I'm like
a code as satin alright so we're going
to work with the same image upload
application in PHP that we created in
the last video tutorial if you missed
that go back and check it out so we have
my file which is a simple HTML file
upload form and then we have our PHP
parse script for that upload form now
what I'm going to show you is after you
successfully uploaded the file is how to
resize that vile or then further edit
the file at any point in your script
that you want so in order to do that we
have to clearly know the files extension
that's being uploaded and here we're
getting the file type which shows us if
it's an image slash JPEG type or image
gif type but really what we're after is
to get the actual files extension you
know how when somebody uploads an image
it's either going to be a dot JPEG or
it's going to be a dot gif or maybe a
dot PNG we want to be able to take that
extension PNG gif or jpg off of the file
name so no matter where whether it's a
gif PNG or JPEG this will work see these
two lines I just put in to our little
upload script the first variable is
called kaboom and what that's going to
do is hold a little array and I call the
kaboom because we're using the explode
function in PHP which creates an array
out of a string so all I'm doing is
taking the file name so if somebody
uploads a file name boy
dot gif that'll be the file name boy
gift and it's going to have the explode
function run on it and the dot is going
to be the separator that explode will
explode upon so if you wanted to explode
by commas you would just put a comma
date but I'm going to explode by the dot
because I know there's going to be a dot
in that string in between the actual
files title and the files extension so
kaboom is actually going to be an array
that has two elements in it whatever was
on the left side of that dot is going to
be the first element in the array
whatever was on the right side of that
dot is going to be the second element in
the array so I can grab that second
element in the array knowing very well
that that's going to be the files
extension and I can grab it by claiming
the kaboom array right here and claiming
the key of one which is definitely going
to be the files extension if I wanted to
grab the title I would make this a zero
but since I want the extension making
this a 1 so I will have the file
extension at that point just by using
the file name and the explode function
and then down in your script where
you're displaying all this other stuff
you can put another line here that says
the file extension is and it'll say jpg
or gif or PNG because when you echo out
the file type it doesn't just say jpg or
gif or PNG it says image /jp eg and
things like that it's not really what
you want to do when you evaluating to
look for files extension but you can see
our preg match does a good job digging
out any matches for PNG JPEG or gif
within the file name but the reason why
why I had to get the files extension
from the file being uploaded is for the
resizing function which I'm going to
show you right now so basically all I've
added to this file upload application is
now our PHP script finds out the exact
file extension and stores it in this
variable alright now before we integrate
our script to resize the image on the
fly when it's uploaded let's get our
bearings for a second here what do we
have here all we have is a simple file
that uploads an image using the move
uploaded file function so maybe you have
a community type site where you have
users and you allow your users to upload
images and you use the move uploaded
file function now I'm going to show you
how to add something right after your
move uploaded file function to allow you
to resize that photo that the user just
uploaded okay so you can add this to any
scripts that you use right now on your
site that you allow users to upload
files and you use the move uploaded file
function you'll be able to integrate
this resizing function no problem into
your existing scripts that upload files
now I'm going to go down to a point in
my script where it seems like it would
make good sense to resize the image
after it's uploaded to the server so I'm
going to do it right after this unlink
function here I'm going to pop in these
lines of code right here you can see I
have comments above them and below them
comment above is include Adams Universal
image resizing function the bottom
comment is end adams universal image
resizing function that way you guys can
see exactly where that is remove it when
you need to remove it put it in when you
need to put it in whatever
now this custom function that I've
created here for resizing images it
requires five parameters I'm going to
explain the five parameters to you right
now and then after I explain the
parameters that this function needs to
be fed I'll show you the script where
the function resides and that script is
called a K PHP image library 1.0 so
it'll just be handy-dandy functions that
are all wrapped up nice to help you guys
two things as far as image processing
goes like this resizing function but you
can see it's just adding these view
lines to your existing script and you
have to make sure you include this file
here which I'm going to supply the
scripts for all this okay so you're
including a file called a K or you can
name it whatever you want I'm naming
mine ake a PHP image library 10.0 PHP so
include that file and in that file there
is a
some function that I've written out that
is just made specifically for resizing
either a JPEG a gif or PNG depending on
what type of file it is being uploaded
so once that's included at any time you
can run this aka image resize function
and that function is looking for five
parameters the first one is target file
target file you can see has a value of
uploads file name and that's just
basically where your move uploaded file
just put that new file that has just
been uploaded by the user the big
original file so you just put that value
in the target file variable the resized
file variable is the next parameter that
the function requires and that's going
to be wherever you want the new resized
file to live if you want it to not be in
the uploads folder and go into a totally
different folder maybe for a user
somewhere or something you can specify
that here and you can specify the name
what I'm going to do is I'm going to put
it right into the uploads folder where
the original file is being uploaded to
and I'm just going to put a prefix to it
called resized underscore so basically
it'll be in the same folder with the
original file that gets uploaded but
it'll have a name of resized underscore
with the original name attached to it
and it'll be a much smaller version of
the original now the third parameter is
the width max the whiff max is what you
set for the maximum width that you want
the file to be reduced to it'll be no
bigger than 200 pixels now the fourth
parameter is height maximum this will be
the maximum value for the height pixels
so the image that's resized there's no
way it can be any higher than 150 pixels
you can set these numbers to whatever
you want and don't worry the function is
going to resize it proportionally
they'll scale it down without warping it
at all
and finally the fifth parameter that
this function is looking for is the file
extension which was what I explained to
you when we used explode we grabbed the
files extension out of the file name and
that we're sending to this function as
the fifth parameter you see so now what
you've done in your script is you know
you've moved the uploaded file like you
normally do and then right after you
know that that's successfully uploaded
you can run this code you can add these
lines you got to make sure you set your
variables correctly here for the five
parameters that get fed to this function
the function name is a K imagery size
and that function lives in a file that
we've included here to the script called
a K PHP image library 1.0 PHP now before
we take a look at the inner workings of
this file let's test this on the server
to make sure that this actually will
allow upload of a jpg gif or PNG and it
will take either the jpg gif or PNG and
resize any one of them no matter which
type I upload once we see that's all
working we know we have a killer
function that works real nice and then
I'll explain that function to you I'll
show it to you and I'm also going to
share the code with you which will be in
a link in the description of this video
on youtube you can click that link and
you'll see all this code on the bottom
of the page that you'll need now my
server this is what I've ended up with
before I had the just the image upload
application that we originally created
now I'm going to add the ake a PHP image
library 1.0 that holds my universal
image resizing function and I'm going to
make sure that I replace my newly
adjusted image upload script which now
holds these five lines of code that feed
that function okay here we are testing
it out live online so let's choose file
first what I'm going to do is this
flower and I purposely have different
kinds of pictures here and they all have
different shapes for instance this one
is much wider than it is high this one
is much higher than it is wide and this
one is like a normal shot and this one's
a gift this one is a JPEG and this one's
a PNG so we'll see the whole variation
of things that we need to check out when
we're testing this script so I'm going
to try the PNG flower first
upload it the PNG is probably the
largest file and you can see the upload
progress down at the bottom there it'll
probably take the longest to upload but
it's going to be resized as well and
that only takes a split second so here's
the results flower PNG was uploaded as a
size is the type now we see the
extension tool remember now let's just
go back let's upload the girls that JPEG
picture upload it that's going to upload
in no time flat let's go back and get
the last one which is the gift upload it
that one's done all right so that's the
results from uploading all the original
files and remember we added resizing of
all the original files as well so now
when our uploads folder we should see
something interesting so let's look
inside of our uploads folder now now you
can see we have flour P&amp;amp;G girls JPEG and
sky dot gif by the all the originals now
here the resized flour PNG resize girls
JPEG and resize sky died gift look how
much smaller they are a lot smaller
because we thumbnail them on the fly
while they were being uploaded now in my
script I can very easily
unlink these originals if I don't want
to keep them but in this case I'm just
going to keep them so we can see exactly
what's going on but you can very easily
use the unlink function on any file on
your server I'm going to bring these
resized images over to my local machine
I'm going to take a good look at them so
here you can see the folder where I just
brought those over from the server let's
look at the original flower let's
preview that you can see the size of it
and that's really it's a little bigger
than that but you'll see the thumbnail
the resized let's preview that it's a
lot smaller you can see that it didn't
distort it didn't warp it and it kept
the same aspect ratio and the same with
the with the girls will preview that one
it's a nice big picture
let's look at the thumb that we created
perfect let's look at the sky this is
the original visit the thumbnail like
that we created using PHP is a lot
smaller so no loss of quality no
distortion no degradation easy way to
resize to any size you want and it will
handle any type of files that you want
to specify within the function alright
so now that we've proved that we have a
good working application let's take a
look at the actual function in the file
that's called a que PHP image library
1.0 file open just grab that script and
open it up now I custom created this
script so we didn't have to create three
different functions for creating gifts
PNG or JPEGs you can use one universal
function and simple if-else evaluation
statements to create the right kind of
file depending whether the extension is
a gif PNG or JPEG so that's what I did
so this function will work universally
forgives PNG s or JPEGs and the way the
variables are sent to the function you
don't even have to specify what it is it
will sense it on its own using this
extension variable now you see these
five parameters here in the beginning of
the function you can see function aka
image resize starts right there you can
see this one two three four five
parameters those are the same five
parameters they just have different
names in the actual function but they
reflect the same five parameters that we
sent to the function when we execute it
so in your in your script we're
uploading files you use move uploaded
file when you run this function that's
when you're executing the function to
actually make it run here in this line
you're just including it let's go back
into the file so basically this function
once it's included into your other
script it's just laying waiting to be
executed to be called to run and that's
what this line right here does and it
sends five parameters when it does
execute so when this function executes
it's picking up five parameters you see
that one two three four or five and
those are PHP variables that are then
given the values of whatever was sent
through that function that make good
sense so now you within this function
all through the code you can work with
these five variables that were sent
through the function now all we need is
to explain the code to you within this
function and you'll be well on your way
to really mastering resizing files on
the fly making thumbnails and things
like that I'm going to translate all of
this into plain English but if you guys
fail to understand math and simple logic
and that's not my fault if you can't
grasp the concepts going on in the code
I'm going to break it down all into
plain English all right this first line
uses the list function in PHP to list
out the original width and the original
height of the target image when we run
the get image size function on it the
get image size function is part of the
GD library functions so this line allows
you to gather the original width and the
original height into variables from the
original images size properties the next
line create a variable called scale
ratio and that's going to be equal to
the original width divided by the
original height you know so if your
pictures original width was 600 and the
original height was 400 it would be 600
divided by 400 which gives you a number
of 1.5 but it's always going to be
dynamic because you don't know what
shape of an image the person is going to
be uploading that's why we have to use
this scale ratio and this if and else
condition statement so this if and else
condition statement reads if the width
divided by height now this is not the
original width and the original height
of the original picture this is the
width and height coming from the values
that we sent through the function and in
our case we were sending the with max
and height Mattox 200 and 150 right here
to the function we sent those variables
so this
in this age represents that 200 and the
150 so you're saying if 200 divided by
150 is greater than a scale ratio then
the width is equal to height times the
scale ratio else the height is equal to
width divided by the scale ratio so
basically this if and else condition
statement helps you change the width or
the height of the the newly-created
resized image according to what the
aspect ratio of the images if it's a
really tall image or if it's a really
wide image this if an else condition
statement will help you make the correct
mathematical equation to size that image
to scale it correctly all it is is math
and logic there's no crazy language
going on here
everybody knows greater than less than
symbols everybody knows divided by
multiplication equal signs just math but
you have it you have to have it this way
in order to make your application
dynamic so it will scale any shape of
image that's really the toughest part of
the code in this function the rest of
its cake after you figure out what the
scale ratio is it has to be and you've
set the width and height for what it
should be to scale it proportionally
then you want to check and see whether
it's as gif a PNG or JPEG and that's
what these few lines do right here
we initialize a variable called IMG and
that's equal to nothing at first
that's going to get changed within this
if and else condition statements here so
the first condition is if the extension
equals gif or extension is equal to gift
in the upper case then image is going to
be equal to image create from gif and
the target file else if the extension
equals PNG or capital PNG then we're
going to use image create from PNG
function using the target file else we
know it's a JPEG if it's not either one
of those two so we can use the image
create from JPEG function on the target
file now you have to do this because
there's no there's no function in the GD
library called
image create from image there there
either image created from JPEG GIF image
created from gift or image create from
PNG so that's why we had to get the
files extension we got the files
extension this way we can easily
evaluate to see whether it's a gif a PNG
or JPEG and depending on which one of
those that we assess that it is we can
feed the correct function into this IMG
variable so this is a g-d library
function image create from gif this
image create from jpeg we just use this
the other day in the first one of the
first lessons in the in this video
textbook and i explained how that
function works these work the same way
image create from gif and image create
from PNG work the same way as image
create from jpeg they just work for
their respective file types and then we
can use that image variable down here
where we need to inside of the image
copy resampled function which is a g-d
library function all of these functions
you see in here these blue things our GD
library functions except this top one
which is a custom function that i
created to resize the image but within
the custom function that i created is
all of these little blue things you see
here our GD library functions for image
processing let me just quickly explain
the last three lines here and you'll
know how thee the resized copy is
getting placed on the server we create a
variable called TCI net variable has a
value of image create true color with
the width and height variables and what
image create true color does is it
basically it just makes a black
rectangle of the width and height that
you specify no need to overcomplicate
that function because that's all it does
now image can't be resampled is a pretty
tricky GD library function because it
takes so many parameters so I'm going to
put in a little comment here for you and
I don't know if I'll keep this in the
source code I might just keep it in the
video but this is how the PHP manual
describes this function so you have 1 2
3 4 5
five six seven eight nine ten parameters
this function has to get fed image copy
resampled the first parameter being the
destination image and you can just think
of that as the new image being created
the resize to copy the source image that
is the target image the the original big
copy that you want to resize destination
X the new X the new pictures X new
pictures Y the source X and the source Y
the destination pictures width and the
destination pictures height the source
pictures with and the source pictures
height so those are the values that I
fed the function here and I gave it just
the values that it needed to where it
wouldn't crop the picture at all it
would just give a smaller representation
of the original picture you know that
TCI is just that new black rectangle
that was created using image create true
color with a certain width and height
that's going to be the size of our
little thumbnail image is the new gif
PNG or jpg that was created within this
evaluation so now you know what all
those variables are going in there you
should have no question about what each
of these variables are you can clearly
see that these are all just zeros you
know what the width is and the height
the original width and the original
height you know what those are so now
image copy resample shouldn't be so
difficult for you to comprehend there
now the last one we have is image JPEG
which I explained this one in a previous
video with in this video textbook just a
couple of videos back I explained this
one what this one will do is save it to
the file system basically put it on the
server for you and that one gets three
parameters TCI which is our new
resampled image because within this
function here we took the black
rectangle that was created here and we
resampled it to be the resized copy of
the original picture so that's what we
put into this first parameter of the
image JPEG function the second parameter
is where you want it to be on the server
so it's path and filename
and new copy is established here when we
fed the function its variables from the
get-go which came from the image upload
script remember resize the file that's
the value see that value right there
that's the value that's in new copy so
that's going right there we're saving it
with the quality of 80 for general
purposes 80 is good enough for
everything you don't want to make the
file 100% 80 is a good optimizing number
if you go up to 100 you're going to have
an unnecessarily large file that you
really can't tell a difference from
using 80 or 100 but you put this on 50
you'll probably see a difference but
between 80 and 100 you really won't see
much difference and like I said earlier
I'm going to have all of these scripts
available under the video where it's
playing at develop PHP calm if you're
watching this on youtube you can click
the link in the description area of this
video at YouTube click that link and
you'll go to the page of develop PHP
that has the copy and paste code
directly on it under the video so you
can use this function for all your image
resizing needs now when it comes to gif
PNG or JPEG and if you want you can add
more you can add BMP W BMP type whatever
but I just made a universal for gif JPEG
and PNG because those are the most
popular ones and remember it's very easy
to apply this to your current upload
scripts that you have going on your site
already with these view lines of code
you just have to make sure that you feed
it to correct 5 variables that it's
looking for which I explained all of
them in depth I mentioned in a little
caption that I was going to discuss this
image JPEG function in greater detail
about some odd behavior that I found
about it and you guys actually watched
me execute this script live on my server
it actually saved a PNG a JPEG and a
gift to my server and they all retain
their types well even though I used
image JPEG to
put them so some people that might work
with GD library a lot might say hey Adam
you know really if the image is a gift
for a PNG you shouldn't use image JPEG
to save that file to the server you
should use image gif or image image PNG
to do that and you guys just saw me I
used image JPEG for all three no problem
did the job just fine but just know that
in the GD library there's two more
functions similar to this one one is
called image gif and the other is called
image PNG and they do the same exact
thing that image JPEG does except one
does for a gif file the other does for
PNG files and so the odd behavior that I
found is image JPEG will output all
three no problem and they retain their
their file types no sweat
so I just wanted to mention that to you
guys so if you want to have another if
and else condition statement here
maybe down at this part of the script
here and use either image gif or image
JPEG or image PNG according to what file
type extension that it is then you can
choose to do that but I don't think it's
necessary because I found this little
weird behavior alright we'll see you in
the next lesson geeky big dork much
