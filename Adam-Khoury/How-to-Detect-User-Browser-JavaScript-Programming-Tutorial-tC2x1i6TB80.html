show browser detection using JavaScript
so I'm gonna write a quick little
example of doing that for modern-day
browser detection because in order to
detect Internet Explorer properly
we cannot just use the MS ie string
anymore so we'll fire up your favorite
code editor and the code editor that you
use is not important because we will not
be using any special features that any
one code editor offers now I'm going to
be writing this script in such a way
that I feel will convey the most
understanding to the viewer and there
are several different ways you can go
about creating this logic in script now
the first thing we have to understand is
the user agent string so what I'm going
to do is just document dot write and in
between the parentheses we're going to
access the navigator object the user
agent string property so we're just
writing to the page the user agent
string property of the navigator object
and the navigator object gives access to
lots of little pieces of information
about the user's browser now if I test
this in Google Chrome this is the string
that gets written to the page you can
see that the string chrome is actually
sitting right there within that larger
string so I can detect for the string
chrome in that case now if I go to a
preview in Firefox you can see it's a
different user agent string because it's
a different browser and the word firefox
or the string the substring of firefox
is within the user agent string so we
can detect for this substring and it's
that way for all of the different
browsers all of the different browsers
that people are using will return a
different user agent string okay now
let's write this detection script the
first thing I'm going to do is create a
variable named ba which is short for a
browser array so here is my browser
array there's all of the different
little sub strings that I'm going to be
looking for
within the user-agent string now in the
very next line i'ma create a variable
called B or named B I'm just gonna leave
it empty for now because that's going to
be the resulting variable it's just
short for browser then the next variable
we're going to initialize is UA which is
short for user agent we're going to make
that equal to navigate or dot user agent
property now let's simply set up a for
loop that's going to run over the length
of this browser array and you can see we
have one two three four five elements
within the browser array so this loop is
going to be set up to run over the
length of that array for each one of
those so we save our I equals 0 as long
as I is less than the browser array dot
length we're going to I plus plus that
way I starts at 0 and then it will go
all the way from 0 1 2 3 4 so this loop
is going to run five times now I'm going
to add an if condition in that for loop
that way if the browser is detected we
can put the resulting substring in the B
variable which stands for browser so the
logic I want to have in my if condition
is UA which is the user agent string the
full user agent string dot index of and
this is a method that you can run on
string objects in JavaScript is greater
than minus 1 and then we simply want to
refer to the browser array variable and
put the eye index number in between
square brackets so that means every time
this for loop runs the eye is going to
be incrementing so it's going to access
each one of these sub strings one after
another now the index of method returns
the index position where a substring is
found in a string so we're going to have
the navigator that user agent string
that we're going to be checking within
using
this index of method because it returns
the index position where a substring is
found in a greater string so that means
if chrome if this substring of chrome is
found it's going to return a number
that's greater than minus one if it's
not found it will be minus one so that
lets you know that the substring of
chrome is within the navigator.useragent
string or the substring of Firefox
Safari Opera etc index of is just a way
to check to see if a substring exists
within a string and it gives you the
index position of where it exists in
that string so where it is detected we
can then go ahead and put within the
browser variable the resulting browser
variable we can put equals BA and then I
come on I within square brackets that
targets the substring either Chrome
Firefox Safari blah blah blah and puts
it in the B variable the resulting
variable and you can name this variable
B result if it makes more sense to you
and then after that on the next line
we're simply going to break the loop
putting break here just make sure that
the loop doesn't have to run more times
than necessary so if the user is using
Google Chrome browser and it is detected
right away then this loop doesn't have
to run four more times to detect for
Firefox Safari Opera and etc they can
just this loop will run just one time or
if they're using Firefox this loop will
run twice when it hits this substring or
when it detects this substring the loop
will break and stop running because you
don't want the loop running more times
than necessary really okay and lastly
we're just going to alert the value of
what is the resulting browser that we've
detected you can also consult log this
for developer purposes if you like but
I'm just gonna run an alert and it's
just going to say you are using whatever
resulting browser that was detected now
there's also some considerations with
Internet Explorer that I'm
going to discuss in just a moment and
I'll show you why so I'm going to first
check in Google Chrome says you are
using Chrome browser ok now I'm going to
preview it in Firefox browser let me
make that smaller and says you are using
Firefox browser so it properly detected
Chrome Firefox and it will properly
detect Safari and opera as well now for
Internet Explorer let's go ahead and
file preview and browser Internet
Explorer let me make this a little
smaller so you can see it and refresh
and says you are using undefined browser
now if you only detect for the MS IE
string on for people that are using
newer versions of Internet Explorer it's
going to come back as undefined because
the MS ie substring will not be found in
the user agent string because Microsoft
is I don't know what is wrong with those
people but they're constantly doing
things weird and making life hard for
developers I don't know why I think it's
a hobby of theirs they they get off on
it now watch this I'm gonna go ahead and
put two more elements within this
browser array one is trident and the
other is edge now I'm gonna go ahead and
preview this in Internet Explorer again
now it says you're using trident browser
it's because the substring trident is
found when i detect or when I check the
user agent string in this newer version
of Internet Explorer and you might also
come across edge as being a string and
not Trident for some versions of
Internet Explorer now if you want the
resulting be variable to say Internet
Explorer
instead of msie trident or edge you'll
just have to put in some kind of if
condition or switch break case whatever
you want I'll just put an if condition
here that reads if B is equal to msie or
if B is equal to trident
or if B is equal to edge then within
that imp condition we'll say B equals
Internet Explorer now when I detect an
Internet Explorer it says you are using
Internet Explorer browser okay so that
solves that problem that Microsoft loves
to create for us and the rest of the
browser manufacturers don't create that
kind of problem for us it's only
Internet Explorer now in your case on
your production websites
you wouldn't alert this maybe you would
but you would normally probably write it
to the page within the body element or
you might even send it to your server
side for storage whatever you want to do
with that result and this code can also
be packaged up into a class or an
external JS file okay so this has been
an example of programming browser
detection script using core JavaScript I
hope you have enjoyed this tutorial and
I'll talk to you next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
