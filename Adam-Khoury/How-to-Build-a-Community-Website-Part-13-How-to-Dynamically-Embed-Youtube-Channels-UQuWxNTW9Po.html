dynamic social community website using
PHP and MySQL created by flash building
and in part 12 we displayed some members
just temporarily we just played all the
members on our homepage under the footer
and now I'm going to show you how to get
the profiles more in order so let's go
to open profile that PHP within our
source package and let's go to the
design view and let's go to the web
where we have this
web intersect
and let's look at somebody's profile
here give this a little smaller you can
see it and let's look at my profile
okay so the picture is good
let's go into the code I'm going to make
the picture a little smaller maybe 180
and now we're going to go to let's see
we have all this information coming out
and this is what we want to display sign
up date yep yep yep
okay so let's go to youtube and let's
show you how to embed the channel this
is a pretty cool little trick there's
not much of a trick but you guys might
think it's pretty cool
if my internet connection would work
see little things going round and round
I'm not trying to waste your time I
swear to God Jesus Christ okay so
pause that let's go to my buddy
scrambled Channel and you can see
you can go to any channel you want
really to get this code so in mine too
you can go into the contact box the
bottom of the contact box is the embed
channel string you grab that control C
now let's go back into the file and see
we're going to display it up here
now will just display it in the HTML
then we'll print the PHP dynamics for
displaying each one in it so right here
right in front of that well maybe we
should list the channel where should we
do that yeah we're going to put it right
there why not let's go to code
we're going to move that first name last
name in a second all right so there's my
channel will be embedded but it's not
dynamic yet we want to make sure it'll
show everybody's channel if I did this
and put it up when you went to your
profile or if somebody looked at your
profile will be showing my channel so we
have to go here let's see if it hope it
works that way flash building yeah okay
so since everybody put their channel
name in or most people probably did and
what we'll do is we'll check to see
we'll do a check to see if they have the
channel name in and if they don't let's
just grab this print-out tag here
let's put it in this section right here
where it says my channel name or it
shows my channel name it print that and
we're going to make sure it says YouTube
now instead of userpic so now my youtube
channel will be laid right in and let's
see if we need to change it anywhere
else that's it let's get this first name
and last name control x and let's place
it let's see maybe right there under the
user pick
or on top of the user pick right there
right there so you in design mode you
can pinpoint where you want the code to
be or the items press code and you'll
see your cursor is at that position pop
it in good to go now let's ftp this up
reconnect that
and we are putting up profile PHP and
now we're going to web intersect
let's see detective that ok now let's
look at one of these profiles ok there's
mine that is sweet so what we'll do is
go into design view make sure this is
set to top go down to vertical here
under the HTML properties select top and
I'll show you what that does right now
let's ftp that back up now let's say you
have an element like this it's a lot
larger and in a column next to it you
have an element a little bit smaller
it's going to be centered unless you do
what I just did now let's refresh the
page and you'll see that picture and my
name move up that's what we wanted
beautiful
and you can subscribe look at that
interesting
go through all the videos this is really
cool
now let's go back to the homepage look
at another member yol Nunez and there's
his channel all this digital phantom
it's a member of develop PHP com
longtime member well not long time
develop HP com is really new but he's
been there for a while and that is
really really cool the way it embeds
that like that automatically let's go
check out oh I notice guy to he's a
developer PHP or develop PHP and he's
also a friend of mine at Facebook crawl
man with all the oreos all right I got
to see this guy's profile
let's see what
interesting interesting profile picture
that is bootylicious okay so that's
pretty much how you can bring in dynamic
things from other websites if they allow
API you know which is that's not much of
an API but it's a cool little trick
nevertheless and in the code view you
can see that all we've done is take that
YouTube string with the person put in to
the register form and that they'll be
able to edit within their edit profile
page and we sync it right into the HTML
where we render out the embed channel
and its dynamic for each profile and
let's see what else can we show you how
to get in order here let's go look at
our profile again
and we need the bio so I tell you what
we'll keep this one nice and short we'll
put out part 14 and part 14 will show
you how to go ahead and get the bio in
here how to render it out correctly
there's a lot of issues when it comes to
rendering out text data from the
database text columns or text fields
with you have to manipulate the code
just right to make paragraphs render
correctly make sure there's no HTML
showing make sure all apostrophes
there's no backslashes on all the
apostrophes and things like that so
that's what I'm going to show you in
part 14 and it'll be a pretty important
step in everything and then once we get
the profile page nailed down then we can
add some more menu items up here like
member listing I'm going to show you how
to make a member listing page kind of
like we did on the homepage but it's
going to have more of a search feel and
a member listing feel to it the whole
page and we'll do a couple of other
links up here and then the base system
will be pretty much done and hopefully
this will have your wheel spinning
pretty good to be able to and it'll put
the power of coding into your hands and
I'll tell you right now all of these
people who are following along with this
and are interested in these kind of
dynamics in this kind of programming
these are going to be these people are
going to be excelling on the web within
the next six months to a year mark my
words all these people take in this
tutorial series okay so we'll see you in
part 14</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
