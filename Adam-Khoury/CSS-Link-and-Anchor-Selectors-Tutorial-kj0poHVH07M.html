pseudo-class selectors of CSS and they
are target linked and visited selectors
okay let's examine how the target pseudo
selector works and what we have here is
a little in document navigation
application so if you have a really long
document with a lot of data on it a
whole lot of different sections you can
just give your section headings or
wherever the section title is these name
and ID values and then in your link
element in the href attribute you just
put the pound sign and then whatever
that identifier is whatever that name is
and that makes named anchors so this is
just a little named anchor application
or you can call it in document
navigation now this CSS rule is
selecting P element that happens to be
the target of any link so you can see
these links target specific elements in
the document when any of these links are
clicked the document automatically
Scrolls to that position on the page
okay let's see our target selector in
action so if I was to click section 3 to
automatically scroll to section document
section 3 you can see it lights up the
title for document section 3 if I click
document section 4 it lights that one up
so on and so forth so it's lighting up
or it's selecting the target for the
link that's how these elements are
getting styled according to which of
these elements are getting clicked so
that's one good way to put the target
link pseudo selector to work all right
the next selectors we're going to
examine are the linked and visited
selectors and these are used to target
and style different states of your link
elements so on your normal state we're
giving it a color blue and on the
visited state it's going to turn a
colored gray so if you don't want your
links turning a different color after
they're visited you just make this also
blue and that will force all of your
links
to remain blue all the time but it's a
nice feature to have them turn gray or
some other color and it lets the user
know that they've already visited that
web page and that covers all of the link
pseudo-class selectors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
