how to use html5 JavaScript and PHP to
render elegant file upload progress bars
now due to the fact that we're using
html5 this application may not work as
intended in old versions of browser
software so for now just make sure you
experiment in either Google Chrome
Firefox or Internet Explorer the most
modern versions of those and we'll be
coding every line of the small script so
there'll be no need for any bulky
third-party code libraries or frameworks
this way you'll have a better
understanding of how the application
works at its core it would be much much
easier for you to manage and customize
it down the road first let's take a look
at the finished product of the lesson so
you can evaluate whether or not your
applications might benefit from having
file upload progress meters and this
little demo is running live on my server
right now online so what I'll do right
now is browse my computer for a video
file and make sure it's one that's over
one megabyte at least that way we can
see some progress loading into the bar
and it doesn't load so super fast so I
browsed my computer and I chose Tom and
Jerry mp4 which is a video file that was
sitting on my desktop and it's
approximately 2.8 megabytes
now I'll press upload file and what I
did was I added at the bottom just for
developer purposes two lines here this
first line shows you the exact number
the percentage of how much of the file
has uploaded to the server so far and
this bar this nice green bar here shows
the exact percentage as well now down at
the very bottom I put in an extra line
that shows how much of the file bytes
have loaded in and the total bytes of
the file size so as the developer you
can see how much of the file has loaded
in exactly how many bytes and the total
amount of bytes when the upload is
complete we have the application render
out a message that comes back to the
Ajax request so this file is actually
being uploaded using Ajax and this
message right here
is an echo from PHP alright let's begin
with the bare bones of an html5 web
document this way we can all see the
production of this application from
scratch mine is named html5 file upload
form dot HTML you can name this file
whatever you want this is the file that
just houses the form so first let's go
into the body element and we'll put all
of the HTML that we need in place and
then we'll put the JavaScript here in
the script element up top so the first
thing in the body is I'll add an h2
heading that says html5 file upload
progress bar tutorial then under that
I'm going to open up my form element and
make sure I go down a couple of lines
and close that form element now inside
of the opening tag for that form element
we're going to put an ID for that form
and the ID we give it isn't very
important at this point and actually
within the whole application we're not
even going to reference that ID but your
form might need a name and an ID
attribute so you can go ahead and give
it that then for the data encoding we're
going to have multi-part form data so
the encoding type will be multi-part
form data because we're building a file
upload application and then the method
that the form will use is post we're
also going to specify the method post
within our Ajax request because really
ajax is going to be what's uploading the
file and post will be specified for that
ajax request ok now inside of the form
we're going to have an input element
with a type of file and this is what
gives you user the little browse for
file button so what allows them to
browse their computer and select a file
and we'll give this a name attribute
that's equal to something simple like
file 1 we're also given an ID attribute
of the same value I will close that
input element and we'll just put a break
tag there that way we have a line break
on the page now the next input element
we want is going to be type of button
we'll also give it a value attribute
that way we can specify what the text is
on the button we'll just make it say
upload file now the last thing we need
on this button is in
on click event listener so we'll put in
on click is equal to whatever JavaScript
function that we want to fire off so the
name of the JavaScript function that
we'll write will be upload file then
open and close parentheses so this is
how we can execute the upload file
function on click of this button
so this first input allows the user to
browse their computer and select the
file and then this input is simply a
button that initiates the upload of that
file and I'm programming this all very
basic you guys would have to customize
your whole application to get it working
exactly the way you want it I'm just
making it very basic for demonstration
purposes now we're going to add the new
html5 progress element put in the
opening tag and the closing tag for that
progress element now we'll give this an
ID of progress bar we'll make the
starting value zero and we'll make the
Max attribute 100 that way it has a
range from 0 to 100 and I'm just going
to put a style attribute in there to
make it a width of whatever I want so
you can customize the width of that
progress bar
I'll put it 300 pixels you can also
target some other style properties for
that progress element now the next thing
we're going to do is have those two
lines that I had under the bar in the
demo of the application there was a
little line that showed us the exact
number of how much progress has loaded
with a little percent symbol and then
there was the line that showed us how
many bytes were loaded in and how many
total bytes are were for the file size
so let's pop those into place and the
first one is an h3 heading and that has
an ID of status then we have a paragraph
element with an ID of loaded and total
so status is where we're going to put
the actual percentage number for how
much is loaded in but like I said this
is for developer purposes but if you
want to have it in your final
application for your end users to see
you can choose to do that but you can
just remove these if you don't want them
because really all you need is the
progress bar to show them how much has
loaded but some people like showing them
the number with the little percent
symbol as well so that's all of the
tml that our application will require
for now now we can work on the
JavaScript portion now first I'm going
to pop in a function that's simply going
to allow me to not use document get
element by ID a whole lot of times in my
application since I don't want to use
that over and over and over again I can
just write a small function that returns
that and all I'll have to use is an
underscore to get any element by its ID
on the page if you've ever used jQuery
before they'll use a dollar sign here
and that way in your applications all
you have to do is put dollar sign and
then refer to the element that you want
I'm just going to use an underscore that
way nobody gets confused
so all this function does is set up to
return the document get element by ID
object reference for whatever element
that you're targeting on the page it's
simply a way to avoid writing document
get element by ID many many times in
your application now the next thing we
need in our Java Script is this upload
file function so let's copy that name of
that function that's going to fire off
on the on click event of this upload
file button so we go up into the
JavaScript and we type in function
upload file open close parentheses put
an opening curly brace go down a couple
of lines and put in a closing curly
brace now the first thing we have to do
in that upload file function is target
the file that is to be uploaded so we're
going to need a variable name and we'll
just name it file and we'll make that
variable equal to document get element
by ID and the ID we want to target is
file 1 right here and we're going to
access its files array and the first
element in the files array we can access
that by putting a 0 in between square
brackets so you've targeted that file
field by its ID and then you access its
files array the first element in the
files array that basically gives you the
object reference for whatever file the
person has browsed for and then you can
upload it now this next line that I have
in place is going to be
meant it out but you might want to
uncomment the first few times that you
run this application so you can see how
you have access to the file name the
file size and the file type even before
the user presses the upload button so in
your JavaScript side of your application
before this file is sent to PHP for
upload you have access to the files name
size and type if you need to evaluate
those things for your form but I'll just
leave that commented out you guys might
want to uncomment it and let it run
first couple of times that you run your
application and that's just there for
developer purposes as well
now the next variable we'll need is a
form data variable so we'll just name it
aptly form data and that's going to be
equal to new form data object instance
and we're establishing that so we can
easily send key value pairs of data in
the Ajax request to the parsing file so
we'll take that object reference now on
the next line and we're going to dot
append run the append method and we'll
append a key value pair so the name or
the key will be file 1 and the value
will be the next parameter so we put a
comma and then we just refer to the file
object reference here and this form data
instance is going to be sent through our
Ajax request when we use the send method
so now let's build that Ajax request
we're going to say Bar Ajax equal to new
XML HTTP request open close parenthesis
semicolon now since the whole point of
this application is to have a file
upload progress bar we're going to have
to have some event listeners added to
this Ajax instance because we want to
listen for the progress event we want to
listen for the complete event when it's
done we're also going to listen for the
error event and the abort event so let's
pop those lines into place right now you
can see we're taking the Ajax object
instance and we're adding event
listeners to it and this first event
listener is progress the second one is
load and that's your complete event so
when the whole transaction is complete
and the file is finished being uploaded
and PHP gives a response
it's back that's when this load event
fire is often
complete handler function will execute
during the progress event for this
upload a progress handler function is
going to be called every time that
there's new progress of upload to the
server so every time more bytes are
uploaded to the server the progress
event is going to be called to run or
the progress handler function is going
to be called to run by the progress
event listener now these last two ever
and abort are rarely ever going to
happen and if they do happen will have
functions in place ready to take care of
that event these are all straightforward
how we're adding the event listeners to
the Ajax instance we simply target the
event that we want to listen for then we
put in the name of the function that we
want to fire off when that event occurs
so we have to have these functions
written in our script we're going to do
that in just a second we're going to
have four functions progress Handler
complete handler error handler and abort
Handler we're going to write those four
functions then when these events happen
to take place those functions are going
to take care of those events now you'll
notice that the first one the progress
event has the upload object reference
before we add the event listener and
that's just so that we can monitor the
progress of the upload while it's
uploading if you remove that dot upload
reference that we put there you'll
notice that your application might not
function correctly so we put that in
place just to make sure that we can
evaluate the progress of the upload
while it's uploading all right so now
the very next thing we need for the Ajax
request is to run the open method now
the open method gets two parameters the
first parameter is going to be the
method which is post and then the next
parameter is simply the URL of your
parsing file so I'll name mine file
upload parser PHP that's going to be the
file that actually moves the uploaded
file to the server and I'll show you
that file in just a moment and the very
last line we need within this upload
file function is Ajax dot send method
and this is what actually execute the
whole Ajax request so we're going to
send form
data so what we have to do is put in our
form data object instance and it already
has the file appended to it right here
so that way the file can be uploaded by
PHP now before we look at that PHP
upload parse file we're going to need
these four little functions in place
that I was talking about now the
progress handler is the most important
one for this exercise because that's the
one that's going to keep firing off
every time the server is updated with
new loaded bytes we're going to be able
to access the event that loaded and
event dot total so you'll have how many
bytes have loaded so far and the total
bytes and we can compute those two
numbers to give ourselves a percentage
okay let's get this first function
progress handler written into place so
let's put function progress Handler open
closed parenthesis
opening curly brace closing curly brace
now when these events are firing off we
want to snatch up the event reference in
the arguments area of this function so
for the argument for this function we're
just going to put event now sometimes
you might see this written as EVT or
sometimes you might just see it as E and
it doesn't matter anyway you want to
write it it can be and it could be this
if you want it doesn't even matter but
as long as you're referencing that event
and I'm just going to write out event
because that's what it is but keep in
mind that you might see this written as
EVT and remember an ActionScript we used
to write just e to reference events
remember so whether you see it as e
whether you see it as EVT or whether you
see it fully written as event it'll work
either way like that we're just scooping
up the event reference as an argument to
this function that way we can access the
event within the function now first
thing we'll do within that function is
say document dot get element by ID and
we're going to target this loaded and
total element down at the bottom and
this one this line is just going to be
in for developer purposes just to show
you how much of the file has loaded in
so far and how much total bytes so
you'll get the loaded bytes
and total bytes shown to you in this
paragraph element but you can remove
that if you need to for your finished
application so once we target that
paragraph element we'll target its inner
HTML property we're going to make that
equal to the string of uploaded bytes of
total bytes so you'll see how many
loaded bytes have progressed and how
many total bytes you have we're also
going to use event that loaded and event
that total to get the percentage right
now so let's type in var percent is
equal to event dot loaded divided by
event dot total and we're going to
multiply that by a hundred that way we
don't get a decimal value and we get a
correct percentage number that we're
looking for it's just basically we're
multiplying it by a hundred to make sure
there's no decimal we're moving the
decimal over two places basically now we
can say document dot get element by ID
of this progress bar the new html5
progress bar and make its dot value
equal to the percent and if that number
ever happens to be a decimal and you
want to math that round you can just put
math dot round method to run on the
percent number now we'll say document
get element by ID the status element on
the page which was this little h3
element here we're going to put the
actual percent number and the percent
symbol so the user can see it will say
dot innerhtml is equal to and we'll just
take the same number here the percent
plus the string of the percent symbol
and the words uploaded dot dot please
wait and that's all of the code that
we're going to need within our progress
handler function so this function is
going to fire off a lot and that's what
gives you the animated effect of the bar
growing so let's take that whole
function press ctrl C go down under that
one and press control V let's change the
name of that to complete handler so we
have function complete handler now now
we can remove this line from the bottom
and the only line we want to keep in
there is the progress bar value we want
to make that zero
- the upload is complete now this
complete handler function is the
function that fires off when PHP echoes
back the upload is complete - the Ajax
request
so when PHP echoes back the upload is
complete - the Ajax request or if PHP
echoes back some kind of ever event this
complete handler will also pick that up
so before we make the progress bar value
back to zero we want to put something in
the status stat innerhtml
and that is the actual text coming back
that is echoed back from the PHP file
and that is target dot response text and
if any of you are familiar working with
Ajax you'll know that the target dot
response text property is how we get the
response text back from a parsing file
like a PHP script and that's all there
is to the complete handler function so
the complete handler is tied to the load
event and the load event just pretty
much means when the operation the
transaction is fully completed now the
ever and abort functions are going to be
very basic let's get the error handler
here for that one I'm just going to
write into the status element upload
failed and we can take that function and
then get the abort Handler and that'll
be like a cancel listener for if the
file upload is canceled we'll name that
function abort Handler and in the status
will put upload aborted now we have all
four of our event listener functions in
place and that's it for the JavaScript
now all we need to do is write our file
upload parser dot PHP which is simply
going to be a script that uploads it
moves the uploaded file to the server
and then it will echo back to this Ajax
request some kind of message okay so you
can see file upload parser is made very
basic for this demonstration and you
would want to expand it with more error
handling and checking of the file size
the type and to make sure it's there and
things like that the only ever handling
I put in place was to check and see if
the file was browsed for it just to see
if it's there before we run the move
uploaded file function on it
to actually put it where we want it on
the server so the first thing we do in
this script is we want some variables
that represent the files name its temp
location in the PHP temp folder its type
its size and see if what the error
message is for that file upload we get
access to all of those little things by
specifying the global files variable the
key or the name of the incoming key
value pairs and we were sending in as
key value pair the key of file 1 and
then the file data to be uploaded and we
can tap into the little specific details
about this file by specifying its array
elements because the file that's coming
into this script has an array of data
behind it that we can access little
parts of for instance the arrow the size
the type temp name and name so the first
thing I'll do is check to see if the
file is in the PHP temp folder ready to
be moved if it's not there then we're
going to echo back to Ajax request ever
please browse for a file before clicking
the upload button and we exit the script
if the file is in the PHP temp folder
and it's ready to be moved we just run
the move uploaded file function so all I
did was I put if move uploaded file
function executes correctly then we're
going to echo back to the Ajax request
file name upload is complete because at
that point everything is successful else
if the move uploaded file function does
not execute correctly then we're going
to echo back to the Ajax request move
uploaded file function failed and you
guys know how the move uploaded file
function works it takes two parameters
the first parameter is the file to be
uploaded where it's residing in the PHP
temp folder temporarily before it gets
moved and the second parameter is your
destination the path and the name that
you want to have for that file you can
name the file whatever you want if you
feel like changing the name or you can
just keep the original name that it was
uploaded as which is what we're doing
here or you can change it and you can
also target any folder in your directory
on your website in your folder system
I'm just targeting a folder called test
upload
and in that folder we're placing the
file now like I said you'd want to put
more error handling here maybe to check
the file size its type and things like
that the script is made basic just for
demonstration purposes so that's it for
file upload parser and it's very simple
now back in our upload form I want to
stress to you guys that you don't have
to use the progress the new html5
progress bar element you can animate any
graphics any custom graphics that you
want for instance if you want to have a
canvas element here instead and you want
to use any crazy lines or circles or
whatever to show progress of a file
upload you can do that you can have
animation on a canvas element instead of
having this progress element here you
can also put a div within a div so
you'll see that many times people
traditionally use to make progress bars
and gauges using a div within a div they
just make the parent div have a border
and a background then they put an inner
div inside of it and that inner divs
width is affected through JavaScript in
this progress handler event so within
this progress handler event you can
simply target a divs width and make it
grow according to the percent number so
the inner div would be like a growing
colorful bar that grows inside of a
parent div and the parent div you just
give it a border a background make it
look any way you want and inside it'll
have a child div that grows dynamically
according to the percent of the file
upload so there's many many different
ways you can be creative with this and I
just wanted to use the progress the new
html5 progress element because that's
exactly what it was designed for it's a
new modern thing we have to use in the
web and it was made for exactly this
purpose or things similar to this but
keep in mind that you don't have to use
that you can use any custom graphics
that you want
okay so that shows you how to use html5
JavaScript and PHP to render elegant
file upload progress meters and all the
programming that you need to be able to
customize this thing for your future
applications I hope you've enjoyed this
