actionscript 3 lesson I'll demonstrate
how to map out or capture or realize
user mouse coordinates so you see how my
mouse is moving and the stage
coordinates are moving along with it and
I set it to where when you put your
mouse over this movie clip here this
black movie clip symbol on stage it also
realizes and captures and shows the
user's mouse coordinates just over that
particular movie clip and then the stage
coordinates are still rolling along this
way you can use this type of application
or these type of this type of code to
capture where the users mouse is so that
way if they're on this part of your
stage or that part of your stage you can
move things and I made a you can see on
the mouse is a green animated dot and I
made that follow the mouse so there's a
whole lot of things you can do so if I
know exactly where the users mouse is on
stage I can make that Mouse follow it
pretty easily with a little bit
ActionScript and I show you how to do
that inside this file and let me show
you the file here and you can see
there's that black movie clip there's
nothing on stage really no symbols on
stage except that black movie clip and
then I have a layer where that black
movie clip is all by itself here and
then the layer above it is everything
else on stage and that's the dynamic
text fields that display the coordinates
the mouse coordinates then we have the
actionscript layer and in the
actionscript layer you can see I was
really nice and I coat I commented out
the code above every single line to tell
you what it's doing and what is there to
tell you about this one this one's
pretty simple but a lot of people really
don't understand how to capture
mouse coordinates user mouse coordinates
you know to the at the most basic level
so this one will show you how to
understand in the most basic level how
to capture mouse coordinates on top of
your movie clips or mouse coordinates on
the stage you see those numbers rolling
along there is a stage and I suggest you
go to develop PHP calm and download the
source file to get it the code and also
to play with the demo that's on that
page and you can see how it functions
all right we'll see you guys next listen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
