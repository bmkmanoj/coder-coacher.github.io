you once again my friend thank you for
giving me your precious time and I know
how valuable it is to you so in this
lesson we will instruct and discuss
entry-level basics of JavaScript
animation programming on the html5
canvas element this is canvas animation
programming 101 first day so we will go
very easy on you and explain the basics
in depth you will get a quick coding
exercise that will enable you to create
a basic animation on your canvas tag
using JavaScript and we'll also have a
nice little discussion so I can pass
along some ideas and discuss Universal
animation theory with you
I'm also an actionscript 3.0 instructor
for flash authoring - many of the key
concepts of actionscript 3.0 animation
programming that I already have in a
huge playlist here can be looked over
and transitioned to JavaScript rendering
on the html5 canvas element as long as
you understand programming to a good
enough degree
there are three basic steps in
JavaScript canvas tag animation
programming the first step is to draw
your assets to the canvas using
javascript the next step is to quickly
clear the canvas and the third step is
to very quickly redraw the assets in
their new state or their new location in
order to make the effect of animation
these are Universal animation concepts
you have linear animations tween
animations and also something called
multi plane animations which you don't
hear a lot about multi plane animation
but it's something you see a lot in
movies cartoons and it was developed by
Disney Walt Disney himself actually
spearheaded the development of the
multi-plane camera and things like that
you can go here on YouTube to this URL
to watch this video about the
multi-plane camera that was developed by
Disney way back when or you can just go
to the search bar at YouTube and type in
the multi-plane camera and you'll get
this video and it's a really cool
concept and I've applied this concept to
a lot of my earlier flash actionscript
3.0 tutorials so we can also apply this
multi-plane camera concept to our
javascript in html5 canvas animations
when we get good enough that we're not
going to be showing you that in this
first tutorial this first tutorial we're
going to create a linear animation and
maybe down the road we'll get into the
more advanced concepts of animation
programming but in this tutorial and
right now in the code exercise that
we're about to go through right now
you're going to learn how to create a
linear animation okay now we're going to
do a hands-on coding exercise that will
teach you how to animate from scratch on
the canvas tag using javascript okay so
you can see we're starting with the bare
bones of an html5 web document and I
have my style element ready to go my
scripting element for JavaScript and you
can see in my body tag I already have my
canvas element all set up it has an ID
of canvas its width is 550 and its
height is 400 pixels now if I render
this to the page right now using my
favorite browser to view it in I get
nothing I would just get a blank page
because there's nothing there so what
I'm going to do is just put a border
around my canvas that way I can actually
see where my canvas exists on the page
so in CSS you can just target canvas and
actually this will target all canvas
elements on the page but since I'll have
only one I can use this method or you
can target the actual ID of canvas
border color will make it something like
that the devil code 1 pixel and solid so
it's one pixel wide solid border that is
the devil color now we render this to
our favorite browser we'll see an actual
border around our canvas that way we can
see exactly where our canvas is on the
page all right now let's code a button
into the page and target it's on click
event so when somebody clicks the button
we want to fire off a function called
draw open closed parenthesis you can put
in a semicolon there to break that line
if you want but it's not even really
necessary and then we'll just make sure
we close that button tag and for the
content section we'll just type in the
word draw so that's what the button will
say and we're going to feed two
parameters or two arguments into this
draw function it's going to be the x and
y coordinates of where we want our box
to appear
0 X position and a 0 Y position that's
all of the HTML and CSS that we're going
to need now in the JavaScript section
here we're going to need a function
called draw and it's going to have to
take in those two parameters so let's go
ahead and write that in function draw
open curly brace go down a couple of
lines but in your closing curly brace
now instead of these saying 0 0 we want
them to actually say x and y because
those are going to be variable names
that are going to represent those
numbers so we can just you can have that
say poop and pee if you like but just
know that they represent the x and y
coordinates if I were you I'd call it x
and y so right when the draw function
fires off and as many times as it
repeatedly fires off it's going to have
two parameters that are being passed
through it two arguments okay the first
line within that function is we want to
target the canvas element on the page so
we say document get element by ID canvas
because that's the identifier for our
canvas tag and I put a little cold
comment here that says reference the
canvas element on page the next line
we're going to establish a 2d context
for the canvas element that's going to
be a variable called CT
and CTX is equal to canvas dot get
context 2d now this next line here is to
save the canvas state if required
and actually the little animation that
we're programming in this tutorial it's
not really required but it doesn't hurt
the script so we're going to leave it in
place but this would be used for
animations where you have a lot of
transitional things happening and the
state of the canvas needs to be saved
now this next line is a definite
requirement and what that does is it
clears the canvas for redrawing the
scene and that takes on four parameters
or four arguments just make sure you put
the width and the height of your canvas
element as the last two parameters for
the clear rect and the first two get set
to zero now with these next two lines
we're going to style and actually draw a
rectangle it's going to be a green
rectangle and this is makes a green box
that should actually be style a green
box style for a green box and then like
I said the next line draws the rectangle
so when you use fill style this is using
the RGB a function which lets you pass
in four parameters and those are
basically for specifying red green and
blue and alpha so this is your red this
is your green this is your blue and this
is your alpha setting for the color so
you can make it somewhat transparent if
you want and then CTX fill rect is
actually what draws it and you see the
first parameter here is the exposition
for where you want that little rectangle
to show up on the canvas so we're just
making that dynamic that way each time
these function is drawn and redrawn it
will have a new exposition and that will
give the effect of animation to the
viewer the next parameter is the Y
position and then the next two
parameters are the size of the rectangle
50 by 50 50 pixels by 50 okay now this
next line is used to restore the canvas
state if you're using save so if you
have the kind of animation that requires
to save the canvas state then at this
point in your script you want to
store the canvas state after the
elements have been drawn after your
assets are drawn now with the next line
we're going to increment the exposition
and you can increment that by five or
ten or whatever I'll just leave it on
five for now and this is what is really
the magic behind the movement of the
little box we're going to transpose its
exposition over a timed loop now since
we've been recently using this in some
of our JavaScript tutorials it shouldn't
come as any surprise to any of you guys
we're setting up that loop timer
variable again and the loop timer
variable is set up to hold the set time
out method so basically it's just your
timer and it gets two parameters the
first one is the function that you want
to execute every 20 milliseconds and the
second parameter is your 20 milliseconds
if you want that to be one second you
put it at 1000 milliseconds I want it to
be five seconds five thousand
milliseconds so I'll just set mine to
200 milliseconds that way we can see
kind of like a choppy animation you can
really sense what's going on and that's
all the script you're going to need for
this very basic animation example that
will really get you up and running into
more complex animation programming okay
so now let's render this to our favorite
browser so I'll go to file preview in
browser and I'll just use Chrome so now
what's supposed to happen is when I hit
draw a green box should appear somewhere
around up here
and it should start animating across the
page right away there we go
so you can see it's a very choppy
animation I'm going to show you how to
smooth that out and make it look like
butters okay so here you have the second
parameter for your set timeout method
remember I said this is really controls
the timing of your animation it's almost
like your frame rate sort of now let me
set that at 20 draw how fast that's
going right now let's set this to 1
that's how many pixels we're going to
offset the exposition of that box each
frame
see that's a lot smoother and it's not
so jagged it's not such a choppy
animation so you play with those two
numbers and you can get just the
animation you want let's go to pixels
that looks pretty good
you probably set this safely on
something like 30 put that on three and
you still have a pretty smooth animation
I bet it's not bad you can play with
those numbers to really fine tune and
tweak the smooth factor the smoothness
of your animation and it's also
something to keep in mind is that the
users computer somebody has an old
crappy computer they probably have an
old crappy video processing capability
in the system their animation rendering
capability is just not going to be up to
speed with like somebody who's got a
computer like mine or like yours you
know what I mean okay so you've got your
coding exercise you see how the
animation programming works and it's
pretty basic stuff there's nothing
really hard about it and like I said you
can transition a lot of the flash
ActionScript lessons that we put out a
couple of years ago you can transition
all of that code over to JavaScript now
now that the canvas tag is become
popular okay so I hope you guys have
enjoyed this html5 and JavaScript lesson
on how to animate on the canvas element
using JavaScript
we'll have some more discussions and
coding exercises to follow that are
along these same lines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
