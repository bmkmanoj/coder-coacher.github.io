here with another fireworks cs4 tutorial
and in the last lesson we left off and
we created active web layouts in
fireworks alone without using
Dreamweaver press f12 and you can see
what we ended up with here without using
Dreamweaver we made links may roll over
and roll out all that good stuff and so
what we're going to do in this one is
show you how to create a drop-down a
pop-up drop-down type menu on one of
these buttons here you can do it you can
choose to do it for all of the buttons
if you like so all of these already have
behaviors that we set upon them in the
last lesson and I'm going to link to the
last lesson right here so if you want to
check out the first one and click that
link right there and so let's take the
behaviors off let's delete all behaviors
so what you do is you highlight this
slice and you click the center dot and
then you delete all behaviors so now if
you press f12 you'll see the delay the
behaviors are gone for that the other
three is still active okay so let's go
back in and let's add popup menu this
time now on the content tab of the
pop-up menu editor let's type in what we
want in there so that's products so
let's say we're a clothing store or
something let's put shirts
and as you type in to the the
bottom-most field it'll add another one
for you to type in automatically you'll
see i'll type pants see how it added it
automatically or you can hit the plus
sign here and say hats and shoes okay so
the way you set up the links on this one
it is right here just double click that
and say on your server and your root
directory you would have shirts that
HTML that's how you link to that shirts
page that you have it's linked to the
pants page or you can put the whole http
www or you know your whole site URL
leading to that page you can put the
full link instead of the relative link
so this would be hats that HTML and this
one would go to your shoes page shoes
that HTML
okay so let's see advanced target you
can set the target to blank cell parents
or top I'm just going to leave at
default so it will default to self go to
appearance now an appearance tab you can
select HTML or image and I'm going to
choose image and i like the little
configuration i have here see you can
change the way these look very easily
i'm going to leave it on the one I had
which was the fat one there and then for
the overstate it's yellow let's make it
blue bird there we go and now so you can
set with the text will be see how it's
on the overstate texts black here in the
overstate it's white there you can see
how those are all set up now if we go to
position well let's go to the Advanced
tab so that's a that's pretty much it
for the appearance tab and there's a
bunch of different settings you can set
in there and I advise that you guys go
through and check out the whole thing
you can even make a horizontal menu if
you want it but it's best if you
experiment with all these little
settings in here and check out what they
all do but which create what I'm going
to create that's as far as I need to go
so the cell width is good at 88 see if I
change this to a hundred it'll make
those bigger
but 88 was nice it's a good size the
cell padding all the different stuff the
menu delay is amount of time before the
menu disappears when their mouths goes
away from the menu set for a one-second
delay and that's fine with me now let's
go to pop-up borders yep yep yep you
could set all the stuff and check out
what everything does now let's go to
position make sure it comes out from the
bottom so it's set menu position to
bottom of slice you can set it to the
right top and off to the bottom right so
let's see what we get let's press done
and you'll see that we need more space
here so let's go to canvas size Anchor
Point top so it pushes down and then set
this to 140 it should be a good size
alright and we even have room for
another button in that menu if we wanted
there so now let's press f12 see what we
get nice new behavior see it's pretty
cool
and you can see it
it navigates away let me see one thing
here let's add simple rollover behavior
here press f12 now it lights up like it
should okay so now you see we got to
Center that thing it's not really coming
down where we want so let's fix that
and I should mention to you guys when
working with the building active web
layouts and fireworks you should go to
the View tab and select to view you know
smart guides guides tooltips and slice
overlay and a few other things that way
to just give you a better reference to
where things are and how they're going
to act or how they're going to be
positioned and so what was I going to
show you how to do okay so let's go into
the edit the pop-up menu now so now we
can go to position and we have to offset
that too maybe 12 press done so we
offset the exposition now you can see
it's more lined up Center so let's go
ahead and press f12 to publish it out or
render the file that's more like it that
is beautiful you can't beat this for
ease ease and customization Dreamweaver
doesn't even come close but they're
different kind of tools you know so so
what will happen here is let's just say
you wanted to make a whole site
so let's go ahead canvassize anchor down
or anchor it to push down and then say
600 so your site would be 888 wide and
600 toll 600 hi press ok now there you
go now you got all that room to do any
kind of custom layout you want so let's
go into the layers and let's minimize
these folders
or collapse and you see layer 1 is
locked and on the web layer we have our
slices and everything so let's lock all
for those slices the web layers
highlighted let's add a new layer now we
have later too let's name layer 1 what
should we name this
menu bar menu bar graphics
whatever you want to name it and then
layer to you can see there's nothing on
it yet so it's locklear menu bar
graphics and on the web layer there's
all the slices so let's see what happens
if we position put something on layer 2
under the slices so on layer 2 will add
a say you had a banner that was going to
run see be about that big under your
menu and everything see if we can okay
so lets you move it around and you have
to put it on a separate new layer like
that to be able to access it this way
and then let's see what happens if we
publish if our menu pops it over it
that's good it's exactly what we wanted
so you can see how your web page would
come to life very easily in fireworks
you can have the ultimate in control
over the looks and the graphics and the
hotness of the site you know what I'm
saying and it'll work just like an HTML
site that's not Flash's all HTML
Javascript CSS based functionality so
let's go ahead and close that and
let's say you wanted to have more
buttons you would just add more slices
if you had a footer let's say you have
to bring further down here
and on top of it you had some text
there's a link
and all you would have to do is add
another hot spot add new layer so that
pretty much shows you how you can get
your whole website created easily in
fireworks put some text easily create
your entire website and fireworks alone
publish it out it's beautiful and put
all the images you want all the custom
graphics little characters you draw
whatever you want to do and that pretty
much wraps it up so that shows you the
functionality of placing drop-down menus
on your menu bar in the header and we
showed you how to make new layers a new
layer to put new graphics separate from
that menu bar and header and you can use
the same method to make new hot spots
and browser functionality like we did
for the first set okay so hope you
enjoyed this lesson and once again rate
it nice and high and comment comment on
it if you guys want to see more and
fireworks cs4 okay we'll see you next
lesson well actually let me show you how
to export it out file export is going to
be the same deal as last time this time
we're going to create a new folder and
call it site and then
inside we'll name this all site so that
way everything will have that prefix so
press save now let's look in the folder
site there it is you can see all the
elements were rendered out site CSS file
and HTML file open that well let's open
this with a dreamer dreamer of cs4 open
desktop crystal insight and there it is
so you can get to the source code go
into design view and you can see that
you can't add anything to the to the
design but you can work around it just
press them put in more texts put in more
images go to properties get a background
image for your whole site loaded in very
easily set the link appearance and
everything like that and you can further
manipulate things from inside of
Dreamweaver for your site ok we'll see
you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
