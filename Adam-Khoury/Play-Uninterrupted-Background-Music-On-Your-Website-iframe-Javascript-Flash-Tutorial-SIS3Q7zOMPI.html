with another web design video lesson
this one is a question we get regularly
at the develop PHP comm forums so I
thought I'd document this information
these three techniques on video so it
reaches a wider audience now I've had a
few clients that have requested to have
audio play continuously on all pages of
their website now if I were to just add
an mp3 to play on each page the normal
way each time a user would navigate to a
different page the music would start
over
so we'll be showing you three techniques
to prevent that from happening so the
background audio is uninterrupted as a
visitor navigates all the pages of the
website so not only will we discuss the
techniques we're also going to show you
code and give you real examples to get
these things going for yourself and at
the end of the video I'll tell you
what's my preferred technique and the
cons of using each different technique
okay technique number one is here a
developed PHP in the learn HTML section
you just go down to I frame floating
frames and here's all the code you need
to get started with creating a floating
frame that would hold your page content
now let me explain real quick how that
would work what you would have is your
floating frame would be your page
content section and that would always
change when people are clicking on your
static menu so you have your site header
your footer and your menu will be static
on the page and never change as the
person navigates through all the
different pages of your website because
the menu system will control what gets
loaded into this page content section
which would be your iframe on top in the
header you can simply put any kind of
mp3 player you want or you may choose to
have it in the footer or over in the
menu just as long as you put it in a
section of your website that doesn't
have to reload every time they click a
link the only thing that will reload in
the iframe situation will be the page
content section if you designate that to
be your iframe okay now technique number
two is using JavaScript so let's click
on the learn JavaScript link and down
here we have examples
common webmaster uses for JavaScript in
that list I've got a little tutorial
about raw JavaScript div toggling for
uninterrupted audio play on website so
you can go to that page you can get this
code and experiment with that a little
bit and this one works in a similar
fashion as the iframe the only
difference is you're using javascript to
swap out what's displaying as page
content when people are clicking your
various menu items but in that situation
it's the same thing the header the menu
and the footer and whatever else never
changes and never reloads the only thing
that reloads in the page is the content
section and that's JavaScript driven so
you can have your mp3 player up in your
header in your menu you put it wherever
you want on the page as long as it's not
in that ever-changing content section
because the header footer menu will
never reload so you can put audio to
play in those sections and it will never
get interrupted technique number three
is using flash so we can click on the
flash video tutorial section scroll down
to working with mp3 and sounds sound an
mp3 audio player programming and down
here at the very bottom it's the latest
tutorial I put out about sound
programming in ActionScript 3
it's called website background music
with control and streaming play and this
one will show you how to get website
background music to play with in your
flash website as people navigate through
all the various pages now which of the
three techniques is best for webmaster
to use I'm not going to define which is
the best I'm going to leave that up to
you and maybe everybody on YouTube or
wherever can comment in and say what
they think about the situation what I'll
do is I'll just mention what the
disadvantages are to using these various
methods and a lot of people will just
say you know it's just not cool at all
to have background music playing on a
website that's not what websites are for
but the web is changing you know a lot
of people might want to have audio
background music playing on the website
as we go into the future that's going to
be a more common thing multimedia on the
web is growing okay so iframes this is
Ben
using iframe or floating frames on your
website is that search engines sometimes
have a difficult time spidering and
indexing that data and also establishing
links to that data that is within the
frames now with javascript the
disadvantages are that it can be
disabled by the user and google says
they do not like for webmasters to use
hidden divs but google and facebook both
use them religiously and are the biggest
sites on the web and if you want I have
a little article a developed PHP under
the marketing and SEO section that talks
about hidden HTML containers which is
the way that JavaScript method is set up
if you click on that I talked about the
article at Google I give a link to it
and everything where Google discusses
how they don't like webmasters to use
hidden text and links by hiding it
through CSS so you can check out this
article if you want so maybe a better
method using the JavaScript would be to
use jQuery to load in the pages so one
could use jQuery to make it to where
they don't have hidden containers on the
page that are waiting to be displayed in
the content section you would actually
load the pages in on the server and that
would help you get rid of this one but
jQuery and JavaScript can still both be
disabled by the user and there's some
freaks on the web that run around
there's some freaks on the web that
navigate the web with JavaScript turned
off because they're afraid of JavaScript
attacks and my preferred method is flash
and in flash building comm I have
continuous mp3 for all my pages and
stuff like that the mp3 just keeps
playing in it and it will not be
interrupted no matter what they do
unless I want them to for instance if
somebody clicks this TV button you can
see I have a program to where a new
window pops up showing the TV and then
the audio has stopped I can press play
again start it up
so with the flash website I think I just
think it's a little more natural and
usually you'll see continuous audio play
throughout a whole website on flash
websites so that's pretty much it I hope
that helps some of you guys who are
looking to have website background
SiC continuously play throughout all the
pages of your website okay we'll see you
