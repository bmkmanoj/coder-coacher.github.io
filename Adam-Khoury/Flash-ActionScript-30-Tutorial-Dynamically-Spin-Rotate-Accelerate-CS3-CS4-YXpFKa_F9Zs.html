in this tutorial let me read the route
it's dynamic rotation spinning your
objects with a dynamic acceleration set
on them and I show you how to do spin
manually on the timeline and I show you
how to just do spins and just how to
change the angle of of items and all
kind of little tricks in this lesson
hello everybody and welcome to another
flash actionscript 3.0 tutorial brought
to you by flash building this one is
easy and can help you with your
animations greatly in this lesson I'll
demonstrate how to rotate objects your
movie clips or buttons whatever you need
to spin will show you how to rotate them
with code for a clean or spin effect and
we'll go into create new flash
actionscript 3.0 and you can be in cs4
or cs3 and first thing I'm going to do
is pull out poly star shape
a little smaller okay so there's my poly
star make it black let's make it red no
edge
okay so let's convert this to a movie
clip and normally you might have a disc
or a circle that would be rotating so
you can write the symbol but I wanted to
have points on my object so we had good
reference of how this thing is spinning
I'm gonna convert it to a movie clip
senator registration is fine and let's
call it poly star so now we have a movie
clip symbol and let's go ahead and name
it my movie clip my movie clip down in
the instance name area here the
properties panel so now it has an
instance name so we can attach code to
it now so the first thing we're gonna do
first let me show you how a beginner
might try and rotate this object so what
they would do is maybe go to frame say
10 frame 20 making key frames by
pressing f6 all through there and then
just one more and what they would do is
take this and with the skew skew tool
they would move it by holding shift to
each side and then you hold it and build
two sides away now the next one you go
three sides on YouTube three
then the next one winds up back at the
beginning point so now you can create
motion tween by right-clicking between
all of these dots here and creating the
motion tween now if we render out
control-enter
we'll see we have a nice spin it's a
little choppy you know let's go to
higher frame rate of 30 and surrender
out
I say that's not a bad spin but there's
a way you can get it even smoother
because you can see that one point it
hangs up ever so slightly so I'm going
to control Z until I remove all of those
steps I created there okay so now we
have our poly star here we have an
instance name on it let's go and put in
an actions layer here for our
actionscript 3.0 I created that new
layer by pressing this insert layer
symbol here and then I double click to
rename it okay so on that layer we're
gonna highlight that keyframe there on
on frame 1 press f9 I'll open our
actions panel now the first thing we're
gonna do is set up the speed that we
want this thing to spin and this can be
changed spin speed this variable name is
spin speed and it is a number variable
and it is equal to let's give it a value
of 2 that'll be alright now let's say we
want to rotate the object so we say spin
now we say my movie clip the instance
name of the movie clip dot rotation and
this is the method that enables the
rotation I can spell it right equals
spin speed
all right so what we're saying here is
the rotation and the movie clip is gonna
be equal to two so let's see what
happens actually let's go ahead and just
make this number very large so you can
see what happens
make it forty render out and you can see
it's fun it almost completely around see
that but what we want is an animation so
there's two ways you can go about this
and I'm gonna show you the the easy way
first and then I'll show you the the
dorky coder way so if we make another
keyframe here or just you don't even
need to make keyframe just press f5 one
frame to extend those keyframes out and
then render out
oops yeah sorry I'm gonna add to make
this compound and pull the rotation we
need we have to add in an addition sign
here before the equal sign that will
compound that value see what happens
so it's spinning it
but if we take that value down back to
two you can see it more clearly so you
see what's happening now it's set on a
spin that we control the speed of and
let's get on a frame rate a little
higher here back to 30 so it's smooth
now that's the easy way so let's just
control z out of those tips let's go
back to frame rate of 30 and now the
dorky quarter wait what we're gonna do
is add in a an on frame an on enter
frame event and function so let's type
function okay let's see if I can spell
right now function on enter frame and
the on interframe event is very handy
for looping and making things enemy
because the process is this function
process is every time the frame is it's
access so if you have a a file that's
set to 12 frames per second this is
gonna happen many many many many times a
second
okay so now we closed off the enter
frame event around our little dynamic
animation code this has to be a plus
sign here can't forget that plus sign
and then all we need is an event
listener now so you say add event
listener and then this is event dot
enter frame all caps and the name of the
function is on inter frame right in here
so you just put that there
you can give it a custom name if you
want to it doesn't have to be that name
right there okay so I think we're ready
now for T's a little bit fast let's go
back down to two and let's see if the
dorky way works with only one keyframe
sure does dorky way is nice nice and
smooth so that's three methods right
there of spinning things and now I'm
going to show you the the ultimate
coolness let's go to make this point
five and let's go right down here is a
special little trick I'll show you how
how to accelerate through code make
something accelerate to gain speed over
time write a little comment there and
we're gonna say spin speed and all you
have to do is take the spin speed which
is 0.5
when we start off and make that equal
spin speed Plus let's try one see how
fast it accelerates so what will happen
is we'll start off spinning slow and
accelerate over time hopefully if I set
it up right that is hot you can see
chaos sets in chaos literally sets in
man mathematics is beautiful look what's
happening it's just ah ha oh no that is
dope you see the mathematics freaking
out from the acceleration I wanna just
try something here and go into his movie
clip add a rectangle actually answer add
a couple of circles here a couple old
primitives one there control C control
shift V and let's put one right there
this is gonna look sick you can see the
mathematics chaos bugging out
and it cool the versus direction
so that's how you accelerate now since
that's going way too fast let's go to a
point one
now let's render out control-enter now
you can see the much more dramatic
effect of acceleration the way I had it
set before it was chaos but the chaos
will soon set in here as well and the it
will reverse its dynamics visually that
is too cool you might take it a little
while longer but it will get to the home
and doing some really cool things
basically that's it that is D listen how
to dynamically rotate and accelerate
through code spinning objects you can
use that accelerate or any motion really
doesn't have to be a spin okay we'll see
you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
