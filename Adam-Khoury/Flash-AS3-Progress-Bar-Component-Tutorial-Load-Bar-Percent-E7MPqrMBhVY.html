we show you how to use the progress bar
component and attach it to dynamically
loading items that way it can listen and
show progress and also we show you how
to have a status text that will show the
load percentage as well and I show you
how to modify the look of your progress
bar size and everything like that let me
press control enter render out you see
what happens so you can see this is
listening to the percentage that's
loaded so is our bar and it's customize
the look of it and there's the image
from the web okay let's create new flash
actionscript 3 file and let's adjust the
size make it a little bit higher 450
440 ok now we're going to drag out from
the components library the UI loader
we're also going to drag out well first
let's position and size this thing the
way we want it let's make it 500 x 400
ok
so that's where our image will be loaded
into this time we're going to use a
progress bar focusing on this progress
bar component and strike that out to
stage and let's place it right about
there you can put this anywhere you want
really does not matter and i'm going to
double-click inside of it you see you
can get to all the little pieces
double-click inside of that change these
to dark right now let's double-click
inside of this zoom in to about 800 and
let's double-click in that group let's
change the color of this gradient fill
let's make it white on top
and dark red
maybe not so white buns up let's give it
a little bit of red
there we go now this thing we can change
from blue to whatever color we like this
also has a gradient so they can be
bright red on the other side of the
gradient dark red okay now I've
customized the look of the component
let's go back to seen one here now it
still shows those blue lines on there
but it's not going to be like that it's
going to be all red make this 300 so we
can see it better and let's make it 10
pixels high you can adjust the sizing of
it too okay so now we have our loader
let's put a dynamic text field right
here make sure we say dynamic text well
make sure we select dynamic text here
make sure we have an instance name of
status underscore txt because this will
text field is going to relay information
to us
well maybe we'll just put the percentage
right there
something like that let's Center align
that let's make it black okay you can
also embed that to make it look nicer
for all users whether they have your
aunt that you're using in that field or
not press ok and now it's embedded into
the file okay so now we have all the
elements we need let's give them
instance name so make sure this one says
progress bar let's make sure this one is
instance name you I loader so what's
going to happen is we're going to load
code in to load an external image into
this UI loader and this progress bar is
going to handle all the loading display
and listening ok I think everything has
instance name we're good to go let's do
some code
okay let's rename this layer stage
elements
you can have as many layers as you need
to hold as many items as you need this
one as3 for actionscript-3 now we'll
highlight that keyframe press f9 open
the actions panel everything has an
instance name so we can target all of
those items now the first thing we're
going to do is claim a variable string
variable that's going to hold the URL
address for the image we want to load in
to that you you I loader let's name an
image URL colon string equals HTTP the
visibility is that I'm going to load a
big image that I have at develop each
piece server and I'm going to load an
extra large image just to show the
progress bar a little better normally an
image wouldn't be as large as the one
I'm going to load in and I'm going to
load an extra large jpg I think it's
about a megabyte and change that way you
see good progress loading from this load
bar component this is swf demo images
folder and the name of the image is
bella one it's my little chihuahua ok
now we close that up and put the
semicolon ok now that we have that we
can make a URL request variable object
and let's name it request this is URL
request and then we pop in in between
parentheses that string okay now we're
going to claim a few properties for the
UI loader we sit there you I loader dot
scale content we're going to set this to
true that way my SuperDuper large image
but whatever size limp image that I
choose to load into the you I'll order
will be scaled proportionately
automatically you are an older dot load
and here we're going to load the URL
request into that you I loader okay now
we're going to load the UI loaders it's
not a bar we're going to target the
progress bar now that we placed on stage
we're going to load the source of the UI
loaders data which would be that image
so this is going to equal the UI loader
so now the progress bar has a source
data content of whatever it was in the
UI loader which was this JPEG on server
okay now we're going to claim a couple
of event listeners for the progress bar
for the progress event and the complete
event so
let's see progress bar let's grab that
that add event listener this is going to
be progress event
dot progress all caps and put a comma
and we're going to put the function name
progress handler we're going to create
that function in the moment so right
here on the progress event now we have a
listener attached to the progress bar
now let's attach another listener so
let's highlight that whole line now this
one is going to be a complete event so
right here all caps we type in complete
and remove this word progress on that
event and this will be complete complete
handler there we go now we have the
listeners for the complete and the
progress events attached to the load the
progress bar now let's just create the
function function let's do the progress
handler first progress handler this is
event colon progress event so we can
just grab borrow it right there put it
right there clothes off parentheses
colon void open curly brace close curly
brace now let's grab that function nest
and put another function here this is
the complete handler and this is going
to be event event okay now we're going
to use that status text field here to
show the percentage of how much is
loaded in and then the bar is going to
show the percentage of how much is
loaded in by doing its magic and showing
a growing bar okay so here we're going
to feed the status text bill txt text is
equal to the current targets percent
complete so all we have to do to claim
that is make sure we grab the event
whatever object is accessing this
function dot current target
and then it's percent complete there
then you'll have the value and let's add
to that see what a plus sign are going
to append to this string here and add
the percentage sign there we go and
close it off the semicolon and actually
you're going to want to turn this into
an integer so it's claimed int and put
that in between parentheses there there
now we have a nice integer in a string
that's going to have the percentage
symbol on the end of it and this is
going to be animated and it's going to
show us the percentage of what's loaded
in as it loads okay so that's all we
need in the progress Handler and now
we're going to add or remove these two
event listeners inside of this complete
handler function because they won't be
needed anymore and actually remove the
progress bar and the UI loader now we're
not going to remove the UI loader we're
going to add the UI loader sorry we're
going to remove the progress bar and
then add the UI loader to stage
now the UI load is already on stage
we're not going to add it dynamically
sorry we're just going to remove the
progress bar so let's say remove child
open parentheses close parenthesis
semicolon and grab this progress bar
variable okay or instance name let's see
and we want to remove these two event
listeners so let's grab those two there
remove the event listeners and then
remove the progress bar there instead of
add we remove remove event listener
remove event listener and I think that's
everything so now we press control enter
it should download that or not download
but load in that image from the web into
the application see make sure we got
everything right
well if it doesn't work we can fix it
let's see control-enter there it is you
can see it's got a nice percentage let's
customize the color I made it and so
what we want to do is remove the status
text there's my little puppy okay so
once she's not a puppy but she's tiny so
let's remove make sure we remove that
status text here too and that's very
easy status text equals nada you can
just claim a string of nothing that'll
empty it it out let's try that again
control enter there it is okie dokie so
that shows you how to get a nice
progress bar component attached to your
items that are loading in dynamically
from your web server will see you next
