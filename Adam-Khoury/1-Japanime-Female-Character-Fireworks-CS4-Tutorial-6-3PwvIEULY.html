you'll be learning how to create this
fireworks cs4 tutorial japanime style
eyeballs nice glossy effects on them
nice huge eyeballs like you see on those
japanime type characters everywhere and
will also be going further with showing
you the mouth and hair and highlights
and the hair and all that cool stuff but
in this one we focus on the eyes okay
the first thing we want to do is get the
shape of the face so we can a couple of
ways you can do this you can start with
an ellipse or you can use your pen tool
just draw it out I'm going to start with
in the lips and then just bring down
this part a little bit okay make sure I
change the size of that freeform tool it
looks good right there
okay that's a good start to the face
anyway now let's give it a little edge
okay it's not too shabby all right now
let's start on this I so let's grab one
more ellipse and it's make it nice oval
shape about like that make sure we have
no edge on this one let's make that
black now let's grab highlight this one
ctrl-c ctrl-v and scale that one zoom in
just a little bit by holding ctrl and
mouse wheeling it zoom in and out let's
get this about the size and placement we
need what we're trying to achieve yeah
this is going to be the colorful part of
the eye which I have selected right now
and I'm going to make it a yellowish
color right there that'll be good nice
gold I and now control C control V and
this one we're going to resize this is
going to be the pupil make this black
and the Japan of my characters always
have really huge oversized eyeballs if
you've noticed make this one a little
more like that there we go right about
there let make it a little bit smaller
there we go
right in the center as best we can that
works ok now we'll draw the white part
of the eye this can be see let's just
draw an ellipse and reform it with the
freeform tool to get it to the exact
kind of shape we want let's bring this
in a little bit bring your top down just
a tad
let's see I'm going to reform this I
just a little bit more because the
character would look me and if I left it
like that change the size of this make
it a little smaller and bring this up so
it has it more of a rounded top there we
go that's perfect now we're going to
zoom in just a little and put the
eyelids kind of like mascara type
eyelids on it so let's go ahead and grab
the pen tool for that and all we need is
to go from you here way over here and
then click down here go back around to
about right there and then curve it
around the top and then click down here
and then go right about there make it a
little curved than that edge there we go
let's make it black now we can adjust
that to where where it fits right over
that white part of the eye or we can
leave it actually what I'm going to do
is resize it this way so it has more of
a there we go and it's perfect oh I like
that that's beautiful let's do one more
for the bottom now go here move out
right make this one really small I care
to a ball right there curve this one
down click down here click down here and
then curve that down to about right
there okay
there we go what you can do is give this
you just a little drop shadow maybe
but not that way let's change the angle
come about right there right that bring
it up maybe about two there we go that
one can say just like it is and now
we'll bring this here let's go ahead and
group those ctrl G actually let's just
go ahead and flatten them modify flatten
selection that way now it's a bitmap and
I can erase it if I need to I'm going to
bring it to front by pressing ctrl shift
up okay now that that's on top take it
make a copy of it refers to fill c
control v take it and resize it these
characters eyeballs are always really
huge chip anime characters i'm going to
twist it or skew it just a tad all right
about there want to get it actually I'm
not going to skew it not just yet anyway
want to get it right about there and we
want to make sure that this eyebrow or
eyelid is above it because the character
will have eyebrows so let's bring this
up a little bit more so right about
there and now we can simply erase what
we don't want of that item will use
around
eraser let's go right about there let's
see the zoom in a little bit make sure
we got it yep looks like we got it ok so
now kind of looks like the character is
looking up a little bit because our
white part is so big so let's do this
here we go now we can bring this up
make sure we still have correct shape on
that white see it's coming through there
let's grab the free form fold that just
down a little bit pull this over just a
little bit
sighs down bring this back down that
looks good enough ok so there's 1i but
we're not done yet because usually let's
go ahead turn this just a little bit
there we go usually they have really
glossy affects all over their eyes these
japanime characters so you can just take
it in small ellipses small white
ellipses and put one there one there and
a little tiny one here and then make
sure they're white first and then you
can give them an opacity of about ninety
percent and there you go then you get
that nice glossy look that you see on
Japan and my character eyeballs so I'm
not even sure if I'm going to use that
as the left or right I let's see that
looks better over there ok so let's grab
this whole thing actually if you wanted
to make it look a little better you can
put a inner shadow or inner glow around
the white part of the eye bring it down
to two maybe twenty percent and not six
right there there we go now let's take
this and ctrl G to group that now we
have a group ctrl-c ctrl-v that copy and
paste and then flip the new copy drag it
over just a little bit there you go nice
japanime style eyes you can use for your
characters and this is going to be a
female character and I'm going to do the
next part we're going to do the show you
how to do the little mouth nose and then
the hair and get rid of this we don't
need it anymore and there'll be a whole
lot of shadows and effects that will put
on the face once we get to creating the
face after we get the hair on we'll put
the effects on for the face because
there's no no use in getting effects on
the face or shadows in on the face
before we get the hair on because the
hair will determine a lot about how the
face will be shadowed ok we'll see you
