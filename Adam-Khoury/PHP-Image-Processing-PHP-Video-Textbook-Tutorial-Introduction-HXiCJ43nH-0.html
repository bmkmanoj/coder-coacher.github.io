video of the mastering PHP image
processing video textbook within this
video textbook we're going to discuss
concepts and supply code examples that
will help you begin mastering PHP image
processing each little thing that we
demonstrate within the videos we're
going to have copy paste code available
for you guys just in case you need it
before we begin with the programming
examples let's lay out a brief summary
of the books contents and address who
this video textbook is intended for this
free online video textbook is intended
for PHP programmers interested in
becoming proficient in working with PHP
image functions many PHP website
programmers need to know how to gather
images from users resize them on the fly
crop them and more PHP programmers who
wish to know how to draw and add effects
to dynamic renderings will also benefit
the information laid out in this book
this information is made for webmasters
that use PHP scripting the topics to be
covered in the textbook are discussing
the various PHP image processing
libraries and we are going to focus
greatly on the GD library we're also
going to cover creating image upload
forms and parsers to gather images from
users and place them on file we will
cover creating true thumbnail images
from very large images without
distortion or degradation we will cover
resampling cropping copying moving
renaming replacing deleting and
converting images and we're also going
to delve into line drawing shape drawing
filters blending and a few more things
along those lines the author is yours
truly Adam Cory and a help resource that
might be available to you is the develop
PHP com forums although no free help is
guaranteed if you have trouble using the
examples we layout here in the book so
I'm excited to show this information
there have been a whole hell of a lot of
people asking me to make examples
regarding this kind of programming
there's been a lot of requests where
people are asking how to resize images
and things like that crop them so in the
next video we're going to get right down
to it you're going to get your hands
very dirty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
