again from Adam and develop PHP comm
since quite a few people are requesting
a full vector 3d Christmas scene
tutorial and fireworks
we will bang out very short three-part
series that covers the entire process
from start to finish
beginning with creating this moon that
you see in front of you the star field
and the light reflective snowy surfaces
on the land create new fireworks
document or make mine 1000 by 550 yours
can be any size for the particular
purpose you have now I'm going to take a
rectangle out first thing and I'm going
to draw it into this space here to serve
as my background color or the color of
the sky now I can go into the color
palette here and I'm going to change the
tube a blue a very dark blue okay now
I'm going to hold down the shapes and
grab the ellipse I'm going to draw in my
moon on a hold shift to make sure it
stays symmetrical as I draw it out and
this is I'm going to give a gradient
radial and on the outer edge where it's
dark blue let's go and change that to
some kind of off-white color right about
there looks good to me okay
and then in the center it's white so
that's good and what I'm going to do is
go down here to the texture and add the
plaster because plaster will give me
kind of texture I want for that and if
you want you can go and give it a little
bit of darker color on this edge where
it's off-white and that will bring in
that feature a little more so you can
see a little bit more of the texture the
more you darken that up now I'm just
going to hit my pointer tool and select
this item and I'm going to drag its
radial up to about this direction then
with that item still selected I'm going
to give it a filter shadow and glow in
her shadow and what we'll do is angle
the inner shadow this way to where it's
hitting from the bottom bring its depth
up lower it right about there looks good
to me then bring down the opacity a
little bit now with your moon selected
still let's give it a glow so go to
shadow and glow glow and make sure
that's just a regular white you can make
it spread a little bit further out and
blur
just a little bit more now I'm gonna
grab this background that we placed this
large rectangle that's the sky in the
background
would give that a gradient as well to
serve as kind of like the halo around
the moon so I'm going to give this a
radial gradient and where it's white I'm
gonna change that to this blue okay and
then I can grab this point here to move
the gradient where I want it to be and I
can also resize that I'm going to bring
this glow down just a little bit it's a
little bit too dominant and that blue is
actually a little bit too bright for me
so I'm gonna bring that
and the color of that down just a little
bit make that a little bit darker that's
good right there
now this in turn shadows a little bit
much and bring the opacity down on that
just a little right there now we can
draw in the star field so what we'll do
for that is just grab the brush tool you
can see I have it set to one I'm going
to change that to I'll start with three
I'll make different sizes actually so
I'm going to just go ahead and dab here
and there and everywhere it's gonna make
its own layer so as you're painting you
don't have to worry about you painting
that onto your moon or whatever it's
gonna be its own layer so if you want to
sprinkle them evenly all over the place
just like this you can okay now I'm
going to change the size just a little
bit down to two and sprinkle some of
those in there those will be just a
little bit smaller than the other ones
and then finally I'll take it down to
one and I'm going to bring my
transparency down to about 40% and then
click those in
okay now after putting in the little
tiny star lights that then you have a
nice evenly spread star field that has
good field of depth to it because you
put different size points on there
okay now let's hold down on the shapes
tool and grabbed out star symbol you can
hold shift while you drag it out we're
gonna adjust the points to be only four
points remove that plaster texture if
you have that on there and this radial
you're going to change that off white to
solid white if you have the radial edge
there but you'll want to give this a
radial gradient and you'll want this
outer edge opacity all the way down to
zero if it has an edge or stroke remove
that stroke now you'll want to pull this
radius in about like that or whatever
looks best to you then press ctrl-c
ctrl-v this one we're going to turn you
can rotate it by holding shift you can
snap rotation angles rotate that one 45
degrees and then make it size just a
little bit smaller put it back into the
center there now what you can do is use
one of these as little points of light
where you want now let's see if I resize
that I should have a little point of
light kind of start looking things see
that that's what you want now this one
you also want a few like this I'm gonna
actually make that one in the center a
little bit smaller just so it doesn't
look so repetitive with only that kind
of star light so let's select this star
hold shift select that star and press
ctrl-g to group those two together see
that and now let's just resize that hold
shift to make sure it stays in
proportion see what that looks like
that's beautiful
now what you can do is take that you can
really zoom in on it by holding ctrl and
mouse wailing you can take that ctrl-c
ctrl-v make a copy
it'll scale it up just a little bit make
it a little bigger than the other one
you can place those anywhere you like
and put this one over here somewhere so
what I'll do is use the variation of
those three and sprinkle those around
just to give my sky a little more of a
twinkling effect okay so what you should
be left with after that is a brilliant
twinkling star field behind your moon
now let's draw in some blankets of snow
so you can grab the pen tool just click
down here somewhere
you be creative as you like to hit just
make some little lumps make it a little
bit lumpy and I hope I don't have to
show you people how to use your pen tool
let's change the gradient from radial to
ellipse and what we'll do is use this
elliptical gradient to serve as a spot
where the moonlight would be kind of
reflecting off of the snow so let's
adjust the size of that let's bring that
in just a little bit let's move it over
here for now just right there I'm gonna
make this where it's dark just a little
bit lighter okay and this blue gradient
highlight I want that to be white so I'm
going to change that to white I'm going
to keep it over here for now and then
I'm going to give this an inner shadow
in a shadow I'm going to make that white
gonna make the angle on it 270 so it's
pointing straight down then I can give
that some spread and some fade I
definitely don't want that at 47 so
let's put it right about there and bring
the opacity down just a little bit
now I can play with this to give me the
exact sort of moon reflection that I
want on that surface so I can drag this
out a little bit to bring this down
let's see what happens I don't want it
so right there and you can position that
anywhere you want so if your moon's
right there you just drag that straight
down my debt make sure I don't want it
to go sylheti you're right like that now
I'll use my pen tool to make another one
so let's grab the pen tool and just draw
it in a way B shape that'll be like
you're your land
put it over here where it should go then
this one needs the inner white shadow as
well so we'll go to inner shadow we'll
make that white and this one we want to
be a little bit a flatter surface or a
flat or blanket of snow not so much of
Hills
so we'll spread this gradient a little
bit further than we did on the other one
now I can adjust this to make it look
just the way I wanted to I've decided
that I want these hills to be just a
little bit lighter so I'm going to go
into the gradient Baudette change those
two just a slightly lighter blue now
what I'll do is just make these little
gradients kind of match you see my halo
around the moon has a diameter sort of
like that you see it so I'll just make
these little guys match that see that
see how it meets up now
and this one the same thing right about
there and then you'll have a more
genuine looking reflection on your snow
this one I'm going to bring up just a
little bit this point somewhat there to
be a nice big Hill right there
there we go that's a good start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
