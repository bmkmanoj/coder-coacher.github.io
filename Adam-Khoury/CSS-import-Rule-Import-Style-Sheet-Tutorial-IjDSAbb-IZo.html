in elementary school
well you're not there's going to be
cursing nudity and blood in this
exercise you can learn to use the CSS at
import rule the import rule is used to
import style sheets into a document or
into other style sheets which means
basically you can import one style sheet
into another style sheet so if you have
a secondary style sheet it can be
imported into your main style sheet or
straight into the document so we have a
simple link element that's calling in a
style sheet of example a CSS and all we
have is an h1 element with hello world
in it now let's take a look at the
example a dot CSS to see what's in it
you know what we're doing is changing
the body background color to pink so
this when we look at it should have a
pink background which it does now let's
take a look at example B dot CSS now if
this were to get applied imported into
this stylesheet example a that means all
h1 elements should get affected by these
properties so let's take a look at our
index example again in the browser we
see it we have black text now let's go
into example a and we'll show you how to
import example B dot CSS into example
eight and we have to do this on the
first line unless you have at charge set
if you're using an app char set rule
then that gets the first line but if
you're not using it at charge set rule
then the import rule can go right here
and it has to be the first line in your
CSS will type in import URL open close
parenthesis semicolon in between
parenthesis we're going to type in a set
of double quotes and then we'll type in
example underscore b dot CSS now let's
save that example a go back to index and
now let's test now you can see that our
text it's not black anymore it's red and
fifty pixels so you've successfully
imported example B's styles into example
a
that's ESS okay let's see where else
this will work let's take it out of
example a that way example a is back to
normal let's go into the index and what
we'll do is under the link element and
type in style then we'll close the style
element and let's put our import rule
right there so basically our document
gets its normal style sheet and then
we're going to import the secondary
style sheet into the document using the
style element let's see if that works
yep everything is connected so where you
use the import rule it's basically as if
you took all of this code and put it
exactly where you're using the import
I'm going to take this control X and get
it out of there and put it back where we
had it here there's also different
syntax approaches that you'll see you
can do it without the parentheses and
remove the URL function reference so all
you have is at import space and then a
set of double quotes and inside the
double quotes is where you put the file
or the file pass so it can look like
this or the way we originally had it
like that now the import rule can also
be made media dependent so if your
syntax looks like this that means that
example b dot CSS will only be imported
if these media properties apply to the
user's browser we'll talk more about
these settings when we do a video
tutorial for the @media rule which we'll
be covering that one as well in depth ok
let's put this back the way we had it
let's go ahead and take that rule out of
there again we're gonna try one more
experiment so example a an example b or
like normal
neither are importing the other so we'll
go into index we remove that link
altogether
for example a dot CSS and let's put it
in a style element close it now let's
import example a and let's also attempt
on the next line to import example b and
let's see if the styling from both style
sheets gets applied to the document
yep so that kind of configuration works
all so let's put all this back the way
we had it and this is the code example
I'll give where we're importing from
example a dot CSS from the stylesheet 1
we're importing stylesheet 2 into it
this is the code example we'll have in
the page but we showed you all kind of
different ways you can set up the code
to make the same thing happen and it's
really just a lot handier if you're
going to import some styles from this
one style sheet into another style sheet
that's why I'm going to leave this code
example because that's probably where it
would be used the most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
