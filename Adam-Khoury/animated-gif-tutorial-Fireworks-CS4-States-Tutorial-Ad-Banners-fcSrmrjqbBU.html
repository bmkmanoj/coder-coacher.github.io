here with another fireworks cs4 tutorial
this one is a a tutorial requests from a
member and their request is how to
create an animated banner for websites
out of several pictures or text and not
sure it would be easiest task and moving
objects around through fireworks and he
says my apology is a stupor request and
such thing has to be done in flash or
something else so I would say yes it
should be done in flash but it can be
done in fireworks as well and the reason
why it should be done in flash is
because flash makes a nicer looking
animation with better image quality
throughout the animations and it also
it's easier to create animations and
flash because of tweening and in
fireworks it's just keyframe animations
so there's no training involved so you
have to do it frame by frame like they
used to do way back in the day at Disney
for the cartoons frame by frame okay so
let's go to create new and 250 by 250
that's perfect
and let's look at the standard banner
sizes just in case you guys want to see
those these are the standard banner
sizes and you can reference those in
case you're making a an animated gif
banner for standard advertising banner
use but if this is for you just for your
psychic peak any size you want so let's
go ahead and change the canvas to black
and let's make a very simple animation
just for an example to show you how the
key key framing works so yeah let's just
put an arrow oh wait
started real stubby like that
oh wait let's put it on ya I don't know
what I'm doing okay so let's put an
arrow down here let's turn it just go to
scale and use the skew effect there you
can hold down shift to make it snap to
certain angles or you can free free spin
free skew it alright so that's frame 1
so this is what it looked like on frame
1 now on frame to you might say how do
you make frame to now you go into states
here and if states isn't available here
you go up to window states and then you
can refer to this state one you can
think of that as frame one so you're
making frame by frame animations here
and this is set to a delay speed of 15
let's set it's like 12 that's good now
if you want to duplicate this state
let's say if we went down here to
duplicate it's not going to retain the
graphics when it makes the new state
watch state to there's no graphic see so
let's get rid of that one now the way to
do it to retain the graphics is
right-click the present though the state
that you want to duplicate duplicate
state right there you select how many I
just want one
I show you now let's go ahead and do do
them all I want to be five this will
make five more states after the current
state okay boom there they are now all
you gotta do is edit your images that
would be on this States or if you wanted
to go state by state to go you know
build your animation up let's go ahead
and remove these and you would just go
duplicate state okay manipulate it here
like that duplicate state make another
one a third frame and you're going to
manipulate your object here make that a
little bigger too then duplicate state
ok you win right there let's make this a
little wider there we go now in the last
state you can just put something like to
placate state ok and put some text on
the fifth one to say download
oops and on these keyframe animations
you know i'm not using images or
anything but there's no reason why you
just can't see what i'm doing here and
swap muse emerges in these keyframes
same thing so let's press play and see
what we've got there there's your
animated banner animation you can use
images and yours tween them in use the
Alpha so you can go to alpha settings so
you can bring this thing fade it in over
a couple of frames what kind of neat
stuff now let's show you how to export
it for the web export wizard let me show
you file export wizard it says select an
export format press ok continue animated
gif is what we want continue and let's
test it out here perfect ok so we go to
export put it on the distal save it as
download and name a shown save
and that's it close that out we're done
now we go to this download animation
open it up there's you put that on the
web on your website it's just an
animated gif just like you'd put any
other picture in your website okay hope
that was helpful for any some of you
beginners and some of you veteran
fireworks users are laughing at me right
now but that's okay this is for the
beginners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
