demonstrate how to utilize the radio
button components from the components
library here to program forms and
quizzes and tests and whatever you need
and your submit question or submit
answer button will show and we have
conditionals set and show you how to
program conditionals to show whether the
answer is true or not so if they press
flash which is a correct answer it says
flash is correct well done and if the
others will say that selection is
incorrect and we show you how to access
the value of what the user chose that
way you can send it to database or
yourself an email whatever you have to
use it for when you're gathering
information and this source file will be
available free develop PHP calm in the
flash tab let's click create new flash
file ActionScript 3 because we're
working with a s3 here I'm gonna adjust
my sized properties of my file to 5 50
wide and 300 high that's as large as I
need it for this demo I'm gonna grab out
text tool and type in a static text
field it's gonna be my question for my
little quiz for my forum question and
then I'm gonna go into the components
library and grab out the radio button
component and also a button component
on the button the parameters I'm going
to change that label to submit
or submit answer
okay let's bring that down a little
because we want four choices so now
we're gonna grab this radio button press
control-c control-v to copy and paste in
place drag it down just a little and you
get them sort of close together
that looks good grab both of those
control C control shift V and slide
those down into place using your arrow
keys to make sure that it's even with
the others there we go
and now what we're gonna do is give
these instance names are b14 radio
button one RB to four radio button two
are v3 radio button three and RB for
representing radio button for the submit
button is going to get an instance name
of submit underscore BTN put it right
about there
now we need a textfield it's gonna be
dynamic text because this is gonna show
the person the status of their answer
whether it's correct or not and in this
field we'll show you how to access the
property or the item selection that they
chose if you were using this in a forum
type situation so you can send it to
yourself in an email or send it to a
database or whatever you're doing with
it you can access that the value of what
they chose okay so let's name this
status underscore txt let's rename this
layer stage elements now we have
instance names for all of the items
we're going to be talking to in the code
or be communicating with in the code and
we can now code this out that has
instance name and these all have a
different instance name all right now
let's create a new layer call it a s3
for ActionScript 3 and let's do some
code
ok let's highlight our ActionScript 3
layer there that keyframe press f9 to
open our actions panel where we're going
to type in the code first thing we're
gonna do is import the necessary
controls for the radio grouping the
radio button grouping that controls
radio button group
okay now we're gonna claim a variable
that's going to be this radio button
group object and name so we'll go radio
let's see let's just name it radio Group
1 radio group 1 : radio group radio
button group equals new radio button
group
and put the name this radio button group
right here which is going to be question
1
all right
now we have the radio button group all
set up so let's place labels on those
radio buttons here so each radio button
we don't want it to say label we want to
give it the actual label of that choice
so let's say our v1 dot label is equal
to let's make the first one after
effects adobe after effects just copy
that line make one two three more this
one is our B - this one is our B 3 is
the instance name so we gave our radio
button to remember and this label for
number 2 is going to be Dreamweaver
the label for three is going to be flash
which is the correct answer for this
question and the last one will say
fireworks now now that they all have
labels let's see what happens if we
press ctrl + Enter see there's my
question and now these all have the
correct labels okay now we can type in
for that submit button submit underscore
begin
dot add eventlistener this is going to
be but when the user clicks that submit
answer button event dot click and the
function we want to fire off will name
submit click close that up now we'll
type in that function function submit
click
submit click
is event : and mouse event void open
curly-brace and close the curly brace
and there's our submit click function
nest all set up nice now what we're
going to do is have a couple of and else
condition statements to check to see
their answer is if to check sorry to
check and see whether their answer is
correct or not
okay so within our if and else
conditions we're gonna be looking for
these this radio group ones selected
items label so in order to get to the
labels and have these radio group
buttons be part of this radio group one
we have to assign that in the code so or
you can do it in the parameters of the
the radio group buttons themselves but
we're just going to show you how to do
it through code our v1 dot group is
equal to radio group one and you do that
for all four buttons so we can just take
that one two three
all of them are radio group 1 so our v2
is in radio group one our v3 is in radio
group one and radio group button for or
a radio button for is in radio group one
so that's how you group them all
together into one group and you can have
many on the page at one time and now
let's put in that if condition if that's
where the condition will be open the
curly brace close curly brace else open
curly brace close close curly brace now
we have a nice nested if and else
condition statement ready to go now
let's put the condition in the condition
is going to be if a radio group one
if radio group one dot selection that
label is equal to flash which is the
correct answer then we're going to put
something in the status text field and
that something is going to be equal to
it's going to be equal to this the label
so you just say radio group one that
selection that label which would be
flash in this condition plus I'm just
going to add to this line and say space
is correct so the output of that say
well done
so the output of this would be flash is
correct well done and the reason why it
would say flash is correct well done
because you hear you're printing out the
accessing the value of what they chose
you're printing it to that line so now
we'll just say else because if it
doesn't equal flash that means their
answer is wrong so we say is incorrect
try again
that's it
hey I just needed to splice in this
little code edit here and what I did on
the submit click function inside of it
before we ran the normal if and else
condition to see if the question is
right or not
I put an if statement to see if the
radio group one selection equals no that
means in your little form if you want to
make it to we're not
none of these are selected by default
like we have here and if they click
Submit answer nothing happens now watch
if I didn't have that code let's edit
that out and now press control enter
you'll see if I press submit answer I
get a big fat error no object reference
cannot access the property so you have
to have that code in there if you wish
to make your radio button group not have
any selected by default
but if you wanted one selected by
default you just say right here are V
one that's selected equals true
and then you really wouldn't need this
because we wouldn't get any errors there
because one would be selecting watch see
After Effects is select its selected
already we click Submit answer so you
see how that all works I felt I should
explain that but we want to make ours
with none selected by default so we're
gonna use this little if statement there
