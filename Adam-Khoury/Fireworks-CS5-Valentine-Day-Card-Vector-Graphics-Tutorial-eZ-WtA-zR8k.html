with another fireworks valentine's day
vector greeting card production workflow
tutorial let's not waste any time and
it's get right to it this is the
finished product of what you'll be
learning how to create within this
lesson ok so the first thing I'll do is
create a new document and set it to be
the dimensions that I want now if you
want this for print design you might
want to set your resolution a bit higher
than 72 let's make this for 50 you can
make yours any size you need it I have
this blue satin jpg on my desktop and
you can go and look for stock images
online or just search in for satin and
look for large satin type textures you
grab any color you want and i'll show
you how to make it red that way you
don't have to take the time to really
try to make your own satiny texture
which can be done in fireworks pretty
easily but it takes some time and
artistry to get it down and i really
don't feel like taking the time to show
something like that so we'll do it the
easy way let's go ahead and import that
blue satin jpg put it into place and you
can see that it doesn't fit in exactly
so i can just stretch it and move it
around if i want and it really won't
mess up the imagery unless I was
stretching it bigger then it would mess
up the resolution of the imagery so you
want to find a nice big one and
manipulate it to be the size that you
want let's make sure this is 800 x 450
so now highlight it and remember it
doesn't matter if it's a gray satin
purple whatever color that you find you
can change to red so I'll show you right
now you go to adjust color hue and
saturation and make sure you select
color eyes and then once it's colorized
you bring your saturation up and you'll
see that it's very simple to change that
satin to be any type color satin that
you want so if i wanted it purple for
instance or if i want it deep red and
what I want is this deep red so I'll
press ok ok let's grab our pen tool and
I'm going to make a shape from about
here click down let go to about here
click down and hold and then drag you
can make this any kind of contour you
want right about there looks good to me
then I'm going to click down let go go
down a little bit
here click down let go and then come to
about right there click down and hold
and then contour to kind of match that
one up top the contour is not perfect
don't even worry about it because you
can change it afterwards click down
right here to make a sharp corner point
then click down right there to make a
sharp corner point now remember when I
was saying you can manipulate these
contours you can just hit the sub
selection tool you can see this one
needs to go up a little bit there that
looks okay for now now I'm going to draw
another shape behind that one by
following the same contour I click here
once let go come over here click down
let go make the same contour that your
existing shape has click down here make
a sharp corner point go up around and
just make sure you cover that whole top
now what you're going to do with that
one is give it a gradient of satin and
we'll change the color on that satin
gradient to a gold color and actually we
can go in our color palette right now
and let's define a gold color and we'll
save it to our palette by hitting okay
actually I didn't save it to my palette
let me go back in hit add to custom
colors that way that gold is always
right there for you you won't ever have
to define it again it ok and we're just
going to make this one a little bit
darker gold
okay and this one we're going to lighten
it up
ok so now it kind of looks like it's a
shiny metal up there a little bit in
this one you want to change to that gold
color as well ok so if I was to give it
a bevel let's see let's give it an inner
shadow in a shadow and let's also give
it another inner shadow make sure this
one come from the bottom direction then
you can manipulate how deep that shadow
runs into the shape by selecting this
little slider and I'm going to make it
only blur or fade one that looks good
right there now the one on the top the
inner shadow on the top I'm going to
turn that white I'm going to bring it
down to about I don't know three bring
this down 2-1 bring this up to a hundred
percent now if I drag this down a little
bit you'll be able to see the effects
that I just put on there and actually
we'll just bring it to front control
shift up arrow key and that will place
it on top of that other shape I'm going
to grab this and this together by
holding shift as I select them and I can
move it up or down to cover as much
space as I want within my scene I want
it just a little bit at the top over
here left so I'll leave it just like
that now what I'll do with this is add
one more effect of drop shadow and that
one you can make it stretch out as far
as it needs to DC drop shadow maybe four
okay that's fine just so it has a little
bit of lift and it doesn't look like
it's laying down on the Saturn I'm just
going to try something out and see if it
looks ok if it does I'll go with it so
I'm going to highlight both of these
shapes on top and press ctrl-c ctrl-v
I'm going to flip them horizontally and
then flip them vertically and I'm going
to drag them into place where I want
them right about there looks good and I
don't want this one so high is the other
one and I might even just to offset it
and don't worry if you see you're a
gradient go all wacky like that don't
even sweat it you can manipulate that
bring it back to what it needs to be see
right about there now this you want to
make sure your inner shadow that was
this one should be black
black and then the one on top
should be white just so we're respecting
the light sources correctly this one on
the bottom I don't want it to be so dark
that's better and the drop shadow maybe
I'll lessen its effect
oh yeah that looks great this one will
probably even look better with a lesson
defect that's fine actually this bevel
this inner shadow on the bottom I don't
want that to go so far in all right
that's exactly what I won't now let's go
into the auto shapes then let's grab out
a heart we're going to manipulate the
vertex arc and the vertex and actually
we might manipulate a whole bunch of
that stuff let's bring this down bring
the clip up and then the breath in a
little bit you can shape your heart any
way you like now let's move this up make
it a little stubby guy let's bring the
clip in a little bit ok now you can size
that to be any size you want while
you're working on it and it's probably
best to make it big while you're
designing the first will highlight that
shape will go to gradient and we'll give
it a linear gradient now on top we want
it to be a nice bright red and on the
bottom we want it to be a dark red even
a little bit darker than that something
like that nice deep red then we're going
to put a little elliptical shape in the
center to make it kind of jewel-like
will make sure that's solid bright red
and then what we can do to that is go
and blur it out give it a Gaussian blur
and whatever you think is right that
looks good to me I'm going to bring down
its opacity a little bit I'm going to
take that shape and copy it ctrl-c
ctrl-v now behind it I should have
another one that's just like it if i
move the one on top this one i'm going
to give it an edge of this gold color
bring the edge up to I don't know maybe
10 and then we'll just make sure that
this one fits nice and snug inside of
that other one which it does and the
outside one you can give it no Phil none
so it's just a border now you want to
grab that one if you have any troubles
grabbing that one you can really just
move this one out of the way while you
work on this one and this one we want to
give a beveled effect bevel inner bevel
and make sure that it's fade is all the
way up the bevel height is all the way
up and the opacity is all the way up and
you can change the angle I'm going to
make my angle go directly 90 degrees
from the
so now let's grab this one and this
thing by holding shift as we grab them
and put it back into place and you can
make this golden border as deep as you
need it to be so if you wanted to go 14
you'll get a little bit thicker you see
let's go 15 with it now let's highlight
the red Grady ated heart on top let's
press ctrl-c ctrl-v and let's make this
one linear white let's go to white
believe the bottom color of the linear
dark red like that and we'll just bring
the opacity all the way down now what
we're going to do is grab the pen tool
and make a little curve the shape so you
can go right about here so right about
there and click down here click down
here click down here and you can get rid
of this border or put it at one so you
really see what's going on I'll
highlight both of these shapes the new
white Grady ated heart we put on top and
this one you go to modify combine paths
and punch so that'll punch that Grady
eight at heart on top then you can just
manipulate the gradient to where you
have kind of glossy effect that you want
now we're going to grab this one which
is the red Grady ated heart let's give
it one more filter of inner glow let's
make that glow blurt out a little bit
more this will help it make it look a
little more jewel like let's bring it in
a little more actually stead of four
let's go about nine that's good right
there I'm gonna make this guy a little
bit bigger and that looks just dandy now
I'm going to draw one of those little
sparkly stars on it by drawing out a
star shape manipulate its points to be
as many points as you like and then
you're going to drag in the radius to
make it a little sharp little star then
give it a gradient of radial you want it
to be white on both sides of this
gradient and this one you want opacity
none then you just move that you put it
into place where you want it shrink it
down make it the size that you want it
to be you can put it there and if you
want to little shines on top you put
another one right there now let me mess
with this gradient just a little bit
right about chap and you can also bring
down the opacity on that so it's less of
effect if you want or you can choose to
move that gradient around to manipulate
the effect okay
happy with that you guys can play around
and give it a whole bunch of glossy
effects you can see some of my older
videos that show how to gloss things out
real nice play with that to get it as
glossy as you want but what I'll do at
this point is highlight that star by
holding shift i'm going to highlight all
these things together as i click them so
you should wind up with let's see the
border is 123456 shapes in your
selection or you can just go like this
and highlight everything and deselect
things you don't want like those three
items and then press ctrl G to group
this now I'm going to press ctrl-c
ctrl-v make a copy of that imma take the
original that I can still ungroup and
manipulate and move it over off to the
side outside of my canvas and this one
I'm going to modify flatten so the first
one maybe i'll make that size now i want
it to kind of hang from the top so what
i'm going to do is draw a rectangle from
here to there now with this thing i'm
going to attempt to give it a gradient
of satin and you can see what that does
it kind of makes like a kind of like a
flowy wavy line there especially if you
have this one side that is zero opacity
now this one that's white I'm going to
change to this gold color so that way it
kind of looks like a gold flowy thing
thing and you can even manipulate that
effect so it looks really abstract now
what we'll do is highlight this and
bring it to the front and then this is
well highlight both of these by holding
shift and ctrl shift up arrow key and it
will kind of look like that thing is
hanging in the back by a gold chain or
gold lacy ribbon or something like that
I'll highlight both of these together
press ctrl-c ctrl-v so it makes a copy
and actually what i could do is modify
flatten these that way they don't warp
out as i shrink them put that one there
put it about right there let's make
another one see ctrl-c ctrl-v make sure
this one gets shrunk in just a little
bit and maybe we'll put you know three
or four of them up there ctrl-c ctrl-v
shrink this one a little bit too
should be enough and you can configure
those really to be anywhere you want
them let's grab the text tool and you
can type in I love you baby or whatever
your message is going to be to your baby
let's make these all capital bring it up
on the sides a little bit and I'm going
to change it to script Tina because
scripting is one of my favorite fonts
for creating things like holiday cards
and things that really need a nice
scripted text all right so i'll change
that to white bring up the size a little
bit not so much that works right there
for me and i'll give that a drop shadow
effect maybe to bring this down 2-1 and
this all the way up to make this 3 and
see what happens there that's good now
on top i want to write in the word to
colon you can change the color of that
to be maybe like a dark brown so it
blends real nice up there and then you
just put the name of your baby you just
copy that bring it down here change this
to from that's even if you want to you
know sign it or whatever to kayla from
adam and let's make this one a little
bit bigger there we go you can also put
some effects on that text too if you
like not right a little more texts to
page just to say happy Valentine's Day
shrink that down so it's not so big so
it says happy valentine's day i love you
baby to kayla from adam and then you
have all your effects in there or
whatever is nice juicy graphics and you
can also make little chocolates and
fireworks if you use the right gradients
and a nice brown nice light brown you
can make a nice effective looking
chocolate heart shaped whatever shape
you want you can also put some roses in
here actually it might leavin look
better if we make this a little bit pink
instead of full white just real light
pink it might blend better okay so
that's pretty much it that's as far as
i'll take mine and you can get as
creative as you want with yours</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
