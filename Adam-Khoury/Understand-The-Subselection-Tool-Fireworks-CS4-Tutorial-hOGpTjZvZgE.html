taking a deep look at the sub selection
tool so everyone understands how it
works and what it can be used for so the
first thing we'll do is drag out a stock
shape the star and you just hold down on
that button to see what old shapes you
can grab and I'm also going to use the
pen tool to make a custom wavy line
and we'll import jpg image
ok
make that a little small
alright so now when you click the item
on stage and then you hit the sub
selection tool and then you click it
again you'll see you have kind of a
different view of the item you can see
its anchor points and you can select
each anchor point any ones you want see
see how they highlight blue if I wanted
to select two I just hold down shift or
three or four or five so now I can move
these with my my keyboard arrow keys or
I can just drag them you see there if I
wanted to deselect one of them I hold
shift again and hit that one and now
just those four see what's going on
there okay now on a shape like this that
you use the pen tool where it has custom
arcs if you happen to select one of the
anchor points that has the ability to
customize the arc you can then grab the
bars and customize the arc that you made
earlier with your pen tool thing
so that's how that works and so say you
had a JPEG and you wanted to make the
corner you want it to warp it out you
can't use the sub selection tool for
that because it just doesn't give you
the anchor points doesn't recognize them
but what you can do is go to distort
tool and then drag those points to
wherever you need them see bring it in
like that I mean this one down like that
and there you go so I just wanted to
throw that example in there because
maybe sometimes you want to distort an
image or the anchor points on an image
but you can't seem to okie dokie we'll
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
