cs4 tutorial we're going to show you how
Dreamweaver cs4 you can connect to your
site connect to your ftp site and
dreamweaver if you haven't done that yet
so we'll click on site new site i'm just
going to set up flash building website
Dreamweaver cs4 let me call it FB
Dreamweaver cs4 DW cs4 so it's flash
building Dreamweaver cs4 WWE that flash
building com next
yes I want to use server technology and
the one I want is PHP select any type
you want to work with but in these
tutorials on using PHP and mysql and how
do you want to work with your files
during development I want to edit
locally than upload remote to remote
testing server that's what I want and
let's see my documents I already have a
folder setup where I want this my five
sides there it is so you can have a
pre-existing folder just created on your
system and then go and refer to that
when they asked you here to choose the
lucu lucu choose the local root folder
for your site I would just go ahead and
make a folder and then refer to it when
they ask you press select then you press
next how do you want to connect ftp okay
so there are 1 2 3 4 5 well there's four
input fields here and each one of these
four input fields the information that
you need for this test connection to
properly to happen successfully those
four pieces of data if you don't have
them sitting in front of you then you
can get them from your host company the
customer service set your hosting
company can supply you with all of this
data you just tell them what you're
doing how you're in Dreamweaver setting
up your site and they'll know if they
don't they're not competent and so I'm
going to place my data in and I'm going
to test my connection
okay so if you're working in the root
directory the line that ask what folder
on the test server testing server do you
want to store your files in you can
leave that blank because mine tested
successfully see you want to get this as
output when you test connection there
dreamweaver connected to your web server
successfully and so you just need your
ftp login name your ftp password if
you're using the root folder in the root
directory of the website you can just
leave what folder on testing server do
you want to store your files in blank
you can leave that line blank and
usually just your WWE whatever com is
the hostname or FTP address so there you
go so after you have a successful
successful test connection then you
press next dreamweaver communicates with
your testing server using HTTP just like
a browser so it needs to know the URL of
your site's root folder flash building
com that is the one let's test it out
the URL prefix test was successful now
if you don't have an index page on your
server yet you might not get a
successful output message there when you
test the URL if you happen to not get
success when you test URL make an
index.html file in wordpad or notepad
and ftp it any way you can to your
server root directory then when you test
URL you'll get a success message press
next
and you want to enable checking in and
checking out to ensure that your
co-workers cannot edit the same file the
same time no I don't want that because
I'm working alone next ok so it's
showing us our settings and the summary
so everything went through good and
press done and you'll see here you'll
have your root directory right there
this is the root directory of the site
on your local machine see that folder i
made FB underscore or DW so if you want
to see the other view on the server you
just hit Remote View and it will gather
all the data there see that and then
let's go back to local view so what you
can do is once you're at remote view you
can take your index file highlight it
bring it over get files hit that green
arrow get dependent files you can change
this preference in sight category of the
site management remember let's say no
for now let's just show you an example
of bringing that over that way we can
prove that we're connected online and
we're FD peeing straight through
dreamweaver like we should be in in
order to use the PHP and MySQL built-in
data objects that Dreamweaver has to
offer us okay so let's show it where is
that folder director fbd and this should
be there's an index file and it put a
notes folder in there for us
so there you have it this folder was
empty member to go see look I can delete
this yes go on the server grab the index
page get files and then in that folder
bada-bing bada-boom this time it brought
the dependent files with it because I
didn't select it not to you see there's
my CSS and stuff and still bringing them
all in so you can just download the
whole directory if you want that's it
you add any files in there but index
page but yours will be empty this for 10
mine is empty too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
