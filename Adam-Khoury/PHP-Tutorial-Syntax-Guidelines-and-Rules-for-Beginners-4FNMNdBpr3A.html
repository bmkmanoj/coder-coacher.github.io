guidelines of PHP
first let's discuss code commenting code
comments are usually used to remind
yourself and others about what a script
is doing and where it is doing it
sometimes you'll see people putting
copyright information in scripts using
code comments so to create a single line
code comment we can use the pound sign
or double forward slashes to make a
multi-line comment in PHP we use forward
slash star and then you can put a couple
of spaces and then another star and
forward slash and that closes that
multi-line comment so that allows me to
move this down and put as many lines of
comments as I would like in here so
that's what multi-line comments look
like now we'll discuss the rules of our
variable naming in PHP standard
variables always begin with a dollar
sign and has a good rule of thumb you
use only alphanumeric characters and
underscores so you can make it variable
for instance named name one and then we
can make that equal to a value of Adam
now what you're not allowed to do is use
a number as the first character in your
variable name so if I put a six there
you'll see I get a syntax error because
that's not allowed you cannot use a
number to start your variable names or
your function names so if I name this
var one that's a good way to also
describe it to myself you would want to
make your variables have a name that
describes what its purpose is or what
kind of information it holds and so this
is the sequence that you really only
want to use within your variable names
alphanumeric characters a through Z and
0 through 9 and underscores now
sometimes you might see a variable for
instance that looks like this it'll have
two dollar signs on the front let's say
that variable name was X in that case
this variable that you see here is being
dynamically named using this string by
changes to Cori and then I echo Adam so
you see I'm echoing a variable that
hasn't even been created here in the
variable side but you can see that this
variable is going to hold a string of
Adam and then we can put that variable
right on the front of another dollar
sign too
this variable therefore named Adam
dynamically it will echo out Cory so
sometimes you might come across the
script where you see two dollar signs
stacked right upon each other like that
okay now let's talk about this semicolon
that you see trailing almost every line
of code the semicolon terminates lines
and statements so for instance if I was
to remove this semicolon you'd see I get
a syntax error because I have a whole
nother line of code in place and this
one has not been terminated yet so I
have to have that semicolon in place to
let PHP know that I intend to stop that
line right there and there's no more
processing for that particular line but
if I remove the last one and it's the
last line of code within the script I'll
have no problems at all but you just
want to keep your semicolons there for
all of your lines that you intend to
terminate now you could also do
something like this to where the
semicolon is down here or even way down
here but just as long as there's nothing
in between it what will happen is PHP
will keep processing until it hits a
semicolon and that way it knows to stop
processing that line or that certain bit
of logic and then go on to the next line
and begin processing PHP is also case
sensitive
meaning that if this variable was named
bar and this one had a capital v in its
name they would be two separate
variables or two separate string objects
now let's talk about string
concatenation and joining string data
and if you're used to working in
JavaScript you'd know that's done with
the plus symbol in PHP it's done with
the period so let's put an echo
statement in place to output some
content to the browser and strings
always go in between quote marks and you
can use double quotes or single quotes
if I want to use single quotes here
that's just fine or double quotes works
also so I'll type in the user name is
space and then outside of my double
quotes I'm going to put a period and
then I'm going to take this first name
variable and I'm going to put it next to
that period and that will append the
value of Adam to that string or
concatenate and then if I want to
continue I just put another period
and then continued my string comma the
surname is space and then I can just put
in the other variable last name so the
output of that will be the user name is
Adam the surname I feel it'll make more
sense if you put the first name is Adam
the surname is Corey and it also works
that way with the period if you want to
compound variables for instance if I
start a variable called list and I make
that equal to a value of say for
instance HTML and then I put a break tag
in there to make a new line what I can
do is take that variable and write under
it all I have to do is put dot equals
and that will compound or append to that
same variable and I can put CSS right
here and you can continue on and as long
as you have a dot before the equal sign
this list variable will contain all of
these things that way when you echo the
list variable the user will see a big
list of items or a whole bunch of data
that you wanted to compound and append
into the original list variable now
let's talk about escaping characters
with the backslash and in most instances
when working with strings and variables
especially you would use backslash to
escape the quote marks that you want to
display in the string when they are
encapsulated by the same kind of quote
mark so let me show you what I mean
let's make this variable name string 1
and this variable name string 2 so you
can see my string is encapsulated in
double quotes here now I'll type in a
sentence josè kitchen but let's say I
want to have the apostrophe here of the
quote mark a single quote where it
belongs that will work just fine because
I have this encapsulated in double
quotes but what if I was to take that
same sentence and put it in string
variable 2 and encapsulate that string
using single quotes you'll see what
happens is I get a broken string because
where my single quote happens again in
the string is where it's going to end
that string so if I want that string to
continue on nicely without any syntax
problems
I will put a backslash in front of that
single quote and it will output exactly
like this drain above the same goes for
double quotes for instance if I want to
put double quotes around the word
kitchen like this you can see I just
broke my string so what I have to do
since my string is encapsulated by
double quotes is I have to escape any
double quotes that I want to display in
the string so I'll put escape there and
a backslash there as well and then I
have no syntax problems now PHP also
ignores whitespace so any whitespace
that happens to be within your PHP tag
the PHP processing engine will ignore
that whitespace meaning if I have a
setup just like this it will run just as
fast as if I have a setup like this so
you can see that I can just tack things
all end-to-end there and my script will
run exactly the same as it would have
before the only difference now is that I
have a smaller file size this is called
minified code and actually it would be
more properly minified if I do this
that's as minified as that code can get
and it will have a smaller bite size
then the code would have if you had it
all spread out on the page with new
lines and whitespace everywhere and you
might even run across people having this
debate on line and you can just tell
them it won't make your PHP run any
faster what it does is it serves up a
smaller file size and this is why you
see a lot of JavaScript programs being
minified it's not so much that
everything processes faster it's just
that you're serving up much smaller file
sizes especially when you get a lot of
code in your scripts when you take out
all the white space in the new lines it
has a much smaller file size there's no
debating that argument but as far as the
processing speed is concerned this
should run just as fast as this and then
you can put your whitespace back in here
and especially if you're trying to teach
code or demonstrate or show your code to
someone that you want to have them read
and understand you would want to have
new lines and some white space in there
because it's easier on the eyes
okay the last little topic we'll discuss
about the PHP syntax rules and
guidelines is the reserved words in PHP
and I'll have all of these lists that
you see here directly under the video
where it displays on my site and I'll
give you guys links to that page it'll
have all the code examples too now you
should not use the following PHP
language constructs as your function
names constant names class names or your
method names because these reserved
words perform special operations built
into PHP or they have special
significant values just by default so
you don't want to create any unnecessary
conflicts so it's good to study these
lists and I have it all packed into one
page here so you can get to it all in
one spot and it works the same way in
JavaScript and any other popular
programming language they're going to
have reserved words and keywords that
you should avoid using in your function
names and such okay so hopefully that
helps you avoid some issues and helps
you understand some of the characters
that you see in place within PHP scripts
and what their purpose is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
