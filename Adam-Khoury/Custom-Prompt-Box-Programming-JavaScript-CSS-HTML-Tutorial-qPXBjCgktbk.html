stock dialog component called a prompt
box which we are going to engineer
ourselves to obtain complete
customization and control over the
dialogue windows within our custom
software the default prompt dialog box
in JavaScript provides a single text
field to the user so they can give you
some value in order for your program to
continue but your custom prompt box can
intake much more than that if you
require it to so since this is the third
and final part of a three-part series
individuals who want to gain full
understanding of the code that we're
going to begin with in this tutorial
could watch the two previous exercises
where we initially created custom alert
and confirmed boxes because we're just
going to extend that code to include
prompt boxes so we're starting with the
same exact code that we left off with
when we completed the previous lesson
for creating custom confirmed boxes but
we're going to be removing all this HTML
anyway we're going to make sure that we
leave our dialog box and dialogue
overlay in place on the page and we're
still including our dialogue dot CSS and
dialogue KS dialog KS already has the
custom alert and custom confirm
components inside of it so what I'm
going to do is minimize all of the
existing code in that javascript file
and on the next line down I'll pop in
the custom prompt object and this is
what renders our custom prompt window
I'm going to explain this code in depth
in just a second once you get that into
your dialog KS script it be ready to use
in any of your HTML files that are
including this dialog KS so you can use
the alerts the confirms and the prompts
now what I'm going to do in my HTML I'm
going to pop in an h1 element that's
just a status element just for this
simple example and really what I'm doing
what I'm doing to alter the page isn't
really important okay now I have a
button whose on-click event is going to
call the prompt objects dot render
method just like we call the render
method for the alert and the
firm boxes in the previous tutorial and
this is going to get two parameters the
first parameter is the dialog that you
want to show in the window to the user
and the second parameter is the name of
the function that you want to execute
once the user supplies the value into
the prompt window and clicks okay so
naturally my program would require a
function so let's put it in a script
element make sure we close that script
element we're going to place the
function change text and it's going to
intake one value argument so it'll have
one incoming argument which is the value
from the text field in the prompt window
now let's run this example dot HTML and
make sure our custom prompt object works
and then I'll explain to you the custom
prompt object here so let's run this
example dot HTML in our favorite browser
click change text and we see a prompt
window pop-up that says a value is
required type some text so I can type in
hello world okay and you can see that
the inner HTML for the h1 element on the
page changed to hello world now what I'm
doing on the page is not important
the real meat of this tutorial is to
show how to pass some value that's taken
in through this text field to a custom
function that you have on the page so
that's what we've done we have a custom
function on the page that is not going
to run this change text function isn't
going to run until the user type some
text into that field and presses ok so
it's important to keep that in mind to
change text or whatever custom function
that you want to fire off it doesn't run
until the user give some value in the
prompt window and presses ok and the
field value for that little text field
the value is coming through in this
argument now let's quickly discuss the
dialogue AAS you can see that our render
method is just like it was for the alert
and the confirm boxes but this time
we're putting different things in the
inner HTML so when prompt Ender is
called to run remember we're passing two
arguments those two arguments are being
school
dup right here as dialog and funk funk
is short for function name so we take
that dialogue variable coming in and we
put it here in the inner HTML for the
dialog box body then directly under that
in the dialogue box body inner HTML
we're going to append a text field you
can see I gave the text field an ID of
prompt value and then we simply supply
the two buttons that are needed which is
prompt okay and prompt cancel and in the
prompt
okay method you want to pass the
function name which is the function that
you want in your program that you want
to fire off in our case it's change text
whatever custom function in your program
that you want to fire off that's the
function name that you're going to pass
here and it's coming through this render
method dynamically so if the user
presses cancel all you have to do is
just remove the dialog window and do
nothing in your program but if the user
presses okay then you're going to pass
that function name through the OK method
here and what we're going to do is grab
the prompt value 1 from that text field
that's in the prompt window we can
easily do that by saying document dot
get element by ID prompt value 1 text
field dot value then we simply call the
custom function that we want to run
using this line and this might look a
little foreign to some of you guys but
basically you can run any function for
instance in my program here I have a
function called change text if I wanted
to run that statically instead of
dynamically here I can just put this in
quotes like that and this will run the
window change text function or really it
targets the change text object of the
window does that make sense because
that's all it's doing and it's passing
one a parameter or one argument through
that function which is the prompt value
one text field so we'll make that
dynamic again so whatever function name
is being passed when you're telling your
prompt to open up you see I'm passing
change text here that's the function
that's going to be initiated when the
user
types in some value in the prompt window
and presses okay and then after that
function is initiated we simply remove
the dialog window so it works pretty
much just like the alert and confirm but
this time we're using a more dynamic
approach to run the function the desired
function once the prompt is submitted
and if you want to understand more about
how I'm targeting this function named
dynamically and running the function and
passing an argument through it in this
form and looking sort of way you can go
to this URL at web intersect com I've
started writing articles again a web
intersect this article I wrote recently
I think I wrote it just last week it was
about dot notation versus brackets in
JavaScript and it'll show you all about
how you can target any object or
function or variable or whatever you
want in your program by using bracket
notation which allows you the this
article basically talks about how using
bracket notation instead of dot notation
in JavaScript allows you to use strings
dynamic strings as the property or
function names for objects in your in
your software so if you really want to
understand this line or if this line
looks confusing at all you can read this
article and it'll explain why we're
using that kind of code it just gives us
the way to call that function to run and
pass an argument to it dynamically
without knowing the function name before
our software is initiating the function
so if your software doesn't know the
function name before it's supposed to
initiate some function it can take it in
as a string dynamically the function
name can be a string coming in
dynamically that the program can then
make run now I've gone into dialog KS
and made sure that there's only the
custom objects and creating new
instances of those custom objects
there's no custom functions in here if
all the custom functions would be in
your main file so for the last tutorial
the confirm box the delete post function
would be here in your main file in
dialogue jsut really just want to store
the custom objects for the dialog
windows and creating new instances for
those and you don't even have to even
create the new instance here you can
take these lines out of here where
you're creating new
instances of those objects and put them
in your main file that way you're not
creating new instances of objects unless
your main file absolutely needs them so
what I did here is I put a new function
called do stuff and I put a new button
just to show you how the prompt box will
render dynamically for as many prompts
as you need to have on the page and in
do stuff I'm just going to take this
line here from change text and I'm going
to target the body so let's say document
body dot style dot background is going
to be equal to value and I change this
text down here to type a color name now
this prompt is going to run the do stuff
custom function here this prompt is
going to run the change text custom
function now let's see if that works
let's go to do stuff this should change
the color of the background so let's put
pink okay and it changed the background
of the webpage to pink now let's change
the text okay and now we have hello
world change text we can change the
background again to turquoise or any
color we want so that shows you the
prompt boxes running dynamically and
remember your custom functions don't
fire off until the user supplies the
prompt value all right so that's one
approach to creating your own custom
prompt boxes from scratch and they can
be made very dynamic the way we made
them and they can be externalized as
modules that you can just pop into
certain pages that are going to need
them if a certain page does not require
any dialogue windows then it shouldn't
include those javascript and CSS files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
