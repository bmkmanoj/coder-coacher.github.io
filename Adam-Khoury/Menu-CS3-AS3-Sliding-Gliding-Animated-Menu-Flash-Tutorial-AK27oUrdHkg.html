will demonstrate how you can create an
exposition speed menu and if you put
your mouse onto it you can see that as
you mouse goes over to the right it
slides where it needs to then as your
mouse moves over to the left it slides
back if you're hanging around in the
middle you can see that the speed action
it decreases the more you go to one side
the faster the menu will move and you
can put 20 to 50 it doesn't matter I
don't I don't think there'll be a limit
on how many you can put in there I only
have six in there but you can put a
whole bunch more and they can be sitting
right next to each other or whatever you
want just as long as you define the the
landing position and the starting
position in the code okay let's show you
the Fla and the code now we're animating
let's publish that again we're animating
this we're not using YZ or we're not
using tween either and this is
ActionScript 3 and we're just using math
and looping to to accomplish this
movement and so that's not tweeze
tweezer
that's not tween or is not ease okay
it's just math that's all it is the the
free Fla file if you want to just go get
the Fla file download it and take a look
at it it's available at develop PHP comm
and if you need the button code a whole
bunch of my other tutorials have to have
button code inside of them so it's up to
you to integrate the button code and the
less your spoon-fed the better off
you'll be so let's take a look at the
code now first in the first frame what
we're doing is we stop the timeline we
initially initialize a few variables or
a couple of variables here and then we
add an event listener and a function
that's listening for if the mouse if the
user's mouse goes over this menu this BG
the background clip if their mouse goes
over that then we start it up and the
way we start it up is send it to frame
two so we say go
- and play frame - and it's set to go to
and play frame - so it'll hit frame to
do the code there or execute the code
there and then hop hop right along over
to - frame three and I'm frame two
you'll see that there's we're removing
the event listener that we created that
we added on the first frame very simple
there and then once that code executes
them the event is removed the event
listener is removed then it jumps along
to frame three and frame three is if you
need any help with this code just go
into the forum that developed PHP and
ask for it to be explained if you
understand math and you understand if
and else conditionals then you should
have no problem understanding what I've
done here and the the movie clip where
where it resides and where it ends up
when the users mouth when we move it to
about ending right here that would be
this number here negative 330 so you got
to kind of play with it to see what I've
done but I'm not gonna reveal too much
to you if you need if you needed reveal
to you then come into the forum and ask
for help other than that I'm just gonna
pretty much understand that you
understand what I'm doing here because
it's just simple math and it's a simple
if and else statements and then right
here we go to and play loop after this
code executes in this in a split second
it keeps looping on itself and
everything here happens about 15 times
per second all this code happens about
15 times every second and it loops all
the way back to not all the way back but
it loops back to frame to our frame
label here is named loop so that's what
it does
every second about 15 times so here we
have the border graphics
here we have the menu movieclip itself
and here we have the background clip
which is this blue symbol it's a movie
clip and it has an instance name of BG
clip underscore MC and so that's pretty
much how it works and it's publish it
and take a look at it again
so yeah depending on where your mouse is
on the menu that determines the
exposition speed that the menu will move
at you can change the numbers in my math
and have it go at speeds where you need
it if it needed a little slower you need
a little faster you can just change the
the ten let's see right here you can
change this ten to be a different number
and you'll see different speeds or you
can change the frame rate I've got mine
set nice and healthy to thirty but you
can change yours to be whatever you want
and like I said this can this movie clip
can have twenty five fifty images in it
or buttons it doesn't matter you can
also put a mask on top of it here if you
didn't want it to go all the way to the
edge and it's a whole bunch of fun
things you can do with this but this
shows a good way without using a big
jumbled mess of code for easing and
tweening you can just use math the old
fashioned way the old-school way to
animate this thing and so we'll see you
next lesson like I said if you need any
help with the code just head on into the
forums at develop PHP calm and we'll get
you some assistance okay bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
