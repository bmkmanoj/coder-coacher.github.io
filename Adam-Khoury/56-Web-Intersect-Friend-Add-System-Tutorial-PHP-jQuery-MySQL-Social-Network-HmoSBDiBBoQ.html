cosmetics to show the friends list or
not so what we're going to do is make
sure that we only show a friend's
section or a friend's output display
section only if the member has some
friends in his array at least one first
most important thing to do is go into
profile that PHP and make sure you query
out the array I think it's right under
YouTube in the database that field
friend array what we'll do is if else
evaluation to see if it's empty or not
if they have brands then we will display
them okay so there's the friend array
being queried with the rest of the data
from the main query on the profile page
now we can do this anywhere we want so
I'm going to go just for now on top of
the doc type directly on top of the
doctype I'm going to put in new PHP
block okay we're going to start with
this logic assemble friends list and
links will initialize as empty a friend
list variable and that's where we're
going to echo out to the HTML part of
the page to show the friend list or not
and if they do have some friends we're
going to wrap it in those green and
white gives that we need to to put into
the layout so this if condition is
checking to see if in their friend array
if there's any friends or not so this
says if the friend array is not equal to
nothing that means it's equal to
something and they have friends at least
one so we're going to get the friend
array explode make it an actual array
that way we can execute PHP array
functions on easily so we wind up with a
variable called friend count which
counts however many items are in that
array that we exploded hear that friend
array is a string at this point then
when we explode it it becomes an array
we use the comma as a delimiter
exploded and that's what the array is
consists of all those friend IDs but
without the commas but it's an indexed
array now we can get easily get the
count from that so we're going to
display the friend count in the page
real quick first thing just for testing
okay so what i'm doing here is i'm
building a little output HTML output for
that variable called friend list and
it's a div class for the info header
which is going to make it this little
green block and in that green block
we're going to say first name which in
my case on my profile will be Adam Adams
friends and then I want the friend count
right here so i'm going to put a
variable a friend count to list right
there then this variable called friends
list or front list i can go down into
the HTML now and wherever I wanted to
right above this div that set ad space
wrote that i'm going to put friend list
echo out right there alright i'm an FTP
and see what I get as a result okie
dokie there it is Adams friends five now
if I go when I check my friends requests
I have some more in here let me accept
somebody's here let's accept now let's
refresh see how it says Adams friends
five if i refresh it should say six yes
now I have six friends now it's a simple
matter to make a white box using one of
the white divs and put six or eight
friends into it let's get the code going
for that and that's also going to be put
into this friend list output here where
we just set up this code okay we can use
the array constructor here you can see
this code outputs this to the page see
this is my first four friends in my list
their IDs and I'm just using the array
constructor here to access those indexes
so you see each array hasn't starts with
an index of zero so friend one
is friend or a constructor 0 but you
don't just want to go grabbing like that
because we don't actually know if
there's four friends what if there's
only two friends in this person's array
so I'm going to get rid of this and I
don't need to show their IDs here I'm
going to get their IDs using a different
method okay this line of code here is
going to slice our array we're using the
array slice function on this friend
array which could be an array that holds
200 friends but we want to make sure
this array for display purposes on the
profile anyway only holds as many as we
specify so we can take the full array
and slice it down to exactly as many
indexes as we want it to have and what's
cool about this is when you slice if the
friend array is less than this many it's
not affected so somebody who only has
one or two people in their array the
slice will not occur on their array and
the count will still be good so if
somebody has 18 friends their count is
going to be cut to four at this line of
code somebody has two friends their
array is not cut at all only if they
have more than four on the page where
we're going to display everybody's the
whole entire the whole entire list of
friends that one we're just going to
explode the array and then show
everybody through pagination but now I
can loop or iterate over this array
which I know will have no more than four
if i go to develop PHP i'll show you
where i'm going to get that code dealer
in PHP section down in the working with
a raise let's go into looping or
iterating over an array and here this is
where I'm going to do it now this is
what my array looks like delimited by
commas so its values delimited by common
so I could just use this for each loop
right there and it will act as a means
to
iterate over everybody in the array so I
can go and get their use their ID to go
get their picture make links and
everything I'm just going to grab this
for each loop we're going to put that in
the code right here there now I'll be
able to access everybody's ID and
instead of that same card array it's
going to say friend array right here
I'll just echo value I already know what
the keys are going to be I don't need to
access the keys say break value then
break let's see what that does okay you
see there it gave me my first four
friends okay so within my for each loop
this is the code i set up and i'm going
to change this i think for a table
layout it's going to evaluate whether
the index which is I here is divisible
by 2 or not that way i can break table
rows and have a little more of a better
structure with this code here inside of
my for each loop it gives me this layout
you can see I've cut my array down to
six now so I cut the array 26 I want six
people here I think I'm going to do a
table layout though that way I can more
effectively keep things in order and
maybe show the names under the picture
ok I think I'm going to take a break
right here and then head into the next
video which will be the last one what
we'll do in the last one is set up a
page where you can link to here which
will allow you to show more of a members
friends will make that page and we'll
also make it to where when I go to
somebody who's my friend already I'll go
to add as friend would say remove
and we're going to make this say remove
friend right now he's my friend already
so if I try and request him it says this
member is already your friend but
further than that we want this to say
remove front to give the remove friend
functionality when they click it it will
give them a whole new window that'll say
would you like to remove Alex as your
friend you click yes it's a new
JavaScript function that will handle the
the dirty work for us so that'll be the
last video for the friend system and
that'll pretty much complete it then
with people being your friends on the
site you have the doors wide open for
all kind of things you can do
programming wise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
