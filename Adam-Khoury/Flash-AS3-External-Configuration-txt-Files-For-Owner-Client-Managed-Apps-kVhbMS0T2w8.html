here and today's lesson is best summed
up by this little conversation going on
here and one guy says I don't have flash
to edit that cool file for my site and
you say you don't need flash because i'm
awesome i like program external
configurations into my flash files so
anybody with wordpad or notepad can edit
them so i'm going to go by feedback that
I get in the form of comments here on
YouTube so if you want to see more after
this lesson if you want to go into xml
and PHP and all of that stuff just say
in the comment yeah let's go into xml
and PHP or say no this is pretty lame
let's stop it here after this one and
move on to something cooler so please
give your feedback in the comment area
so I can know what to do next
okay here i am in flash cs3 but you can
be in cs4 and it works exactly the same
we use actionscript 3 files create new
and i'm going to pull out a rectangle
primitive draw it out to stage and i'm
going to get the size on it to be let's
make it 200 x 200 and it has even
coordinates there and i'm going to right
click it well let's first make it gray
there it's gray now i'm going to right
click it converts the symbol
registration top left is good movie clip
let's call it my BG that's the instance
name we're going to give it as well so
you press ok and in the instance name
area in the properties panel give an
instance name of my BG so this object is
now a movie clip of the instance name of
my BG now inside of it this is just
going to be a very simple demonstration
to show you how you can make things
selectable to give people options when
you're creating files may be just skin
things to make different skins
backgrounds words options everything so
what we'll do here is layer one right
above it let's create a new layer insert
new layer let's go ahead and rename this
shape
and this top one labels let's get one
more about that and just call it actions
right there you put a stop action so you
can highlight this keyframe press f9 or
go to window actions and you type in STO
p open close parenthesis semicolon
that's a stop action that way when we
put more frames in here this thing just
won't loop continuously it will stop on
frame 1 and then just go to key frames
that it needs to go to when instructed
okay now that we have all the layers set
in this first one let's go ahead and
highlight that keyframe go down to the
frame label and put in gray cuz that's
the color of the box there you see the
little flag let's extend that out 10
frames maybe press f5 you see the word
gray on that frame label on frame 10
let's make another keyframe by pressing
f6 go down to the label call this one
red extend out another key frame frame
20 f6 name this one blue now just go to
frame 30 and press f5 extend the frames
out don't make a new keyframe that's all
we're going to do for this demo now
let's go to we can extend these frames
out as well by pressing up five but you
don't really need to we'll leave that
one on just frame one let's stop action
only needs to be on frame one now the
shape let's make a new keyframe here on
red at six and then a new keyframe on
blue you can extend these out if you
want that's not necessary press f5 here
here where it says blue just go and
change it to blue so it will have a blue
background here you go and change it to
red but you can have all kind of
imported backgrounds from Photoshop
fireworks or illustrator that can be
really cool backgrounds skins for your
flash applications and let people choose
what color they want even if they don't
have flash from an easy configuration
file all right so that's pretty much set
up exactly how we need it now let's drag
out a dynamic text field let's put that
on stage give it an instance name of
owner name underscore txt I'm just going
to make it a little bit longer they're a
little wider I'm going to take the edge
off make it not selectable make it black
and 18 that's good single line perfect
put it in place and the owner's name is
going to show their from the external
configuration file now what we're going
to do with this thing is let them sighs
it and color may get the color of the
skin of it from the external
configuration file ok so now before we
put it in the view lines of code that's
going to call out to the external
configuration file let's go ahead and
create the external configuration file
so you can go to notepad you get a
regular text file going and we're going
to type in owner name equals
Adam put the ampersand the end symbol
and the next variable will be background
color
and ampersand again and then background
what was it sighs we want it to look
yeah let's let them do sighs its equal
to and I'll explain this in just a sec
of what we're doing here let's say 300
all right Oh background color needs to
be equal to let's make it blue it's in
our flash file they can go to the blue
and set it to blue if they like okay so
in this notepad file what we're going to
do is save this now both of these to the
same directory this flash file and
there's no pad file so they're in the
same folder now in this configuration
file what we have is a URL encoded
string it's sorry it's a URL variable
encoded string so that's how you send
URL variables into flash and I'm sending
owner name which has a value of Adam and
I'm sending background color which has a
value of blue and I'm sending background
size which has a value of 300 and so
people who don't have flash can just
open this in notepad change this to 500
they can change this to read or the gray
whatever options you want to give them
and they can change their owner name you
have many more things that they can
change can make the application a little
more powerful and easier for people to
visually see what they need to edit
using XML especially and
so that's that bottle let's save these
both now to the same directory file save
as let's just go to the desktop I'm
going to put it in a folder cold where
was it as3 txt config files right there
I'm going to name it config flash I
already have one in there i'm just going
to replace it there I'll close that it's
ready to go now all we have to do is
make flash call out to that and bring
those variables in which is very simple
ok so we have an instance name on our
little object there that we're going to
have them able to skin and size and you
can see ours is 200 x 200 all right so
let's add a new layer above that layer
you can rename this one stage elements
access the objects on stage and this one
as3 short for actionscript-3 highlight
that actionscript 3 layer lock it
highlight it press f9 and Booya that's
how easy it is now let me explain this
code real good to you now this is the
kind of stuff that advanced flashers use
to sell applications to people who don't
own flash know how to make their own
things in flash they can sell an
application with a configuration file so
anybody can use it and adjust it so in
the ActionScript let's talk about this
real good name the first line is setting
the URL loader object and a variable
name for that and inside of the URL
loader object we have a new URL request
and the in the URL request we're calling
out to config flash txt which is the
little text file we made notepad it's
living in the same directory if you
wanted it living in a different folder
you can have a folder called my files
/ config flash txt would be in that
folder you set it up like that but this
one is going to be in the same directory
the same folder as the flash file line
for is we add an event listener with the
complete event when this file is
completely red and brought into flash
this complete configuration function
will fire off will execute so the
function complete configuration fires
off and we have these five lines which
are setting up variables which are going
to allow us to access the values of the
things inside of that text file so the
first line is the URL loader for the
event target which is going to be all of
the data which is in that string in a
text file then we claim a variable for
the URL variables because I made a URL
encoded variable string with ampersands
that separate all the different
variables and their values so we claim
this variables value for that and or
this variables bar for that and then
these three are just setting the certain
strings we need and the number creating
variables to use when we adjust those
things on stage so these three lines
that's what those do and I'm going to
come out comment this code out a little
bit more before i post it and so yeah so
you have your variables and they're all
set at this point with these five lines
all the three variables that we want
from that file are set up right here and
ready to be printed or used in our code
okay yeah so these four lines apply
those variables to the things in your
file so what we do here in the first one
in the owner name that text field that's
on stage or the owner name underscore
txt a dynamic text field we put in the
owner name and then the background my BG
which is this item its width it's going
to be set to the BG size which is coming
in it's the background sighs right there
that's set to 300 I think in the config
file but ours is 200 you can you'll see
when I render the file how would it be
bigger than it is now the size will be
adjusted by what they pick in the config
file so my BG go to and stop BG color is
how we skin this thing so if we want to
give it let them pick the skin color you
saw how we created this inter timeline
for that it's going to shoot to that red
frame label I think they picked the
right no blue we put blue in the config
file so it's going to shoot right there
it's going to be a blue background let's
test it out so that's all the code fully
explained and if you have any hang-ups
about how this is doing what it's doing
just come to the forums that develop PHP
and ask a question and one of us try and
get you an answer ok so now let's go
ahead and just save this flash file to
that same folder will be in business and
we can test it file save as there it is
let's just overwrite that old one I was
playing with earlier press ctrl enter
you see put my name in made the box blue
300 by 300 wildly different from what we
have here that's because you're letting
somebody else externally configure it so
every time at runtime when it goes it'll
show what they want I'll show you a
demonstration let me go and open that
that text file ok here's that config
file let's go ahead and make this red
make this 100 change the name mr. doofus
control save or ctrl s or you can go to
file save and once it's saved you go
back in the flash you press control
enter look at that mr. doofus nice
little tiny box 100 where 100 and it's
red that's how it's done like I said if
you would like to see more all about
this kind of stuff so this file will be
available at develop PHP calm in the
flash tab here click flash adobe flash
right there at develop PHP and you go to
the section I'm going to have it in
maybe working with other external files
and data probably be in this one here
and you can download it mang okay like I
said you guys let me know if you want to
go further and see more examples of how
to get the XML and PHP config files
going for yourself and even more
dynamics if you want to go deeper and
deeper and deeper we'll get into mysql
rendering out config files okay have a
happy day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
