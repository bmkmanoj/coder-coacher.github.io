XML external XML lesson well showing you
how to create I'm going really in-depth
this time I had a similar tutorial that
didn't go as in-depth and I didn't
explain as much and I think a lot of
people can use a real clear in-depth
explanation on how this all works so we
show you how to bring in data from an
external XML file and display it in
flash have colored boxes and all the
things that you'd like it to have this
lesson comes courtesy of mr. flicks six
one of our forum members and his thread
reads hi there this is more of a
tutorial request I guess but it is
relevant of ActionScript 3 and XML
anyways could anyone make a tutorial on
the basics of XML and he talks about how
to read the flash help file a couple of
tutorials some books working with XML
ActionScript 3 is proving itself more
challenging every time so could anyone
make a tutorial of the basics of XML and
integrating it into the flash file into
a flash file or even just explain how to
do it here it'd be greatly appreciated
thanks for everything
and schenke gave him some good resources
I'm just gonna show a quick video
tutorial of the basics of XML from start
to finish and then you guys can dig
deeper into it
ok so the first thing we'll do is I'm
gonna open up Dreamweaver cs4 because I
really like it the highlighting syntax
in code help everything it's great so
I'm gonna go to create new under the
create new list XML and if you happen to
be working in notepad or WordPad very
basic text editor you can just create a
new document and name it whatever you
like I'm gonna name this one file save
as let's go to the desktop make a new
folder and let's name it
XML basics as3 ActionScript 3 XML Basics
in that folder I'm going to name it my
XML file my XML file and it already
knows it's going to be an XML extinction
and notepad or WordPad you might have to
put the extension in my XML file dot XML
to claim it as an XML so I save and you
see your Dreamweaver knows it's an XML
extension already ok so the first part
of the lesson I'll show you how to code
out from scratch your XML file and how
that all works and then in the second
half of the tutorial the same video
we'll be demonstrating how to bring this
data from the XML file into our flash
ActionScript 3 project and display those
items access all of them and understand
how to okey dokey here we go by default
Dreamweaver gives us the XML version and
encoding type tag automatically by
default so we'll just remove that in
case any of you guys happen to be coding
from scratch and let's explain
everything so let's open a tag and put
the question mark and this is claiming
the XML version it's going to equal 1.0
in between double quotes 1.0 and then
encoding type
equals there's several different
encoding types you can use and close
that off with the question mark and
we'll just use utf-8 which Dreamweaver
gives us by default as you noticed
earlier there's also other encoding
types you can use and you can research
the xml encoding types on your own if
you really want to know about it but
it's really not necessary to know about
it if this will function in our flash
application well enough if you really
want to dig into what the encoding types
do then you can on your own that would
be outside the scope of this lesson so
the first thing we'll do since that tag
is all closed up it's going to open an
XML tag and close it so down here open
and we just put in in Dreamweaver you
can just put in the forward slash and it
closes the tag for you see it's very
nice I put in the bracket I put in the
forward slash and close his tag for me
Dreamweaver helps you do less work but
you can still understand the code just
like anybody working in WordPad or
notepad and Dreamweaver also gives you a
lot of stock code that helps you learn
how to code a lot of people bash
Dreamweaver in their stupid ok so here
we go let's say my XML list this is
opening the tag the section that's going
to be read in our ActionScript file as
the XML list so to keep everything
organized real nice let's put some
spaces in here that way we have when
humans read our XML file or we read our
XML file we have nice visual referencing
on how all the tags are stacked up on
each other so now let's close this one
so you see how I opened my XML list and
then I closed my XML list now I can put
things inside of my XML list it's that
easy put a couple of spaces here go down
one more line by pressing enter and
let's put the first list item and this
is how easy it is
let's call it list item list item and
let's close that tag down here let's
close it off you have to close off all
your tags so this is say list item one
and we want three list items for this
example because I think three will show
this example nicely and you'll be able
to expand
okay so there's list item one list item
two and list item three these three list
items are what we're going to bring in
to flash to make render okay so first
thing we'll do is have the item color so
we type in item color and all these tags
you see here these little nodes are
gonna be referenced in flash movies
bring it in to display so item color for
the first guy is ffffff which is white
let's close that tag off item color
closed okay now the next item for the
person or whatever you're doing if
you're showcasing clothing or software
I'm just gonna be showcasing people okay
so item label this is going to be their
name the first guy's name I'll use red
nicknames so we got Peter McCall wait
for a call close his item label tag now
Peter McCall's phone number but item
phone
and then you just put his phone number
in by PI pi PI pi PI pi PI pi PI and we
close his item phone tag now that's all
we need for a Peter McCall you can have
many more options in there many more
nodes that would bring in much more data
it's very easy I'm just gonna show three
pieces of data we bring in for each one
of our three list items but know that
those can be expanded to have many more
items types in there and you can have
many more list items not only three okay
so I'm gonna pop in three more two more
people into these other two list items
here and then we'll talk about bringing
it into flash will show you how to do
that and just so you know the item color
there the item color tags four nodes
which they would be properly called as
XML nodes they are going to be hex
values we're bringing them into flash
hex values then we're gonna utilize them
within some of our function to make
those colors happen make it happen okay
so the next person so we got Emily Owen
and Jeff Jones Peter McCall and the
Leone Jeff Jones
let's see we all have different phone
numbers that's great
okay so you see everything is closed off
and nested really nice we open my XML
list and then closed it see here's the
opener
there's the closer here's the main XML
tag right here and then it closes here
within the main XML tag is my XML list
within my XML list we put list items
that's as simple as it is XML is so
simple and even if you wanted you can
bring one little item in for instance if
I only wanted one little item to go in I
can just put owner name tag and then
close that tag off and inside of it put
atom quarry and you don't put any any of
of these other things in and you can
access just that one thing so XML could
be that simple if you wanted it to be
but for bringing one variable into flash
I wouldn't recommend XML okay so but it
works well I would just do it in other
ways there's the three people
everything's done here let's bring it
into flash let's open the flash
ActionScript 3 project which you can be
in flash cs3 or flash cs4 and code this
exactly the same so let's open flash
ActionScript 3 project and let's save
this file to the same location on a
desktop
where is it I forgot what I named it now
a s 3 XML basics let's name that same
thing a s 3 underscore xml underscore
basics that'll be the name of my flash
file you would name yours my file
whatever you want ok and we have to
realize that this XML file and this
flash file have to live in the same
exact folder if we're going to reference
it directly it could also live in
different folders so you see here I have
my flash file and my XML file living in
the same folder and it would live that
way on my server as well if I wanted to
have my XML file in a folder say called
XML and I pop it in there actually I
can't do that well Dreamweavers I'll
have it open let's close it there in
Dreamweaver now I drag it in there
now you could reference it in that
folder if you wanted and I might show
you how to do that let's cut that out
let's bring it back okay so now inside
of the flash file all we have to do is
code out to grab each and every one of
the nodes from the XML file and display
them in a loop that's what we'll be
doing we'll be using a dynamic loop to
render all of the items in the XML file
so you don't have to go over each one we
can just iterate ok the ActionScript 3
side of working with external XML data
it's not as simple as creating the
actual XML file itself this is a little
more complicated I'm gonna try and get
you comfortable with it it's best I can
ok so I'm gonna show you sections of
code the first thing I'm gonna draw out
a rectangle just to serve as background
graphics
that looks good to me
let's make this an edge of black it's a
little lighter okay so now we have
graphics on layer one so let's just name
that graphics and stuff then we add a
new layer name this one ActionScript 3
3.0 and here is where you can click the
current key frame for the ActionScript
layer and press f9 to open your actions
panel and that's where we put in code
that we want to correspond to certain
objects or things in our timeline okay
so I'm gonna pop in some code and I'll
discuss each line or each section as I
pop it in because I'm not going to cold
character by character for you it will
take too long ok here and this is very
similar to another tutorial I gave but I
didn't go as in-depth and explain things
as well okay so this one we set the Y
location on stage where the first box
will live and we're gonna bring in each
XML item each XML list item and it's
going to be placed into its own little
box and in each little box we're gonna
put the data and I'll show you how to
create a movie clip container that holds
the rectangle the colored rectangle the
text the two text objects and organizes
things into a nice movie clip container
that way you can even add more
interactions to that container like
button interactions anything you can do
to a movie clip or button basically
alright so first line sets the Y
placement so this means each box when it
comes in will live at a wide location on
stage of 20 which would be let's see
where's 20 y see my box is now at Y 20
so that's where the first one will start
when it's dynamically displayed the X
placement is similar that just
determines where on this explain that
the the file will live and that set to
30 so to be right about there so 20 and
30 that's about where the first box will
live when it comes in dynamically its
top corner will be right there
now the third line is the distance each
box should be apart referencing each box
from this top corner if that makes sense
each box is going to be referenced from
its top left corner okay now let's put
it in the next little bit of code now
here we're going to initialize the XML
with this line it creates an XML object
and initializes it and then we
initialize we place the XML file name
into a string variable here this is a
string variable with the XML file name
on server and its location and then we
initialize the URL request right here
using this string with the files
location and name see we make a URL
request and then we use a loader to load
the URL request then in my loader we add
an event listener for complete and XML
loaded is going to be the name of the
function that runs on complete okay now
let's go ahead and add that the start of
that function it's gonna run right there
at that point and so let's go ahead and
close that function off give it lots of
space there'll be lots of things in
there okay the first thing we're gonna
do inside of that XML loaded function is
this we're going to place the XML data
into the XML object see this XML object
we claimed up here my XML gets the
loader object data and that's what we do
we put a loader object data into the my
XML object and then we initialize and
give a var name which is XML doc - the
name of the new external XML document
just for using it in ActionScript easier
and then we ignore white spaces within
that document so in your XML file say if
you have blank lines separating each
item then it will get ignored so you
don't have to worry about it okay so to
find a new name for the XML that is in
the data in my loader so we give it a
var of menu XML and it's XML based my
loader data which is very similar to
what we did here but we're just gonna
place it into a new variable here then
we take the XML doc that we claimed
right here which is XML document based
ok so now we parse the XML data into a
readable format so we use the parse XML
method or function and we make it all to
string string is like the opposite of a
number string is like just text
characters alphanumeric characters
let's see okay now we're gonna add the
for loop and a for loop is for iterating
over items usually dynamic items that
you have coming in externally so you can
code a little more slim let's go ahead
and close that one off so inside of the
for each loop is really where let's give
this a little more inset there is where
all the magic really happens inside of
this for each loop right here inside of
the XML function the XML loaded function
we had to claim a few things to get our
XML into readable format now inside of
the for each loop is where we're gonna
really add the magic to make everything
display okay so the first thing inside
of our little magical for each loop and
you can see inside of our for each loop
and let me line these up about their
point point point right okay so let's
put this back one okay so the for each
loop it claims a variable of list item
and it's xml-based
and in inside of my XML which is this
object here that we claimed at the very
top my XML it's a new XML object and we
add the list item so it knows to read
the list item nodes within our XM our
external XML file so it creates a new
variable for each of those list items
does that make sense yes it does okay so
each list item in our external XML file
is created a new variable for it which
is called list item and then we can
access those things within the loop so
within this loop each person or each
list item will get iterated over so we
can then display in succession and I'll
show you how first thing we do is access
the value of the
item label let's see no item color
it's item color this is labeled phone
okay
access the value of the item color in my
last lesson I didn't show you guys how
to deal with colors or have or convert
strings to a color which I show you how
to do here and I'll show you how to do
that in just a second we're gonna
convert this color which is a string
variable into a number variable and I'll
show you how to do that so we access the
value of the item color which each one
of our people in our XML file has a
color remember each one of our people in
our XML file has a item label which was
their name and each one of our people
had a phone number so all we're doing
here is creating variable string
variables of each of those items in the
notes in our XML file pretty simple now
we're going to define what the box is
gonna look like a little rectangle it's
gonna be their little background for
their box and I'm gonna show you how to
display things in ActionScript within
this XML loop just so you don't have
just some blank tutorial that doesn't
show you how to integrate or actually
use the knowledge will give you
something that will show you how to
dynamically render and display things as
well let's try to give you the insight
that you need of what the code is doing
you know okay so this next session
section all pertains to the style of the
box that holds each person does that
make sense yes bar rect shape is a new
shape so we name this variable rect we
claimed it is a shape and it's a new
shape object the next line is var color
and this is the number we convert we're
converting the list color number
or the list color:string
into a number in this line so we claim a
new variable coal color make sure it's a
color object or a color variable sorry
and then or a number variable sorry and
that's how we convert this string here
this list color to a string and you have
to add the 0x there I'm not sure if you
have to add that but it looks like all
the colors in ActionScript like they
like that so I added it so we add a
little string to the string coming in
see what I did I added a little string
of 0x to the number string the hex value
coming in for their number and this
whole variable is claimed as a number so
then we can use that in the begin fill
so we go we say the rectangle that we
created here has a graphics begin fill
of color that's all that's saying the
graphics is going to be colored this
color which is going to be different for
each one of those people if it's claimed
it's different in the XML file which
ours is so the rect we also add a line
style which is a border around your box
around your rectangle and ours is going
to be a nice dark color and this is the
hex value for that nice I think it's a
dark gray and then we draw the box now
the box is drawn and we can then add
child to stage whenever we like we're
gonna be doing that in just a second and
I'll show you you might think this is
really complex but this is all kind of
necessary for doing this sort of thing
in ActionScript 3 so just get used to it
but you can see everything you know is
has its place here and like I said you
can research all of these green items to
really understand what I'm coding out
here okay now let's pop in the next
section now this pertains to the
everything's off
this pertains to the text fields that
are going to create be created to hold
each person's to display each person's
data okay so now we say my text variable
we claim a new variable which is a text
field and our text field object sorry
and then the my text one which is
claimed here gets a dot text value of
list label that means the actual text
that's in that node which is list label
which is each person's name
remember that gets put in to the text
field as that text fields value its text
value so the next line autosize is the
text field and make sure it's lined to
left the next line you can do a whole
lot of text formatting if you research
it in ActionScript 3 help file or online
you can understand how to format code
like a champ I just do a couple of
little things here to show you examples
now this might X dot X it offsets it
inside of the box two pixels and the Y
also so it's like cushion space so it's
not right up against the edge that's all
those two little lines are doing okay
now we're going to add child see right
here
add child my text that means it's
actually going to be placed on stage at
this moment which is the first text
field so let's put this up here add
child mine takes one now the second text
field is going to hold the phone number
it's gonna be all the same things pretty
much and then we're gonna add that child
as well grab the code for that right
here okay so we added child one we add
child two or add child from my text one
add child from my text to an add child
if you don't know is for adding dynamic
objects to the stage it actually puts it
on the flash stage so people can see it
at that moment add child that's what
that does you can also use a remove
child handy little function okay so that
takes care of the text and the boxes now
all we got to do is create a little
movie clip container that way you guys
can have more control over these these
each list item and create objects out of
them that can be manipulated with code
like a button or any movie clip Ken
okay now let's pop in the last little
bit of code and explain it to you and
then you'll be off and running
now I'm also going to have this source
file available free for download at the
favela PHP calm in the flash section you
can get to the source and the XML all in
a nice little zip package okay those are
offset a little bit further than the
rest but that's okay now we're gonna
create that movie clip holder for each
box that I was talking about and this is
not a necessary step but I think it
really helps in making your your loops
leaner and your organizing all the
person's data or all the items data into
one little box that can then be given
more code and interaction and I have
tutorials that show you how to create
dynamic movie clips from loops into
buttons that then can get clicked and go
to URLs or other scenes in your flash
file or open up new
for display and that's when you get more
advanced into xml programming in
ActionScript 3 you can go and take my
other tutorials and see a lot of other
cool stuff okay so in in the inside of
this last little bit of code that I just
added I'm gonna explain each line we
create the movie clip holder which is
using just the new movie clip create a
new movie clip object function and then
we give it a bar name of clip underscore
MC we add the rectangle graphic now to
that movie clip inside of it it's going
to be placed the rectangle which is
going to be colored remember with each
person's color choice then we add the
text fields inside of our movie clip
clip underscore MC is going to have two
text fields placed into it this one is
gonna be the name the person's name and
this one is gonna be the person's phone
number so we're just adding child
instead of directly to stage C add child
that adds child directly to stage and
then this one will scoop it up and place
it into the clip underscore MC which we
might not even need this one and I might
get rid of these if we don't need them
we'll test and we'll see you learn
something new every day okay so now
after we put the two text fields into
the box then we put the new movie clip
on stage at this very moment add child
clip and MC at this moment when this
runs their little boxes put on stage and
it's all split second you can't even
notice it it just happen so fast so now
we apply the offset Y position to the
stage and this is to make it so these
three lines of code make it to where
each box just doesn't land right on top
of each other on stage you have to
offset each item in your iterated four
loops so that each item won't be sitting
directly on top of its of the one that
came in before it so if you left if you
didn't offset each item you would see
just the last item that was brought in
through the loop because all other items
would be hidden in stacks and layers
underneath
that one okay so here we X we offset the
Y placement we offset the X placement
and remember those values we put here in
the beginning that's what those are you
should take a take a minute and you'll
understand that it's saying clip for
this item coming through the loop it
equals y placement so it knows to have a
y placement of xx and X placement of 30
and then each box knows that it has to
be offset of a Y position of 60 so each
box doesn't land on top of each other
this one really has to do with each box
being offset these really just place
where it's gonna line up on stage if
that makes sense and that's pretty much
everything let's see I hope I don't get
any errors let's try this beautiful
alright so Peter McCall has a white box
remember Emily Owen we had to give her a
little pink box and Jeff Jones we gave
him the light green box and that's how
you get all of your items to come out on
stage you see here it was my background
so when I press control enter and I test
the movie there it is so by pressing f12
and look at it and see how it look in
the browser pressing ctrl enter just
exports it for viewing and flash and
debugging okay so this also has will be
available if you want to get to the
actual source of what I created here to
look at it a little further
change it up whatever and that should
show you the very basics of creating an
external XML file for use in flash and
then bringing it into flash and having
it display all the ways that you want it
to okie-dokie we'll see you next lesson
oh yeah we were supposed to check one
thing in the code here see if we
actually needed it to add these text
fields at this moment I don't think we
do let's see
nope not needed we can get rid of those
I didn't think they were good okay see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
