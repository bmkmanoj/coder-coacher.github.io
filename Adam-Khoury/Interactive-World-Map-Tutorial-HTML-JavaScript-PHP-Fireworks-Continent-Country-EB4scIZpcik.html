learn to create interactive web ready
maps that are HTML and JavaScript based
your map areas will change colors when
the users mouse hovers over them and we
can program interaction into the map
areas we also discuss integrating this
type of interactive map with dynamic PHP
and MySQL systems and this is the
finished product of the user interface
that you'll be learning to create so you
have a web ready map that lights up
different areas when the users mouse
goes over that specific area and then
the user can click that and they're
ushered to a page called continent PHP
and it passes the dynamic variable for
whatever continent it is over to that
page the first thing I'm going to do is
open the map that I want to begin with
in fireworks now I'm going to add a
second state to that map which will give
it a different look and determine the
hover state so you can go over to your
side panel here if you have it on the
right and open States or you can go to
window States right click state 1 and
duplicate it one time after the current
state press ok on this one we're going
to highlight the image on state 2 then
we're going to add filter adjust color
hue and saturation I'll select colorize
and actually that looks like a good
color right there to me I like that you
can really make it any color you want by
sliding your hue and saturation you can
make it very bright let's see maybe I'll
make it blue actually I like that green
color right there in between blue and
green ok so if you go in between state
one and state two you can see what you
have you have the regular gray or
whatever colors your map is starting
with and then you have your hover state
you can even rename this one hover and
the first one rename normal so you have
your normal state and your hover state
ok let's go back to the normal view of
our map now we're going to add slices
and hotspots and fireworks slices and
hotspots are used to make things web
interactive and I'm going to target
North America first with a slice so when
your left toolbar here you go under web
and you grab your polygon slice or you
can hold it down you can get the regular
slice or polygon slice which will allow
you to make any shape slice that you
want so what I'm going to do is target
North America just by drawing a polygon
slice all the way around it
and I'm not sure about this little
island here but I'm just going to make
that part of North America I'm not a
geography expert so all right so you can
see I'm putting a polygon slice all the
way around North America now I'm going
to grab a hotspot polygon hotspot I'm
going to draw pretty much the same shape
but this one is a hotspot and I'm going
to try and make it just a little bit
smaller or inside of the slice if I can
and it doesn't really have to be but you
want to be able to select both of them
when you get done drawing this one out
so that's why I'm making a little bit
smaller than I did or have some edge of
the slice visible underneath the hotspot
that way I can grab both of them when I
need to so now we have our hotspot on
top of our slice now let's highlight the
slice again underneath the hotspot and
we're going to click this little Center
ridicule and add simple rollover
behavior now let's highlight the hotspot
on top grab its reticule grab its center
point reticule and drag it over to the
slice now a little dialog pops up that
says swap image and we're going to swap
image from the hover State okay now I'm
going to go to file save as and just so
I don't overwrite my initial world map
image I'm just going to name this
interactive so I have interactive
underscore world map save it and then
press f12 to run it in your favorite
browser now when I hover over North
America you see that that switches to
state two now we're going to add the
hotspot and slice for the continent of
Europe now before we do that let's talk
about the interactivity that you can
place on the hotspot you could put any
link you want so you can have it go to a
page called continent dot php' and
attack
a get variable to it of name equals
North America and you can do that for
all of the hotspots that you put on your
map for all of your various continents
and then continent dot php' will just
need to be set up by the programmer to
maybe fetch variables from the database
according to North America or Europe or
whatever or you might just want to show
a larger map of North America so all
we've done so far is we had a map we
added a second hover state for the map
that changes the colors then we added a
slice and what the slice does is
determines what part of the map is going
to be visible when the person hovers
over it or when the person hovers over
this hotspot when the person hovers over
this hotspot this slice determines what
part of the imagery is going to be shown
to them because this slice is connected
to this hot spot and the hot spot is
where we add our web interactivity and
you can make the alt to say North
America for that one so basically we'll
do the same thing for Europe now we're
going to add a slice and then a hotspot
for web interactivity now Europe where
it's connected to Asia is going to be a
little bit trickier so we're going to
add another slice polygon slice I'm
going to start drawing it in right here
and if I need to I can press ctrl and
mouse wheel in to zoom in real close and
I'm just going to go around all through
here making sure that I don't intersect
with Asia and I'm going to go up through
this line very carefully it doesn't have
to be perfect but you want it to be as
perfect as possible so you could spend a
whole lot of time making sure that you
define your lines correctly to here on
all of your slices your hotspots it's
not really going to matter so much okay
so there's our slice let's grab our
pointer tool again and hit the center
and add simple rollover behavior now
let's draw our hotspot on top of it so
we'll grab polygon hotspot and this one
doesn't have to be a so exact in its
shape because this is just going to be
the mouse over interact
but I'm going to shape it pretty much
the same your lines wouldn't have to be
so intricately defined because this is
just where the users Mouse is going to
be grabbing so it wouldn't have to be as
perfect as the other line there now the
link for this one put continent dot php'
question mark name equals Europe and the
alt for that clickable hotspot or that
web interactive hotspot is going to be
Europe and you're only putting alt
because there's an image associated with
that hotspot and all images on the page
require an alt attribute you can also
specify the target for all of your links
now we're going to make sure we
highlight the hotspot and drag its
center to the slice under it and we'll
swap image from hover state to okay now
press ctrl s press f12 to preview this
so now when we hover over Europe you can
see that it's interactive now along with
North America and if I was to click that
it would attempt to take me to a page
called continent PHP name equals Europe
okay now I'll zoom back out to a hundred
percent and what I'm going to do is now
add the slices and hotspots for Asia
Africa Australia and South America using
the same approach that we used for North
America and Europe okay now I've got my
whole map rigged up and when I highlight
any hotspot it has the proper link with
the proper dynamic URL variable so if I
render this you can see that I get all
of my continents or lit up where they
should be when my mouse goes over that
specific area and even very intricate
shapes see like these very close
together you can spend a lot of time
making sure that all your shapes are
correct all of your slices so remember
the hotspot is what the users Mouse will
go over and determine what will show for
the slice that's under it and the slice
determines what part of the graphics are
going to be showing now what we'll do is
go to file export we're going to create
a new folder on the desktop call it
interactive map now inside of this
folder called interactive
a platooning on a desktop we're going to
export the HTML and all the images for
this web interactive world map and
there's a lot of different little
options you can play with down here
according to your specific needs so
let's go to save now let's see what we
have on our desktop we have this folder
interactive world map and here's the
HTML page and all of the images now if
you open the HTML page you'll see
basically what you saw when you render
it out in fireworks and this is a page
you can just throw up on the web it's
ready to go and when the person clicks
any of these continents they're going to
go to a page called continent that PHP
which can be set up to be very dynamic
and you can also open with Dreamweaver
and check out all of the JavaScript and
HTML that make up that image map and you
can also add further interactivity the
better you get with JavaScript CSS and
HTML and all those little things you can
add a whole lot more interactivity and
coolness to your map now let's go away
back into our map into the layers and
what I'm going to do is go up into the
web layer I'm going to lock it that's
where all my hotspot and slices are I'm
going to lock it and I'm going to make
it to where I can't see it and then on
state one my normal state I'm just going
to put the labels right on the
continents so that I'll just make it
white press ctrl-c ctrl-v put this one
over here say South America and I'll do
that for all of them I'll also want to
take those highlight all of them and
hold shift as I'm highlighting them all
to grab them all together like that
press ctrl C and go into your state to
your hover state make sure you put them
there also if you want them to show up
when the user hovers over press ctrl s
preview your file by pressing f12 and
you can see now you have labels over all
of your continents which might help
people all right so it's very important
to remember that you can use the
JavaScript HTML and and then add PHP to
the whole system to make it a very
dynamic web interactive map to where
when somebody clicks on any of these
continents you're going to usher them to
continent PHP with a dynamic variable
attached and you can dig a whole lot of
information out of your day
base according to what that variable is
and then display it on continent PHP so
if I click North America when this map
is on the web I can program my database
to query things for North America and
then render them to the page and the
same page continent at PHP would be able
to render all the different results for
all these various continents so
basically all you would need is two
pages the page that holds your map and
then the dynamic page that renders
results from things that people click on
in your map</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
