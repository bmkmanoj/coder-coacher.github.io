with another awesome video tutorial for
webmasters courtesy of the Vela PHP comm
and this one is called flawless active
page CSS menu marking using PHP dynamics
by Adam quarry that's me this tutorial
has come to be due to a forum post at
develop PHP calm where skate tronic
which he has a pretty cool URL to I
don't usually do this but if you're into
skateboarding and music this is the site
for you because it brings skateboarding
and music together skate Tronics calm I
just thought he had a cool site cool
unique things going on so I thought I'd
throw it out there if anybody's in
skateboarding or music you'll probably
dig that site a whole bunch he asks is
there a tutorial on here how to make
menu markers for a PHP or HTML site I
searched it and I didn't see one if not
can somebody maybe make one thanks so
that's why I'm making this tutorial
because I'm going to show you guys how
to make menu markers for your HTML CSS
websites we're going to use a little bit
of PHP dynamics to keep things nice and
slim and easy and also text spectrum
second in the motion for this to be a
tutorial so we're putting that into
motion and this is what we have and I
also make sure I validated through the
CSS and the HTML and if that's not
enough well first of all you're getting
two tutorials in one here you're going
to learn how to make menu markers so
when I click on partners
you see partner stays active it's lit up
and the person knows they're on the
partners page just by the button itself
and that's the first thing you're going
to learn so whether you have a menu
that's set up on top maybe your menu is
vertical going down the left side or
something and you want the buttons to
stay lit up if they're on that page this
is the tutorial for you and this also
shows how to sync the button right into
the page so I offer you a little trick
on how to make this seamless to where
when they click this button it goes to
that page there's no line there and the
button just blends
right into the element that's under it
it's awesome you're going to love it
okay and just for extra added assurance
I went ahead and make sure that Google
Chrome it displays correctly Internet
Explorer it displays correctly
everything works exactly as it should
Firefox everything displays as it should
and opera everything displays just like
it should and it all looks the same
throughout all the different browsers
all right now let's rock and roll and
talk about this cold logic and how these
things are set up you'll notice that the
home page is very simple much like any
other home page the only thing that is
dynamic about it is this menu template
include here we're using PHP to include
once a file called menu template dot PHP
now we're doing that so and if you ever
want to change you'll notice this
website only has four pages but say you
had a website with eight or ten pages
and say you wanted to change the design
or the maybe what this link says or
maybe you want to add one more button up
here you won't have to do it on all four
pages that's why we use that menu
include you want to add another button
to your menu change what one of the
button labels say where it points to
what URL it navigates to anything like
that you change it in one spot one time
in one file and it's updated on all
eight pages all four pages all 50 pages
of your website if you're using a smart
include menu template so this whole menu
you see here is not static in the page
and you can tell that by looking at the
index file the div ID menu container
only contains where we include the menu
template and the menu template is here
and I'm going to discuss that in one
minute and that's where the dynamics are
happening all the dynamics making this
menu possible happening there and CSS we
have a CSS stylesheet that is used for
styling up the website the way those
buttons look where they're located and I
got that seamless
effect to wear buttons blend right into
the page by using padding one pixel on
that container and I'll I'll explain all
that in just a second so if you look at
all four pages they're all relatively
the same the contact page partners page
services page and index page all pretty
much look the same and they're all
bringing in that menu template like I
said you only want to have to change
things in one file one time to affect
all the different various pages
otherwise you're having to open twelve
pages in Dreamweaver and change one
little thing on every one of those pages
that's retarded
so you use a menu template if you can
okay let's just explain the stylesheet
real quick you can see I am affecting
the body tag on the page on all my pages
setting the margin top forty pixels font
to Arial the font size on one to
fourteen so we can set the font size and
a font family and all that stuff in the
body tag if you want and that menu
container you can see is on all the
pages here div ID menu container so in
the style sheet this styling here is
affecting that container this container
right here is being affected by this
styling here and here and this one you
see a little a on the end that affects
only links that are inside of the menu
container so you can style just the link
tags if there are any in there and
that's what I'm doing so that's how I
get it to have padding so the letters
aren't so close up to the buttons you
know what I'm saying it gives the
buttons a little room in there
and also the padding bottom one pixel
that so it gives it look watch if I
change this to zero I'm going to FTP it
up and then refresh okay
now let's refresh here and now you can
see there's the line it appeared and you
don't have a seamless integration of
button into the div under it under it
and that's a trick not many people know
about so that's why I'm throwing that
one in free and let's refresh and see
that's how I achieve that effect it's
very simple and the text decoration on
all links inside of them
your container I wanted no underline so
I set that right there now here the menu
container links hover you put this style
so when they hover over a link see it
looks like the like the active button
really you can make that black you can
make it pink on hover you can make the
letters in there any color you want
right here change that color will change
the text and this will change the
background color now here we have and so
that's it for menu container CSS styling
next thing we have is the menu buttons
so when the menu buttons are not active
this is the styling they have which
would be these here these three are not
active and I'm not hovering over them
right now so they're a dark blue with
white white font and then when they're
active we assign my active button on the
page that's active using this menu
template dot PHP file which I'm going to
explain in just a second when the PHP
file renders dynamics it needs it sets a
different class on the active page which
is this class right here my active
button which gets a background of
whatever you want and a color text
whatever you want
I chose to use the same color as my body
the div that's the body section and sync
it up to where there was a seamless
layout of button into page I think it's
a really cool effect when you do that
now let's discuss the last little bit
here which is the body container which
is not anything really relevant to what
we're doing except that it does render
out this nice blue body it matches the
color of my buttons when they're active
and when they're hovered see so my body
container is set up to match that so
everything syncs up nice and here I gave
my padding of the inner body content
which is
this div here so you can see this div
body container which is set up to be
that blue box with the grey border then
inside of it there's another div
container and that is simply set to have
a padding so it's not so close up on
that gray border on the edge of the box
see here right there that space right in
between that first word and the edge of
the box
that's that padding I set right there
and that's all that's in there and
that's the style sheet now everything
you've seen so far is basic HTML and
basic CSS now here you might be thinking
I'm saving the hardest thing for last no
no no no no no this is very simple
watch this menu template that PHP only
contains this many lines and before I
even explain what the PHP is doing I'm
going to explain what the HTML output of
this page is doing you can see there's
four links here and contrary to what a
lot of CSS gurus think you don't always
have to use an unordered list and list
elements to create nice menus you can
actually just use the a tag so I think
it's a lot smarter to get rid of all
that UL and li you can do horizontal and
vertical whatever you want you just
gotta set the CSS up right and it all
validates at w3c so you don't really
need the unordered list you don't really
need the the li elements in there if
you're going to make any kind of CSS
menus really even dropdowns or anything
like that they can all be div separated
and it all still validated whatever okay
so basically what's happening is I'm
laying in four links here very simple
and the only thing dynamic about these
links is the class is dynamic you can
see let's go up into the PHP now and
you'll see that we initialize the page
variables so there are no errors
actually we can remove that because
we're putting in default values so these
aren't really being initialized which
they are being initialized but we're
putting default values in them the
default values in all of these is my
buttons which gives it the normal class
in the CSS style right here
for the buttons and then here's my
active button and let me show you how we
get that going now here's the only semi
tricky sort of thing about this whole
little application is getting the menu
link ID and the way I achieved that is
basically what I'm trying to do here was
get just what the page name is so if I'm
on the services page what my logic was
telling me was - I have to get this page
name in order to do this so I had to get
this services on partners I wanted to
get just this partners so I used PHP
which PHP is really handy and has all
kind of built-in functions do all kind
of cool stuff and the base name a
function you can research a PHP that net
basically what that does is it gets the
base name of the file and server PHP
self this renders in the full path or
the URL that's in the browser and so
it'll grab everything the whole path to
this file on your server so what you do
is you get base name to remove all of
the path stuff so basically base name is
going to remove all the path stuff in
that string and just leave you with
index dot PHP or say services dot PHP
that will be the variable here so to
remove the dot PHP I just laid in the
second argument there for the base name
function which will allow it to remove
that extension which leaves me with just
index just services just partners that's
what that variable will hold because
this is removing the path base name is
removing the path and it's also helping
us remove the extension so we're left
with just the page name that we can use
to render out dynamically which of these
links should have the active page
styling on it you get it the active link
button styling on it so we just say if
menu link equals index or menu link ID
equals index index equals my active
button
it switches from up top with a default
my buttons it switches it to my active
button so when it renders down here it
will know that that's the active page
else/if menu link ID equals services
page services equals my active button
else if bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
for however many pages you have and you
can also use PHP s switch and break
statements here to accomplish this logic
that you need to evaluate which page in
which page ID but I think if an else
condition statements work nice and fast
you won't have any problems with that
but you can substitute this for switch
break statements if your if you're good
with PHP you can substitute this with
switch break to evaluate what the menu
link ID is so that's how it works
okay so I hope this was helpful to a few
of you guys and we'll see you next
lesson bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
