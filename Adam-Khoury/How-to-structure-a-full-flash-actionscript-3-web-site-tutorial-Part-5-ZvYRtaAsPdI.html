full flash website structure tutorial
and we were inside of the button menu
movie clip and we have our four buttons
here and the code for all four buttons
is right here and I'll explain that in a
second first thing we want to do is you
got to change the name when these things
so we double-click inside of that one
and let's change the text layer to say
home double click outside to return
double-click inside button too and we'll
call this one about us or about and then
double click outside double click into
button three oops went too far change
that text to contact on own videos and
do the same for button for this one
we're going to rename contact up me okay
so contact me so home about me videos
and contact me perfect okay let's see if
we get a loud click sound in there I'm
going to take the click sound away from
me it's way too loud you can put any
kind of sound you want on your buttons
and inside the button you'll see when
you download my animated button tutorial
with the click sound you'll see how I
laid sound in there and where I put it
but I'm going to take it out because
it's too loud
I had my sound set way too loud for that
okay so now we have our correct names
now let's look at the action script so
button one function for over out and
click out all right here and then here
are the three listeners for button one
over roll over roll out and click so
this fire is off when they click it this
fires off when they roll out this fire
is off when they roll over the button
it's that simple and you'll see here
when they click in that function we jump
out of this clip this main menu movie
clip and we go into the wii u's parent
code to jump out of the movie clip in
code and jump into and control the all
pages movie clip so we're essentially
doing this we're jumping out and then
here's the all pages movie clip instance
name all pages and we're jumping in so
we're jumping out of that movie clip
with code and going into this and
instructing it to play these frame
labels it's that simple so if I publish
out right now there it is in a home page
faded in I click about so you see about
videos and contact and like I said
anything at all can be inside of those
movie clips anything at all let's close
that and now let's go back to the code
inside of the button movie clip and
you'll see that it says movie clip
parent dot all pages that go to and play
home so it plays it goes and plays the
home label inside of our pages movie
clip this one is all exactly the same
except the controls button to and their
listeners are here just like button one
and it goes and it instructs the all
pages movie clip to play the about frame
label and this one the videos frame
label this one is to contact frame label
it's very simple and here are
so button function over out and click
for number four and it's set its
structured the same way button one is
but it just controls button for instead
of button one and I think that's about
it that should get you on your way and
let's see so here we have the button
movie clip here's all pages here's logo
up here you put an mp3 player digital
clock whatever you want to put up in
there and then you can have a footer
that stays static as pages change or
whatever you want to do and see there's
anything else I need to mention yep like
I said you can put any kind of
transitions you want in here I just did
a simple alpha fade from zero to one
hundred percent for each page but
there's tons of transitions you can do
in flash and there's tons of
applications you can get it developed
PHP com that already made in flash free
fla files that you can pop in and use on
your websites just drop down menu scroll
bars video players mp3 players yadda
yadda yadda everything anymore okay so
that is pretty much it and if you guys
can't once you get your hands on this
file you download this file that i just
created you'll see the structure you'll
understand maybe a little bit better how
to how to keep your your file in your
page structure in your menu system a
little more organized within your flash
files okay we'll see you guys next
lesson that concludes it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
