explore the storage interface in
JavaScript you could use web storage to
create shopping cart applications for
online stores allow your visitors to
change your website's theme and remember
their theme choice from page to page
storing certain details about a user or
hundreds of other programming tasks that
might require your pages or applications
to remember things about a user or for
the user it can also help you cut down
on requests for database data as the
user goes from page to page on your
website you can think of it as a data
cache that has a five megabytes storage
limit now here are the properties and
methods that you'll be learning about in
this video and there are the nuts and
bolts of the storage interface and as we
already mentioned there's an arbitrary
space limit suggested for stored data in
various browser software which is five
megabytes and the security concerns
would be similar to any security
concerns that you would have with
creating sessions or cookies in PHP Java
C or any other language that allows the
programmer to create and manage sessions
and cookies we're going to be working
with two HTML files so we can show how
we can set stored data in any file on
our website and then the other files on
our website will be able to access all
that data so that's why we're going to
be working with two files the first
thing we want to do is illustrate the
difference between local storage and
session storage so first I'm going to
create a local storage item now we're
going to put a session storage item in
place into temporary memory and the
items in storage work like key value
pairs so you have the key is on the left
then you put a comma and then the value
is on the right so in this case the name
of my keys is name or you can change
that to username if it makes more sense
that way we don't get confused so the
key name is username and the value is
George that's for a local storage item
this session storage item has a key name
of username and a value of Bradley now
we establish both of them so we can show
you how local storage has a longer life
than session storage session storage has
a
shorter term memory according to when
the user leaves your website or shuts
their browser down while local storage
remains persistent even if they shut
their browser down the last thing we
need now is just a simple link that goes
to other pages at HTML that way when we
navigate to this page there's going to
be a local storage item and a session
storage item created and then we'll have
a link that we can click to go to the
other page now in other page that HTML
we're going to apply the following code
now all this code is doing is writing to
the document inside of the body element
we're writing hi local storage user name
and hi session storage user name so we
should get hi George and hi Bradley now
the only reason this other page that
HTML will would have access to this
information is because we already set it
in one of the other pages on our website
some page that HTML so now let's just
run some page HTML in our favorite
browser software or navigate to it so
now the two storage items were set and I
have the link to go to the other page
let's click that see how we set and says
hi George and hi Bradley that means all
of the information is remembered now for
all the different pages on our website
now I wanted to illustrate the
difference and put both side by side by
let's take this link right here and
let's open a new tab let's go to that
new tab and the same link see hi George
and hi undefined the reason why this is
undefined it's because we're using a
session storage item for this one we're
using local storage item for this one
that's why this one persists and this
one did not because it's it's still
available in this tab we can refresh and
it will be available all day in this tab
but it's not available in this tab now
let's just shut the browser down and
come back to other pages HTML to reopen
the browser then let's go to that same
link see George is still there even
after
shut the browser down the local storage
item is still there but the session
storage item is not there anymore
so if you want to think of it in terms
of cookies and sessions this is a cookie
and this is a session which is a shorter
lived memory and it only can persist
within that the browsing tab that it was
set in local storage will persist
through other tabs and even if the user
shuts the browser down now all of the
methods and properties like the method
set item that can be used on both local
storage and session storage so all of
the different methods and properties
that we're going to be discussing for
the rest of the video applies to both of
these storage objects so I'm just going
to I'm not going to work with the
session storage examples because they're
just like the local storage examples but
now you know the difference between
local storage and session storage so
from here on in we're going to just work
with the local storage now whenever we
want to clear data out of the memory the
local storage memory we can just type in
let me just comment this line out we run
the local storage dot clear method so
now if I run this in my favorite browser
it should have cleared the storage now
I'm going to go to the other page and I
have undefined data on under other page
actually let me go to other page and
remove this one to show you how we have
cleared it now we sub-sect successfully
cleared that local storage data and you
can remove just specific items let's go
ahead and set another item so we have
user named George and we'll say country
will be the key name for the next item
and that will be USA so we have user
name George country is USA and we'll go
into other page and we'll copy this
reference and we'll type from quote plus
plus plus quote and then in between
there we'll put in that data so it'll
say hi whatever the user name is from
country so we can access local storage
dot user name and local store
country data and in this document I'm
going to clear the local storage every
time before these new storage items are
put into them I'm going to clear out the
local storage which is not something you
have to do but it's just something I
want to do that way it's empty each time
we set it new so I'll go to this
document in my favorite browser now go
to the other page now I see hi George
from USA
that means this data both of these data
items are stored in local storage for
all of the other pages on my website to
access whenever they need to access them
in script or in the HTML now we'll show
you how to access the length property so
we'll go back here and we'll set one
more piece of data
let's just put color blue now when this
script runs there'll be three local
storage items set so in any other page
in the website let's go ahead and get
rid of this we can and we'll write to
the document the length or you can
console dot log this or alert it
whatever you want to do I'm just going
to write it to the document just for
testing purposes so we're going to check
the local storage dot length and we
should get three because we're setting
three items into local storage so let's
go check in our favorite browser go to
other page and we get a big fat three
now what does that mean that means you
can loop over the local storage in a for
loop to access all of the items within
it even if you don't know what those
items are prior to running the loop you
can access all the items within a local
storage object just by running a loop
over and once you get comfortable with
the the other methods that we're going
to demonstrate it'll be simple for you
to do that here let's go to let's grab
this let's put it in this other document
right here and you'll see that the it
should be either undefined or zero
because we cleared out the local storage
so we won't get a length let's see if
that works yeah we get a 0 because there
is no items in the local storage because
we went ahead and
clear them in this document now when
these things get put into the local
storage object as a list of items
they're going to be alphabetical meaning
that this one should be the first item
which will have an index of zero this
one will be the second item having an
index of one and this will be the third
item having an index of two in the list
and I think they they are ordered
automatically in the local storage
object according to their place in the
alphabet so this one looks like it will
be first in the list this one second in
this one third so now I'll show you what
the key method does in other page dot
HTML or you can do it in some page that
HTML whatever you want you can access
the local storage object and run the key
method on it and we're going to get the
what the key method does is returns to
you the name of the key for that item it
doesn't give you the value for that item
it gives you the name of the key it
returns the name of the key so in this
case we should get color so let's go
ahead and run some page in our favorite
browser and we go to other page and we
see the key name of color now if we
change this to a 1 we should see the key
name of country so if we go back to that
page and refresh see the key name of
country is written and if we make this a
2 we'll see the key name of user name
when we refresh this page so that's all
the key method does is it returns the
name the name part of the key and not
its value now we'll show you how to use
the get item method so for the local
storage object you can run the get item
method and you just put the name of the
key that you want to get the value for
so get item returns the actual value for
whatever key name that you put here so
we should get George written so let's
run some page go to other page and we
see George is written you can also
actually
use that in conjunction if you ever need
to use that in conjunction with the key
method so we'll type in local storage
key and we'll target whatever element in
the list that we want so if I want to
target the first element since they're
ordered alphabetically I'll target color
first and that will be a zero so I'll
put a zero here and this will actually
give me the value of the the the key of
color so it'll give me blue now that I'm
using these methods in conjunction with
one another and go to the page and
refresh and I get blue it's because I
used the name of the key here and I'm
using get item method so that's the way
you can do things more dynamically
inside of your loops if you have a need
to okay now I have my other page that
HTML set up like this to just render the
username and the country from the local
storage so if we take a look at how that
works we go to other page and we get
Gorge USA that's great now let's say we
want to destroy just one of the items in
local storage I'm going to set out to
destroy this country item that's in
local storage so for that I'm going to
use the remove item method so I'll just
go here into my script and before these
things get written to the page I'm going
to type in local storage dot remove item
open closed parenthesis and I want to
use I want to destroy or remove the
country item from the local storage list
now when this script runs the local
storage country item is going to be
removed so we should only have access to
one of those items now let's go ahead
and refresh or navigate and we get
George is still in place but we get a
null returned for the country and let's
also go ahead and output the length so
let's just type in the length property
here and refresh and you see we only
have two items in storage in local
storage because the country was removed
the country item so you see we
established three items and then we were
able to
destroy or remove just one of those
items in the list using the remove item
method and that's all of the properties
and methods that are involved with the
local storage and session storage
objects so you'll be working with local
storage when you want things to be
remembered longer or more persistently
like when the user closes their browser
down or in other tabs on your website
and then you use session storage when
you want it to be a more short-lived
memory for just one browsing session
then when the user shuts their browser
down the session storage is
automatically destroyed and also session
session storage data cannot be accessed
in multiple browsing tabs there's a good
chance in the future that will be making
tutorials that apply web storage to them
and now we won't have to go so far in
depth to make sure everybody understands
web storage when we do apply a few lines
of code for it in our future tutorials
whenever you guys see local storage dot
whatever or session storage storage dot
whatever you'll understand that we're
working with storage interface in
JavaScript and you'll know all of the
properties and methods that you can
apply to that kind of code okie dokie
