you wanted to see how to animate the
floating element shadow effect that we
made in the last video I am more than
happy to accommodate that request I
almost created my genes when you guys
asked me to do that oh my god okay this
is the finished product of the animation
that you'll be learning how to program
today and keep in mind that it'll be a
little bit smoother and cleaner on your
website and your local machine when you
test it might only appear choppy because
of my videos low frame rate but trust me
when you run it on your machine you'll
see it's smooth as glass
buttery now just so everyone can see the
simplicity of the css3 animation
programming workflow we're going to
place our still elements on the page
first like normal like we would normally
put anything on a web page then we'll
set about animating them okay first
let's discuss what we're starting out
with here we're starting out with
basically what we ended off with in the
last video when we created the shadow
effect under the element on our page
that we wanted to so let's go ahead and
take a look at what we have so I have my
head floating in the page there and
really to make it appear floating I've
placed an oval shadow effect under it
you can see that nothing's animated yet
and everything is just sitting there
still this is how you would normally put
things on a web page so you can see I
have my container
I call it bot container and inside I
have the bot div and the bot shadow div
the bot div is the one where my head is
now let's take a look at the CSS for
that and we have the bot container I'll
show you a border on this container and
you can see what it looks like let's
make it red one pixel and dashed let me
render that in browser so you can see
the border around that element it has to
85 with 420 height margin of 0 pixel
Auto to Center it in the browser window
that's zero pixels top and bottom margin
and Auto for the left and right margins
that's how it centers and you can see
that I just put that border around it so
I'm gonna take that border back off I
just wanted you guys to see the
exact location of that div now this time
we're having the the bot instead of
having the video like we had in the last
code we had an iframe an actual YouTube
video here and we were placing a shadow
under it but this time we're just going
to put a div here and we're going to
make this background image equal to my
big face you can put anything you want
there and I just named it bot so you can
throw anything that you want in that
place so just keep in mind that this
element can be anything you want it
could be a video as long as you put your
iframe inside of this div your video
will float on the page and then just
remove the background property but I
have a background property because I
want to float an image around and I
could actually stick an image tag within
this div and have the same effect if I
put the atom dot PNG image tag right in
this div but you can just use a
background image for the div itself and
that will put the image there so I made
the div have the same dimensions as my
image and I set its top property to zero
pixels and I made sure to give it a
position of relative for animating
purposes so I give it a position of
relative or absolute when I want to
animate something okay so it's pretty
important to keep in mind that you might
see that your animations don't work if
your elements in some cases if your
elements aren't relative or absolutely
positioned so make sure you set your
positioning to relative or absolute for
any elements that you want to animate so
I'm going to animate this bot and the
bot shadow you can see both of them are
set to position relative
now the bot shadow is set up the same
way we set it up in the last video
except that now I added opacity to make
it really transparent when the animation
begins and I'm going to darken it up as
the animation proceeds I'm also going to
make it wider so that's why I set the
margin space so I set the margin space
everything to zero because I'm going to
shrink it and expand it as the animation
runs and then the top property for that
is 100 pixels and since it's relative
positioning that means it's going to be
100 pixels under the bot that's where
it's going to start and all of that
gives you this okay
now let's set out animating it and we're
going to use keyframe animations if you
guys go to develop PHP comm you'll see
in the CSS library that I have css3
property references you can find out all
about the keyframe animations if you
want to learn more in depth about how to
program keyframe animations and also
transition animations and now I've been
doing a lot of videos about how to
trigger all these animations using
JavaScript and stuff like that but this
one we're not going to use any
JavaScript and all you have to do is
create an infinite animation a keyframe
animation that runs infinitely so when
you have animations that you just want
to run on their own you can use keyframe
animations and when you want animations
that are user initiated user interactive
that's when you use transitions and you
trigger those css3 transitions using
JavaScript so that's how it all works
but since we're just going to have an
animation that's not user initiated it's
just going to be running on its own I'm
going to use keyframe animation and I'm
using keyframe animation also because
it's going to be an infinite loop it's
just going to keep running the animation
all right so I'm going to add the
keyframe animations for making the BOK
float and I'm using the WebKit prefix
towards the end of the video I'm going
to talk to you guys about how to make it
run in all browsers and not just
webkit-based browsers in the future we
can remove all prefixes and just run
keyframes like that without any prefixes
but for now we have to use prefixes and
it's not so difficult I'll show you how
simple it is to add prefixes to make it
run in all the browsers now what we're
doing here is we're setting a keyframe
animation called bot float and you can
name that whatever you want and this
animation only has two keyframes and I
set it to 50% and 100% and if you go
check out the information at develop PHP
you can see that you can use to and from
instead of these numbers here so you can
use to and from if you're only going to
have two keyframes in your animation or
you can use 50% 100% and that will allow
you to have to and from animation logic
so you're an
maiding to top 100 pixels from top
so basically this animation is set up to
animate that that bot from its top
position 0 where it starts to top
position 100 and then back and that's
all it does so now in order to tie this
keyframe animation that you set up to
this element here we just put reference
to it in the element as WebKit animation
so we're using the animation property
and like I said in the future we can
remove all prefixes and we'll just have
it like that but for now we'll use the
prefix the animation property is set as
such we specify bot float animation
which is our keyframe animation here so
we specify that to run and we're going
to use YZ instead of linear you can have
linear here you can have ease in ease
out ease in out or just ease and I
thought in this case it would be best to
use ease the animation is going to take
place over two seconds infinitely so
this is like your speed two seconds and
it's going to loop it's going to be
infinite the animation will run
infinitely and you can set a number here
if you want so if I put two right here
well let me put three right there you'll
see that the head goes up and down one
two three and then it stops but I want
it to be infinite now if I run this in
my browser it'll just keep going and
going and going it will never stop now
what if I wanted to have ten keyframes
in here I could just put 10% 20% 30% 40%
all the way to a hundred percent and
that will give me ten keyframes and I
can move that element around on the page
anywhere I want in any directions okay
let's take a quick look at this again
now to make this look a little more
realistic we're going to take the oval
or the elliptic shadow effect that we
made in the last video that was just a
still shadow I'm going to animate to
correspond with this head that's bobbing
up and down on the page so under the
shadow div I'm going to put another rule
that is the keyframe animations
foreshadow react so we have another
keyframe animation setup here and it
also has two keyframes now let's go
ahead and tie that keyframe animation to
that element bot shadow so you can see
we're tying shadow react to this element
and shadow react is our keyframe
animation that we established here we're
setting that two E's two seconds
infinite as well and what we're doing
inside of that animation is we're taking
it from its normal margin space of zero
pixels and we're changing that two
margin space of 20% so basically it'll
take it from being wide to being a more
narrow shadow a smaller little ellipse
because it's pushing in the margin space
left and right so margin property works
like this you have top right bottom left
so right and left you can see are both
set to 20% and the opacity is going to
rise so we can make the opacity 0.7 that
way the little shadow gets darker when
the when the big head gets closer to the
ground and that's why in the div when it
starts out for bot shadow we have it set
to a point one opacity so it's barely
just visible and then when the animation
begins we're going to make it go from
barely just visible to more visible and
darker so the other side of your
animation the second keyframe brings it
back to its normal state so you're
pretty much going from its normal state
to whatever state that you want to make
it go to in the animation so let's check
out what we have now you see now we have
a little bit more realistic effect to
that shadow that's under our floating
element and that's the kind of logic
that you would want if there was
lighting coming from above so say this
was a sunny day or whatever or there was
lighting above this head this little
circle down here would get darker as the
head approaches the base or the floor
and as the head rises up into the sky
this shadow would get
Lichter it would start to fade out and
it would get much wider now let's talk
about these stupid prefixes now in the
future like I said you'll be able to run
these animations like this without these
WebKit prefix here and here it'll look
just like that and it'll work in all
browsers software in all environments
but for now we have to use the prefix
let me just show you what I mean let's
go and preview this in Firefox I've been
using Chrome to preview my work you can
see in Firefox I get no animation I just
get the still elements all I have to do
is change WebKit to moze and you'll see
that that works in Firefox but you
really want to have all of them there
you don't really want to just replace
them
now let me file preview in Firefox
you'll see now my animation runs in
Firefox but it's not going to run in
Chrome let me run it in chrome now now
it's not running in chrome because I
remove the WebKit prefix now what if I
change this Mo's to ms let's change Mo's
to ms ms ms now let's run this in
internet explorer so you can see we get
the animation that we want in internet
explorer as well as long as we use that
ms prefix but now if we file preview in
Firefox it's not going to be working
anymore because we remove the moles
prefix so what do you do add all three
and then after that you add the
standardized syntax and I'll show you
what that looks like right now okay so
you can see for each element that I want
to animate I just have to specify the
animation that I want to run the
keyframe animation I specify using
prefix WebKit Mose MS and then the
standardized syntax under those and the
same for the actual keyframe animation
itself you have to set the WebKit Mose
MS and then the keyframes syntax
standardized format after that and I did
the same for the bachata I added the
prefixes
so basically you can develop in whatever
browser you like whatever is your
favorite if you like working in Firefox
best you can create your animations and
develop and everything using the molds
prefix and when you get done you're
ready to release it to the public just
add the WebKit MS and other prefixes
just make sure you put the standardized
syntax in the bottom because in the
future that's what's going to be used so
let's file preview in browser Chrome
make sure we save it yes okay we have
animation preview and browser Firefox
looking good preview in browser Internet
Explorer it looks good in IE and let's
also preview it in Safari and I'm not
going to add the Opera prefix because
Opera is a little buggy I don't like the
Opera browser anyway I hope it dies
there's enough browsers that we have to
mess with and this should also work on
mobile device browsers for Apple devices
and Android devices let's take one more
look at the finished product alright I
hope you guys have enjoyed this css3
keyframes animation programming lesson
and remember keyframe animations you
don't have to have just two keyframes in
your animations you can have ten
keyframes if you want 20 keyframes to
wear this head could start over here on
the page and smoothly animate over here
and then animate down to this corner
then to this corner and then back to its
original spot as long as you set up four
keyframes you get it the first keyframe
will bring it from here to here second
keyframe brings it here to here the
third key frame brings it from here to
here and then the fourth keyframe brings
it from here back to its original
position and you can loop that
infinitely infinite loop or you can just
run it one two times where however many
times you watch remember you can check
the information for animation and
keyframe property animations and all
that stuff at css3 information at the
develop PHP library and I have a lot of
example
there and also have examples for the
transition property programming and
remember keyframe animations and
transition animations in css3 are two
different things you use keyframe
animations when you want animations to
run on their own and when you want user
initiated animations you can use
transition property instead of animation
property and you trigger your transition
property using JavaScript so you
basically just use JavaScript as the
trigger mechanism to make css3
transitions run when you want it to be
user interactive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
