of designing and programming custom
search fields and custom form components
now remember you guys can customize most
any form element in HTML for any type of
form that you're building in this lesson
we just happen to be making a custom
search form field and button now in
order to prove that our secondary images
are all being pre-loaded before the user
interacts with the elements I've placed
the finished application online so we
can sense how it will act for a user
that comes to your page for the first
time ever so we can sense the
pre-loading of it so here I am in Google
Chrome and you can do this in any
browser to test you go and clear your
empty your cache and clear your browsing
history and all that crap and then you
go to where your application is online
to test it out now here's mine and if
things were not pre-loaded correctly
when I put my mouse inside of this field
and click that field should disappear
for a split second while the other one
has to load into the browser and if I
roll my mouse over this button right now
it would disappear and glitch for a
quick second before the other overstate
of that button was to come into play so
let's put our mouse over that button and
see what happens if we get instant
change that means everything is
pre-loaded correctly okay that's great
and by the way we're using CSS to
preload we're not putting anything in
the HTML or anything like that to mess
up our semantics now if we put our mouse
inside of the search field it should
instantly change that's great now let's
type into it now if we take our mouse
and we click outside of it it shouldn't
go back to the other state unless the
field is empty now watch if I empty this
field to see I'm clicking over here now
watch if I empty the field then click
over there see that's how you want it to
react so if there's something in it and
you click over here you don't want it to
go back to that other state but if it's
empty and you click over here you do now
here I am an Internet Explorer just so
you guys can get a look of what it looks
like there and make sure it all works
correctly there too okay everything's
just fine everything's pretty loaded I
click here it goes back that's great ok
now let's go into internet explorer to
the YouTube channels and see how this
thing acts let's go ahead and put a
bunch of big w's in and see
what happens when we get all the way to
the end here this is Internet Explorer
okay you see that really good you see
where all those w's are now let's go to
our internet explorer for our
application and let's test it out let's
put a bunch of w's in it should act the
same exact way all right that looks
exactly the same as YouTube's and
Internet Explorer so we can close all
tabs in Internet Explorer now let's
check in Chrome
it's going to work the same way in
fireworks and Safari and all that as it
does in Chrome so let's check it out
let's put in a bunch of Pig double use
some other letters okay
you see what it looks like because if
they empty there is out if you empty it
out and then go back you can see it
works just like ours see same thing put
in a bunch of pig double use black
pepper blah you click out here and it
doesn't go back to that original state
unless you empty it out now that we've
proven to ourselves that we do actually
have an elite search field just like
YouTube's is I mean it's not program the
same exact way and maybe not design the
same exact way but it has the same exact
look and functionality to it and that's
what we were after
now before we explain the code real well
let's take a look at our website so you
can see we have the index file which is
a home page and then the images folder
where all of those images are so as long
as you understand that structure we can
get into the code now and you'll
understand how we're referring to those
images in that image folder now since
I'm going to be explaining some code
pretty in-depth and if you happen to be
an advanced coder that really already
knows how to do all these things I don't
really even understand why you subscribe
to me why you even watching the video
please don't complain about the length
of the time that I take to explain
things thank you very much now we're
starting with the bare bones of a
regular HTML file you can see we have
our doctype or HTML tag which opens and
closes here we have a body tag opens and
closes right there and the head tag
opens and closes right here and inside
the head tag we have our style tag
that's for CSS we're going to put our
CSS here and then our script tag we're
going to put our JavaScript there so
really it's just the bare bones of a web
page the first thing I'm going to do is
go into the body tag and I'm just going
to give myself a little header an h2 tag
it says custom form component
tutorial then under that I'm going to
open up a div I'm going to give it an ID
that's equal to my form container make
sure I close off that div go down a
couple of lines and put the closing tag
for that div okay now inside of that div
we're going to indent a couple of spaces
in that way we can make sure we see all
of our elements really nice and
organized and this form is going to have
an ID equal to my form and I'm giving
all of these things an ID that way I can
communicate to them with my CSS in
JavaScript
now the next attribute and the form tag
is going to be action and that can be
set to any kind of parts file you want
I'll just put parser dot PHP maybe
you're sending this search query to
search PHP or whatever search mechanism
you have set up on your site and I'm
also going to give insight into how to
ajaxify this whole thing using
JavaScript towards the end of the video
now what we want to do is put a method
of post just in case you want to use
this in a normal traditional type way
where it posts to a file called parser
dot PHP and the whole page has to
refresh and you send them to the search
page type thing so let's go down a
couple lines close off the form tag now
within the form tag we're going to have
to float but we don't have to but this
is the way I'm preferring to do it
there's a million ways to skin a cat in
web development usually and what I'm
going to do is put two divs that are
floating side-by-side so I'm going to
float them left that way the field
floats left and then the button is going
to float left right next to it
horizontally on the end of it so let's
indent a couple of lines and let's put
another div this one is going to have an
ID that's equal to search field box we
can close that go down a couple of lines
and make sure we put the closing tag for
that now let's highlight that copy it
ctrl C and then ctrl V right there to
paste it and then you're going to change
this one to say search BTN box so
there's u div for your search button and
here's a little div for your search
field we're going to float both of those
left using CSS now all we have to do is
put the input field here and then the
input button right there okay let's
start by putting in the input field now
this is an input type HTML element and
it's type at
tribute is set to text that way it's a
text field where people can type in one
line then the ID on it is set to SF and
that's how we'll communicate to it
through JavaScript and CSS the name
attribute is query and query is going to
be in the traditional form posting
scenario it's going to be the value how
you pick up the value of what the user
typed in you use the posted variable of
query to find out what they typed in in
your parser dot PHP so that's why I put
that one in there if you're going to
ajaxify the whole thing you really don't
need that one you can use just the ID
now we have two very important event
attributes for this element on focus and
on blur on focus is pretty
self-explanatory it's when the user goes
and interacts with an element when they
put their mouse in that field to put the
cursor in place and start typing that is
the on focus event when that happens the
onblur event was the event where I was
taking my mouse and putting it outside
of the field and interacting with
something else on the page to make it
where I wasn't interacting with that
field anymore that's the own blur event
so within both of those events we fire
off a JavaScript function called field
swap and I'm going to talk to you about
that function in just a second when I
put it in place so field swap gets one
argument sent to it and we have to send
what picture would image that we want to
swap the field background for on each
occasion on on blur and on focus both so
once I put the JavaScript in a second
you'll see that all come into play now
the very last line in the HTML that we
need is the image input type so we're
using an input type again in HTML which
is your normal form type element and
we're setting the type attribute for it
to image this way you can use an image
instead of a normal form button that
looks all generic you can use any image
that you like as your form processing
button so that's what we're doing we're
using an image type we're setting its
source attribute to whatever image we
want to use this is the default the SB
norm the name attribute that is also put
in place for your form processing needs
if you happen to need to access that
posted variable the ID is how we're
going to communicate to it through
JavaScript and see
ss on the page the alt attribute is
necessary for any image type element
that you're going to have on the page so
even if it's an image tag or an input
with type image you have to have an alt
attribute or else you'll have validation
markup errors then the two important
event handlers for this field is
onmouseover well it's not a field it's a
button it's all mouse over and
onmouseout of this button those are the
events that I put into place because
that's what I want to listen for I want
to listen for when the user's mouse goes
over the button and I'm listening for
when the users Mouse leaves the button
so when the mouse goes over the button I
run a JavaScript function called button
swap and then when the users mouse goes
out of the button I run button swap
again and I just feed it the correct
image that it's supposed to be swapped
for now I'll put in the CSS in the
JavaScript and you'll see how it all
ties together like that okay we're going
to start with the CSS and I'll explain
it and then we'll move along to the
JavaScript and I'll explain that too now
the CSS the first thing that's happening
is we're affecting the body tag on the
page and we're making the backgrounds
body color this value and we're setting
a margin on it just so my little fields
in this example is not all crunched up
against the edge of the page now these
next 4 1 2 3 4 5 are specific to our
search field and button and all that
stuff so what we're doing here is we're
targeting our form container which is
the div tag right here that contains
everything in the form and we're also
targeting the form itself and we're
placing in two images to preload as
backgrounds and this is a really slick
method of pre loading your images
without having to go down in the page
and put in a div set to hidden a lot of
people will put in a div set to hidden
and then they'll stack a bunch of images
in it that they want pre-loaded but
that's not always the best method a good
way to make sure your images are
pre-loaded without messing with your
HTML or your semantics of your HTML you
can just preload them through CSS is
which what I'm doing here so these
really these two CSS rules are set in
place to preload those two images the
over state of the button and the focus
state of the
field you can't see them because they're
actually hiding behind the visible
elements that the user can see so when
they're needed into the place where they
needed to go
now this next CSS rule is set up for the
SF ID so what is that that's ID of the
search field that's the actual field
they type into now what we're going to
do to that is make the background image
equal to that SF norm by default dot PNG
and in JavaScript we do the little
switch on it
by default when the page loads you want
to put that image as background into
that field and you want to make sure the
background set to no-repeat make sure it
has no border height of whatever height
your field was set to in your graphics
the width whatever width you want to set
to make it function correctly you'll
notice that my width is not the same
width as my field graphics it's a little
bit shorter you can play with these
numbers to see how it affects things the
outline we want to make sure there's
none so we don't see any outline that we
normally see around fields the
background color set is transparent in
that because we want to be able to see
through the field to the image
background that we set on it right here
so that's why we set the background
color is transparent so we see right
through the field to the imagery color
is the color of the text that the
person's using to type in mine is set to
a light gray now the padding right and
left that's pretty important because
let's see if we look at this right now
you'll notice that there's a little
padding now if we take those padding
settings away control s and run it in
the browser will notice that it's all
crunched up against the side they're
really tight and there's no padding on
this side either and you know you got to
make sure your padding set right so
everything is cool for the user so
that's why we set the padding that way
so when you run it it's off of the edge
a little bit and not so crunched up on
the side you can also pad top and bottom
to move the field cursor up and down in
there now the last little bit of CSS is
remember I was telling you we're
floating these two divs right next to
each other horizontally that's what
these are doing the search field box and
search field button those two divs are
set to float:left and you just put the
width that you want to set for those two
where everything looks right now we can
throw in the JavaScript which is just a
couple of tiny little functions just to
take a couple of seconds to
disgust all right I'm going to go ahead
and collapse this CSS that way it's not
so dominant on the page now what I'm
going to do is put in the JavaScript and
the reason why I chose to use JavaScript
is because I'm going to show you guys
also a way to ajaxify the whole thing if
you don't want to use this form in the
traditional form posting and parsing
type mechanism you want to use Ajax I'm
going to show you some insight into
doing that right after we get done
explaining these two little functions
now the first function is called field
swap and that's the one for the search
field on focus and on blur we run field
swap and we want to switch out for the
proper image on that event so what we do
is field swap is set up to bring in one
argument which is the image that it's
fed down here when the function is being
told to run we can pick up that image
variable right there so we can use that
within our function to represent that
image this first line pretty much just
targets that search field that way we
don't have to write document get element
by ID
every time we want to target it within
our function so then we can just target
the variables of sf' because SF
represents document dot get element by
ID SF all right and we need an if
condition here because if you didn't
have this if condition here what would
happen is if somebody typed into that
field and then they own blur outside of
it what's going to happen is your
original image is going to go back into
place and the text is going to be on top
of it it'll look funny so you want to
put an if condition here to say if the
value of that field is equal to empty
then and only then do you want to switch
swap the field back but if it's not
empty you want to leave it alone because
they have text in it so you don't want
to be swapping the imagery while they
have any text in it if they empty it out
then they aren't blur then this will run
and it'll switch the image same thing
for function button swap but there's no
condition needed in there because yet
that's just on roll over and on roll out
or onmouseover and onmouseout that's
when button swap function runs same
thing we're grabbing the image variable
that's being sent in now it's not even
really necessary because there's only
two lines in here but a lot of people
like to set up variables for their
elements when they start talking to them
to JavaScript so we take that element
search button and we change it
dot source to equal whatever image we're
commanding it to be so on mouse-over
we're going to button swap for SB over
dot b and g so what happens is we say SB
that source attribute which is this
attribute right there you can change all
of these attributes at any time you want
in mid flow of your application so
that's what we're doing we're targeting
the search button we're changing the
source attribute on it to be a different
image than the one that is in by default
it's all very simple all right let me
collapse that get those out of the way
now if I wanted to ajaxify this thing I
can just put Ajax function here if we go
to develop PHP calm in the video
tutorial section for JavaScript you'll
see ajax post to PHP file xml
httprequest object that's JavaScript way
of Ajax Inge that's what Ajax is so I'm
going to grab that function right here
in the example and if you really want to
understand ajax watch this video
tutorial because i explain every little
bit of this code line by line so i'm
going to go back to my page and right
here where it says Ajax function here
pop I put the Ajax function in right let
me just go ahead and collapse that up so
you don't get confused
there's my Ajax post function now I'll
go back to develop PHP and I'll notice I
need an on click event to fire that
function off so I'll just grab that on
click event for that little button down
there and I'm going to put it on this
button here so now this button has an on
mouse-over onmouseout and an on click
event so all you have to do is really
you don't need this form tag anymore if
you were going to ajaxify everything but
you have to remember our form tag is
serving as pre loading for some CSS
image rollovers but I'm just saying if
you were to ajaxify this thing in this
way on click on this button you wouldn't
need this to have a form opening and
closing tag at all you wouldn't need the
parse to parse with dot PHP and refresh
the whole page you can ajaxify the whole
thing to partial PHP and the page will
never refresh and all your data from the
search would come right in
basically if you go to youtube right now
and you look at that one let me search
here and see what happens I think this
one is a JAXA fide syphon flash tutorial
no actually their whole page refreshed I
believe yeah it sure did so yeah the
whole page refreshed so they're not even
a JAXA firing this thing yet if they
were Facebook they would because
Facebook loves to JavaScript and Ajax if
I everything all I'm saying is if you
wanted to make it to where it doesn't
refresh the page at all and it brings
data straight into that little area
where you want it to display for your
search results you can ajaxify this
whole thing using that function Ajax
post and to really learn about how to
use it correctly you can just check out
this video tutorial right here okay so
let me remove this Ajax post function
because in my example I'm not going to
have that I was just letting you guys
know in the video as an extra tip and
there's my whole script I got some CSS I
got some JavaScript and I got some HTML
keep in mind this a few different ways
you can build an application like this
that it's going to work exactly the way
you want it to work I just chose to use
javascript that way I could you know
show a few more little tricks on how to
target your HTML element attributes and
work with their event handling through
JavaScript okay and that's everything my
friends we test it in Google Chrome and
if it works in Google Chrome it's more
than likely going to be exactly the same
in Firefox and Safari and all those
other guys and we tested an Internet
Explorer which is a big problem browser
so we made sure it worked in that one
everything preload is great it works
pretty much just like the one at YouTube
so we did successfully create an elite
search field in HTML it works just like
the ones at the big boy sites and many
might not be programmed the same way and
it might not even be designed the same
way but we got the same app we have the
same finished product no matter what
road we took to get there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
