gonna do is make a contact page and on
that page we're going to put a form and
when the user puts in their name email
in the message we're gonna make that
form send to your email inbox
now as to not waste too much of my and
your precious time our precious time I'm
going to show you the code at develop
PHP in an article that I'm just gonna
temporarily put the code there actually
I'll just leave it there for anybody who
sees this tutorial on down the line
okay I transferred that file onto my
live server
IFT peed it up and now I'm going to
press send now without trying without
putting anything in I'm gonna press send
now see what happens you see the way we
program the form nothing's gonna happen
and the user whoever's using the form is
you know they're gonna know why nothing
happened because they didn't put nothin
in there being wise guys so you don't
want nothing to happen but if I happen
to put a name in like my name say my
name is John and then I press send now
it says the form is incomplete please
fill in all the fields and this can be
styled up any way you want big bold and
red and a div tag in a span or whatever
you want you can make it output at
certain places in the form field if you
program your form really smart all right
so now let's put in an email address my
email at my site comm whatever whoever
is contacting you this person's name is
John he put in his email and now he's
gonna put in his message hi I would like
to find a web designer said now and
there you go beautiful
Thanks your message has been sent fields
have been cleared everything's cool you
press send now nothing happened it's
great now let's check our email let's
open our email checking application
however you check your email and see if
we got anything her
all right look at that hi I would like
to find a web designer John and there's
John's email so you'll see it works it
works
pretty nice like I said you want to make
sure you put in a few more security
measures maybe you want to put in
CAPTCHA an email validation if your site
gets a good amount of traffic and you're
worried about spam bots posting your
forum you want to put CAPTCHA and maybe
email validation okay but other than
that this is a good way to do inline or
internal parsing mechanisms for PHP
forms sending you email or you can send
it to a database instead of doing this
mail function you just query your
database and send all the data to the
user put it in to a database okay so you
might want to get your hands on the
actual working code so here is the URL
where you can go and get that you'll see
that right there that's the URL you want
to type in right there you go to that
URL you'll see it's titled for part 9 of
dreamweaver series and down in the page
you'll see I wrote you can just take all
of this you just read this right here
but basically you can take all of this
the whole thing all that code and put it
into your a blank Dreamweaver file name
it whatever you want go to it on your
server test it out it works nice for you
integrate it into your design as a
contact page as I showed in the video ok
so we'll see you in part 10 which will
just leave up bonier what part 10 is
gonna be about and since people are
requesting so many different things a
wide variety of different types of
things I'm not really going to listen to
what you guys asked for me to show I
know that sounds mean but it's not fair
if I do one thing that somebody says and
then everybody else's requests go
unanswered so
I'm not going to answer anybody's
request i prepared everybody sk-ii
