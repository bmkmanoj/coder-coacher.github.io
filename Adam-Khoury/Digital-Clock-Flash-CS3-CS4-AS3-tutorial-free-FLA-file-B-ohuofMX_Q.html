lesson will be demonstrating how you can
create your own cool custom digital
clock for flash and let me publish it
out so you can get a look at it first
and that's it working as an SWF and it
looks pretty good to me so well shut
that and take a look at the fla now now
in the on stage you can see we have a
layer here that's clock background and
that's a little movie clip that's just
cosmetics and I set it to have a drop
shadow just to make it look like it's
sticking out a little bit and our text
fields are right above it in a layer
sitting on stage there and this one
renders ampm this one render seconds
this one renders minutes and this one
renders the hours it's that simple and I
made two frames because we wanted to
loop we're set to 12 frames per second
so every second we're going to this
thing is running 12 frames every second
so that's more than enough you can have
this set to eight you can have this set
to 32 and it would still do the same
exact thing and that's the reason why I
have two frames there so the file loops
on itself and ideally you would want to
have this thing maybe in its own movie
clip inside of your application that way
you're not you're not interfering with
any other timelines and you can copy and
paste it into your applications more
easily from one to another and things
like that so I recommend you put this
into its own movie clip even though you
see mine is on the main timeline here
that would be bad juju I think so just
have yours make sure it's it's in its
own movie clip and you're setting up a
timeline in its own movie clip it's
separated from the rest of your file
okay let's take a look at the code now
the first line packs the date object
into a variable name now these three
lines take the now variable and it gets
the hours gets the minutes and it gets
two seconds and we
pack them into their own variable names
here that we can use more easily down in
our conditionals now this first
conditional it sets the am or PM dynamic
text field to render correctly according
to military time so I'm saying if the
hours are less than or greater than or
equal to 12 then we know it's p.m. else
we know it's am so that's what we render
and you can see right here ampm text it
throws it right into the dynamic text
field on stage according to which
conditional is correct now this next
conditional is converting the military
time the hours of the hour segments of
the time display it's all in military
time if you don't convert it so we
converted here saying if hours are
greater than 12 then hours equals say
it's 13 or 14 here minus 12 so that'll
make it say one or two if that makes any
sense to you you're saying so let's say
the hour happens to be 14 military time
so we're saying hours equals 14-12
essentially giving us two and that's
what we want this next one just make
sure that if time happens to be 00 that
it says 12 because we know that 00 means
12 ok the next conditional is the one
that adds 20 to the front of any hour
less than 12 so if you're our just
variable happens to equal 8 it'll this
conditional will pack a 0 in front of
the eight making it the correct display
for like a digital clock like you'd buy
at Walmart we don't want it just to say
eight we wanted to say 08 if it's 10 it
doesn't do anything at all it just
renders out the 10 it won't add a zero
in front of the 10 making it 0 1 0
because that would be retarded okay in
this next conditional if the minutes is
the same thing as the hours if the
minute sir
less than 10 then we pack a zero in
front of it with the same kind of logic
and this next one does the seconds and
you can see in each one of the
conditionals is where the text is
actually rendered it's in the text field
on stage here that's when it's actually
put in that text field is in the
conditionals themselves so that's pretty
much how it works it's pretty simple
straightforward maybe it might take you
listening to me ramble on about what the
code does just a couple times to really
grasp it but I think the first time you
go through it without me even explaining
it you can just go and download the fla
open it up and look at it and say oh ok
I see exactly what he did and then
you'll be good to go and knowing how
this thing works and you can build a
whole lot of cool things another thing
to note is that if you're slick you can
take all of these variables hours
minutes and seconds and just pack them
into one text field they don't have to
be one two three four different dynamic
text fields it can all be a nice
variable string a text string that that
would be rendered out nice and evenly
but it's sometimes you know it's nicer
to keep them separated so you can get
the am and PM to be a little smaller or
you can spread them out any way you want
put them anywhere you want make it look
like whatever you want so that's the
reason why I opted to do it that way but
like I said it's almost easier to have
it in one text field just render
straight out through there as long as
you know how to pack all these variables
together in a string and if you actually
if you want help doing that just coming
to the forum at develop a task and I'll
I'll pack it all into a string for you
and you can then use that code to render
out and then maybe you would really have
to rework all these conditionals to
actually make that happen so that's why
I didn't put it in here but if you know
what you're doing you could pack it all
into one string so that's how you make a
digital clock in flash cs3 all
customized nice for your applications ok
we'll see you guys next lesson
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
