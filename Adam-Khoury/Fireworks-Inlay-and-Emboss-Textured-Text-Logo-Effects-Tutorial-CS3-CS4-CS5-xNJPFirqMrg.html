product of which we'll be learning how
to create in fireworks cs3 for cs5 any
fireworks version you're in actually you
probably do this in Photoshop and GIMP
no problem as well but let's take a look
at all the examples we slap together
here for you using custom image fills a
custom image patterns as filled on our
text to create some cool designs when it
comes to logo creation or special text
creation alright first thing is to open
up whatever image you want to use I'm
going to use a stone surface and if
you're going to use stone it's probably
best to have something that has a lot of
detail in it and if you can find
something with nice cracks in it that
helps as well you can get texture maps
like this from stock image facilities
online or you can just go up to a wall
and snap in and rub it with your digital
camera now with that in place I'm going
to write some text right f/w which is
short for fireworks sto and E stone
let's see 220 let's make this one a
little bigger actually let me change the
text first just find a font that you
like I'm going to use this with this
example I have I'm not even sure how you
say that plan Ted Ginn it plantagenet
Cherokee it looks like I can make this a
little bit larger which I'm going to do
let's make that about 220 there we go
I'm going to adjust the height
difference between the lines right about
there
I don't want that fireworks were too big
so I'm going to make that about 160
oh here we go okay now the idea is to
get this same picture the same texture
as the fill for this text now to do that
you just go down here to the color for
that text instead of changing the color
you go down to the fill options change
that from solid to pattern and there's a
whole bunch of default patterns that
come with fireworks but we're going to
go to other so you go all the way down
to the bottom if there's a little arrow
there you click the arrow till it gets
all the way to the bottom of the list
you'll see the word other click that
let's grab that stone surface the same
picture now here's where the magic
happens with the text highlighted you
can move the texture that's on the text
or the pattern and you can see watch
when I get down to the corner things
start to synchronize up and it becomes a
little chameleon text and it blends
right in like it was the predator now I
want to try and do is get a little dot
at the very corner and it looks like I
just about got it let's go down one more
right there so you can zoom in by
pressing control mouse wheel zoom out in
and out control mouse wheel so if you
have to zoom in like I did get it
directly in the corner do that all right
now so now the text is there and if I
fade this out let's go to the opacity on
this background highlight just the
background go to the opacity bring it
down you can see that your text is there
but it has the same exact pattern as the
background and it's all in the same
pixel location so it blends right in now
we're just going to quickly and simply
add a few filter effects to create depth
perception and make it look like it's
chiseled or laser cut into the stone
okay with our little chameleon text
highlighted let's go down to the filter
effects and add first one will be adjust
color brightness and contrast
now you can play with the brightness and
contrast to make it lighter darker
however you like it in this case we're
going to make it darker so right about
there is good that's okay this text that
has the pattern which is the stone
surface is now just a little bit the
patterns just a little bit darker but it
hasn't lost any of its detail or
anything now we're going to go and give
it another effect of glow so you go to
shadow and glow give it a glow change
the red to white bring it all the way
down to zero here bring it in a little
bit on the fade of it we don't want it
so bright see if you had it all the way
up to 100 you see it give it a nice
bright glow but you don't want it like
that you want it very subtle
right about there that looks good to me
now click it again make sure the text is
highlighted let's add another effect
this one's going to be shadow and glow
inner shadow so you can see right when I
added that one that one adds the the
magic that is the depth perception of
the whole thing and since we added the
glow around it it gives our edges a
refined look that we want so you can see
if you focus your eye on the center of
that oh there it looks like it's in its
own little rock island standing above
everything else that's dug out down
there same thing with the e so that's
the effect you're going for you want to
look like it's sunk in there and you can
play with the depth but I wouldn't go
too far because then it'll look a little
a little phony ish so about six or seven
is good now let's grab this text ctrl C
let's go to file new let's make it a
little bit bigger than that that way we
have room to play let's make it a
thousand by 400 press control V
and speak the background black click the
background make it like there I'm going
to make it a little bit bigger than 400
500 would be better all right now
there's the text without the matching
background what we'll do is remove the
glow and the inner shadow I'm going to
change the white now I'm going to give
this a new effect of bevel inner bevel
bring it all the way up bring that all
the way up that looks good to me let's
give the text in edge color actually
let's try it without an edge color first
once that's selected press ctrl-c and
ctrl-v
so basically what you've done is taken
that and put another copy of it right on
top of itself see but don't move it
I'm just moving it for demonstration
purposes I'm putting it back right now
by pressing ctrl Z now it's sitting
right on top I'm just going to press my
arrow key up on my keyboard up once and
then right arrow key once I'm going to
do the same thing with the the one
that's on top control-c control-v the
new copy that I just pasted it up once
over once do it again ctrl-c ctrl-v up
once over once control-c control-v up
once over once then you can grab a whole
bunch of them if you want at that point
ctrl-c ctrl-v and move them where they
need to go to where it gives it a 3d
look because that's what we're setting
out to do here alrighty so see what that
does
it almost looks like it has nice marbled
edges it's really cool you can highlight
the whole set of those press ctrl-g or
you can modify flatten the selection and
now it's just one
image flattened you can give that a nice
glow do whatever you want make it hot
just bring that down there we go
beautiful so you can see you can achieve
some really cool textured 3d inlaid
laser-cut all kind of cool-looking stuff
by using patterns custom patterns as
they fill for your text now I just
happen to have this wood and steel
surface and see what we can do with
those okay here's the wood I chose to
make it look like it was raised up
instead of inset and the steel I have to
say I like to steel the steel looks
really cool and the steel I made inset
and here's the wood all 3d out there you
can see a whole bunch of good examples
of how this can really help your design
workflow using custom image patterns on
your text or any shapes I have a
fireworks tutorial that I put out about
a year ago to talks about putting these
custom patterns on shapes so it doesn't
have to be just text it can be you
whipping out the pen tool doing
something funky like this and that shape
see it already has the stone on it all
I'd have to do is put that in the corner
it's going to sink right up soon soon
soon soon alrighty
hope you've enjoyed this lesson in
fireworks and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
