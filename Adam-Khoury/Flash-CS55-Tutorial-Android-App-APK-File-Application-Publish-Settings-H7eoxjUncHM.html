video handbook in the last lesson of
this series we learned how to create a
simple hello world Android app apk file
that is market ready by using Eclipse
and Java now we're going to demonstrate
a similar process using ActionScript 3.0
in flash cs5 point 5 which is the newest
version of flash authoring to enter the
market currently flash cs5 point 5 is
the only flash authoring tool that has
native built-in Android app packaging
abilities without the need for an
extension or anything extra now wait
till you guys see how easy this is in
regards to what we did in the last video
tutorial to render the words hello world
into our Android application now when
flash cs5 point 5 in the create new menu
listing here you have air for Android so
let's click that one now let's go to
file save as so now let's save this file
into a new folder let's call it hello
world
apk flash and double click inside of it
and it's named this Fla hello world on
the score Fla hello world underscore Fla
save now let's drag a text field to the
stage or you can choose to do this
programmatically through a code by
creating a new text field object and
using add child to apply it to the stage
so you can do that programmatically or
you can just add to the text field if
it's just going to be cosmetic things
and nothing dynamic you can just simply
grab the text tool grab the shapes tool
whatever you want and if you need some
tutorials for how to work in the flash
authoring tool or how to work with
actionscript 3.0 programming you can go
to develop PHP comm where there's all
kind of great tutorials with stuff like
that in the video tutorial especially
the video tutorial section for flash
ActionScript 3 is really hot there's a
lot of stuff in there at anytime while
working on your flash Android
application you can press control enter
to test it out to see how it will work
and look for the user but if you want to
test it in an android emulator or really
if you want to emulate it it's best to
load it onto your phone
your device it's really just best to
have a device for testing or you can use
the emulator that's within the Android
SDK that we got from the last video
tutorial because that one has a built in
emulator and you can also emulate your
flash files through that one but it's a
little bit tricky now let's get right to
the important stuff let's go over here
to the properties menu of our file where
it says player
it says err for Android the script is
action 3.0 only for air for Android now
let's click edit application settings
here now here is where you set up for
deployment and permissions and
everything to do with the packaged file
which is going to be the apk file which
is what we rendered out in the last
video when we used Eclipse and Java to
do the same thing with help from the
Android SDK so the output file will be
hello world dot apk the application name
is hello world let's put a capital H on
that now my app ID we know it has to be
more than two or at least two
identifiers so I'm going to put err Adam
Cory hello world the version I'm going
to leave it as it is
aspect ratio I'm going to put to auto
auto orientation I'm going to tick that
box and render mode I'm also going to
put the auto that way the hardware
device can choose if capable the GPU
will handle rendering if not the CPU
will now let's move on over to the
deployment tab since I don't have a
certificate made I can create my own
self signed certificate so you go to
create publish a name is Adam Cory
organization Union I'm just going to put
undefined because I don't want to list
anything for organization country is us
password I can make whatever I want and
make sure you write your password down
so you don't forget it
I'm going to make sure I put that in
right okay type I'm going to leave as it
is delivery period I'm going to leave
that as it is 25 years I'm gonna save
this file into that new folder
on my desktop with the Fla and it's
going to be a dot p12 file which is a
personal information type file it's a
certificate for personal information so
hello world dot p12 save now I can just
press ok and that file will be created
self signed certificate has been created
ok now here in the deployment section
the certificate there is put in place
you can see it hello world peace well
password put in place let's remember the
password for this session I'm going to
select device release because that is
the deployment type that you would
select when you're uploading your app to
the market when you're finally done when
you're debugging and testing you might
want to use debug mode and emulated
release mode so now I'm going to go to
icons and you can see that this is where
you would set up your icons for the
application and on the permissions tab
you have to click internet or you'll get
a little error when you try to publish
so you make sure you tick that Internet
box and take a good look at all of these
because these are the things that you
would need access to depending on the
application you're building maybe your
application has to access the user's
camera on their phone or their device or
record some kind of audio
and access their location or whatever
but in order to publish without getting
any errors we have to tick Internet
there now you're ready to publish and
get your apk file the one that is the
file that you put up at the market you
upload that to the market through your
developer account
let's press publish so now it's
publishing let's press ok let's minimize
this let's go into that new folder here
hello world
apk flash and what do you know we have a
hello world that apk file so mission
success with flash cs5 point 5 in
creating a dot apk file and using
eclipse in Java in the last one we have
a hello world apk file that we were able
to render we were able to render this
apk file using eclipse in Java
and now we were able to render this apk
file using flash and ActionScript 3
now like I said if you guys want some
flash actionscript 3.0 know-how and good
video tutorials you can go to develop
PHP calm which if you don't know yet is
my site where I catalog and I index all
of my tutorial material and I also write
programming courses and there's a few
other things there right here in the
video tutorial section flash
ActionScript 3 this is just gobs of
information especially information on
working with PHP and MySQL and XML and
all kind of good stuff
there's also an actionscript 3.0
programming course if you're very new to
actionscript 3.0 you might want to go
through that but after we show how to
upload apps to the android market after
we're finished creating them and
everything is polished up nice and we
have to make sure that people can
download them from the App Market when
they go online to the marketplace we've
got to make sure ours is listed in those
lists and it's searchable and everything
we will then at that point discuss
making more complex apps that might be
worth something to a mobile user the
traffic alone from a free app that gets
popular can make anybody happy in the
pockets and you can also create apps
that people have to buy for a few bucks
making you real big money honey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
