here and I'm gonna be showing you how
easy it is to put together your own
computer from scratch and I bought all
custom components because I would rather
know what goes inside of my computer and
I spent maybe I think it was eleven
hundred dollars on everything and this
is the case I got so up in this top box
here there's the the PSU the motherboard
the CPU the water cooling unit the
everything that goes inside the case the
case I got is the Cooler Master HAF 932
high airflow full tower chassis and
that's what it looks like so I'm gonna
unbox everything right now get it up
over here on the desk and then we'll
take a look at the components that we
have going into it and then I'll show
you how simple it is to put it together
and the documentation that they give you
with all of these components should help
you on your way let's unbox everything
and rock and roll
okay so now I have everything unboxed
and here you can see on my desk I've got
the tower laying on its side so I can
easily get inside and put all the pieces
in I've got it sitting on some styrofoam
there so I don't scratch my desk or ruin
the side of the the chassis you can see
this chassis is really nice it's a
really nice setup everything is pop in
and pop out everything is nice and mesh
doubt so breathable so if you're not
going to use any of these slots it still
has that nice mesh there so everything
can breathe real good it's got extra fan
space on the bottom if I need it
giant fan on the top and on the side of
the door that you can't see that would
be right here there's another same size
fan as this one on the door so here's
the door you can see it's got that nice
security style type window where you can
see through and then there's the huge
fan so that's the door now let's take a
look at the things that are going to go
inside of it and usually it will give
you all kind of little components and
things that you'll need for the case in
the case when you get it okay so first
we have the motherboard the Asus hybrid
extreme design it's the m4 a 8 9 GTD pro
so that's a motherboard for the CPU I
opted to go for and you'll notice that
all of my components here are not
high-end
they're not top of the line I always go
maybe one or two steps down from top of
the line to save money but you still
have high-end equipment that will last a
good long time through all your
computing needs ok so the processor is
the AMD Phenom 2 it's the AMD Phenom 2
Black Edition and as 2 X 4 965 and I
chose AMD over Intel just to save some
but I can overclock this bad boy if I
need and what's cool about this
motherboard is that this motherboard has
special features on it it's basically it
has a little switch that you can just
switch over and it will overclock for
you automatically so that's why I got
that motherboard it's because it's nice
and feature-rich so that's the processor
and the motherboard the RAM or the
memory modules I got are the 4 gigabytes
of ddr3 from Corsair and I've only got 4
gigabytes because I want to try this out
it's got really nice heatsink on it and
you got to make sure you have enough
room in your tower I got a nice big
Tower so I won't have any space issues
but if this memory works out real nice
I'm going to double up and I'll have 8
gigabytes but I want to see how that
memory runs first before I go ahead and
invest in another pack then we have the
power supply unit this is Diablo Tex 950
watt ATX power supply and this one was
really highly rated at tigerdirect calm
everybody gave it rave reviews and
Diablo Tech is not a company I've ever
went with before for any of my
components but since the reviews are so
nice and it was so affordable I figured
I would get it and I wanted something
near a thousand watts 950 is good for me
that's all I need I don't need too much
aha now we got some niceness here
now this is not top-of-the-line either
but it's high enough for all of my 3d
and this thing will handle it just fine
this is the Radeon HD 5770 and it's got
1 gigabytes gddr5 memory HDMI output PCI
Express 2.0 one so and I've always been
with Radeon all through my computer
builds every computer I've ever built I
use Radeon graphics processors graphics
cards ok so that's the power supply in
the graphics card then here we have
the CPU the h50 water cooling unit for
the CPU cooler and what it has is a
radiator and the module that goes onto
the CPU itself and this is my first
experience with water cooling for CPU
and that is the corsair h 50 then we
have Microsoft Windows 7 I figured I'd
go with Windows 7 because I I've always
used Windows from my operating systems
then we have a set a hard drive that is
a 1.5 terabytes
nothing real special there but it has
lots of space on it for everything I'll
need plus I already have tons of
external drives for storing files and
things like that so this will this 1.5
terabyte hard drive will just be for
installing my programs and holding the
programs that I have installed than
anything that will be on my C Drive for
holding videos and audio files and
things of that nature I just use
external drives so that is everything oh
wait no last thing is this anti-static
strip the anti-static wrist strap
bracelet and I get this and I know it's
kind of dorky to use this but I have a
lot of carpet in my home and every time
I walk around I build up static charge
through my feet and I can tell because
anytime I touch anything metal in my
house it zaps me so I'm gonna work with
the anti-static wrist strap when
building everything alright so now I'm
going to take everything out of these
boxes and we're gonna start piecing this
thing together like Lego main ok so in
this particular case I've removed the
stock fan that came in this section here
and I'm going to be putting our water
cooling system fan there and the
radiator will be sitting on top of it in
this particular case has a little guide
that tell
we're using an ATX or a micro ATX or ATX
it shows us where to mount our little
risers that will hold the motherboard up
so I'm gonna go ahead and put my risers
in place and then I'm gonna install my
motherboard okay now your motherboard
will come with something like this for
all of the components that you can
connect to you install that little plate
making sure you put it in the right
direction it just pops into place like
that you know so my particular
motherboard I had to remove if I want to
put my water cooling unit in for the CPU
I have to remove the heat sink fan
bracket and the back plate off of the
motherboard so I'm going to do that now
and I'm gonna put the water cooling
bracket and back plate on
okay so here's the back plate that I
removed that came on the motherboard and
here is see that black bracket that's
the one that came with the H 50 so I
just put that one in place now let's go
ahead and put this thing on just set it
right into place and now we'll screw in
the nine screws they're going push it up
against the edge nice and snug let's get
screw number one in place and the rest
will follow suit make sure you don't
screw those in too hard okay now with
the motherboard in place we're all ready
to unbox and get our central processing
unit into the socket now you can't go
wrong with this because there's a little
arrow on the socket and there's also a
little arrow on the processor so you can
see there's a little gold arrow at the
very top of your processor if you have
this type and there's a little arrow
here so it all lines up and there's also
little little positioning segments
inside of the socket that correspond
with those little empty spaces there in
this in the unit so let's go ahead and
grab that out
you pull the lever up move it to the
side pull it up make sure it's at a
90-degree angle there let's make sure
our arrows line up and into place it
goes
there it is now you just go ahead and
lock that back down
and your processors in place
okay now we're ready to install the H 50
bracket and get the water cooling system
on and this is the bracket I remove the
default bracket that came with the
motherboard that I removed and it has a
heatsink which is it's pretty
nice-looking actually but I'm not going
to be using this I'm going to be using
the H 50 but if you're using something
like this you'll notice that there's
thermal paste already pre applied so you
wouldn't need any thermal gel for this
type and for my age 50 I don't need any
thermal gel as well because it's pre
applied also it's all I have to do just
get the bracket for the H 50 on which is
this guy right here this is for the
AMD's all I got to do is set that into
place and we're ready to put on the H 50
water cooling unit now before I attach
the unit to the processor I have to put
this fan where I removed the stock fan
that came on the case I'm gonna put this
fan right here and then here we have the
radiator this radiator goes on top of
the fan and then there's a unit that
sits on top of the processor so this fan
is going to go here the radiator is
going to be attached to it and then the
unit gets attached to the processor it
has that thermal layer all ready to go
so you don't need paste
okay so now we have our pump that's
ready for the cooling system the
radiator and fan is all in place so now
we're gonna add the ddr3 ram into the
DIMM slots here and I'm going to use the
two blue slots I'm going to leave the
two black ones blank for when I get
another package of this so I can beef up
to eight eight eight gigabytes
now most motherboards recommend that you
put if you have two cards or if you have
two sticks to put your sticks in slot 1
and three if you have four sticks then
they just fill up all four slots and I
recommend ddr3 because it's less of a
power consumption and it gives you
better performance and the way these are
not just you can't mess up the way you
put it in because these notches here
corresponds to those notches there okay
now we're going to install the Radeon HD
5750 which is a beautiful card this is
one of my favorite components of the
whole system and for this particular
motherboard we have a couple of PCIe
slots this one on top that's white or
gray and then this blue one my radio is
gonna go in this blue slot and then the
motherboard came bundled with a VGA
switch card which is going to go into
the gray slot so I'm gonna go ahead and
put those in and then we're about ready
to get the power supply unit didn't
start connecting all of the the case and
chassis wires to the motherboard
man this thing is really pretty this is
a beautiful card do that when you're
handling these cards you want to make
sure that you don't get your fingers all
over that stuff on the bottom there so
you hold it by the edges the best you
can this thing is nice it's not
top-of-the-line radeon but it's pretty
it's a lot nicer than I what I was using
now what we're gonna do is make sure we
remove two of these slots here that are
going to correspond to where the card is
going to be plugged into that dark blue
PCI Express slot so I'm gonna pop these
out then I'm just gonna turn it the way
it needs to be turned pop it right in
and then we'll get the power supply unit
set in okay so as you can see we've got
the Radeon in place and that's pretty
much everything that's going to go into
the motherboard for right now and soon
I'm gonna take all of these wires here
that are sitting on the side here and
that's gonna connect everything that
powers the chassis to the motherboard
now before I do that I'm gonna add this
see if you can see that the Diablo Tec
950 watt power supply it's not the
biggest power supply or the most wattage
but if this one comes highly recommended
and it has great ratings and I don't
think I'll need any more than 950 watts
and this case happens to come equipped
with top or bottom mount for the power
supply so I'm going to mount the power
supply on the very bottom right under
the right the Radeon video card there
now as you can see this power supply is
not modular all the cords come attached
to it but this case is really nice in
that you can hide all of your wires in
the sides so it's a really good case for
wire management and there's also these
little velcro ties that come with it
they came with the Diablo Tec that will
help me with cord management and hiding
my wires and such but most of the wires
can go if they're not going to be used
can go hidden throughout the chassis the
back of the chassis and I wish
everything was blue but we got a little
bit of red it's like a rainbow color
inside of my machine now so we got a
little bit of red here a little bit of
blue now we got some yellow that fans
yellow and that's what it looks like but
it has really has all the power cables
that you would need for a really
high-end rig so let's set this sucker
into place
okay if you guys are curious I've been
ground of my wrists to the chassis of
the machine the metal part of the inside
of the computer of the case so now what
we're going to do is add the last
important part which is the 1.5 terabyte
SATA hard drive and this is where we'll
load our operating system and store our
files now in this case we have now in
this case we have a really nice feature
which is screwless assembly for your
hard drives and also your base any of
your babies they just pop in and pop out
so you want to take this right out
you'll just pop it in you want to make
sure you don't touch the green stuff or
the gold stuff on the back of the hard
drive or the universe will cease to
exist so now we're just going to slide
this into place and get it the right
direction
those pop into that side and then you
can just kind of bend these out of the
way and slide it on
there we go
look how easy that is no screwing no
screwing around so once that slides down
into place you just lock it back in and
then you'll have access to the power
supply for that hard drive and the cable
that communicates the hard drive to the
motherboard on the other side so it can
be accessed through the other door very
easily all right I think that is pretty
much everything that we need now the
last thing I'm going to do is get all of
these cables here that are part of the
chassis like for instance the power
button the USB fans and all kind of
other stuff that might be connected like
this fan in the front here this fan on
the side has its own little wire here
but all these various wires are for the
case all the various buttons some an
interface for a lot of different things
so what I'm gonna do is take my
motherboard manual and I'm going to make
sure that I hook all of these things to
the correct place on the motherboard not
once that's done we can then go ahead
and see if it powers up and then load
the operating system on it okay now I'm
going to add this DVD drive that way we
can load programs in the operating
system once at the machine and I'm just
going to pop it into place
which on different cases it's a little
bit different procedure this case is
really nice and lets you just pop in and
pop out with this little plastic button
there so it's a screwless assembly for
that as well so let's go ahead and get
that in okay here it is with everything
set up plugged in now all I needs to
happen is we put the power cable into
the power supply unit plug it in and see
if it fires up I'm gonna run these
cables a little more cleanly and hide
things better when I realize that
everything's working because if
something happens to not be working when
I plug it in I'll have to take things
out and test and diagnose so once
everything is working I see it powers up
fine we'll hide these cables a little
bit better but as it is you can see
that's it's decent cable management most
of the cables are hidden behind the the
back of it or the rear door let's turn
it on and see what happens okay so I
closed up the doors I booted it up to
put it up just fine so I loaded Windows
7 on to it and we're running dual
display from our Radeon HD 5770 which we
could also add another Radeon card and
run transpire but you want to make sure
you have a power supply unit that's
maybe 1,000 watts and better if you're
going to run two video cards like that
and we have an asus motherboard and the
AMD processor and the asus motherboard
that we have in here gives us an easy
ability to overclock
the graphics and the processor so even
though I didn't buy a really high-end
AMD processor or Intel processor I can
overclock this one very easily with the
flick of my wrist just switch a little
switch in there and it will overclock
that process for me and we have liquid
cooling on the processor so it'll stay
nice and cool no matter what we do so
you can see it's not very hard to build
your own custom rig with
all your own custom components and it's
actually kind of fun if you're anybody
that likes putting things together or
even taking things apart you'll have a
great time building your own computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
