comes courtesy of the creative dot is a
forum member at developed PHP he has a
thread up and it says create a detection
if user has flash player he says hi I
was wondering if this can be done in
actionscript 3 when a user does not have
flash player and enters a flash website
is there a way you can recognize this
and with the click he and she can
download the latest flash player from
the site thanks in advance and I said
you'd want to check if the user has a
flash player before you were to even run
a flash file on a page the HTML page
should do the checking need to know how
to do that and he says yeah thanks that
would be great help and so that's what
i'll show you how to do and this is
really quick and you can really thank
the adobe programming team the creators
of the program for this and so you can
go into flash actionscript 3 new violin
cs3 or cs4 i'm in cs4 and cs3 here and
i'll show you in both and it's into the
publish settings so if you'll if you're
in a new file you can go to settings and
cs3 here and there's the publish
settings and you just go to the HTML tab
and you click detect flash version and
now it will output a different kind of
HTML page for you and you'll notice that
so you have to do is click that you set
the version you want to check for and
then you press ok and usually you want
to check for the latest version and then
press ok and right now I think I need to
update mine actually we'll see ok and
then same thing for this one here see
where's the publish settings publish
settings and then HTML tab detect flash
version and oh I see it's a different
flash version that that's needed for cs3
than cs4 but that's cool then you press
ok and then once you publish this out
let's see let's save this save as save
it to the desktop
test one save in cs4 let's save this
file save as the desktop test to save
and then let's publish this by pressing
f12 and spotless just by pressing f12
okay so you see all those files well you
can't see it but they're landing on my
desktop right now and close that out we
don't need that now what I'm going to do
is just drag this over and then those
here's all those files that just got
created on my desktop and now I'm going
to go into test to edit in dreamweaver 8
or dreamweaver cs4 i have cs4 but i'm
i'm hooked on dreamweaver 8 i just i
love it I've played around a lot in cs4
and it's cool but I'm just stuck on
going to remove / 8 now let's open the
other one to minimize this get it down a
little test 2 or test one let's open
with dreamweaver 8 as well ok now you
can see here let's go ahead and close
that down you can see here this isn't
the normal file that you get you see
here the Global's major version of flash
required setting some variables for you
there you can thank the adobe team for
that makes it all automatic you don't
have to code anything would be a genius
I love it because I'm not a genius great
guys alright so in the you see how in
this if statement here an else statement
it's detecting the flash version for ya
Booya or automatic and then it gives you
content here that you can replace what
any content you want you can go get a
nice graphic or make your own nice
graphic of the adobe flash player button
link and give them a link to go and
download the adobe flash player the
newest version and then let's check out
test to what it did beautiful it's
checking for the browser and then it
also runs the check
oh man it's a lot of JavaScript in this
one see where is it flash version right
there that looks like it and that checks
for flash version as well and it should
have a output sick and output section
right there provide alternate content
for the browsers that do not support
scripting and then there's also right
here alternate HTML content should be
placed here this content requires the
adobe flash player bubble oppa and they
may even give you the link get flash see
so that's how it's done it's all
automatic you don't have to go crazy and
do a bunch of JavaScript and on't go
looking on if you working to cs3 and cs4
I just showed you how to do it in both
of them no scripting involved no genius
involved it's very easy thank the adobe
team for adding that to the
functionality of the program will see
you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
