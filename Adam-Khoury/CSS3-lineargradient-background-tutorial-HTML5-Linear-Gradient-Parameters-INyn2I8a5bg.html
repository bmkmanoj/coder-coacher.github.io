going over the various parameters for
creating linear gradient backgrounds for
any HTML elements this video will be
followed by a radial gradient
programming tutorial so don't miss the
next one if you enjoy this one okay
let's start with the bare bones of an
html5 web document mind is named teste
ml go up into the head and put in a
style element and I'll make its type
text/css make sure I go down a couple of
lines and close that style element now
the first thing I want to do is target
all native div tags that I put on this
page so just for example sake we're
going to have a whole lot of divs on
this page we're going to have different
gradients on all of them so we can
evaluate the way they look next to one
another so what we're going to do just
for example sake is just so in CSS we
just put div if you wanted to target all
paragraphs so you just put P there but
we want to target divs so we'll put div
and each one we want to float:left be a
width of 300 a height of 100 have a
margin of 4 pixels around them the color
of the text within them will be white
the font size of the text will be 30
pixels and the padding the inner padding
of each div will be 20 pixels simple
enough now I want you to go into the
body element of your webpage and place
in these nine div elements and each one
is going to have a different class from
the other you can also make these IDs if
you want but I'm just going to use class
so you can see each one has a different
class gradient 1 all the way down
through gradient 9 and the inner HTML
content just holds the number 4 which
div that is on the page now we can start
targeting all these divs by the class we
give them so let's target gradient one
will say div dot to signify that it's a
class gradient 1 open curly brace and
close curly brace and we want to target
the background property multi-pin linear
- gradient and then you open and close
parentheses and then put semicolon and
in between your parentheses is where we
put all the parameters that will render
the exact gradient that we want now in a
couple of years we'll be able to use
linear gradient without any prefixes but
for the time being since I'm testing in
Google
Chrome or if you're testing in Safari
you have to put the WebKit prefix before
your linear gradient setting and if
you're testing an internet explorer this
would be MS if you're testing in Firefox
this would be Mohs and if you're testing
an opera this would be an O since I'm
testing in chrome I'm going to use
WebKit but like I said soon in the very
near future we'll be able to use it in
all browsers without any of the prefixes
just like that for the time being when
we get done with all of these examples
we're going to add WebKit moze oh and
the MS prefixes for all of the gradients
that we create in these examples because
we want to make sure that it works if a
user comes to our site in Opera we want
to make sure that the linear gradient
works for them too so basically the
parameters you can put in a linear
gradient are the angle which is the
direction it will flow and then all of
the colors that you want and color stops
which I'll be explaining color stops in
the colors in just a moment so the first
thing we'll do is we'll just put a very
simple gradient that will go from
turquoise to black now let's render test
that HTML in our favorite browser you
see I get a gradient that goes from
turquoise to black now you can use any
kind of color values that you want you
don't have to use the direct name of
colors like I'm using here you can use
hexadecimal colors if you like so I can
change that word black to a hexadecimal
black and then if I test you'll see I
get the same results you can also use
HSL colors and RGB color values here so
you can use direct name of colors you
can use hexadecimal colors you can use
HSL colors or you can use RGB colors
whatever you prefer okay now what if I
want to add more colors let's copy this
whole rule right here and let's create
another rule under that one for the
gradient box number two and right after
the black setting we're going to add
another color magenta now let's view
that in our browser so you can see now
we have a gradient that has three colors
and let's say I wanted to add yellow
onto the end of that preview it you can
see how you can just get a whole wide
spectrum of colors all you have to do is
keep adding them in there Sep
rated by commas okay now let's take that
one that we just created that has three
colors in it now let's change that to
gradient 3 so we can affect box 3 here
on the page now we're going to introduce
color stops which will make your color
stop where you specify and you can use
either pixels or percentages so if I say
turquoise goes 30% and I'll leave the
black alone and then my magenta I want
it to go
70% so let's render that let me stretch
this out a little bit and what you can
see is that that makes the turquoise and
the magenta dominate more of the
background and you can go even so far as
to tighten those lines up all the way to
where it doesn't even look like a
gradient I'll show you what I'm talking
about by making another rule here let's
make this one gradient 4 now here if I
target black and I make it 30% what will
happen is it will meet up with this line
where turquoise stops at 30% and make a
sharp line so let's take a look at that
so you see on number 4 we have a very
sharp line there's no graduation of one
color to the next it's just a really
sharp line we can do the same where the
black meets the magenta and all you'd
have to do to make that happen is put
another black here and make it meet the
70% comma and then view that so that
shows you how to put these lines the
gradient lines anywhere you want them
and even tighten them up to where they
don't even look like they graduate from
one color to the other ok now let's talk
about direction or angle of your linear
gradient so let's highlight this rule
for gradient 4 let's make one right
under it cold gradient 5 and let's just
simplify this down to turquoise comma
black comma magenta and if we render
that we see we have a new box that looks
just like box 2 but now what we're going
to do is in front of all of our colors
if you want to ever change the angle of
your gradients in front of all your
colors the first parameter you can put
something like left press ctrl s and
preview
so now you can see that your gradient is
coming from the left the turquoise
starts on the left and black then you
have magenta on the right of your area
and I can also target bottom if I want
you can target bottom left right or top
I render that you can see now my
gradient comes from the bottom or begins
from the bottom up all right so let's
grab all of that and copy it
make another one call it gradient six
now here we'll talk about 45-degree
angles so if I wanted my gradient to
start at the bottom left corner I can
just put bottom left I can use bottom
left bottom right top left or top right
so let's render this in box six so you
can see box six has a slight angle to it
the turquoise starts in this bottom
corner and the gradient ends with the
magenta in this top corner here and you
can see that more dramatically if you
make these boxes square and then
rerender and then refresh you can see
how more dramatically you can see how
it's from corner to corner there but
I'll just leave that at 300 so we can
all see what they look like in
rectangular form now you're not only
limited to bottom left or top right if
you wanted certain angles for you then
you can get the exact angle that you
want by using a different approach for
setting the angle so let's make this
gradient seven and let's change bottom
left to whatever angle that you want by
say 45 deg that's 45 degrees render that
in my browser what if I change 45 to
something like 315 and refresh the page
and keep an eye on box seven you can see
how the angle changes and you can put
any angle that you want there so if I
want an angle of 20 here that's no
problem fresh the page you keep an eye
on box 7c you get any angle that you
like and I can go back to 45 and you'll
see it turn ever so slightly if i
refresh see it just turned over so
slightly
I'm changing the angle more directly
using numbers now it's important to note
right here since we have a numeric value
the JavaScript can animate any numeric
values in CSS so if you have something
on the page and it has a numeric value
like this one does Java Script can
animate that in a smooth sort of way by
incrementing or decrementing these
numbers so I just want to let some of
you guys know that if you happen to be
thinking about making javascript rotate
and animate this gradient spin it round
and round you can just target these
degrees right here and if you slick
enough you can make JavaScript animate
that round around to spin the gradient
and that might be something handy if
you're making like multimedia players
like an mp3 player in JavaScript and
HTML you can have animated gradient
effects on it and if you're really good
you'll be able to use the html5 audio
sound spectrum to affect graphics on the
page and that's how visualizations are
created for sound that jump to the exact
beat okay we just have two more examples
to go through so let's copy seven and
let's create a number eight and let's
take the angle but the direction off of
this one so we have a gradient with
turquoise black and magenta that's a
linear gradient but right in front of
linear we're going to add the word
repeating and then a hyphen
so you have repeating linear gradient
instead of just a normal linear gradient
now you're going to create a repeating
linear gradient and you have to use
color stops to affect the repeating
linear gradient so if I render this out
you can see box eight it doesn't have a
repeating gradient because I don't have
any color stops in it yet so I'm going
to go into the black color and I'll stop
it at twenty pixels and then the magenta
I'm going to stop at forty pixels
now let's render this you can see that
gives you a repeating gradient
background now let's take that one and
we'll just pop the last example in here
make this one gradient nine and let's
change the angle to top right or you can
use degrees if you want and then render
the page and that just shows you how you
can sit your
repeating gradients at any angle that
you want so you can use the gradients as
navigation bar background colors and
we'll give a little bit of depth and 3d
feeling to your graphics you can use
these gradients on a elements for
buttons or li elements may be using Li
or a elements for buttons gradients can
be the backgrounds for those to give
them a little more depth make them look
a little more like a button and you can
also change their appearance on rollover
when you're using something like a link
you can just put a hover
pseudo-celebrity incompletely when the
users mouse goes over it for instance
here let me show you what I'm talking
about I'll just take gradient number one
press control C put a hover pseudo
selector right here we're going to
change that from turquoise but I'll just
make it a light grey on top to a darker
gray when the mouse goes over that box
one two let's refresh the page and one
of my mouse goes over one you'll see it
changes from one gradient to another see
so you can do that for your buttons and
then you have nice rollover buttons that
have cool gradients on them and you can
even round those corners by using
border-radius
so for instance if I was to put here for
der - radius say 8 pixels and then
render that when I hover over it you'll
see I have nice corners or rounded edges
on my gradient now and I can just set it
like that for the for the non hover
State - so if I take that border radius
and I put it right there and then I
render this I'll have a rounded
rectangle that has gradient and when I
go over it it changes from one gradient
style to another so just like a button
now so I'm just showing you that's how
you can make buttons if you have a tags
that you want to be buttons somewhere
you can style them up really easily ok
here let me take that out and that the
last thing we have to do is make sure
that this works in all browsers for
instance if I go to file preview and
browser Firefox I get nothing so what
I'll do here is add all the prefixes for
all of the other browsers now and like I
said in the future you wouldn't have to
really worry about
this so I'll separate all of these out
that way I can make more lines in each
one and I'm going to remove this hover
State okay so basically for gradient one
all the way down through gradient 9
we're going to add the prefixes for the
other browsers so I can take that and
make this one Moe's and now when I file
preview in Firefox I've got my first box
you see because I'm targeting the
Mozilla browser and not only for Mozilla
I need this to work in Internet Explorer
so I'll put MS and I also need it to
work in Opera so I'll put an O and when
all of those prefixes are no longer used
I just want the default standardized
linear gradient after all four of those
now if I file preview this in Internet
Explorer I get the box that's good and
what you can do here is up top is just
have a default like if I wanted it to be
default background color gray if none of
these gradients appear so you can also
put a URL to a repeating background
image that would be like a fallback if
these gradients don't happen to render
in the browser but you'll see I get the
gradients and I don't get just a regular
background color of 999 but if none of
these gradient settings worked in this
particular browser you would just get a
background of 999 as a fallback or like
I said you can set that to have a URL of
a repeating image background as fallback
so I'll just go through and put all the
prefixes in for all these various
examples okay so basically this is what
you should end up with and remember like
I said each gradient that you create can
have a fallback at the top you just want
to make sure you target WebKit Mose MS
and O and then at the very bottom you
put the standardized way that it will be
used in the future in all browsers and
in a couple of years from now you won't
even need all of those you'll only need
the one that says linear gradient just
like that for the time being we have to
use the prefixes actually some will work
just like
without the prefix in certain browsers
for instance chrome let's take a look at
box to see box two is still there
everything still works just fine and
there's no WebKit prefix and it still
works in Chrome but you don't really
want to do that because some of your
settings will not work in Chrome unless
you have WebKit so you just want to
leave it just like it is like that for
the time being because some of these
more complex settings won't render in
Chrome unless you have the WebKit prefix
okay so using these examples should
allow you to be able to angle your
gradients any way you want put as many
colors that you want in them oh and I
wanted to show you guys one more thing
let me target number two and I'm going
to show you something interesting let's
target gradient two so I'll just take
all the blacks for all of the prefixes
and change them to transparent now let's
render this and you'll see we get a
transparent color as where the black was
which is a pretty cool effect that you
can layer these backgrounds on top of
other elements you'll be able to see
right through these gradients where they
are transparent all of this code will be
on the page where the video renders of
develop PHP if any of you happen to need
to see all the code or copy it for any
reason okay so that covers the various
programming parameters for creating
linear gradient backgrounds for any HTML
elements and in the next video that I'm
going to put out directly after this
video we're going to talk about radial
gradients which allows you to create
circular or elliptical shaped gradients</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
