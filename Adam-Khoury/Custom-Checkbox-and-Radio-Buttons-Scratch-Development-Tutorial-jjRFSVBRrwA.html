custom checkbox and radio button
interfaces in order to gain full control
over their design and functionality
without requiring a ridiculous amount of
CSS code CSS hacks or third-party
frameworks we're going to use just a few
lines of CSS to set their appearance and
just a few lines of JavaScript to
establish their functionality some of
the benefits of building your own custom
components are that you achieve
consistent design across all browsers
and another benefit is that malicious
BOTS and foul automated programs won't
be able to recognize and interact with
your components as easily as they do
stock components so you can fire up your
favorite code editor and create a file
called checkbox dot HTML to run your
experiments in the first thing we're
gonna do is set up a div because div is
an all-purpose element in HTML it has no
specific semantic value so you can use a
div for pretty much anything you want
and divs are made for general purpose
use and there's really no other elements
that have that description so no other
elements would be more appropriate
really and the first thing we'll do is
give the div a class equal to CB let me
go ahead and give it an ID equal to CB 1
and each ID needs to be unique
throughout all your elements in your
document and you can use this ID to
target this specific checkbox through
JavaScript and if you want to pass the
value for the checkbox through Ajax to a
server-side language then we're going to
set up a custom data attribute which
will be data - checked and we're going
to set it equal to 0 by default
that means this checkbox won't be
checked by default and 0 is equal to
false 1 is equal to true and then
finally we're going to put an on click
event it's equal to
a function that we're going to put in
our JavaScript called toggle CB which is
short for toggle checkbox we're going to
pass this as an argument through that
function that way we get dynamic access
to this div when this function fires off
the keyword this represents the object
that it's within okay so I've changed
everything for CB 2 to be an independent
checkbox so you have CB 1 CB 2 and your
events don't have to be directly set
inside of your HTML element this can be
set through add event listener using
javascript in the onload event or the
load event of the document that's just
in case you wanted to remove any event
handling from your HTML elements
directly you can target cb1 and cb2 and
then add event listeners through
javascript when the page loads or you
can just put it directly in the element
and it works exactly the same now under
those I'm going to add a button element
that when clicked it's going to run a
function called submit values and let's
go ahead and just put that function in
place while we're thinking about it so
here's function submit values and all
we're going to do is alert ourselves the
values for the data set dot checked and
that will return or show either 0 or 1
depending on whether the checkbox is
checked or not and this is how you can
access your values for those checkboxes
in JavaScript or when you want to pass
this information or this data through
Ajax to a server-side language like PHP
you can also keep in mind that your
scripting your JavaScript doesn't even
have to be in the document you can
externalize this javascript into any
external javascript files that you're
applying to your document so just
because I have it directly in my
document for this tutorial sake doesn't
mean that you have to set up your
application that way most of the times
we like to ex
analyze our JavaScript and our CSS code
but if this is the only document that's
going to use this specific JavaScript
then there's no need to externalize it
at all you really only need to
externalize JavaScript when multiple
documents are going to use reuse that
same exact code if only one document is
going to use a certain script or CSS
code makes more sense to have it
directly in that one specific document
and not externalize it now if we were to
take a look at this in our favorite
browser you're not going to see any
check boxes yet because we haven't
applied a little bit of CSS to design
those divs to make them look and act
like a checkbox and right now they're
block level display items with nothing
in them so that's why you can't see them
so let's go ahead and add a little bit
of CSS to the document that's going to
style those check boxes and then we can
refresh and now we see we have check
boxes when the CSS is very lightweight
and easy to comprehend
we have display we're taking the divs
out of their normal block display
behavior and making them inline block
because that's how a check box or radio
button would behave making the width 12
pixels the height 12 pixels to make them
a little square the background color is
going to be a light grey the border is
going to be a little bit of a darker
gray 1 pixel solid the border radius is
going to be 1 pixel and if you wanted to
turn these into radio buttons you would
just put this on border radius 100% and
that'll make a little circle and I have
a transition set here that way when it
changes from grey to green or from
unchecked to checked it'll have an
animated effect when those colors change
and then cursor is set to pointer to so
our cursor changes whenever we hover
over the check box now the last
little bit of code we need is this
function toggle CB to be put into our
script section and here it is
so when function toggle CB fires off its
in taking as an argument the div or the
checkbox as an object so we have
reference to whichever checkbox is being
checked at that moment now we can do
anything we want to it when it is
interacted with so the first thing we do
is set up an if-else condition statement
and that reads
if the checkbox data set checked which
is this attribute here is equal to zero
then we're going to change it to the
green style first let me show you what
it looks how everything functions and
that's all the code there's not going to
be any more code we're going to add to
this little demo let me refresh and then
I'm going to click the check box one
check box to unclick or uncheck them and
then when I press submit
you see CB 1 is equal to 0 and C B 2 is
equal to 1 0 being false 1 being true if
I have them both checked then they'll
say CB 1 equals 1 CB 2 equals 1 so
they're both checked and our script
would have an indication that they're
both checked so now you see how it
actually works I'll finish explaining
every line of this function so if
checkbox that data set that checked is
equal to 0 which they are by default
then we're going to change the
background color to the color that we
desire it to be when it's in its checked
mode and then we're going to change its
data set attribute checked to 1 now the
next time that checkbox is interacted
with we have to change it back to being
unchecked so if CB data set that checked
is equal to 1 then this else condition
is going to fire off and we'll change it
back to light gray and it's data set
that checked back to zero and it's that
simple so
if we submit without interacting with
them they're both going to be false or
not checked if we change one to checked
then CB 1 equals 1 and CB 2 equals 0 now
there are things you can do to the
design if you want to enhance it to put
HTML entities within the box the check
mark so that it actually shows a check
mark because there's an HTML entity for
check marks or you can use PNG images or
you can use SVG graphics that's only if
you want you don't have to now I would
warn you against using HTML entities
because browsers do the same sort of
thing from one browser to the next
they're going to show those HTML
entities differently there'll be a
different design between different
browsers for HTML entities so that's
just a little warning if you're going to
use HTML entities just realize that it's
gonna look different from one browser to
the next the check marks won't look
exactly the same in every single browser
and they might be sized differently so
that's why I would suggest using P&amp;amp;G
graphics or SVG graphics if you must
have a check show up in that check box
and like I mentioned before I want to
change this border radius to 100% then
basically I will have radio buttons
instead of checkboxes because radio
buttons and checkboxes have very similar
functionality in your applications let's
put that back the way it was now I put
together some other examples in case you
guys can't figure out how to achieve the
exact functionality you want to mimic
the way actual checkboxes and radio
buttons function in an application so we
have here checkbox grouped and the code
changes just a little bit checkbox in
form submission scenario that's only if
you're not going to be submitting your
form
through Ajax if you're going to use a
traditional form posting without using
Ajax then this is the type of change to
the code that you can make to where
whenever the check box is interacted
with then you can just have a hidden
input that would take on the value of
whatever data dot checked is and you do
that through JavaScript and then we have
checks mock checkbox prefilled and check
box with click text because a lot of the
times you'll notice that there's the
label the actual visible text next to
the check box or radio button is
interactive where when the user clicks
on that text it highlights the check box
or the radio button or it makes the
radio button or check box become checked
or unchecked when the user interacts
with the label text so let's go ahead
and just get all of these in the browser
so you can see the different way they
work and then I'll explain them a little
bit okay here we have the original one
that we first created and this would be
just for the most basic functionality
actually let me go ahead and refresh
that and get it back to a check box this
would be the most basic functionality
that you would have or need for using
check boxes and radio buttons and you
already saw the code for this one so you
know how that works
now this one is checkbox grouped because
a lot of times you'll want to have a
checkbox group or a radio button group
so what will happen is when you click
those you can't click multiple in the
group only one so that's what grouping
them does only one of them can be
selected within that group and I'm going
to show you the code for that it's very
simple to do and we use an array another
variation to the functionality might be
checkbox in form submission scenario so
if you keep an eye on this URL up here
when I click cb1 and then press submit
it processes the form in a traditional
sense to where if you're not using Ajax
but
most professionals build their forms
nowadays with Ajax handling all the data
transmission to the server-side language
like PHP so 99% of the time in 2017
onward you're going to see Ajax handling
all form submissions the data from forms
is not being transmitted much anymore
using the traditional approach so what I
did was I set my form to get that way
you can see the values being passed in
the URL but usually you would post these
values and not use the get method you
would use post method I just used get
method so you can actually see the
values in the URL so if I have both of
them checked and I submit then you can
see CB Haider input is 1 and the CB
Haider 2 is also equal to 1 because they
were both checked when I submit the form
if I only highlight or check CB 2 then
submit you'll see CB 1 is equal to 0 and
C B 2 is equal to 1 so that's what would
be passed and I'll show you the code for
how this all works and then we have
checkbox prefilled
so you can see when the page loads CB 2
is prefilled and checked already and
that would be in the scenario where you
just want to have a checkbox that is
already checked when the page loads and
then the final variation will be
checkbox with click text that was the
interactive text to where when the user
clicks on that text label it checks the
checks and unchecks the checkbox that
would be similar to using the label
element with a stock checkbox ok so you
can either click the text or the
checkbox itself let's first take a look
at the variation of checkbox with click
text now all I did to make that possible
was I wrapped my checkbox div my custom
checkbox in a span element
along with the label text that I want
that will be interactive now instead of
the actual div having the toggle
checkbox function in its on click event
we're going to add the on click event in
the span instead of the div that way
anything within this span becomes an
interactive part of checking and
unchecking that checkbox and you can see
instead of using just this I'm saying
this dot children with a zero index now
what that does is it passes this div
which is the first child of this span
element it passes that object through
this toggle CB function because we want
this checkbox to be the object that this
function handles and not the span
element and that's the only variation to
the code to make that possible
now checkbox prefilled let's check out
that variation our CSS is exactly the
same except we've added a Seabee
underscore checked CSS rule and all that
does is make sure that the background
will be green by default when the page
loads javascript is exactly the same and
then what you would do is put the class
CB normally you would have just class CB
but the one that you want to have
checked or any amount of checkboxes that
you want to have checked you're going to
also give them the class of CB checked
so it gets the class CB so that this CSS
rule is applied to it and then we give
it CB checked as well so this CSS rule
applies to it which will make its
background green and then we make sure
we set its data checked attribute to 1
instead of 0 because it is checked by
default when the page loads and that's
the only variation there now let's check
out checkbox and grouped now our HTML is
pretty much exactly the same as it was
before for grouping the checkboxes
except we're going to add a new class
called CB or checkbox Group one and you
can see that's not in our CSS that class
is added so that we can group all of
these checkbox together and have them as
an array in our JavaScript so we're not
adding this class to target through CSS
we're adding this class only so that we
can make an array out of this div this
div and this div so when our toggle CB
function runs we create a variable
called CB array and that's going to be
equal to document get elements by class
name checkbox group one which is down
here in its class attribute then we can
run a for loop over that array of
checkboxes to make them all turn gray
and be unchecked then we run our normal
if-else condition that we had in the
original here you see so it's very easy
to group them all together and you can
have 50 check boxes there if you want
that are grouped but what happens is
each time toggle CB function runs you
just basically want to change all of
your check boxes in that group back to
unchecked and then this code here this
code here takes the whole array and
makes them unchecked and then this code
here would check only the specific one
that's being interacted with by the user
it checks or unchecks it just like in
the original code then finally let's
take a look at the check box in the form
submission scenario so all I did here
CSS stays exactly the same the toggle CB
function stays exactly the same except
we're adding one line of code to it we
want to take the check boxes previous
element sibling value and make it equal
to whatever the check box data set is
for the checked the data checked
attribute so basically what's happening
is
when toggle CB runs these hidden inputs
are going to receive the value of its
neck element sibling so when this
checkbox is interacted with by the user
this hidden input is going to receive
the value of its data checked attribute
and that way you can pass this
information or this data whether the
checkbox is checked or not to a
server-side language in a traditional
form data transmission scenario but like
I said most forms that are
professionally built in 2017 are going
to pass the data to a server side
language using Ajax but if you have to
use traditional form method and you can
use this kind of trick to pass CB haider
one and CB hide or two and that will
represent those checkboxes the value
whether it's checked or not
when PHP or your server-side language
gets ahold of that data it'll know which
checkboxes were checked or not I'll see
you next time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
