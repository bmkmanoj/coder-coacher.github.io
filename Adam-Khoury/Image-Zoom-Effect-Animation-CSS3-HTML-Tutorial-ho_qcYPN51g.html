demonstrate how to create an animated
image zoom effect for little thumbnail
images using the CSS transitions and
we'll also talk about triggering the
zoom effect using JavaScript event
handling to target other events such as
click double click drag and many many
more events that CSS alone cannot give
you access to so if you want the zoom
effect to happen on the click event or
the drag event or the double click event
you just can't use CSS alone to achieve
that we'll also set up the animation in
several different ways
- hopefully preemptively address any
questions people may have after viewing
the exercise before we start playing
with the code let's take a look at some
live demo examples now here I'm using it
at the web intersect Q&amp;amp;A section and
inside of the threads when any user puts
their mouse over an image you can see
that image grows and shrinks that way
somebody doesn't have to really click to
go to somebody's profile if they want to
see their image bigger they can see it
right here a little bit bigger and
here's the standalone example that
you're going to learn to program today
ok it just makes the image pop-out
bigger right next to the original
thumbnail and the way we're going to be
setting it up it doesn't matter if the
images are sitting right next to each
other horizontally like this you'll
still grow and shrink like it should
we're going to start with the bare bones
of an html5 web document first thing
we'll do is go into the body element and
we'll place our little thumbnails so
let's open up an image element make it
source equal to the path of the image
that you want mine is Adam quarry JPEG
and then we'll put the alt attribute for
that we'll just put Adam make sure we
close that image tag and then we'll add
two more images in the same way if you
see with that renders it's going to show
them all full size so what we want to do
is give it some CSS but first we'll just
go into each image and put class equals
pic or you can name it thumb whatever
makes sense to you
so we'll take that class and make sure
we put it in for each of the images that
we want to have the zoom effect for now
let's go ahead up into the CSS and put a
style rule for the class pic' okay very
simple we have width and height property
set to 50 pixels so if we look at that
now we have little tiny pics okay now
you guys are going to laugh at how
unbelievably simple this is what I'm
going to do is copy the first one and
directly underneath the first one I'm
going to place another copy of it but
I'm going to name it pick big and I'm
going to do the same right now for these
other two images so you can see it's a
very simple setup you have your normal
thumbnail image and then right directly
next to it or under it you have your
bigger version of that picture so now
all we have to do is go up in our CSS
now and set up a style rule for the pic
big class and here it is we want to make
sure that each one of these pick big
images has a position of absolute that
way it doesn't move all the other
elements around on the page when it
expands and grows it can just grow in
its own space without making other
things move and we make sure the width
is zero pixels that way it's not even
visible but it's there but it's not even
visible because the width is set to zero
pixels then we applied the transition
property and we're just using the WebKit
prefix for now to make sure that works
in Chrome and Safari and all the
webkit-based browsers but here's the
standard syntax for the transition
property we're going to affect the width
property which is right here and over
0.3 seconds in a linear fashion with
zero seconds delay the width is going to
be transitioned and we have a z-index
set to ten just to make sure that the
little zoomed out pictures are displayed
above everything else on the page so if
you have things on the page with a
higher Z index than 10 just raise this
to a hundred or something so the
transition property again is targeting
the width property of the big pic
element so it starts at zero pixels by
default now the last little bit of logic
we need is a rule targeting every
element on the page with the class of
pick we're targeting those
and we're applying the hover pseudo
selector which is the hover event of the
mouse over event and we're using the
adjacent sibling selector so this where
you see the plus sign in CSS that
targets the adjacent sibling so look in
our HTML we have these elements right
here with a class of pick and then
they're adjacent sibling the sibling
element right next to them is the one
we're targeting in this rule to make its
width go from zero pixels to 200 pixels
so basically when the little thumbnail
pic is hovered on the big pic is going
to increase in width it's that simple
and it's going to happen with the
transition animation because we put this
one line in place so let's take a look
at what that renders that's what we want
okay so now that that's working let's
remove this transition property and see
what happens they should just pop out
without an animation and you might want
that you might not like the animation
because it might make your page lag or
whatever for viewers who have crappy
video processes on their computer so if
you don't want the animation you can
just simply remove the transition
property that we have in place now let's
talk about triggering these things in
JavaScript because you might not want
just the hover event when the users
mouse hovers over the thumbnail you
might want the click event you might
want to double click event or any of the
other numerous events that JavaScript
gives you access to that CSS does not
give you access to so what you would do
in that case is go down into your
element or you can add event listeners
up in your JavaScript section of your
document but I can go into this element
and add the on click event and make that
equal to a JavaScript function that I
want to fire off I would name it
something like zoom pick open closed
parentheses and then I would type this
in the function that way when the
function runs I would have access to
this element that's calling the function
to run and it can be scooped up as an
argument in the function so that gives
you access to whichever thumbnail is
being
clicked by the user in your JavaScript
function now JavaScript also allows you
to target the next sibling element
there's a property I think it's named
next element sibling I might be wrong
about that but I think it's named next
element sibling it's a JavaScript
property that you can target four
elements and that alleged dynamically
target whichever element is next to the
dynamic element getting clicked so
basically that we give you access to the
big pick right next to the thumbnail and
at that point you can use javascript to
set this elements width property to
whatever you want and that will cause
the animation to occur now some of you
might be thinking why doesn't he just
make the original thumb grow in size and
you can certainly do that but to make
sure or to ensure that all of the other
elements on the page don't get tossed
around while the thumbnail is zooming to
show you a bigger version of it you'd
have to add a lot of div containers to
this application so basically all of
these would have to be in some kind of
container to constrain its position and
then you can make the pic inside of that
container grow and shrink to whatever
you want without moving all the other
elements on the page around so in the
beginning of the video I told you we
would discuss different ways to set up
this animation and really you don't even
need the big pics you can remove those
big pics and just have your normal
thumbnails but make sure those
thumbnails are placed into div
containers that will constrain their
movement or their positioning on the
page remove that and then take the
transition control X and put it up here
and this rule for the pic and then
remove that big pick rule altogether all
right let me get back to what we
originally had
there we go
so I think this is a lot neater and
cleaner and it doesn't take up really
any more processing power because all
you're doing is taking the exact same
image and putting a version of it right
next to it so the page doesn't have to
load any extra resources really because
the resource is already there and loaded
so it's really up to you the way you
want to set it up I just want to give
you different options and discuss
different things okay we hope this
exercise helps you accomplish some
creative things with thumbnails if you
