working in flash cs4 today in action
shoot three and in this demonstration
we're showing how to have multiple
objects follow them users mouse and this
has a couple of really handy uses that
we're going to discuss before we show
you how the files set up and everything
and this file can be downloaded free the
editable source file can be downloaded
free from develop HP in the flash tab
there I'll explain the stage objects and
the code in just a second but first I
want to talk about a few things to get
your imagination flowing ok so let's
look at this thing when we move the
mouse okay and you see how it flows it's
almost like it's swimming after my mouse
chasing it sniffing after it and the way
we've created the the math it's almost
takes on the the feel of an entity
rather than just a bunch of objects it's
almost alive okay and I wrote this is
useful to several things cursor trailers
cursor effects critters and cables now
when I say critters cursor trailers and
cursor effects that's easy to understand
how that would be set up as a cursor
trailer and if you need to see examples
of how to make cool custom cursor
trailers I can show you how to do that
nice little animated ones and everything
using an array but in this one I wanted
to show you using movie clips on stage
that way I want you to use your
imagination with me for just a second
and look at that first little dot that's
closest to us I know mine just kind of
looks like a snowman a big green snowman
because he's just a bunch of Spears but
just imagine if yours that closest spear
had fangs and cool-looking ears and a
face and then the spear behind it maybe
had arms dangling down and maybe the
severe behind that had wings coming off
of it and they were flapping
you know there's a lot of cool things
you could do the very last one could
have you know more more legs coming off
the back or whatever you can make a
dragon if you wanted that would follow
the mouse a shark you can make fish you
know a seal as long as you set your
movie clips up right to look correctly
as things flow around you can achieve a
lot of cool things with this code in
this demonstration okay at cables now
the reason why I listed cables there as
this being useful for is instead of
having this in the mouse event for
dragging or following the mouse imagine
you had it stationary up here and the
user had to click down and drag that
first ball to get things moving so say
you set it up in such a way to where
that of the ball farthest from the top
would be stuck in place and all of the
others would kind of be pulled along but
that last one would never move because
of the math you set up the math would be
strung down through an infinite line and
these you have to use your imagination
here I'm not going to I might show you
an example but if I had all of these
little balls the same exact size same
color it would form something that
looked like a cable that would be moving
around in and out looking like a wire
like an animated wire or cable something
you can drag about and plug-in from one
spot to another you get my drift so if
that you can see how the code is set up
to where the smallest ball follows the
fastest so if you just set your code up
to be to make it a set down to zero for
the last ball to where it wouldn't move
at all then that's it that last one will
be stuck and the first one would always
move fastest with the mouse so say they
click drag and then let go click and
they put the cord wherever they wanted
to if you've ever seen propellerhead
reason you and you flip the console on
that software product it's awesome it's
like a whole rack soundrack unit it
flips over and you can unplug the wires
and the the wires react just like real
wires would it's really cool and that's
why I just wanted to discuss this before
i discuss that i know i made this video
super crazy long but the possibilities
are really endless you know there's a
lot of things you can do with this
demonstration in this code now let's
explain it ok now the file is very very
simple there are five Clips sitting
there and they graduate from a size of
20 to 100 so you have 20 pixels to 100
pixels the one on top is instance name
object 5 it's the smallest one the one
on the very bottom is object one as
instance name of object one and it's the
largest and you can see how they just go
up through size from 1 through 5 and
those are on the objects layer here and
then we have an actionscript 3 layer
here so let's highlight that and press
f9 or just go up to window and actions
alright let's talk about this code and
it's pretty easy it's just a little bit
of basic mathematics that you know from
elementary school first we add an event
listener for the stage of enter frame
and if you guys know about interframe
events it's a way of animating things or
making functions execute or fire off
multiple times per second many many
times a second so or it's a good way to
animate things as well so that's what
we're using a port here instead of using
between class which is using the enter
frame event and custom math to make thee
the easing effects happen so on the
inter-frame event which happens far
solve multiple times per second we're
running a function called move my
objects and here it is function move my
objects has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 lines
two lines for each object you notice we
have five objects here on stage so
there's two lines for each object each
line for each object is controlling the
exposition in the Y position for where
that object is to be placed when the
mouse moves so I'm just going to explain
this one line and then or maybe one set
and then all of the rest are the same
and then we'll talk about how this
number here on the end 6 8 12 18 26 is
going up and graduating in size ok so
let's talk about this first set here for
object 1 so we say object 1 dot x
property that's its exposition on stage
where it lives in the x coordinate minus
equal and i'll explain what minus equal
means in just a second is minus equal to
object one's exposition minus the mouse
exposition so wherever the mouse is
minus wherever object one exposition is
there's a number that's gathered with
that equation there and that is divided
by 26 that's how that little line works
so you take an object 1 x position where
it currently is at that millisecond and
you're subtracting the mouse's
exposition and then you divide that
number that's attained there by 26 and
all these lines is doing a similar type
thing now all you have to do is
understand what minus equals doing what
minus equal is doing if we didn't have
the minus there and we were just saying
is equal to it's going to kind of reset
where the x position of the object is is
being read from and we don't want that
we wanted to kind of compound and move
and stay in a fluid motion so that's why
we set the X there if I was to make this
a plus everything would fly away from
the mouse instead of following it and
being attracted to it you make that a
plus sign you'll see what I'm talking
about everything will just go flying
away it's funny
and I also wrote down here at the bottom
so yet each line is set up the same way
to move each object on the x and y
coordinates according to the numbers
that we set and it's all set to bottle
of the mouse and now the only thing left
to explain is why these numbers would be
graduating and not be the same size the
reason why these numbers at the end or
not the same size is because object 1
which is the largest object in the back
it's dividing this rate by the the
largest value which means it's going to
move less so actually what I was
explaining earlier was backwards this
would have to be a really high number
for that last one to not move now this
one being a really low number makes it
move faster towards the mouse and that's
how that's so you have six the
separation between six and eight is to
the separation between eight and twelve
is for separation between 12 and eight
is 6 12 and 18 sorry is six and the
separation between 18 and 26 is 8 so you
got that two four six eight so it's just
exponentially growing so this can be
plopped into an array if you know what
you're doing with arrays this can be
placed into an array and I'm going to
delve a lot more into this because I
really like this kind of functionality
and mouse interactivity when the user
comes to the page you can make eyeballs
to follow the mouse which is a lot of
common request I get a lot is how to
make eyeballs a set of eyeballs follow
the mouse perfectly and there's a way
you can do that using code that's
similar to this but you just have to
make sure it's not free to follow the
mouse it has a boundary but yet it will
follow the mouse inside of that bounce a
lot of cool things you can do with this
man I'm sorry I went on and on and on
geez this whole tutorial is just blah
blah blah blah blah but it's all about
imagination here folks my little green
snowman is
nothing compared to what really could
and should be done with this kind of
functionality I'm going to I'm going to
max it out and my personal projects best
believe it be making some cool Jeff ok
hope you enjoy this one remember you can
get the free source file of develop eh
be calm and from everybody develop PHP
com we wish you a Merry Christmas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
