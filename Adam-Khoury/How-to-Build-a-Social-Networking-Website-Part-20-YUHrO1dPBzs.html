a dynamic community social networking
website using PHP and MySQL brought to
you by flash building and in the last
lesson we left off with allowing the
members and building the functionality
to allow members to blab away which is
sort of like tweeting on Twitter so
we're kind of cloning towards
functionality here a little bit and so
what we have to do is run the feed for
the user for that members blabs
underneath here and we also or maybe
we'll run it at the top I might change
the location of these items but we'll
see maybe i'll have the blab on top and
then usually these these kinds of
mechanisms are built with the Ajax and
JavaScript and I might convert mine to
flash one day and show a tutorial on
that that way it'll be seamless like
just like the Ajax JavaScript or the
Ajax functionality to where it'll show
the update right away and things like
that so let's dig into the source files
that make the adjustments needed to
display those things or the additions
needed to display those things so we'll
open the profile PHP script and also the
index dot PHP script or page okay so
before we can run the blabber feed on
the homepage we're going to have to kind
of clear it out and get just what we
want on it so let's take this home page
save it here and file save as about this
will be about PHP and it's going to be
the about page where we're just going to
have some information about what the
site's purpose is and what one can do
here so we're going to remove this
section let's save another one file save
as call this parts the tutorial parts
well we'll make buttons in navigation to
these pages shortly so we have parts
here
yep
parts
inch maybe if you want to put an image
for each page on top depicting what that
page is about maybe who knows well you
don't even need that thing okay
maybe I'll change the text up in there
to describe what this page is a little
more so its parts and I'm going to go in
like I showed you in the first few parts
of this tutorial where I made new pages
how we change the metadata and
everything that we needed to change in
order for the site to index well so i'll
be doing that on the about and parts
page but i won't be showing that on
video so we can save some time here
because you guys already know how to do
that ok so let's go to the index page
again and all we want is let's see let's
take this and so remove the center stuff
class here where is that none ok and
let's put another row on that table make
two rows and up in the top let's change
the color to blue
make it nice and light blue beautiful
and this one will make it blue as well
but we'll make it a lighter blue for a
little contrast okay now you can put
here member blemings
let's just format this let's go into the
code and see what's going on here
there's a break tag that's why and now
let's format this to an h3 heading 3 and
then on top I want to have the members
the newest members on top there so we
can go control x and we won't need that
table at all down there now let's hear
put a new paragraph tag ctrl v go into
the code we should have it in a
paragraph tag now and the paragraph tag
can be aligned center or you can do it
through the CSS and give the paragraph
the class definition so you go to what
am i doing here p align center now that
will give us an alignment of Center for
that row of newest members and we'll see
how this thing looks now we'll go let's
go ahead and reconnect okay it's already
connected great now we don't need any of
this data
you can get rid of all of that maybe
we'll keep and we'll put it in later if
we need it let's keep that table there
we might want to use it
now let's get rid of it okay so now
we're nice and slim here it's beautiful
so now we'll put the member blabbing
speed the dynamic feed from the database
current and up-to-date to the second
right here in this home page and there
will be the images let's just check it
out let's go to index web intersect
homepage see there's the newest members
and then member blemings let's go into
the right there and move that let's see
the h3
and we don't want it that big let's just
bowled it out make it strong
or you can set a class for folding
things making things bold in your
external CSS file that we created but
I'll show optimization tips once we're
done here we're almost finished so now
let's get the live feed in there by
programming it in okay I popped in the
little segments of code that we need to
run the the dynamic blab speed on the
home page and I placed it another PHP
block it's in another PHP block directly
under first PHP block we had on the
index page for showing the latest six
members the joint so now here's the new
PHP block and what we're doing is
creating an SQL query that selects the
ID the member ID member ID the lab and
the blab date from the blabbing table
and it orders it by blab date descending
so it'll be the latest to the oldest and
then it limits it by 20 so this will
have an array of 2020 indexes in the
array so what we do here is we bring out
within that array or within the while
loop for that array we bring out all of
these pieces of data that we need for
those 20 blabs so we get the member ID
all that stuff we pack it in two
variables right here then we create
another SQL query within the while loop
the first while loop and we run another
while loop inside of the first while
loop and a lot of people will tell you
you shouldn't run while loops inside of
while loops and it is dangerous if you
don't know what you're doing but this
one is very limited because it limits by
twenty first of all and then this query
here limits by one so all that's going
to happen is a query 20 times
and you can also if you get deep into
PHP learn how to join database tables
and queries together into one query if
you get really advanced but this is a
very basic lesson so I'm just going to
show you this method of placing a while
loop inside of another while loop so you
can access more data that you need
within the loop so here in the second
while loop we're saying for each one of
those 20 blabs the member ID we're going
to gather all that members info see if
they have a picture and everything and
then we make the blabber display list to
20 blabbers or the 20 blabs get put into
tables and sunk into the output of the
page and then this is what we get that's
how it works and it's limited by 20 so
it's always going to be the newest
somebody's asking questions yeah the
videos right now I've got like four or
five lined up on YouTube just ready to
be released or all set to private though
I but everybody's just squirming but uh
where everybody who is following this so
yeah I just wanted to pop that in and
explain that section code because it
seemed to got lost in my video
production when I was making it earlier
okay enjoy carry on okay let's make sure
the blab comes in the blab
where it says blad here make sure that
variable renders correctly by putting
our single quote that single quote
around it okay
this should be uid i do believe because
that's what it is here okay so let's put
that up index now we should have proper
blemish let's look at the homepage look
at at so the people who are blabbing
your picture is up next to their blabs
there's going to be a whole lot of
nonsense in the member blemings at web
intersect com I can promise you that
okay so this is looking good I'm liking
it so far might change the colors up you
can definitely move this these
percentages in maybe make this 10 this
90 let's see what that gives us
and we're going to want to link to the
person's profile as well on their name
and that picture that looks good so the
picture is going to be a link and also
the their name is going to be a link to
the profile as well and I'm just going
to add that in then I'll explain the
code okay I've made links on the members
name and the members picture so when you
click it it goes to that members profile
so you can view their whole spiel and I
wrote in a little titles member of labs
these are the smartest people on earth
blabbing about stuff their mind power
cannot be matched so true look at that
blah blah blah 44 666 that's so
intelligent okay so let me show you what
I did the file will go into the index
page and where we were running that loop
inside of a loop which like I said you
got to be careful with we are showing
the link or inserting the link right
here on the name just like we did for
the lesson where we created the homepage
with the newest members we sunk a link
on their name we just sink a link around
or wrap the link to their profile using
their ID here that we get from the
database here in the loop it's too
direct to their profile around their
blabber pic and their first name and
last name as well the same link so that
was very easy so that's what I popped in
there to make the links active on the
homepage for the user and I also change
the background color of that table and a
couple of the the width
values here for the table columns and I
think all we have to do is set the same
kind of query so let's grab this no no
this one perfect let's go to the profile
page now we can run the feed for that
member all of their blabbing is just
their blabbing so everybody can see just
their blabbing if they want or that
member can see all that they're
gladding's up to a certain amount so now
we'll go to the profile page we'll just
make another PHP block this is the one
that parses it oh no that's the form
here's the parsing
so after all that
get our new PHP lock in
now put in that query SQL the blabs so
now we just have to close off that while
loop and let's see let's go where
what is that mem ID field
mmm ID equals the ID for this current
user and then we'll order by lab data
sending again this is all good it's
ready to go now we'll create the output
let's go to back to the index grab this
output section blabber display list it's
going to be a little different kind of
display just that members blabs but it
would be a very similar type thing we
don't need that let's just scrape that
let's go to inside the loop blabber
display list will be lab date yes yes
don't need the name or anything like
that we just need one row so let's get
this thing look in the way we want it to
look just grab it here control C go into
design and those are going to be right
here member of labs it the blab form
put a break tag there and now in the
member blabbed display list let's just
put that right there for now
we'll put the date make sure the date
comes out blab date we don't need these
links so the date and the blab that's
all we need derivative of this see if I
can exempt out this cell I'm not sure if
that works oh yeah it does perfect okey
so this can be a hundred percent here
save it
now let's grab that table
patrol X place it up here and we're good
to go I think now let's ftp this up
let's c SQ m by d equals ID or by yep
yep yep okay profile page let's make
sure we're displaying that bladder
display list which we're not yet right
here now let's ftp that profile dot PHP
page and view it in the browser live
guess the home page and view profile
okay it's showing blabber display list
because i'm a doofus and then you can
put the dollar sign ftp it up refresh
there's my bladders let's just bowled
out that a date let's see
yeah we want to leave that like that now
let's just leave it just like it is you
guys can do any cosmetics you need to
and so there it is it shows you how to
blab and on the homepage so I'll put out
another one that will prevent double
laughing double posting so we'll teach
you the method of preventing double
posting within your PHP and MySQL
systems and actually it's something I
need to add to develop PHP in certain
areas and but it's very simple to do
okay so we'll see you in part 21 and
then after we do that then we're going
to wrap this puppy up by showing you
some optimization tips</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
