with another JavaScript video tutorial
this lesson will show you how to apply
the set attribute and remove attribute
methods of JavaScript like usual any
code that we write in the video will be
available at develop PHP comm and a link
to it will be in this video's
description text so first we'll create
an example that shows how to reduce your
HTML markup by applying attributes to
HTML elements using JavaScript when your
document loads so let's go into the body
tag and I'm going to place three
elements there very standard elements
here's the h2 tag there's the P tag and
there's a tag so we have a link a
paragraph and a heading and I gave each
one an ID so I can communicate to this
element using JavaScript my heading has
an ID value of e1 that's short for
element 1 and my link has an ID of ìiî
that's short for element 3 so now I can
go into the head tag and I can place
some JavaScript so I'll pop in my
opening and closing script tags and
actually before we go any further let's
press ctrl s and view this in a browser
by pressing f12 or you can go to file
preview in browser whichever one you
want
I'll choose Chrome so you can see what
it looks like now we'll apply these
attributes through JavaScript so let's
make a function handle at all so let's
type in function apply attributes open
closed parenthesis open your curly brace
go down a couple of lines and close off
your curly brace what we want to occur
is when the page is ready when the
document is fully loaded we want this
function called apply attribute to run
to apply all the attributes that we want
to our desired elements so that being
the case we just go down one line in the
JavaScript and type in window dot onload
is equal to apply attributes let's just
copy that and paste it right there put
in semicolon to break that line so this
line tells this function to run when the
window is loaded now my first mission is
to take this h2 tag and give it an
attribute of a line and a value of
center which will be the equivalent of
doing this h2 space a line equals
Center but we want to keep that out of
the HTML markup and apply it through
JavaScript okay so we'll type in
document dot get element by ID and the
ID we want to effect here is e1 so we'll
put that between double quotes and close
off the parentheses then for that
element on the page we want to set
attribute so we will type in dot set
attribute you can see set attribute
looks for two arguments the name and the
value so the name of the attribute and
the value you want to give it so we want
to put those two arguments in so we can
just put in double quotes comma double
quotes and then close that off and put a
semicolon to break that line now right
here I'm going to put the attribute I
want which was a line and the value I
wanted was Center now if I were to press
ctrl s and then run this file in the
browser I'm going to get a centered h2
tag it has an alignment set to Center
now and if I comment that line out press
ctrl s run it again in the browser
you'll see that it's not centered
anymore
now let's add some attributes to those
other two the paragraph and the link so
we'll just go down right here put those
two lines in even doing the same thing
document that get element by ID target
the element that we want and we set
attribute on it this one I'm giving a
class of some style so I have to put
that style into the CSS of my page and
keep in mind there are other ways using
javascript to apply CSS to a tag but I'm
just showing you how versatile this is
and this is another method you could use
to apply CSS to a tag so if I apply a
class of some style to this paragraph
tag down here that means this some style
CSS should be applied to it and I'm also
targeting the ìiî tag which is my link
and I'm giving it a title attribute and
the value is navigate to my site so
let's see what all of this renders press
ctrl s and preview in the browser so you
can see
the style was applied to that tag the
paragraph tag the link if I hover over
it it now says navigate to my site
because I gave it the title attribute
through JavaScript okay so this is a way
that you can slim down your HTML markup
by having your attributes and their
values assigned to those HTML tags using
JavaScript so it makes your JavaScript a
little bit more bulky but it really
helps in reducing your HTML markup
pretty much just the same way you
separate out your style from your
content you separate out your CSS don't
you that means you're making your CSS
more bulky but your HTML markup is
becoming more slim and the remove
attribute method works pretty much the
same way so you would type in remove
attribute there and you don't need a
value you just have to put one argument
in that method you just put the
attribute that you want to remove from
that element so if I run this now it's
going to try to remove an align
attribute from my e1 tag so let's put
that in a line let's put a line Center
so now when I run this this align Center
will be removed from that tag it will
not be centered now I've also put
together a small example that will show
you guys how to add and remove
attributes during run time in your
scripts so during the middle some kind
of processes that's going on while a
user is using your application you might
have to add or remove these things so
you can see the code there now let's
take a look at it running in the browser
what this does is you can see I have my
regular h2 tag there like I did before
but now I have button set in place to
where when I click it's going to add the
title attribute to that and then when I
click this one it's going to remove the
title attribute from it so right now you
can see when I hover my mouse over it
there's no title attribute so let me
click this button and now I'll hover my
mouse over it and I have a title
attribute you can see it says Adam wrote
this when I hover over it now let me
click remove title attribute and now
when I hover over it it's gone again so
you see click and there it is click and
it's gone click
there it is click and it's gone so now
let's take a good look at this script
again we have a function apply act which
is short for apply attribute and then we
also have a function called remove app
which is short for remove attribute and
these functions you can see they're
taking on custom arguments that I put in
place this one's taking on the target
for the ID that we want to affect it's
also taking in a variable called ad
which is the attribute that I want to
affect for that element and then the
attribute value which is the value I
want to pass to that attribute and then
it's the same kind of script as before
document that get element by ID we
target the element that we want on the
page and we use the set attribute method
upon it the same thing goes for the
remove attribute target but all we need
to do is pass two parameters to that
which is the target element and the
attribute for that element the value is
not necessary because when you use
remove attribute method you only pass
one argument through it which is the
attribute to remove and now you can see
in my buttons there's an on click event
so in that on click event when anybody
clicks that button it's going to add to
my heading which is the ID for this h2
tag it's going to add the attribute of
title and this is the value Adam wrote
this then when somebody clicks this
button it's going to run the remove
attribute function it's going to affect
the my heading h2 tag here and it's
going to remove the title attribute and
that's pretty much how it works so
that's how you can use set attribute and
remove attribute at run time during your
script processes then we'll talk to you
