yet but I just had to throw this in
because it seems like some people are
raising concerns in the comment sections
of my videos so I want to just squish
this when creating Ajax driven web
applications JavaScript developers lose
the indexing power that their content
would normally have if it were regular
HTML visible in the source code of the
document this is why a lot of webmasters
choose to not use Ajax and JavaScript to
supply any important text or image
content to the viewer in any way the
browser software and the viewer can
access your Ajax content but the search
engine crawlers cannot yet most search
engine crawlers can only crawl HTML
content if you supply any text images
lists database data or anything else
through Ajax the crawlers will not be
able to execute the Ajax request and
thus they will not index your precious
site content so the same issue that
flash developers use to face is now
plaguing Ajax application developers and
JavaScript animation programmers
technology leaders created crawlers
that can index a Flash SWF file by
programming the search engine BOTS to
access the active object plug-in on the
page but search engine technology
leaders have not yet made such efforts
for JavaScript and Ajax powered web
content to enable their BOTS to crawl
that content by default the developer
has to take extra steps so we have to
take extra steps at this point in time
until search engine technology leaders
make the crawlers access Ajax and
JavaScript driven content by default
making it to where we do not have to
take any extra steps to assure that our
site content is indexed well they did it
for flash years ago and I imagine they
will do the same thing for JavaScript
content to where hopefully soon we don't
have to take any extra steps to have our
JavaScript and Ajax content be well
indexed in all of the search engines for
the time being the solution we have is
creating an HTML snapshot to feed to the
search engine crawlers to
pain-in-the-butt yes but it must be done
if you care about your very dynamic and
cool site indexing well in search
engines your site might be
HTML based but if any content is
delivered through Ajax or JavaScript you
are suffering on the SEO side of things
unless you work with HTML snapshots I'm
going to supply you guys with this link
to the Google developer website under
the webmaster section for Ajax crawling
and I'll put this link in the video's
description that way you guys can just
check out the videos description and
click the link if you want to come to
this page so you can see what Google
says if you're running an AJAX
application with content that you'd like
to appear in search results we have a
new process that when implemented can
help Google and potentially other search
engines crawl and index your content you
just go ahead and click on all of these
sections to become very well-educated on
what you can do to make your ajax in
JavaScript content more accessible to
search engine crawlers and actually
other search engines like Yahoo and Bing
are adopting Google's method for
crawling Ajax and JavaScript driven
content so the solution is HTML
snapshots and I hope that helps some of
you guys we've known this for years
we've known the content of flash doesn't
index well videos that's why a lot of
developers didn't like for using flash
they prefer to use regular HTML even
though it wasn't fancy and all animated
it was very indexable in the search
engines and you have the same problem
when you're using JavaScript and Ajax to
deliver any kind of content to your
viewer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
