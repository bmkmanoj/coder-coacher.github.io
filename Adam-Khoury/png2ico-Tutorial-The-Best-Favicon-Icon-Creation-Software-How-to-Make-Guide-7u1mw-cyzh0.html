going to show you how to break out of
web design preschool for baby kids
regarding fav icon creation if you want
to stay in web design preschool by going
to some website that's going to make it
for you you do baby did you go right
ahead and you just use that service all
you want this video is not for you if
you're a big boy web designer and you
want to know how to make your own fav
icons on your own see drive on your own
windows machine without having to go to
some website every time you need a fav
icon for every one of your client
websites this tutorials for you we're
going to be using a very fast
lightweight program called P&amp;amp;G to ico
which i listed at develop PHP calm under
the latest freeware and webmaster tools
section so if you click that you'll see
there's a page to download here click
download it takes us to this URL which
is if you go to the overview you'll see
the demands name is Matthias Venkman and
he writes software and in my opinion PNG
to ico is a really cool piece of
software and I've been using it for
years now so I see people a lot of
people they go to this website they go
to that website this website and they
recommend this website that website this
website to go to to get your fav icons
created when you don't really need to go
online at all and you can do it just as
quickly if not faster using this method
so that's what I'm going to show you how
to do will download it and install it
then I'll show you how to use it to
create the favicon ICO file and then
finally at the end of the video I'll
show you how to apply that favicon ICO
file onto your website and i'll also put
this guy's URL for the download page in
the description of this video so right
there's the download you see it right
there and i'm just going to show Windows
users so any version of Windows you're
using
follow what I'm about to show you and
apply this and use this little piece of
software let's press download and the
google chrome is downloading it now and
i'm going to go and show all downloads
in my downloads folder and there it is
show and folder I'm going to cut it out
of there okay so wherever you download
it to just grab it put it on your
desktop you can now close down the web
if you want paste it onto your desktop
or get it onto your desktop zip package
anyway you can and I'm going to
recommend that you have winrar installed
on your machine or some way to open up
these type of downloadable packages like
zip files RAR files and archives like
that so double click it go to extract to
and it'll probably say your C Drive
desktop and all that by default where
this package is currently sitting press
ok in the location this package is
currently sitting it's going to put out
this folder you press ok and there it is
so it's going to produce that folder to
your desktop you double-click that
folder you go in there you right-click
this in the right click dialogue here
you go to cut or copy just copy it
because you can delete both of these
later you go to your C Drive my computer
local disk c and you paste it right
there now it's installed and ready to
use how easy is that ok once PNG to ico
is installed on your C Drive then you
just open up your favorite graphics
editor I'm going to go create new start
with the 32 pixel x 32 pixel image I'm
just going to go into the common library
and grab out some little graphic to use
in this demonstration like that floppy
disk alright so basically you just want
to wind up with a 32 by 32 pixel image
so we'll go to file export wizard
continue the web
exit and here's the image preview screen
go to PNG 32 format all right now export
bring this window into view real good
you go to your C Drive where you
installed PNG to ico and that's where
you're going to put this you're going to
name this first one that's 32 pixels
logo 32x32 and it will be a dot PNG file
so logo 32x32 save it there now take
this and make it 16 by 16 make it 16
pixels by 16 pixels fit canvas file
export wizard you save them both as PNG
32 format if you're using fireworks so
where it says logo 32 by 32 we're going
to save this now as 16x16 save alright
so now at that point your fav icon your
fav icons are in this PNG to ico folder
right there and if you look at the large
icons you'll see there's that one and
there's that one now we're going to use
PNG to ico to create a fav icon dot ICO
file out of that and we can slap on to
our website and PNG to ico is very
lightweight it has no graphical
interface we use the windows command
prompt to do the whole thing is just
typing in one line pretty much and it
creates the file instantly to have PNG
to ico create one favicon.ico file out
of these two files all we have to do is
go into the windows command prompt which
i think is a very nice feature cuts out
all the bull so let's just go to start
let me drag this down so you can see go
to my Start button if you happen to be
in anything prior to windows 7 you can
just click the little run button that's
here but if you're in Windows 7 to
access the run box you can just go to
run so once you get the run dialog up
you type in CMD and that will bring up
windows command prompt
now inside of Windows command prompt all
you have to do is access the c drive for
that folder so we'll type in CD space
backslash P&amp;amp;G to ico press enter so now
we've accessed that folder now we're
going to send the command to the
software and this line when executed is
what creates the fav icon that ICO file
when you press ENTER lets it start it
off with PNG to ico space fav icon dot
ICO that's going to be the name of the
output file then you type another space
and the first one will be logo 16 by 16
dot PNG space logo 32 by 32 dot PNG now
you press ENTER and at that point you
can see it just popped up right there in
front of your very eyes it popped up
right above that license file now you
just type in exit to close the command
prompt and there's your fav icon file
that's ready to be placed on your web
server you ftp it up like all your other
files we're going to play something into
the code of the web document to make
sure that it displays in all browsers
like it should as a fav icon so after
you ftp that favicon.ico file to the
root directory of your website where
ever your index dot PHP dot HTML file is
wherever your index file your home page
of your website is that file that's
where you want to have the fav icon that
light go file now if using something
like Dreamweaver let's just make a an
example HTML page so i can show you guys
where to put this you go in the head tag
right there where the meta tag is and
that title tag but within the head tag
so here's the opening and closing head
tag so within the head tag you're going
to place the following so those are the
two lines that you can place and a lot
of browser software is getting to where
you don't even have to place those two
lines sometimes
it will pick up the fav icon on its own
as long as you have the fav icon that I
co file sitting in the root folder for
that website but to make sure it shows
up you place these two lines in and
that's it you're all done you'll now
have a fav icon that ICO file that shows
up in all the favorites the bookmarks
browser tabs and all the places where it
should and if you happen to be using a
browser software where your website is
cached in it already and the babe icon
doesn't show up right away go to some
other computer or friends computer some
and then view your website from there
somebody that doesn't regularly visit
your website you'll see that your icon
file shows up okay we hope you enjoyed
that lesson on how to use PNG to ico
