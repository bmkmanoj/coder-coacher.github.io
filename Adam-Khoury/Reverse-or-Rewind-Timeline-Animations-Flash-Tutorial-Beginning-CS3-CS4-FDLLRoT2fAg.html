which you'll be learning how to create
in this tutorial it's reversing your
animations reversing your timeline
animations programmatically and manually
this is for beginners who don't know how
to do such things yet side of my Flash
building gear today we're going to learn
how to reverse our timeline animations
programmatically and manually so first
I'll show you the code method using
script and then I'll show you the manual
method this way you can know if this
ever crops up and a forum anywhere
online or you need to know it yourself
you can refer yourself or other people
to this video because I'm gonna go over
the whole thing the whole shebang I'm
gonna cover it you're cute let's go
first we'll get him into a let's double
click well first let's just right-click
them convert them to a symbol and let's
call this movie clip my animation
timeline animation register top left is
good okay and let's name that well we
don't even have to name it just yet
we'll name it after after we get done
making the animation after the fun part
so let's go and double click inside of
them and then you can see you have the
movie clip that was imported or that you
brought in from some other program and
we're going to animate on this timeline
not the main scene if you were on the
main scene the code would be a little
different but let's pull this down a
little there we go now we'll name this
layer man and then we'll make another
layer and name that one
places yes very good and then I think
that's all need for now so on the places
I'm going to put some places in here in
this area and then we'll resume
okay so I have all the elements on stage
that I want for this simple example and
the goal of my animation is going to be
to get builder man here from his house
to the Yankee game and so he'll have to
his route will be passing his mailbox
then going by the golf course and going
by the library or museum thing and then
to the game he's got to walk through the
blocks and go that way and so the goal
of this will be to get him home
programmatically so first I'll manually
get him to go buy a time line animation
here so let's just go to 25 well first
let's what I did was I went to 25 and
pressed f6 and made a new keyframe I'm
gonna go on the places layer out to
about 130 press at 5 extend the
keyframes out now on 25 we have a new
keyframe there and you can see we can
move our little man let's lock the
places layer I don't want to mess with
that
now let's bring him down past his
mailbox now on 50 we want to bring him
past the golf course now 175
it's part of the animation he's gonna
walk my museum there and then 75 or 100
he'll make it to the Yankee game yay
okay so it ends on 100 that's great
that's perfect
okay so let's remove these frames
highlight them remove frames and you see
I'm working in flash cs4 but all of this
will work the same in cs3 so now all I
need is motion tween so let's go ahead
and highlight all of these on top
through there and create classic tween
so we just created a motion tween
through their scene so there's our
animation now instead of me building
that to where he can go back that same
route back home I'm going to do it
programmatically through script and then
I'll show you the manual waited just to
reverse it easily and quickly so you
don't have to build any more timeline
like you did because in a lot of
animations that you'd make especially
nice ones these timelines are very
complex and they're not as simple as
this example here you know what I mean
all right okay now if we press control
enter to test the movie or if we press
f12 to publish it we'll see that he goes
through his route good but when he gets
to the game it's like he just magically
gets back home and then goes back on his
route but we want to make him go to the
game and then reverse the animation
programmatically and make him go back
home from the game using the same route
that's what we're going to do so let's
go back into the main scene and on the
layer here you'll see we have our movie
clip and let's give that movie clip an
instance name now let's just call it my
animation my MC that's a whole lot
better my movie clip
my MC and once we have that as an
instance name and we can connect to it
through code so let's open up the
actions panel and go to window actions
or hit the little actions button there
or press f9 ok so now first thing we
want to do is create a variable that's
going to be for the direction and I'm
going to call it var direct it's short
for direction this is a string variable
and it's equal to the word for word very
simple easy to understand okay now we're
going to add an event listener for on
into frame event so let's type in event
dot enter frame all caps
and then comma and the name of the
function that we want to fire off on
enter frame which we can name it on
enter frame it makes a lot of sense okay
now you can name it anything you want
now we'll just type in function on enter
frame we'll grab that name right there
there I'm going to name it something
different just you see on enter frame oh
okay now let's open up parentheses type
in void open up our curly brace go down
a few lines close up the curly brace and
there's our function nest all ready to
go inside of the parentheses we're going
to type in event colon event it's not a
mouse event so it's just event okay so
now first thing we want to have inside
of the function is an if condition so
let's set up the nest with act and
there's an if condition now we want to
say my MC if my my MC that current frame
and I think ours was 100 frames was the
animation if that is greater than 99
that means when it hits 100 this little
little bit of code will fire off direct
which is our direction variable is equal
to forward right now we're going to make
it equal to backward
so it'll say backward and that'll switch
from that direction variable saying
having a forward value to a backward
value and now I'm going to make one more
if condition set up that nest okay now
in the parentheses for the condition
we're going to type in the to see what
this variable has as a value or if it
has a value of backwards that would be
even better let's do that
if the value of direct is equal to
backward then we'll fire off code right
here okay first we're going to claim one
more variable and we're going to need to
get the amount that we want to go back
set to one keyframe I'm going to show
you I'll explain that right all right
now after I set this up this is going to
be my underscore MC patrol see let's
grab that that current frame so I'm
accessing the current frame within this
on and to frame event that's firing off
multiple times per second
so in this own inter frame event which
fires off multiple times a second I'm
claiming a var a new variable which is a
number type variable and it's equal to
my movie clip my animations current
frame minus one so if my animation
happens to be on keyframe fifty at that
very second this is going to be recorded
as 49 if this happens to be on frame 75
this week it's recorded as 74 so we're
just saying whatever my movie clips
current frame is minus one and that with
that that's what that number variable is
we're going to use it in this one line
of code then we're done
okay so the last line is very simple
let's just say my underscore MC dot go
to
and stop on that dynamic variable it's
always changing it and this is basically
a rewind script this will rewind any
timeline animation frame by frame
okay so let's press control enter see
what we have so you should go to the
game now take any route and then head
back on the same route we just
programmed in a reverse feature into our
animation without having to do it
manually and let's take a look at that
code and I'll show you something
interesting you just turn this up to 3
and you'll see the frame amount that you
want to go backwards
it's accelerated down so if we look at
it he'll go the normal speed on its way
there but on his way back home he's
moving three times as fast okie dokie
now let's show you the manual method and
we'll go ahead and comment out this code
for now and I'll show you how to do it
manually inside the movie clip using the
features within the right-click function
okay this is very simple I just wanted
to show the more complex way first for
the uber dorks out there okay so all we
have to do is highlight all 100 frames
of our animation right click copy frames
and let's go to 200
anywhere back here would be fine but I'm
gonna go precisely to 200 and press f5
for the places layer and then on the on
these key frames I'm going to highlight
them all the way back to 100 and right
click paste frames so all of that
animation is there and it loops again
but we wanted to go backwards instead of
him starting from home there when he
gets to the game we want him to walk
back home backwards okay so let's just
highlight all these frames from 100 on
that we paste it in make sure there
highlight is right click reverse frames
and there you have your reverse
animation okay so now if we press
control enter you'll see we have the
same exact effect but done manually see
there
and this time he loops because there's
no stop action set okay so now you can
also speed that up if you needed to just
don't have so many keyframes there on
the reverse part maybe halfway instead
of 200 make it only go to 150 but still
have all four of those points in there
you just highlight them drag them see
Betty easy and then remove the ones you
don't want by right-clicking as your
highlight there remove frames basically
that's how it works it's very simple and
I'll have this event this file available
free if you want to get to the code and
see the structure of what I created here
for this example it'll be a develop PHP
in the flash section where all of the
other videos and source files are okay
we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
