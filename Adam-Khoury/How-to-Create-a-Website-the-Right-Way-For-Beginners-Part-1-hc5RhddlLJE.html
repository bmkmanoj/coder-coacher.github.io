learn ancient Chinese secret that I
apply when creating power sites the
reason why I call them power sites is
because a they're nice to look at
you can design them to look any way you
want pretty much be they're gonna have
awesome search engine indexing power see
they're going to be very very fast
loading and D it can be super easy to
manage and expand okay a few important
notes that you may want to know about
before we even begin is you can use any
graphics program that you like if you
like gimp or maybe you like photoshop or
illustrator more than you like fireworks
you don't have to use fireworks you can
use any graphics program that you're
comfortable with that you feel that you
can create something like this in and
you'll also need a text editor I'm going
to be using Dreamweaver cs4 and but it's
not going to be necessary to use
Dreamweaver you could use something like
notepad plus plus I'm going to show you
all the code that's going to be
necessary and we're going to use mainly
just CSS and HTML with our custom
graphics to create the POW site now I've
already created my shell my design in
fireworks complete and you can see it's
a little bit stubby but you don't have
to even worry about that because this
section here is going to auto expand
depending on how much content is in our
respective individual pages on our site
it will auto expand to fit that pages
content since we're using CSS and we're
going to be using CSS backgrounds it's
going to be very very easy to achieve
fast loading auto expanding sites that
will hold all your content in in your
nice graphics so if you have no
experience designing anything in
fireworks if you go on YouTube and you
type in a search bar
fireworks cs4 tutorial I own that
section you'll see nothing but my videos
come up and a few other good tutors
videos will come up in that list
but mainly my tutorials will come up in
that listen you can learn how to create
graphics do all kinds of tips and
techniques for graphics creation within
fireworks cs4 so mine is complete
already so we're not going to be going
over how I created all of these custom
graphics from scratch but I'll kind of
pull it all apart here so you can see it
just text graphics crap
more crap more crap my friend Ryan this
thing is just a bar that's just a bar
that's just a bar this is just a
rectangle so you can see it's just
custom graphics thrown together now
let's press ctrl-z and slap that all
back together the way it was
there so you can see what my custom
graphics are comprised of and you can
make your own shell and layout now let's
get to moving on making his site
okay let's slice and dice this thing up
first thing I'm gonna do is get my
background so I'm gonna highlight this
blurred shape on the end here and then
this blurred shape because those two
objects are gonna be all that makes up
my background I don't want to be too
overly distracting with my background
graphics or my page layout because I
would rather the content in the pages
and photos or anything like that really
pop out that's why you see my my layout
is very gray and almost bland looking
until I get some content on the pages
and then those things will pop and the
background really won't distract from
what's on the pages the layout won't
distract okay so let's press control X
actually no just press control C copy it
leave this file the way it is complete
and make sure you keep it safe that way
you can change it and manage it a little
more easily so just press control C and
let's go to file new and we're gonna
make a new file for the background it'll
have if you're in fireworks it'll have
the width and the height already
specified for what you're about to pop
in place press control V now let's grab
both of these and Center them and you'll
see in fireworks you get a center line
right there which helps out a bit let's
make sure it's in that looks good to me
now we'll take this file and export
wizard you go to export wizard continue
the web exit and then it'll say JPEG GIF
and give you all kind of options of what
kind of file you can export this as a
nice optimized file we're gonna export
it as jpg keep it nice and small look
how big this background file is gonna be
because there's not much going on on
mine but fireworks is good for
sporting a nice optimized JPEG to use
the webpage backgrounds so I'm all set
ready to go JPEG 80% quality that's all
I need
17 kilobytes now I'm going to go to
where I am creating this site which is
on my D Drive it's in working on folder
my five sites and you go to any folder
you're storing your site in mine is
called web intersect new there's the
folder I'm creating my site in on my
local machine and then I'll FTP
everything up to the web so I'm gonna go
and create a new folder this is kind of
like hey let's make a new one for root
this is the root folder of the dock of
the website whatever your root directory
would be let's go inside of that make a
new folder called style in the style
folder for the site
here next to the style folder would be
like your index page about Us page
contact page and we'll be creating all
of that in just a little while but first
we need to get our style folder setup
with these images so we're exporting
this JPEG let's call this B G save
backgrounds done okay now let's go back
over here and you can also then once
you're done with that save that file
that we were creating the background on
here save this file save as site imagery
you can see here I have the route
there's the style folder but above the
roof folder next to it there's an
imagery folder this is where you want to
save your raw PNG graphics editable
files that you can then just manage and
change up later if you want to change
your site design down the road it's
called this BG and it's saving it as a
fireworks
PNG editable file so I can edit it later
on whenever okay our fast-loading
background is all set up now I'm gonna
work on getting my header that's going
to also be a well optimized jpg and its
own little sliced out piece which is
gonna be a CSS background that we can
then put HTML elements all over
elements graphics or whatever you want
you can put it on top so what we'll do
is highlight everything I'm gonna hold
down control the mouse wheel in my
canvas there zoom in and out I'm gonna
highlight everything and I'm gonna hold
down shift on my keyboard and deselect
these background elements that we
already say we don't want that and I'm
gonna press ctrl-g I'm gonna group that
whole thing so it's one big group you
see that
now I'm gonna highlight it press
control-c file new width and height is
all set up press okay
control V now you can see all my edges
there I have a little maybe one pixel
white strip of canvas you can see there
so to get rid of that it's pretty easy
you just go to canvas size instead of
976 let's make it 974 and then I'll wipe
out one pixel from each edge of the
canvas there okay perfect now it's nice
and snug next to my grey line the
graphics of mine my header file here so
I'm going to drag this up or just
highlight it and press up on the
keyboard and now with the top all snug
to where that's only going to show in
the canvas we want to make sure we get
this bottom section up to meet this line
if we want to take our header file and
make it a fast loading header graphics
then we have to make sure we slice it
out right so we have the top bowl set up
in the canvas now let's go to canvas
size anchor top middle and let's make
that maybe 2/10 that's okay
and you see what it did it just shrunk
the canvas to where it's only going to
show a certain part of the graphics that
you have onstage there or in the canvas
so we need it looks like we need to get
rid of maybe 10 12 more pixels so let's
top anchor down again
from the top middle and let's put this
on 198 okay ah maybe two more pixels
let's go up here click on the side
canvas size 1 9 that might be 3 pixels
so let's try 1 9 5 I think that'll do it
yep that's good so now it's perfectly
snug just like I want now I'm going to
go to file export wizard and you'll
notice that this is still a group that
you can ungroup and modify all these
things if you wanted or you can modify
them back at the main file here and then
recreate your header file which is
simple you saw how long that took me it
was just like a minute and now I'm going
to go to file export wizard continue the
web exit make sure we're on JPEG 80 is
good now we're going to export it see in
the style folder here right next to BG
we're going to put header save now you
have a well optimized JPEG header that's
going to load super fast and I can add
any graphics you want in it you'll be
able to put any HTML elements on top of
it as if they were part of it flash
images whatever you want flash object
files can go right up in there okay so
we need the body and then we're gonna
slice up the footer okay now at this
point you want to file save this as the
raw PNG in the imagery folder that way
you can edit it open it up in a minute
again because we're going to be changing
this file in a second this untitled five
is going to change up in a second so we
want to make sure we save this as it is
right now as header row PNG editable in
the imagery folder press save
now no matter what we do to it at this
point here will always have that header
ready to go because what I'm gonna do
right now is move this up I'm just gonna
hold up on my keyboard with that group
of items selected when it gets to about
right there I can have a body section
I'm gonna make up right now by clicking
off to the side here go to canvas size
and the body section could be really
fast loading you can make the height of
it just eight pixels if you want I'm
gonna go with maybe I should do eight
let me try sixteen sixteen at first okay
that's good I like that and that will
repeat actually it might make those
lines a little bit too thick so let's go
to we're gonna want I'm gonna want my
little graphics my little hatch design
here on the edges to meet up just right
and if they don't I can change it up but
right now the body section is all set
you go to file save as imagery and that
imagery raw PNG folder that we're going
we're gonna save this as body save now
let's get the footer and the footer
might be able to be the same width or
the same height let's see yeah it'll
work look how fast loading that's gonna
be okay
file I haven't made JPEG submit but you
can imagine how fast they're gonna be
let's call this footer in the imagery
folder save it as raw PNG now we just go
to file open see we are in the imagery
folder open body and header back up so
we have body footer header but basically
you just want the body the footer and
the header open now we're gonna save
these as optimized JPEGs like we did
before
file export wizard get the header into
the style folder with our fast loading
back
let's go to jpg export style
header I had saved one a little earlier
but I'm just gonna overwrite that yours
wouldn't have a header file in there yet
now I'm gonna do the same thing to the
footer file export wizard continue jpg
export call it footer save same thing
with the body
file export wizard continue bla bla bla
bla bla so you get the idea we're saving
a whole bunch of optimized JPEGs at a
little slices that we're going to piece
together using CSS when we get into
Dreamweaver or any text editor that you
have so let's call this body I'm gonna
have a stylesheet
a separated stylesheet that's going to
power our site it's going to be in the
style folder so let's press save on the
body and we're all set now we have all
of these items that made up the shell of
our site sliced out is optimized JPEGs
ready to go on a web page and we're
going to use CSS and we're gonna
continue on in part two because I don't
want to have this get too long-winded
here when continue on in part two where
we'll pick up and Dreamweaver and show
you how to really get the site come
start to come to life and the design
piece together using CSS alright so
don't miss it if you enjoy in this
series but I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
