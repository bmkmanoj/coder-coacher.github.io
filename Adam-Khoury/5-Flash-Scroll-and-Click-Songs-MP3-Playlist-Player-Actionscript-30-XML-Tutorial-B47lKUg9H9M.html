and we're in our actionscript-3 XML mp3
playlist player project tutorial series
it's a lot to fit in your mouth hey I
got something fitted your mouth holy
crap i'm a retard all right now well we
have to cover in this part of the lesson
it's going to be short and sweet but let
me demonstrate what I'm talking about
here when the player is playing and say
you're on song 7 the users on song 7
it's the last song in the list and song
one's going to roll around when this
song gets finished playing you want to
make sure that it goes all the way back
up to viewing in the scrollpane
automatically that song so if you are on
song 5 and it gets done with song 5
we're going to make the list component
automatically on its own scroll to show
6 in the view pane okay let's grab
folder for copy it paste it here move on
to part 5 rename this part 5
double-click inside of it rename this
source file part 5 now we're ready to
rock get some better functionality set
up into this list component alright so
this one we can delete because we'll be
creating a new one when we press f12 to
render out now we'll just open some
flash part 5 this is very easy to
accomplish it's going to make this part
of the lesson very short this video so
here in the code we have our new track
play function here so when it goes to a
new track automatically this is where we
have to put that code in we're going to
put it right here under
where we select which cell is
highlighted in the field right under
that we're going to add the code and
here as well right whereas select the
highlighted self we're going to add some
more code i'm going to show you the
handiness and the power of the help file
and people who choose to use it
sometimes are able to get at the
functionality they need without going
into the forums or or looking for help
elsewhere because it's right here so
what I was looking to do was see I go
into the help file and i typed in when i
type in attempted list and when that
gave me all the results in actionscript
3 i went all the way down to where was
it list right here this is very
important because this can show you how
to search inside of this help file even
if you're on the online help file in
flash cs4 it's a similar type thing so
right here I found list scroll to index
and I thought that's exactly what I want
so I read it and it says Scrolls the
list to the item at the specified index
if the index is out of range the scroll
position does not change so let's grab
that scroll to index and now let's put
it right here
and let's put the semicolon and this
index is going to be 0 for this first
song to play the one down below is going
to be and this is the method of the list
component here and some other components
it's called scroll to index and it makes
the component scroll automatically to
the index that you set so let's grab
that whole sea and put it down here in
the else condition of this function as
well so lists scroll to index this one
has to be SN instead of 0 if you have
kept that 02 always go to one you don't
want that this has to go to SN that's it
now this press control enter and I'll
show you I'm going to go to this one's
nice and short song for now let's go to
song 5 so when song 5 ends here it's
going to automatically scroll you'll see
I'm going to keep my mouse over here
it's going to automatic it over here
it's going to automatically scroll to
the number 6 and bring six interview
showing only two three four five six
so you see there if you have 50 songs in
your playlist it will just sit there all
day and keep automatically switching on
its own which is the more intelligent
way to program a player like this with a
clickable scrollable playlist so I'm
going to keep this in its own little
section and we'll move on to part six in
the next video low scroll to index
pretty code and remember your help file
very helpful you saw how it was just
helpful to me I needed something done I
searched and bam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
