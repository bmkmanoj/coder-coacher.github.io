on the product page which will be the
page that puts your product on display
when anybody clicks on the product in
any various lists that it's in this is
the page that will have your Add to Cart
or Buy Now button on it whatever you
choose and before we get into this
lesson we're going to have to discuss
just a couple of things that way we
don't get ahead of ourselves now if you
already know what online payment
processors are and you are familiar with
what they offer you as a merchant online
then you can just skip this whole crap
right here that I'm about to say about
the online gateways and what they offer
so PayPal is the king of online checkout
thing Google is closed
runner up I guess and gaining ground and
so you have Google Checkout you can be a
merchant a Google Checkout you can also
be a merchant at PayPal which means that
you can offer your shoppers to checkout
with either Google Checkout or PayPal or
you may choose to go with the private
system even at your local bank they
might even have software where you have
your business account they might have
software that would allow you to tap
into their online gateway service and
they take a small fee from each
transaction just like Google Checkout or
PayPal would now with each of Google
Checkout or PayPal or any other system
really they give you a free card
software usually and they allow you to
get in there as the merchants log in to
your account and create Add to Cart
buttons by now buttons donate buttons
gift certificate things all kind of cool
nifty things that you can use for making
money online now at this point when you
have your items in the database images
for you're ready to sell those things
you can use the gateways free card
software so whether you're a Google
merchant or a PayPal merchant you can
use their free card software simply log
in to your merchant account generate an
Add to Cart button you can put the
details in the name for the product to
price everything and it will generate an
encrypted button for you now PayPal over
the years has had problems with people
forging prices and things like that but
now they have more secure button systems
where the price can't be forged
and Google Checkout uses a secure system
as well so when you go when you create
an Add to Cart button whether you use
Google or PayPal you can choose to have
it encrypted so where nobody can tamper
with things but if you're using a card
system a custom PHP card system what you
want to do is get the code for the Add
to Cart button and then make it dynamic
by using the variables that they give
you if you're a if you're looking at the
developer documentation for those
payment gateways and what I'm going to
show you is the PayPal developer
documentation since I'm more familiar
with the paypal side of online
transactions I've used Google a little
bit but not as much as I've used PayPal
over the years now there's another
option that they give you which is the
Buy Now buttons which will direct the
person right when they click that Buy
Now button it will direct a person
straight to Google Checkout or if you're
using PayPal you'll go straight to
PayPal secure server and it will allow
the person to checkout for that one item
and it'll usually let them up the
quantity or decrease the quantity there
if you enable those options so the Buy
Now button is really just to let
somebody buy one thing real quick if
they want seven of that one thing they
can assign that when they get to the
checkout at the payment gateway but what
we're going to do is option three here
we're going to build a custom PHP card
to have more in-house shopping
experience that way the person is is
never directed to the online gateway
such as Google Checkout or PayPal when
shopping with an Add to Cart buttons so
the person can put 20 items in their
cart being on our site the whole time
while doing that if you using the
default free cards to the gateways every
time they put an item in their cart
they're going to be ushered to either
PayPal or Google Checkout or whatever
where where the default card software
for you is on their site your card
session is on their site when you use
the gateways free card system so if you
use a custom PHP card which is what
we're going to do we're going to have a
more in-house shopping experience so
where the person really never
leaves our sight until the very end when
they ready to check out for all the
various items in their cart then they're
going to be ushered to the online
payment gateway if you want to spend a
little money I think you can get either
with Google Checkout or PayPal you can
get more advanced systems with the
shopper would never leave your site at
all
even through completion of checkout so
that's something you may want to look
into but we're not going to go that
route in this lesson series we're going
to go just as far as assembling a cart
full of items and then they check out
through the online gateway ok so now all
we have to do is make it to where when
we click one of these products we want
the product PHP page to render showing
all the details for that product so
let's go into Dreamweaver here we are
with the index page let's just say file
save as product up PHP since this page
is pretty much virtually empty anyway
we're going to overwrite it so index dot
PHP is just fine we can actually close
that now product dot PHP let's go into
and say store homepage we're going to
change that to some dynamic variable in
the title tag here this will be some
kind of dynamic title for the product
now we have the changes query up a
little bit we're going to leave this
script error reporting right here on the
top just so we force script errors to
show every little thing that's wrong
with script if something happens to be
wrong no matter what your PHP dot ini'
vile is set like now on this page before
you connect to your database you want to
make sure that the URL variable ID is
set and that it exists within your
database and that's a very simple check
so let's go right in between those two
PHP blocks let's place a new one this
one put a little comment let's say check
check to see the URL variable is set and
that it exists in the database so that
would be an if condition followed by
and else statement so we say if is said
will use the is set function dollar sign
on the score you get all capital letters
bracket single quote single quote
bracket in between the two single quotes
put ID if is set get ID we can access
that ID right here you just put ID is
equal to get ID and using something like
this you can be sure that you've
cleansed the variable that way nobody
can put anything but a number into the
URL because people can type and change
the URL variables just by typing in the
address bar so you want to make sure
that anybody types any funny characters
in there you get rid of them strip this
whole variable of those making sure it's
only 0 through 9 type characters that
can be in that variable after you use
the preg replace function on it so let's
remove that so you can see the get ID
variables right there and that's what's
being cleansed using this preg replace
function so we're still going to do more
with that ID and we're going to use it
to access the database and get all the
information for this product out but in
the else condition you want to make sure
that you let the people know that
there's new product and really this
should never happen if they're using the
site correctly in the system with that
ID so you just echo out no product in
the system with that ID you can echo out
some links there if you want to put the
link so I'm not even going to mess with
it I'm going to leave that up to you but
that this would only happen if any URLs
get tampered with by anybody visiting
the site which is not really a consider
a security concern but that ID is not in
the database you really don't want the
page to render so you want to put exit
right here this page is really only
going to render if this variable set and
then if we find it in the database well
actually this would be for if the get
variable is not set
so that means you would say data to
render this page is missing
that means the get ID variable is not
set in the script which it always should
be but inside this condition where we're
going to access the database and see if
this item exists we might echo a message
and exit the script once again if we
find that this actual ID does not exist
in the system if it does exist in the
system then we'll get the information
out and let the page render so here
let's write our selves a comment okay so
here we have a comment to ourselves use
this variable to check to see if the ID
exists in the database if yes then get
the product details if no then exit this
script and give a message why right here
we're going to have the SQL query to the
database and your ID variable is already
cleansed you don't have to use anything
else on it so let's borrow this query
right here pop it right there and we
wanted to read select all products where
ID equals single quote single quote and
in between the single quotes you put
this ID variable that we've just
attained from the URL limit one
so select often products where ID equals
this dynamic variables ID limit 1 now
you can use this code here we have let's
just take that and use it let's take
those two lines pop them right under
that query so let's indent this so if
the product count is greater than zero
get all the product details
and right here we need the else
condition that would mean the item does
not exist so we can we can simply echo
out again and exit right here because at
this point you would know the item
doesn't exist so you can say that item
does not exist really these things
should never happen to people are using
you Sai correctly but you just want to
make little precautions and then you
exit you can give links there whatever
you want to do but here is where we're
going to focus our efforts to get the
data out of the get the data out of the
array that came from this query so we
can grab this while loop right here and
we're going to slim it down just a bit
because we're only going to need the
variables right there where it says get
all the product details pop in that
while loop you can get rid of that
dynamic list variable altogether now
let's indent this closing bracket for
that while loop that way we don't lose
ourselves here so the things we can get
out of the database are let me grab the
list right here let me just pop it right
there product name which we're already
getting we already have the ID so we
don't even need to access that their
product name price we're already getting
that details we need to access so let's
access that right here category and
subcategory let's access the two of
those as well
so make this one say details this one
category this one subcategory date added
we're already accessing and we're
actually making it human readable so
we're good to go right there now at this
point that's all you have to do within
your while loop because you're only
accessing one row from the database one
row of information and once you gather
these variables into local PHP variables
you can then use them down inside of
your script inside of your HTML rather
so you can just go ahead and remove this
PHP block that originated on the index
dot PHP page you can just remove it you
might want to keep that mysql closed tag
or mysql closed function by doing that
so you can have that mysql closed
function if you like right at the end
the very thing in your PHP block so do
you see let's make sure you guys can see
that if you need to that's a pretty
logical way to to set that script up we
have the product name now we can put
that in the page title this dynamic
title here can be product name put a
semicolon on that and use your PHP tab
to echo out right there and then in the
title tag you'll have that dynamic
product name for the page note you can
also put in meta tags for your
description and keywords and use these
variables peppered throughout alright
now I'm going to go into design view of
product that PHP I'm going to press ctrl
s just to save my work here
I'm going to go to code view Noah I said
I'm going to design view what you
smoking man all right so I'm going to
make this page look the way I would want
it to look for a product presentation
now my store my whole store is ghetto
and you would want to design your as a
whole lot nicer I'm doing a lot of
things very very basic to keep things
simple so what I'm going to do is I have
the image on that side here will be the
product name and I just statically wrote
these variables in but I'm going to go
into the code view in a second and echo
those variables out and right here my
Add to Cart button will be there
I'll have the Add to Cart button right
there when they click that they're going
to go to cart dot php' and here I'm just
going to do this real ghetto as well I'm
going to put a link to the actual image
on the server you know some people opt
to put some kind of fancy gallery there
for their items people can for Ag and
zoom in on them are definitely not going
to be showing you how to do that in this
lesson series alright so let's go into
the code view and bring this thing to
life there so right here where there's
that table that was commented out from
the index page you can totally remove
that I had that lingering but it serves
no purpose here so you can see there's
where the body tag starts there's our
header template coming in here's our div
ID for the page content there and our
two column table that's our two column
table right there so all we have to do
is make these render out so I'm going to
echo these
variables and these particular two
variables I'm going to encapsulate in
double quotes that way they render it's
the easiest way I think to render two
words together that are variables and
the others we're just going to leave the
way they are like details I'm just going
to put a semicolon and then highlight
the whole thing echo and that will echo
the details right there and the price is
well let's go echo and make sure we get
a little semicolon on there to break
this statement what else is there
product name that one as well it's going
to get echoed out all right now we got
to get some dynamics in that picture
right there we have to have the ID echo
out so let's type in that ID variable
semicolon highlight the semicolon and
the ID variable only echo so it'll go to
inventory images folder and grab that
dynamic ID jpg picture and then here's
the product name again so we can just
grab this echo here since it's the same
thing right there and I believe that is
it so now you just have to make get your
add to cart code and put it right there
which is very very simple so let's check
out the design there we go now all we
have to do is add the link to that image
so you can just grab that URL and right
where it says view full-size image in
that URL that's where you put that and I
know that's real ghetto but like I said
I'm doing things basic so when the user
wants to see the image both sides they
can click that and
we'll just be a little bit larger but
you can let your your store admin upload
any size picture that you deem necessary
for the store to be laid out and
designed the way you need you need
really big sharp images
then that's what you take in from your
admin system my admin system I wasn't
even regulating the picture size they
could have uploaded any size picture but
maybe you want to regulate to a certain
size or whatever you want to do I don't
know it's up to you I'm not going to
spend forever on this whole thing I'm
just going to cover the basics and move
along and I forgot my MySQL query let's
see I didn't connect to the database but
that's a simple fix
let's just open the index page and grab
the query line they're raw there now
we're going to sink in right above our
query actually we'll sink it in first
thing right there okay so this is what I
get which is exactly what I wanted if I
click this it shows me the Hat full size
you can also choose to make that a pop
up new window I'm just keeping it simple
so now it shows on the product page
black hat the title the price and looks
like we need to add the dollar sign bit
to the price down here right there so we
can put double quote double quote period
that'll put a dollar sign right in front
of that price variable refresh and there
you go there's your dollar sign so we
got $4.99 is price it's in the hats
clothing category subcategory you can
choose to display that or not but this
is the description this is a black cap
and that can be as long as you want so
in part 9 what we're going to do is
continue on and we'll get the Add to
Cart button in place that will lead the
shopper to the cart that you build
custom for your site so if we're in the
home page click any item you see
that's how it works so we just add to
once we get to Add to Cart button on
there with smooth sailing and this cool
black shirt duplex fifty-caliber up to
50 caliber bullets you might want to buy
that the end of times is coming alright
see you in part 9</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
