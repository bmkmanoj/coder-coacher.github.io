demonstrating how you can use the filter
effects to make things look really 3d
and what i'll do is just draw out a
rectangle get the roundness up on it and
then i'm going to punch a couple of
shapes in it the rectangle tool you just
can serve as my little view screen i'm
going to make like a little handheld
thing and held looking thing then we'll
grab a couple of ellipses place them in
there
set 50
50 it's about even demonstration
purposes doesn't have to be perfect
change your colors on these so you can
see them better okay now what we're
going to do is punch you'll use these to
punch holes into that shape or modify
combined actually I think you can go to
join and it punches them all out and
then or punches them all into that
bottom shape to where it makes nice
holes in it and then you go to filters
bevel and emboss inner bevel and you can
see it gives you kind of like a
pixelated bevel so what we'll do is
we'll adjust the inner bevel settings
now to make it just right so let me drag
this down so you can see i'm going to
double click inner bevel here and i'm
going to take this all the way up and
i'm going to take this so all the way up
and i'm going to take this all the way
up and i'm going to make this smooth
and the angle looks good and raised it's
what we want okay so now you can see how
it's starting to look 3d little already
and so what you can do now to make it a
look look a little more 3d is hit
another filter of interglobe and you can
see how it takes on a more of a 3d
metallic look then it glows a little
dark make it a little more opaque and
make it spread a little further
there you have it almost looks like
steel on there now see ya that's how you
can make things look nice and 3d and and
beveled out like the old fireworks used
to have a nicer bevel effect an easier
bevel filter to use this one you have to
kind of tweak it out to get it just the
way you want it to render the same way
that old devil affected in the old
fireworks but that's the way you can do
that you can also give it a drop shadow
to make it look a little more 3d and you
can do that to any shapes and it'll make
it look like lights hitting it from one
direction and it's shaded in another and
that's about it for that one will see
you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
