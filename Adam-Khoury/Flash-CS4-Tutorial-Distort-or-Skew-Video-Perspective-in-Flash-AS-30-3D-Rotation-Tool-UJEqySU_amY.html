you can learn how to distort the
perspective or the view on your movie
clips videos anything you want using the
3d rotation tool in cs4 and let's go
ahead and show you this thing playing so
you can see how video is playing in a in
a distorted perspective and that's
really hard to accomplish in cs3 but in
cs4 it makes it really easy if you
target Flash Player 10 ok the first
thing we're gonna do is here I'm in
fireworks and you can be in Photoshop
wherever you make your TV image and
press ctrl C and then one so it into
flash cs4 press ctrl V to paste it on
the stage there now you have it on stage
in your layer and now we just created a
new flash ActionScript 3 project and
flash cs4 here and there's the first
layer and we're in the main scene and so
I'm gonna take that movie clip we just
made and I'm going to convert it to a
movie clip the movie clip we just
imported from fireworks and I'm gonna
convert it to a movie clip and I'm gonna
call it TV I'm gonna press ok and now
it's a movie clip colty B and inside
we'll double click to go inside and
there's the original one when we click
that we import it we're gonna give it
another layer inside and that layer will
call vid play Bid play and this one
we'll just call TV graphics
and now we want to make a movie clip for
our video rectangle and draw it on the
stage there it's gonna have to be size
of your video at first so you go into
your properties my video is 320 by 240
so I go into my properties panel make
sure that symbol that I just rectangles
320 by 240 now when I create or when I
right-click this and convert this to a
symbol cold frame press ok and I give it
an instance name in my properties panel
of VI D underscore our AME did frame and
now all I got to do is pop my code in
there so let's make another layer for
the code and I've got my video code all
assembled here and if you want to get to
this code all you have to do is go to
develop PHP and download this source
tutorial files and there's my code and
this is instance name vid frame so now
the video should play at this point but
we're not done yet
so let's see if we render out okay
there's the video playing let's bring it
up one and that should be a good spot
okay now we're gonna resize it to fit
inside of that it's gonna loops before
we do that let's move the registration
dot to the top or the transform dot to
the top left now I'll pull it up to
where it fits right inside of the screen
and now it'll play when I press to
render the file out you see it's a
little distorted but that's okay because
we're going for the skewed effect anyway
now so we'll just go back out to the
main scene now you can press main scene
or double-click on anywhere outside of
the stage there and it'll bring it back
to the main scene and now you have both
the frame and the TV in its own movie
clip here and you press rotation 3d
rotation tool now with that now here's
where the magic happens you just skew it
or distort it or rotate it to the side
whatever you want to call whatever is
happening there and then now when we
publish out you can see we have a nice
skewed video playing and a skewed TV
both skewed at the exact proper angles
and you can skew this thing any way you
want you can move it up down and around
and let's do something crazy like that
see what happens
see that's funky fresh man you can't get
any easier than that in flash cs3 you
had to use something like paper vision
or Shh
I forget what it's called I think it's
flash shady flash sandy sandy flash
something like that but it lets you that
and paper vision will let you skew video
like this but it's a whole lot more
complicated and flash cs4 makes it
really easy so we hope you enjoyed this
one and to get to the code for the video
to play the video like I did so easily
and the video is just a to show you it's
in the directory sitting there and it's
called right there it's video dot flv
and the code I popped in there refers to
and you can get to the code by
downloading this tutorial ok we'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
