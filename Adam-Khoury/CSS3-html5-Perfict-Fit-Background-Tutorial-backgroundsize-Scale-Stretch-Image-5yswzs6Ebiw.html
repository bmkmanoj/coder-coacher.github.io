cat the world of web crafts and he asked
to see how I would make a web page with
the CSS background that scaled to fit in
the users screen no matter what size it
is so in this lesson you'll learn to
make a CSS background that scaled to fit
no matter what the device of people
looking at it with
before we discuss the code let's take a
look at the finished product now what
happens is regardless of the users
device whether it be a tablet or a
laptop or even a PC with a big old giant
screen with great resolution your
webpage background will fit in there
100% of the width and your content
notice my HTML content that's that black
text here it does not scale along with
everything else so that's the
functionality that we're looking for
we're looking for a background image
that scales a hundred percent
okay here we are starting with the bare
bones of an html5 web document so
whatever CSS I put within these curly
braces is going to be applied to the
body element on the page so I'm going to
start with the background :
now let's first target the URL now what
I'm going to do is use shorthand for the
background CSS you could use all the
longhand attributes but I'm just going
to use the shorthand method of setting
all of the background attributes
together in one line so I'll get the URL
which is this background here then the
color I want to be this hex value I want
no-repeat and I want it to be Center top
or you can just make that laptop it's
going to be in there 100% regardless so
it really doesn't matter how you set to
it now we put a semicolon and this next
line is really the magic behind it and
this is css3 background size property
now if we look at that in the browser
we'll see we got the results that we
wanted we wanted a width 100% for our
background image no matter what size the
user screen is no matter what device to
looking at it whit and remember this is
css3 this property right here but you
can test it in all the major browsers I
tested it in Firefox Internet Explorer
and courage and if it works in those
three browsers it's pretty much
guaranteed to work in every modern
browser that any device uses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
