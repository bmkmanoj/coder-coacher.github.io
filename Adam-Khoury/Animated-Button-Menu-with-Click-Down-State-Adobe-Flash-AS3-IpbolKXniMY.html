we'll be demonstrating how you can put a
click or a down effect in the timeline
of your animated movie clip buttons so
this is an example of an animated movie
clip button menu with the sound and you
can see that as I go over the the
buttons they have an over effect they
grow in an animated fashion and then
they shrink back in an animated fashion
when I release or when I roll out with
my mouse and the new part is when you
click now they get bigger within a
little animation and I send it to this
dynamic text field to say you clicked on
button one you clicked on button two you
clicked on button for you clicked on
button 3 and I made it do that so you
can understand how to utilize these
buttons so they're just not sitting here
and you don't know how to apply the code
to make it do things in your scene I set
the code up for you and so that's pretty
much it for the button it has a sound I
demonstrate how to put a sound on it and
make it have a click or a down effect as
well as an over and an out effect so
let's take a look at the Fla and the
code so if you go inside it each button
is set up exactly the same inside each
button is a movie clip this one is
instance name of button 1 in the
properties inspector this one has an
instance name of button 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and if
you click on one or any one of those
buttons you go inside of it you'll see
that there's three States now we have R
over R out that we had originally from
our first tutorial and now I added the
click state and the click state is the
third state there and that happens when
the user clicks the button we instruct
it using the action script
in the parent scene right here seeing
one right now we're inside of button one
the movie clip so here we have a stop
action there's a stop action and there's
a stop action you'll notice there's no
stop action on the last one because I
wanted to loop and stop back on frame
one it'll hit this stop action I wanted
to not stop here and stop here so I
don't put a stop action here if I wanted
it to stop here on this last frame then
I would make keyframe and put a stop
action there but I don't want that so
what happens is actually you already saw
what happens so let's go look at the
code so the code is setup to engage
these buttons and go inside of them and
do certain things so I commented above
all of the sections of importance here
where you might need to understand what
the codes doing there and then there's
three event listeners and there's three
functions for each button setup and I
only commented the first the whole set
for button one button two three and four
more compact down there to save space
and you can understand what they're
doing by what button one's comments here
and if you have any trouble just get
into the forum there and we'll try and
get you an answer as quickly as possible
and see if there's anything else I need
to discuss this one's pretty simple one
of our forum members actually requested
that we take the tutorial a little bit
further because the they didn't
understand how to make a click effect
there but now this should clear it all
up and show you how to get a quick
effect that's animated as well and
there's a whole lot of different ways to
skin a cat in flash but that's just one
method of making your button menu nice
and animated
and maybe in a future tutorial will show
you how to when the button one is rolled
over to make button two three and four
move out the way a little bit then one
button two is rolled over will make
button one three and four move away a
little bit that's always a cool effect
you see that on a lot of nice
flashlights okay we'll see you guys next
