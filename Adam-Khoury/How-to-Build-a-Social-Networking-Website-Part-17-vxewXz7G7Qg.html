dynamic member community social
networking website in PHP and MySQL and
in this part we're going to focus on
tightening up the profile display page
you can see I already tightened it up
and i'm going to show you what i did to
the source file and you'll be able to
get the source file if you're watching
the video now you can go to web
intersect calm and get the free source
file package to view the adjustments
I've made and I will be discussing them
here too and so you'll see in the
profile edit page I added the the line
we needed to show when the member join I
also added a line here for Adam Cory's
blurbs blabs whatever we want to call it
and I think I'm going to put a button up
top here soon it says start blabbing and
it'll be our form of tweeting so the
site will operate very much in the same
way that Twitter does when it's all said
and done so and so will show you the
structuring out the profile edit page
better displaying the bio now and I take
care of line breaks double line breaks
and the apostrophe mess that a lot of
people deal with that problem with
apostrophes and line breaks when it
comes to displaying and storing their
database text field and I'll also show
you how to display alternate content in
case the user doesn't have a youtube
channel we want to make sure that we
show nothing in that area or show
something else so inside of the script
you can see if you go into this design
view Dreamweaver you'll see how I
adjusted the table to now display the
data better and all the data and some
titles and stuff see now we have titles
for sections so this is location details
about and blabs labs will be coming in
part 18 and I'm going to show you
Twitter functionality show you how to
make a twitter clone and so what we do
here is we just set up all the PHP print
functions to display where we need them
to with the correct data that we need to
display and if you look at the source
code you see I'm just printing out all
those little pieces of information that
we gathered from this mysql database
query within the while loop and so what
I adjusted in the top portion inside the
while loop where we gather all the the
member data I added the sign update let
me show that now on the page and the way
I set everything up on the design of the
page within this table it pushes all the
data down so in my about me section if I
have eight paragraphs it'll push the
blabs down and i'm going to show you in
the blab section how to make a Content
scroller that way it won't really make
the page way too long if you choose to
do that for any of your content you can
and so that'll be in part 18 or 19
whatever see how far we get in the next
and so we put the member since sign up
date gets displayed here there YouTube
is right in between that so now I'm
going to show you how to set up the
alternate content within an if Modell's
conditional sort of like we did for the
image but now we're going to see if they
have data in the database that may not
be present we want to make sure we
account for that in the design of the
display of the of their profile okay now
this is going to be oh so simple because
we already have a mechanism that's
checking to show alternate content
already for the picture so let's just
copy that one paste it in under it and
let's rename what it says mechanism to
display
youtube channel or not very simple okay
so we'll get rid of these two variables
because we do not need them and we just
have to change this if condition right
here so let's grab this YouTube all
right y'all control see if you too
equals nothing then we're going to show
make a new variable name let's call it
youtube channel
equals this user has no channel yet
there's no YouTube channel yet and then
if they do we're going to grab this
strip this embed script that we all
learned about earlier in the series and
right here will change this to channel
which I easy this is let me just remove
the whole thing or copy it rather
control C pop it right in there in
between single quotes this time though
so just put single quote single quote
put it right in and right here where we
have PHP print we're going to remove
that remove the double quotes we don't
need this PHP or the semicolon so now
all we have to do is go over here and
put in
a single quote space period face and on
the other side of the variable space
period space single quote and that way
that variable right here will dissipate
display correctly so we're going to say
YouTube they're not channel now down in
the page so that will put their YouTube
right in that line where it needs to be
now here down the page we want to print
out YouTube channel change that's
youtube channel and now in the page
where are we right here we'll remove all
this do not needed I'm just going to
print out the whole YouTube channel
right there and I tried to structure out
the little table this table right here
it displays everything it's very small
this page is very lightweight and so
let's see when we have here make sure
this is all good youtube channel yep
save it let's ftp it and we'll check
okay view my profile and sure enough
there it is now let's view somebody's
profile that just joined or something
may not have a channel well that person
has a channel let's see somebody else
okay why would he have my channel
oh I see because I had mine set just
temporarily to show my channel in case
somebody had one right there and that if
conditional so let's move that and now
put up the profile page now refresh that
user see this user has no YouTube
channel yet and now all we have to do a
little line break right there now put it
up and refresh it and it put a little
space there that's it now if you go and
you view your channel you hear your
channel displays if you have a youtube
account and I'm sorry when you go to
your profile your channel will display
if you have a youtube account and if
you've inserted it into the edit profile
page okay so that pretty much shows you
the adjustments I've made on the profile
PHP page and the script adjustments
necessary to show alternate content okie
dokie so in part 18 what we're going to
do is show you how to set up some
Twitter functionality and make a really
active hopefully active site where
people will just be blabbing it's not
going to be tweeting on my site that web
intersect it's going to be blabbing and
we're going to make fun of Twitter a
little bit cuz</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
