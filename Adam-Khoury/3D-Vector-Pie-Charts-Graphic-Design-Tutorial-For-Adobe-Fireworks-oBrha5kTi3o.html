design lesson you can learn to make 3d
vector pie charts the vector pie chart
you see here is where you will learn to
design in this video lesson create new
fireworks document PNG and I'm going to
make my width about 1200 and my height
may be 700 resolution 72 okay I'm going
to make my canvas white and the first
thing I'll do is go to my shapes and
grab an ellipse and I'm going to hold
shift as I draw my ellipse and if you
want to have your tool tips go to view
and make sure tooltips is selected then
you'll have those little numbers next to
your mouse like I do I'm going to draw
my ellipse out holding shift as I draw
to make sure it stays in a perfect
circle and I can make it any size that I
want but I want to make sure it has even
numbers so 542 that's fine
just as long as the numbers are even now
I'm going to take it drag it to the
middle and I'll see it when it's in the
middle I'll see a line show up letting
me know that I'm in the exact middle of
my canvas then I'm going to grab another
ellipse and that's going to be a very
small one in the center of that one you
can make it any size turn it black and
then just take the width make it about
eight and the height about eight as well
because you just want it to be a small
dot now you grab that dot you can move
it around within that bigger ellipse and
you put it in the center you'll see when
it's in the center you'll have a little
crosshair show up then let go right
there then you'll know you're in the
dead center of that bigger ellipse now
we can start drawing in our colored pie
shapes or wedges so we'll grab the pen
tool and we'll start right here
somewhere down on this angle you can
start any angle that you want really
click down let go and go to the very
center of the black dot click down let
go and then make any angle that you want
for that pie shape I'll make mine about
like that click down let go but the last
line let's connect it all and when you
click down this time hold it and drag
the line and you can make it bulge out a
little so it's not up in the shape like
that you want it outside the yellow
shape if you left it like that it would
be inside the yellow shape it wouldn't
make a
a nice wedge that you need to just bulge
it out it doesn't even have to match the
curve of the inner shape or the curve of
this ellipse that we started with
because we're going to crop it anyway to
match that curve perfectly now you can
take that and make it the color that you
want it to be so I'll make that one
green now I'm going to make my next pie
shape using that same method so I'll hit
the pen tool and I'll go here next to
this point or basically right on top of
this point I'll click down let go then
I'll go to the center again click down
let go and then make any angle that you
want once again click down let go and on
the last point when you connect
everything hold and drag and then you
can make that shape any color you want
let's make that one Brewer and if it has
an edge on it you can take that edge off
okay now I'm going to make one more
wedge using that same method okay so I
have all of my wedges in place and your
angles don't have to be precise for this
type of graphic because with these in
the end they're going to be pulled apart
a little bit anyway now to get these cut
out to where they're a more precise
wedge shape is simple you can just grab
the yellow shape in the back press
ctrl-c and ctrl-v now you've just placed
a copy of it on top of itself take the
new copy of the yellow shape hold down
ctrl shift and hit your up arrow key
holding ctrl shift and hitting your up
arrow key is bring to front or you can
use these buttons up here does one of
these does bring to front and once you
have that in the front you can select it
and the shape that you want to crop by
holding shift to select them together
you can hold shift to select things
together so I have those two items
selected I'm going to go up to modify
combine paths and crop now I'm going to
highlight the yellow shape again ctrl-c
ctrl-v
bring it to front control shift up arrow
key and then hit it and the shape that I
want to crop and modify combine paths
crop last one for the green one control
C control V bring the yellow shape to
front the new yellow shape then we'll
highlight it and the piece that we want
to crop modify combine paths crop now
we'll punch this last shape because it's
still a solid ellipse of full ellipse
you don't want to really move it I was
just showing you what I have there but
we want to punch that one out so what
we'll do is grab the
tool will start right here then we'll go
up to the center click down let go
follow this red line up click down let
go and then just make a shape that goes
all the way around and you'll have
something like that and it doesn't even
have to be very precise so what you can
do is grab this end this shape together
go to modify combine paths and punch so
now you don't want to move yours but
I'll show you what I have okay I'll put
those all back where they were and what
I'll do is zoom in I'll select one of
these and zoom in on it now click that
black dot in the center and press
control X to get it out of there and you
can zoom in by holding ctrl and mouse
wheel when you have any object selected
you zoom in on it now what you'll do is
highlight all of those items together
and move them over to the side over here
and you'll want to keep those in case
the angles and the depth that you create
is not exactly what you want so you want
to keep this one kind of as a master so
you press ctrl-c ctrl-v copy all of
those things and we'll move them over to
the side over here now what we're going
to do with all the DS selected is we'll
go up into the distort tool while
they're all still selected and then
we'll it on a set on its side so
we'll make the sphere looks like it's
laying at a 3d perspective and you can
really drag it to be any 3d view or
perspective that you want I'll go up to
my pointer tool they're all still
selected I can just grab them and move
them anywhere I want to put them now
let's make sure those four items are
highlighted and we'll go to filters
shadow and glow solid shadow and we'll
make it a solid color we'll just make it
like a grey at first now what you're
going to want to do is change the angle
and the distance so you put the angle to
where it's going down something like
that around 270 is straight down 90 is
straight up but you can really choose
any angle that you want and the distance
let's just make that a little bit
greater so something like that that way
you have nice thick pie wedges then you
press ok now the ones that
should be on the front we're going to
bring those two front for instance this
blue one should be front two let's press
control hold control shift and hit the
up arrow key on that blue one now
everything looks pretty good it looks
like a 3d disc but if you were to take
these and move these now you'll see what
you have you have like chunks now but
don't move them you can leave them in a
nice shape like that until the end now
for each one of these you want to make
sure this solid shadow and you have to
do it separately or else they'll get the
same color so what you'll do is you
select one I have the green one selected
I'm going to go to its solid shadow but
change it from grey to green press ok
and you can even make it a little bit of
a darker green if you like so let's go
to solid shadow again and let's darken
the screen just a little bit okay then
press ok and there now I'll do the same
thing to the blue one solid shadow make
it match this blue then highlight it
again go to the color wheel and make it
just a tad bit darker okay okay now do
the same thing to the red and now
finally the yellow now let's select the
green one once again and let's go to its
bill change it from solid to gradient
ellipse and let's put the ellipse where
the brightest point of the white on the
ellipse is right in the middle and what
you can do is you can make that a bright
green if you like instead of a white
instead of solid white it could be like
a bright green like that and then you
adjust your ellipse so you hold one
point and hold shift so your ellipse is
perfect if you hold shift your ellipse
will grow in proportion do it to where
it about hits the edge right about there
the blue one I'll do the same thing go
to solid fill change it to gradient
ellipse and put that right in the center
there and then change from white to a
very very bright blue looks like it even
needs to be brighter than that
so let's brighten that up a little bit
okay and then you can manipulate the
ellipse by holding shift and dragging
one end until it about reaches the end
there I'm going to do the same thing to
the red
and the yellow and for the yellow one
I'm just going to use white in the
center so I'll go to the lips and I'll
leave it white and then I'll just make
the ellipse grow until it's about more
towards the edge like the other ones
maybe that's too much for that one right
about something like that now let's take
these and move them slightly apart and
you can use your arrow keys if you don't
want to move them too much you can
highlight one and just move it up a
little bit then move it over using your
arrow keys do the same thing to the red
one just move it out down maybe same to
the blue and then you can you can really
just drag them if you want move the blue
over this way a little bit I'm going to
highlight all of these again
independently so I'll start with the
green one I'm going to give it a new
filter shadow and glow inner shadow I'm
going to make sure the angle on the
inner shadow is coming from the bottom
of the pie shape so you see my black is
inner shadow is on the bottom of the
piece I'm going to make it come up a
little higher into that piece and then
make it spread or fade into it a little
bit better something like that and you
can take the opacity down a little bit
if you don't want it so dark I'm going
to do that for the others as well making
sure that the shadow is always coming
from the bottom up and that gives you
something like that now you can really
take a lot more time to put a lot of
effects on these things and you can even
put lines here and you can put white
shapes if you wanted these to have a
more jelly-like appearance but I want
mine to have a more plastic cut look I
want it to look like a plastic pie
that's just cut up plastic or metal or
whatever I don't want it to look like
jelly I can go and grab this green one
and zoom in by holding ctrl and Mouse
wheeling in and I can make a line just a
very basic line by dragging it from one
end to the other where I wanted to live
and then I could change it to be any
color I want like that dark green right
there so you see what that does it gives
my little shape more of an edge if you
want to have those on there you can
change the points just grab it hit the
sub selection tool and move
these points if you don't get them
precisely where you want them let's see
what that looks like
okay so that's the yellow one all I need
is one line here for the red one let's
see what we have now you can see they
look a little more cut and clean now
this one is actually a little bit too
dark let's lighten that up a little you
don't want them too dark if you make
them too light you won't be able to see
them now you can grab all of these
shapes together by making a box around
them like this make sure you don't hit
this yellow one over here just grab all
these shapes and then you can press
ctrl-g to make a group out of them now
you can move the whole group around
let's get this thing out of the way a
little bit
over there now you can just move this
group around anywhere you want now when
we shrink this down it won't have any
jagged edges or anything it'll look
really sharp since we made it pretty big
and we're not going to have it that big
on a webpage when we shrink it down to
be the size it needs to be on a webpage
it's going to look smooth so what I'll
do is I'll just draw a rectangle maybe
something like that and I want to have a
fill of gradient radial and I'll just
make it gray where it is red there
something like that and then I'm going
to highlight my nice little three-d pie
chart press ctrl-c ctrl-v
bring it over here bring the front
control shift up arrow key and then hit
modify flatten selection now it's a
flattened bitmap so now when I shrink it
it'll look really good so I'll go to
scale tool shrink it down to the size it
needs to display on the web and right
about like that now I can highlight it
and then go to filters shadow and glow
and drop shadow and the whole thing and
I'm going to make it drop a little bit
further and I don't want my shadows so
dark so I'll bring the opacity I like
that and if you want you can even take
the little shape a speech bubble or is
that talking put it up there
shrink it to the size it needs to be
whatever size you want it to be over
there then you can grab this point and
move it around you have something like
that and then you can put numbers in
there or words or whatever you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
