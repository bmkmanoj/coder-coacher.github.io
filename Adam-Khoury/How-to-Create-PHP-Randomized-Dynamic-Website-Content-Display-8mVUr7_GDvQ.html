lesson I know what you're thinking whoo
ah this is great another one by Adam
rock and roll I'm glad you're excited
because I am too
now this one's very simple and I'm gonna
be showing you how to create randomized
content on your page so you can make
your page unstated websites I go to and
my friends they own websites they say
hello check out my website then I go a
month two months later I go check out
their website and it's the same exact
 on their homepage with the food man
one line of PHP code and I can show you
how to remedy this a couple of banners
one line of PHP code and you can stop
having a stale website let's get started
okay now this little package will be
available for download that way if
anybody wants to see the structure of
the images folder the banners at the
four banners that I have the way my
sample webpage is you can just grab it
snatch it up and check it out but you
really don't need to because this is so
easy
alright so let's check out what we have
here
let's press refresh and we'll see that
this number will change this random
number what there is is one line of PHP
that creates a random number between one
and four in my case because I only have
four banners but if you had 20 banners
you would make it one through 20 a
random number in between 1 and 20 or
whatever however many images you got and
so let's press refresh and see what
happens you can see it changes the
random number between 1 and 4 to a new
number each time and what I did was make
it call in a new banner with each number
and as long
the banners are named correctly they'll
come in dynamically so you can set your
homepage to run like this and each time
somebody refreshes or comes to the page
it will show new content and it'll just
look a little more alive and a little
more intelligent okay let's look at the
code now alright in the let's go to okay
let's go to the code view and what I
have is a test that PHP page here if we
go to open
okay so here's test PHP and this would
be maybe your home page or your contact
page any page you want and say you had
an images folder on your server that's
where I have my four banners
right inside that images folder let me
go to all files and you'll see them
banner one two three and four so up on
my server that's what I have in the
images folder and here's my simple page
it's called test up PHP and here's the
inner-workings of that script let me
minimize this down now the first line is
opening the PHP block third line closes
the PHP block the second line the one in
the center we have a number variable
here that I just named num my variable
that holds the random number is named
num and it's equal to the random number
function in PHP with given arguments of
one and four which means it's going to
create a random number between 1 and 4
if I change this to 100 that will be
between 1 and 100 it's very easy the way
that works so one in four and then down
here we have a regular web page type
setup and I show you how to echo out
that number so here in the text random
number this time equals boom we echo it
out right there
and then here's the here's the magic
part where you're creating your image
where your image is coming in if you
want it to be different size banners
then just don't claim the width and
height attribute for the image tag you
know how you can claim with to be
something solid we're just going to
leave it open so that way it doesn't
restrict the sizes of each banner might
be different sizes okay so all you do is
make sure your banners are names
correctly minor name banner one two
three and four so all I have to do is
say image source equals images folder
banner random number
jpg it's that easy you echo out the rim
number right there at that JPEG so
banner one two and three and four is
always going to be coming in but it's
always going to be randomized and you
can even put the alt let's echo this out
right here correctly well echo out for
the alt tag banner number whatever
whatever the random number is and that
is a it's very easy and I'm also going
to show a how to do this in flash for
all you guys with full flash websites if
you want to keep your homepage on stay
I'll show you how in the very next
lesson I'm going to do that for Flash
cs3 and cs4 okay goodbye I love you and
I want to kiss you in the mouth with
tongue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
