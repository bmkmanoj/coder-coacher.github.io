thousand members you can see right here
we have over a thousand members now I
thought I would give you guys a special
treat and show you how to code out by
now buttons for PayPal Buy Now buttons
in flash ActionScript 3 so you can use
it in cs3 and cs4 and the code is pretty
simple it's just a function that we're
gonna make for this button here and this
is just like any other button you would
have in flash and I made it animate you
see you know that the little widget the
little green widget spins around and the
Buy Now button flashes since we're in
flash and we can animate things why not
we'll catch the users eye so close this
out okay so all you need to know is that
this is a button layer and this is a
details layer and in the details layer
you would put your price right there and
any price you want would go on the Buy
Now button because you never see PayPal
by now buttons with the price actually
on it that would be pretty cool and
unique or you can put the price off here
to the side whatever you want to do but
let's go ahead and show you how to code
it out and thanks everybody for joining
up and getting active on the site and
staying
all right right okay I'm gonna better
not gonna fix what's wrong you're doing
that's right sir my UI
it goes forever personally
the burners really
by needles your outgoings you out
battles it goes new you our battles
okay
now we all we have to do is add our
event listener we're done so let's go
down here under the curly brace that
closes the function and we'll type in by
now down oops sorry
by now underscore BTN which is the
instance name on our Buy Now button on
stage dot add event listener parentheses
Mouse event
dot click and the function name is by
now down close parentheses that's it and
put in your semicolon and that's it all
done so now like I said all these
variables you can read up on what
variables you send to PayPal and what
kind of values you can have in them at
the PayPal documentation online at their
site but this is the way you would code
it out in oops I got a small P there
let's put a big P babe small p there too
ok now it's good like I said I'll put
the comments in above the the lines what
you need to see what's going on but
anyhow I just wanted to thank you guys
for being active on the site and I hope
this one proves useful to a few of you
and we'll see you next lesson you can
get this fla at developed PHP comm if
you couldn't see or hear what I was
doing in the code
ok bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
