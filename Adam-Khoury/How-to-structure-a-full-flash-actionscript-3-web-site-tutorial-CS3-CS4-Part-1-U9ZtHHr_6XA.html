members have requested that we show an
example or set up a little tutorial file
here on how to set up the structure of a
full flash website because all the files
that you can download three at our site
you know it's all kind of cool menus and
multimedia players and things of that
nature there's no tutorial yet of how to
put all those things into a whole site
make it all tie together with a button
menu and everything so that's what we're
gonna do and there might be two parts to
this because it might take a little
while but the first thing we'll do is
you'll see I started a new file here and
here's my layer one on my scene 1 so I
just started and I set it to 500 by 400
just to keep it in to where I can lay it
in the demo section at develop PHP and I
set my framerate to 20 and I put a black
background and that's where I'm at so
what I'm gonna do is I downloaded the
as3 preloader from develop PHP and I'm
gonna take these frames here I'm gonna
copy them write all of those except file
content so I take I highlight all the
frames by dragging highlight all the
frames except for the file content layer
and then I'm gonna right-click the
selected frames and copy copy frames
then you go into your new file and you
make enough layers to where they'll all
fit in there and you highlight enough to
where you can paste them in and you say
paste frames in the right-click this
time and there they are so you have all
the frames and now you have layer 1
sitting here on the bottom and let's
just call that content now you can
double click it and rename it content
and that's where the site content will
go then you highlight these 4 layers
here to remove the keyframe or the frame
2 on them so you remove all the frames
that way these four layers
only have one keyframe and they're empty
on frame two because on frame - we're
gonna make a keyframe now by pressing f6
make a keyframe on the content layer
frame two and now we have a free loader
all set up and ready to go now all we do
is just put in a movie clip which will
be our whole site and I'm going to make
a background and I'm gonna make it a
little rounded give it an edge of gray
and a back of darker gray let's make it
one point five on the edge so it's
smooth and bring this down a little and
it's gonna be like a mini site your site
would obviously be much bigger you can
make it up to a thousand wide nowadays
and and feel pretty secure about most
people being able to see it real well
but if you want to stay real safe 768
why does the you know there's still a
lot of people on small monitors and such
okay so now what we want to do now we
have that in there we're gonna select it
right-click it and convert to symbol
this is gonna be a movie clip and call
it entire site it's a movie clip
registration top left press ok and now
double click and now structure out your
pages so what we'll do here is we'll
make a new layer and we're gonna call it
menu button menu button menu and what
we'll do is we'll go and we'll get the
button menu here let's just go ahead and
call this one background
and go to develop PHP comm and download
the the animated buttons menu here and
then you can go ahead and grab all these
buttons I'm just gonna highlight these
two frames and I'm going to copy frames
then I'm gonna go into my my site my new
site here and I'm going to go to insert
new symbol movie clip and I'm gonna call
it my menu
press ok and now here you are inside
your new movie clip that's not on the
stage yet
this is gonna be compiled into the
library when we're done so we add a new
layer and now we paste those frames that
we copied pasted frames and there's the
buttons we don't need these words here
get rid of that we don't need that
either and we don't need the background
all we need are the buttons so what you
can do is go back to scene one and you
go back into your movie clip and on the
your content while we clip and on your
button menu you just drag out from the
library open up your library and you
drag out that new my menu movie clip
that you just made and voila ok now we
have a menu for our website so you see
how I'm doing this this isn't a movie a
movie clip all of its own and what this
will do is inside the movie clip is
where the buttons are coded right there
and these buttons will control the pages
pages I'm gonna go ahead and set up here
in a second but let's go ahead and put
another layer call it pages
okay this is where we'll end right here
and I'm going to continue in a part two
I like so look for part two and right
under this one on the page and develop
PHP and you can keep walking through
this with me okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
