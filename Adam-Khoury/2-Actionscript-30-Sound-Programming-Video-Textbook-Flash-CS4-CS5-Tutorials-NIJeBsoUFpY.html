point on programming video textbook in
which we are teaching sound programming
in flash from head to toe in the first
lesson we showed how to get sounds place
manually in your timeline for a simple
thing like applying button sounds or
applying a sound to follow along with an
animation that you create in the second
lesson we will demonstrate the two ways
in which applies programmer to ready a
sound for actionscript-3 control which
is handling the sounds through code and
that is how we get access to volume
control visualization rendering track
cking sound panning and much more ok
let's create a new flash actionscript 3
file and so the point of this lesson is
to show you the two ways in which you
can ready a sound for full on
actionscript-3 control so i'm going to
save this file to a specific location on
my computer on my desktop I have this
folder called example inside that folder
called example I have another folder
called mp3 files so along with that mp3
files folder in the example folder on my
desktop I'm going to place this file I'm
going to call it sound example one save
ok so the first way to load a sound into
flash and get it ready for full on
actionscript-3 control is to use a sound
object so what we'll do is type in bar
will call it snd colon sound equals new
sound object the next thing we need is
the URL request to grab the mp3 out of
that folder that I have sitting there
called mp3 files so let's type in bar r
eq colon URL request equals new URL
request and then in between parentheses
we put a set of double quotes and then
we put the path mp3 files that was my
folder name forward slash cowboys from
hell mp3 and make sure you put a
semicolon on the end now we're going to
load that URL request
into our sound object so we type in snd
download in between parentheses here
we're going to type in our eq which is
our URL request so at this point your
sound is loaded into flash and ready to
go so you have to do is command it to
place so you say snd la open close
parenthesis semicolon now let's press
ctrl enter and let's see if we have a
sound play okay so that's the first
method to get a sound ready for full on
actionscript-3 control ok now let's
remove all that code will show you the
second method press ctrl enter you'll
see nothing place it's all empty now the
second method I'm going to show you is
for people who might not have the
privilege of streaming the URL
externally like streaming the mp3 file
externally from the URL request which is
the preferred method if you're building
something like mp3 players or even if
you have mp3 song playing on your
website without an mp3 player you still
might want to stream it from the server
so using the URL request method in the
sound object is the way to do that but
some people might not have access to
streaming from the server they might
have to put the file directly in the
library so let's take that same song
file import into library go to mp3 files
in for cowboys from hell and once it's
in the library when open my library and
right click on it way at the bottom it
says properties click on that then here
where it says export for action script
click that and then right here where it
says class name that whatever you want
I'm going to name it my track okay and
then it's going to give you a dialogue
that says the definition for this class
could not be bound so it'll be created
automatically okay now in the code you
can just type in bar snd colon my track
is equal to new my track open close
parenthesis semicolon next line snd play
pretty much the same thing we did before
but now we're using a library of sound
file which can be full mp3 whatever you
want those
control enter now you can control this
using the sound object sound channel or
whatever you want to do so you can put
visualizations on this sound playing
control the volume panning everything
you want to do even with the sound
channel and everything from a an mp3
file that's in your library I just
wanted to throw this method out there in
case somebody doesn't have the privilege
of streaming using the URL request which
again I will say is the preferred method
for dealing with sound so let's say you
have that song playing and maybe you
have all these frames out here in your
flash file and a 150 you have a stop
command and maybe at frame 80 you want
to stop that sound from playing so right
now if I press control enter song will
just keep going to go until the end of
the song
to stop any sounds that are playing in
your file you can type this in sound
make sure that stop all wherever you
want any part of your timeline any part
of your code you can watch what happens
see it just shut right off so you can
use sound mixer dot stop all to stop all
sounds that are currently playing in
your file I just want to throw that in
there we're not going to really be using
that method very much because we're
going to be programming buttons like
play and stop buttons and things like
that because normally when you're
dealing with sound you're you know
you're building an mp3 player or you're
having sound play on your website in
which case you want to give people pull
as buttons or stop and play buttons and
things like that all right so that
lesson shows you the two methods you can
use to ready a sound or full-on
actionscript control</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
