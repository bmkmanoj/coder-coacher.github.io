you'll be learning how to create and
inspire work cs4 tutorial hearts
intertwined hello everybody Adam a flash
building here with another fireworks cs4
tutorial and in this lesson I'll show
you how to interweave or interlace your
custom shapes and custom graphics that
you create and have filter effects on
them and such and this lesson is for a
buddy of mine who was having trouble
getting items to interlace that were
that had heavy filter effects on them so
that's what we'll show you how to do so
first thing we'll do is go into the
shapes menu and we'll grab out that
heart right there and I'll show you how
to enter interlace or interweave hearts
or any shapes you have so I'm just going
to get the set up and so now I have a
heart stock shape that i manipulated the
vertex and the vertex arc just a little
bit you see how the vertex arc
manipulates that heart won't mind about
like that and a little stubby guy
now press ctrl-c ctrl-v pop it right on
top of itself and then I'm going to
shrink the inner heart the one on top
and a little bit more let's make it nice
thick edges so our filter effects show
through nice ok now let's grab both of
those you just drag or select multiple
by holding shift and then modify
combined paths and punch so now we have
one there and this press ctrl-c ctrl-v
put a duplicate right there okay now
just to be a little extra cutesy going
to them each to the side sku them a
little bit there we go
and now we'll add some filter effects
let's see let's go to inner bevel i'm
going to show you that the problem that
happens that occurs for a lot of people
when they try and have nice custom
graphics let's turn this one blue okay
so what you want to do is to set this up
right look in the layers you see has the
gold one on top and the blue one on the
bottom so you just ctrl-c ctrl-v see the
gold one there make sure there's one on
the bottom or move the blue one up hello
there it is or you can just do it on
stage or you can drag the layers up here
just make sure the blue ones in the
middle of the two gold copies there and
so now we can take out the pen or any
kind of shape that you want to place
over this because it doesn't have to be
very precise just so it fills that area
that needs to be masked let's give it a
solid fill of white and no edge and now
we grab this and this together and go to
modify mask group as mask now let's see
is the big hang-up when you have filter
effects on your objects it shows that
part of the mask as a uncombined part of
the shape and it bevels it all on its
own like it's it's own little piece you
don't want that and that's a big problem
a lot of people have so to get over that
all you have to do is let's backtrack
out of that and
tell you what let's go add some let's
get rid of that devil add some photoshop
effects photoshop live effects let's try
inner glow bevel and emboss satin and
color overlay it's beautiful ok
now with this one will edit the
photoshop live effects go to the color
overlay let's get it back to our orange
and now let's get this one actually I
like that it looks good so now if you
try to do the masking again you'd have a
hard time we got to make sure that this
layer let's remove this old one put this
one back and now let's make sure we get
another one on the bottom again ctrl-c
ctrl-v highlight it press ctrl shift
down arrow key you can see how the red
ones in the middle there grab this grab
this modify mask group is mask see the
problem again okay so we back out all we
have to do to overcome that is go you
can either flatten each of these modify
flatten modify Latin
and then it will work going to modify
mask Gruber's mask so you see there we
have hearts intertwined and they have
nice filter effects on them and so if
you had any trouble if you ever using
the the masking techniques in fireworks
if you ever had trouble applying it to
objects that had nice filter effects on
them there's your fix okay so we hope
you enjoyed that one and we'll see you
