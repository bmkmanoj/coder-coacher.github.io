before we begin the lesson let's take a
look at the finished product of what
you'll be learning to program in the
lesson it's a little application that
calculates the monthly payment for a
loan so if we put in a number of two
thousand two thousand dollar loan and an
interest rate of 10 percent spread over
only one payment then the person will
owe two thousand two hundred back
because two hundred is ten percent of
two thousand but they split that payment
between two months then it becomes one
thousand one hundred and so on and so
forth as the months go we're going to
begin with the bare bones of an html5
document mind is named example dot HTML
and you can name yours whatever you like
first thing we'll do is go into the body
element and we're going to place those
three fields those numeric fields that
we need and all three are going to be
number type fields and we're going to
put those within little paragraph
elements just to space them apart so we
have the loan amount and that's an input
with an ID of amount and its type is
number the minimum that the loan amount
can be is one dollar and the maximum is
$1,000,000 now when anybody changes the
value within that we're going to make
the compute loan function run and that's
going to be the focus of the lesson is
to show you how to program the computer
own function and that's all it is is
three numeric fields to take in the
amount of the loan the interest rate and
how many months that the loan is to be
spread over how many payments the user
is going to make on the loan and then
finally we have an h2 element that's the
one that showed the actual monthly
payment that's where we're going to
render our monthly payment inside of the
compute loan function so what we have to
do now is create the compute loan
function which is going to compute all
of these values before we do that let's
inspect have our HTML renders okay
that's exactly what we want and these
are number so they'll have step
if you have a modern browser it should
have little steppers on the side or if
it doesn't have that the user can just
type in whatever number they want right
there now let's get this compute loan
function in place go up into our head
element and inside of our scripting
element will type in function compute
loan opening curly brace and closing
curly brace now you can see that in all
of these HTML elements they're given the
on change event so anytime anybody
changes any one of those three the
compute loan function is going to
execute it's going to fire off so the
first thing we do inside of the compute
loan function is we gather up the
variables needed the values from all
three of those input fields so you can
see we're getting element by ID name of
amount interest rate and months that's
these three right here and we're putting
them into local JavaScript variables
called amount interest rate and months
that gives you the values of those
fields now the next line we're going to
calculate the interest for the loan so
we put in this variable we'll name it
interest and what we do is we take the
full amount of the loan and we multiply
it by the interest rate times point zero
one so when you take the interest rate
times point zero one all it does is it
moves the decimal over two places and
this pretty much just creates a numeric
percentage from the interest rate value
so you take the amount and you multiply
it by the interest rate percentage and
then you divide that by months and that
gives you the amount of dollars in
interest now the next thing we do is we
calculate their monthly payment we
create a variable called payment and
that's going to be equal to the amount
divided by the months and then you just
add the interest and we use the two
fixed method here on that number to make
sure it's only a decimal point with two
values behind it like money format and
one more line for formatting it like
money is this line so all this line does
is it adds a
, for the thousands between every three
digits in the in the string and then
finally in this payment display
container we're going to make the
monthly payment render there so we say
document.getelementbyid e the payment
element which is this one it's innerhtml
is going to say monthly payment is equal
to whatever the calculated payment is as
the user is adjusting all of these
little form controls so now let's save
that and let's test to see if we have a
working application you test this in
your favorite browser and I'm going to
put a loan amount of $2,000 and the
interest rate is 10 by default and since
it's only set to one month that means
the monthly payment is going to be the
full amount plus the interest but if the
user wants to spread that over 10 months
then you'll see their payment only 220
dollars and you can adjust the default
values for the for instance the interest
rate I have it set to a default of 10
you can change that to whatever you want
that could be a 3.5% interest rate but
I'll just leave it on 10 and I made it
step by the tenths so it'll go up a
tenth each step that way you can have an
interest rate of four point five and
four point six and four point seven and
hopefully the logic here will help you
create any kind of calculators that you
need to create just by using the
appropriate math for the type of
calculator that we're creating so that's
a monthly payment calculator that also
applies interest to the loan all right I
hope you guys have enjoyed this
JavaScript programming lesson and we'll
see you in the next exercise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
