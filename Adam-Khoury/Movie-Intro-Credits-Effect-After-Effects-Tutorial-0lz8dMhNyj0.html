and this Adobe After Effects tutorial
will be demonstrating how to create cool
movie intro credit sequences a lot of
times you see in the beginning of movies
or shows where they have an animated
credit sequence where the characters of
the cast's name comes up in 3d layers
and cameras are panning all around and
stuff and it looks all like the text is
standing in 3d space and it's really
cool-looking so I just wanted to
demonstrate how they achieve that
sometimes ok first thing we'll do is get
a new composition going for this example
so we go to new composition and make
sure we set the size that we want
everything appropriately and if you have
a really large composition that you're
making
make sure you have big enough imagery
okay let's go to press ok and we'll set
the I could have set the duration of
this rendering to the exact amount I
wanted but I can also just drag this bar
so instead of 30 seconds I can just make
it 10 seconds and that's what I'll do
okay so now let's bring in the files
that we want let's import multiple files
let's grab that brick texture map and
hold ctrl and grab the water texture map
open so they'll both come in they'll
both come into the project window here
and then you can just drag them into the
composition window all right so let's
grab the brick drag it into the
composition window
let's set them both to have 3d the
property for 3d to unlock that one so
when you set something to have a 3d
property it has a 3d layer allows this
layer to be manipulated in three
dimensions so that's why we set that 3d
property there
that way we can manipulate this thing in
3d space
so now let's lock the bricks grab the
water texture map I just made it to
where I can't see the bricks because I
just wanted to see the water so I'm
going to bring the water a little bit
towards me there using the Z the Z
property all you have to do is put your
mouse over these arrows and you'll get
the property that you want and you can
manipulate it okay now let's go ahead
and lock that one open it up its
properties and go to transform opacity
bring that down and we're just going to
put this one in
well let's unlock it first we're going
to put this one in just to show you some
contrast of what layers are where okay
so now we're looking at both of those
layers again and now since they're set
on 3d if we were to turn manipulate
things you would see them both on
different layers so before we turn
things around and show you or certain
things about and show you I'm going to
close that up and I'm going to add a
couple of text fields some text layers
and this one will say produced by
let's add another one
there we go
and you can group these together to
where they weren't all different layers
but I want to leave them in separate
layers just with this example make this
one a little bit larger they are
produced by Adam Cory okay now let me
get the two more text layers that I
wanted okay I have all of the elements
that I want for this little
demonstration in my composition window
and I'm going to make sure I set all of
those elements to 3d so they can be
manipulated in 3d space now what I'm
going to do is let's grab the wall let's
Lock everything I'm going to grab the
brick wall I'm going to send it back
just a little bit see if I bring it
forward it'll cover up that text and
then it will cover up the water
eventually there's yeah bring that back
just a bit to where it's just behind the
text and then I'm going to grab the
water and push it closer to the text and
there we go right about there now we can
lock everything and go and add our
camera now so adding the camera will add
the movement that we want and
positioning of certain elements to play
out in the movie
all right everything looks like it's in
position and it's locked
I'm going to go to layer make sure I
click my composition window go to layer
new camera and press ok you can change
the presets for what type of camera you
want and I'm just going to leave mine
custom actually I'm going to go to
35-millimeter press ok and then I'm
going to start by opening the cameras
properties here the transform properties
and we're going to use these the point
of interest and the position to make the
camera flow the way we want to so the
first thing we'll do is bring it up to
let's move it up to where we just see
produced by in the picture there so
let's bring it in
because what we're going to do is get it
into position and then we're going to to
move it wanted to start it right there
now I'm going to press this clock or the
stopwatch for each of the point of
interest and the position so now they
can be animated when I move this marker
to my next keyframe where I want the
next keyframe to occur you'll see that
when I move things
another little yellow dot will appear a
little yellow diamond showing that new
keyframes have been made and it will be
animated so what we're going to do is
back off let's back off some
let's turn the camera a bit let's go
down a little bit like this
now let's move it over make another
keyframe now let's manipulate the point
of interest in positions again come down
move it over this way and I'm really
twisting the camera about so we can
really see what our layers are doing
