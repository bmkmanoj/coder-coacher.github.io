PHP image processing video textbook or
PHP webmasters first thing we will learn
how to do is check our Gd installation
specifics and we'll also run an example
of using one of the GD functions just to
make sure that everything is working
correctly and that the GD library is
indeed installed on our server with PHP
so let's create a variable this variable
is going to hold an array of information
that we're going to access using the GD
info function so that's all you have to
do to put the GD info array information
into a local PHP variable and then on
the next line you can create another
variable called version and that's going
to be equal to the GD info array key of
GD version close your double quotes
close your bracket and semicolon now
we'll just echo that to the page in
between double quotes I'm going to type
in your GD version is and I'll put a Col
in there space and then after the double
quote I'm going to put a dot to append
to that string the value that this
version variable holds then put a
semicolon there now when I run this in
my browser on my server
I'll see exactly what my GD version is
and I'll know if it's installed or not
depending on the value that comes back
okay so I put the file up on my server
and this is the output that I get your
GD version is : bundled to point zero
point three for compatible now I'll show
you how you can also access the full
arrays information instead of just
accessing at GD version so let's go down
one line let's type in echo double quote
double quote and then between the double
quotes I'm going to put it in a char tag
which is a horizontal rule just to
separate everything then we're going to
put a for each loop open parenthesis
close parentheses open curly-brace go
down a couple lines close the curly
brace and there's your little for each
nest and within the parentheses we're
going to put this array we're going to
list it as key value pairs and now
within the for each loop we can simply
echo key equals key and value equals
value or you can just let's just echo
key and value like that let's see what
that gives us let's press ctrl s to save
it and put this on this waiver let's
refresh this file and you can see now I
have my GD version like I did before but
now I have the whole array of
information being output so I can check
the gift read support gif create support
JPEG support or that stuff one means
true a missing value I would suppose
that means null or false that's how you
can access the whole array of
information if you want to access just
one little piece at a time you can do
like I did here target a certain key
within that array so that way you can
get the value of that key out just by
itself or you can use the for each loop
and echo all of them out or evaluate all
of them now let's take an image that we
have on our server and manipulate it
using the GD library of functions so I'm
going to take this file put it on my
server I'm going to make sure my pick
JPEG is sitting in the same folder this
is what you want to see in your
directory whatever PHP file you're
working with and then a JPEG image in
there with it that we're using in this
script now what we're going to do is go
down a couple of lines you know if you
put this on your server this file and
you run it that picture will show up on
the page now I'm going to pop in some
PHP code that's going to take that image
copy it and rotate it using the GD
library functions and then we'll output
it right next to this one all right now
let's discuss this code real quick so
here is our target image my pic JPEG and
it's on the server in the same directory
as this file if you had this picture in
a different directory you
type in images / and go into the images
folder and grab it or whatever since I
was in the same folder we're just going
to target it directly there so we create
a variable called IMG which is short for
image and that's equal to image create
from JPEG which is one of the GD
functions and so is image rotate and so
is image JPEG and let me explain what
those do image create from JPEG is a
function that will do pretty much what
it sounds like it says it'll do it will
create a new image from a JPEG whatever
your target JPEG is so now we create a
new local variable called image rotated
and that's equal to image rotate you put
your target file here which is now the
new image that we created from that
source JPEG and the image rotate
parameters are your image the second
parameter is your rotation and then the
third parameter here is the background
and I put minus 1 because I want a white
background you want a black background
you can just change that to a zero you
can use different numeric values to
target different colors in the spectrum
now the last GD function we're going to
use here and this sample is image JPEG
and what that will do is output a JPEG
and I'm giving it three parameters the
first parameter is the file that I wish
to output which is this rotated image
the second parameter is the path and the
file name when the new file that I wish
to output because I wish to lay this
file on server create a copy of the
original and the third parameter is the
quality of the JPEG which you can set
that for 80 I'm just going to leave it
at 100 so that's the quality of the JPEG
rendered the higher the quality the
larger the JPEG size will be but you
know using JPEG so I'll relatively small
now all we have to do is output the new
one so let's press ctrl C here press
control V there make sure we change that
name to my pic rotate it here so now
we'll see the rotated image right next
to the original so before we run the
file let's take a look at this comment
let's target an image copy it rotate it
and save
so we're targeting an image here we're
copying it using the image create from
JPEG function we're rotating it using
the image rotate function and we're
saving it using the image JPEG function
and once it's saved at that point you
can render it to the page and you can
actually use image JPEG function for
rendering it to the page without having
to put your image tags here as long as
you set your content type on the page
using a header so here I am at my script
that was just rendering an image to the
page using the image tag in HTML then I
added my little script to copy it rotate
it and then display it right next to
this one I'm going to refresh and there
you go now it's rotated 45 degrees and
now if you look on your server that will
have magically created this new picture
and you can now take that and do
whatever you want with it all right so
that's how you can check to see what GD
version you have make sure it's
installed and then run a quick test for
yourself to make sure the functions work
for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
