version six tutorial this one we're
going to talk all about lighting which
is going to be creating three-point
light creating target point light
creating three spotlights and creating
target spotlights and we'll also discuss
the trackball a little bit now the
trackball is pretty obvious when you
have your default scene come into play
there's usually two trackball lights on
the objects in the scene already now if
I wanted to and we can go to preview and
export and generate selected frames to
see whether that's going to look like
and this is a stingray that I sculpted
in Mudbox and I'm going to be doing some
Mudbox tutorials real soon
right when I get done with these few
last Swift 3d tutorials I'm going to
show some workflow in Mudbox as well
Mudbox is really cool because you can do
organic sculpting so that's where I got
this model from I made it in Mudbox
and then I brought it into Swift 3d by
creating a D D F X file DXF file and
then I brought from Mudbox and Mudbox
only renders out object files or CAD
type files but you have to find some
kind of program that will turn that into
a DXF in order to bring it into Swift 3d
so if I take these camera lights or the
trackball lights and I move them around
you can see how it's going to change
what's going on there if I wanted to
animate that trackball light all I have
to do is press animate turn the take the
keyframes out to whatever keyframe I
wanted to animate to and then move my
trackball light and if I go to preview
and export this click animate shut it
off go to preview and export let's go
back to frame 1 and generate all frames
you'll see how the light is now animated
and you'll see what happens when I press
play see see how the light is animated
okay so that's how that works
and let's go to edit delete all
animations okay so if you wanted just
one trackball light you highlight any
one of these and you hit the minus sign
here and then you have just one so you
can make it nice and dark generate
selected frame so you see how the
stingray is much darker now so let's go
back in the scene editor and if you want
to just that one light but really dim
you can go to the properties panel
toolbar for that light once it's
selected see if I select that light I
have properties for it the color I can
make it a lot darker okay and you see it
just made everything darker so the light
doesn't have to be a bright white and
there's also options for the light such
as specular shows shadows and have the
light active hidden or locked okay so
that's all about trackball lights and if
I wanted to remove that trackball light
or maybe moving down here to
everything's dark and put in a spotlight
trackball spotlight I can do that and
then I move the spotlight up and you can
see the way the spotlight works it has a
ring of light so if I go to preview an
export generate selected frame it's more
like a spotlight on a stage where a
comedian or singer would be under a
spotlight and some guy whoever's
controlling the light would be moving
the spotlight around so that's how the
spotlight works not not very hard to
understand you want to get rid of that
you just press the remove symbol there
once it's highlighted so we can add new
spotlights add new three-point lights as
well okay so that's it for the trackball
now if I want to remove these
everything's dark in the scene and add a
three-point light
what that's going to do is give me a
free point light that I can just grab
and put wherever I want inside of the
scene and it's not controlled by the
charkh ball delete now if I want to put
a target point light I add that and what
this does is it gives you the ability to
create the target which would be on this
thing right here and then the point
where the point of light is coming from
so let's put that up here so you see how
far away the light is at its origin and
where it's targeted to be spraying light
so let's go to edit and delete that one
too
let's just put in a regular target light
and all of these things can be animated
in the way that I showed you before and
now for another quick example I've made
a UFO to feature putting point lights
inside of your objects so if we go to
preview and export master generate
selected frame you'll see that you only
see light or you only see these orbs lit
up that's because I have point lights
three point lights set up into my
transparent spears so I have spheres
around the ring of this UFO and I have
transparent material on all the little
spheres like a light blue and then I put
a point of light into each one so and I
also have this animated so those lights
are spinning around so if I was to take
a point light and put it somewhere on
scenes where you really see the
spaceship really good you go to preview
an export generate selected frames and
there you go now you have your spaceship
showing up in all of the whole body of
the UFO as well as these bright lit up
little orbs echo all the way around it
and let's press play and you see how
that gives us a really cool effect
if you wanted more of the top of your
UFO to be lit up you just move your
trackball light a little bit or you can
create target point lights for free
point lights and for the last example
here we have a little demon head which I
also sculpted this in Mudbox
and you'll notice that Mudbox has a more
of an organic feel to it you can do
really cool organic sculpture in Mudbox
pretty easily and like I said I'm going
to be going into that after these last
swift 3d lessons here we're going to be
getting into some Mudbox 2011 which is
very similar to the old Mudbox versions
but there's just a few new features
added so we'll be going over those now
this one also has an animation set on it
to revolve the little sculpted head
round and round now let's preview and
export that and you'll see with these I
have just trackball lights set up but
they're not on opposite sides it's kind
of set up to where it's front and back
so you can see if you look at it from
the left of you that's where my target
lights are if you look at it from the
front view on the trackball they're set
up here and more on the back one is more
on the back of his head and one is
coming from the top so let's preview and
export that and now we press play
so lighting determines the shadows
reflections and just the overall look of
the piece you can see that is pretty
funky fresh it doesn't get very much
cooler than that so if you do organic
sculpting in Mudbox or Maya or 3ds Max
or something like that and you want a
really easy way to animated and put
lighting and things on it like that then
get those files easily into flash for
display or Mouse interaction it's very
simple to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
