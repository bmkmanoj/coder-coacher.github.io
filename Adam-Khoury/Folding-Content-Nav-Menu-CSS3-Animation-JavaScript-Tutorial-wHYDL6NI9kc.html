you're about to view is brought to you
in part by web designer news.com
offering curated stories and news for
web designers and developers their
content is specifically geared for
people with interests like yours and
mine in this tutorial you can learn to
create various folding content effects
with click triggers and toggle
mechanisms learning these visual effects
can greatly enhance your front-end
design work the best part is is that
it's so simple to do that no third-party
frameworks or libraries are needed the
code is slim and the visual effects are
awesome let's take a look at one of the
effects we will rig up in this tutorial
so that you can get a better feel for
the concept before we even begin so in
this little demo we have a menu button
and when that menu button is clicked a
little fold down menu appears and you
can see that it has a 3d perspective
effect to it and we gave it a toggle
mechanism so that when the user clicks
on it initially it opens and then if
they click on the menu button again it
closes and we achieve that through
JavaScript but all the animation and the
visual effects are css3 driven we're
just going to use JavaScript to create
the toggle mechanism and before we apply
the visual effects for the animated
folding just going to show you the
content we're going to begin with in
this document we have a little bit of
HTML which renders this and when we
click the menu button nothing happens
and nothing will happen when you click
those either
so basically it's just the static
content that you would have in place
before you wanted to add these effects
to it so you can see we just have a nav
element and that's the little menu that
would fold down then we have a div with
an ID of top bar and that's the dark top
bar that you see going across the page
and this little guy here is your nav
element your navigation menu and then of
course we have the menu button and that
menu button is right here and in the
style element for the document we have
just some CSS very simple CSS to style
those elements the way we want so all of
the CSS we're beginning
and the HTML is very basic now let's go
into the CSS from menu 1 and down at the
very bottom we're gonna add some
properties that will help us achieve
that effect we're gonna add the
transform origin property we're gonna
give it a value of 50% and 0% and I'm
going to explain these values after we
look at the example running and we'll
also change those values so you can
actually see what happens when you alter
them next we add the transform property
and we can give it any of the transform
functions that we want in this case I'm
using the perspective and rotate X
functions rotate X is the important
function that makes it have a certain
angle in 3d space because we're giving
it an 800 pixel perspective and we'll
change these values so you can actually
see what they do but this rotate X
starting at 90 degrees means that it
will be in 90 degrees in 3d space
meaning we won't even be able to see it
because we'll be looking at it from its
side and it has no thickness so we won't
even see the element at first only when
we change these degrees will we start to
see that element fold down okay now the
last thing we need in here for our menu
one element that nav menu is the
transition effect and that's what makes
the animation happen
the animated effect now what we're going
to run a transition on is the transform
property which is this guy right here
so any time any of these values are
changed for the perspective or the
rotate X they're going to be animated
changes and we're going to run a
duration of 0.3 seconds for the
animation the animation itself will be a
linear animation and you can use easing
animations there if you want and a 0
second delay now at the end of the video
I'll take you to develop PHP comm where
I have all of these CSS properties
explained more in depth in the CSS code
ducts but for now let's just get the
example working then once you see it all
working you can research things more in
depth on your own these specific
properties now all that's left
do is add the few lines of JavaScript
that's going to power the toggle
mechanism for that little fold down menu
so actually let's go down in the nav
element and where it says data opened
we're gonna change that to no because
now by default our data is not opened
because we changed as the rotate X to 90
so we're not going to see it we're gonna
see it from its top which is totally
flat so we're not going to see it
because we changed it to 90 degrees let
me show you what I'm talking about you
can see we don't see the menu but then
if I change this to 0 save and then view
it again in my favorite browser I see
the menu now what if I put that on 45
then we'll have a 45-degree angle for
that little menu you see so by default
this is going to be 90 degrees so we
can't see it at all and then down here
data opened is going to be no because
the menu is closed it's not showing so
we can change this value at any time
through JavaScript ok so right under our
style we're gonna put in a script
element go down a couple of lines and
close that script element and the first
thing we want in there is a function and
we'll name it
toggle menu you can use this for
multiple menus not only just one because
we're going to set it up dynamically
we're going to take in an argument of
menu through that function I'll open
curly brace and closing curly brace the
first line inside the function we're
going to establish a variable we're
going to name that variable menu it's
going to be equal to a document dot get
element by ID menu and it's going to be
referenced by this incoming argument of
menu which will be a string that
represents the ID of the menu that we
want to affect in this case we have nav
ID menu one so what we can do is go into
our button that controls the menu
folding up and down and right after our
ID we can just type in on click is equal
to and in between quotes we copy our
function name here and we put it down
here and we open closed parenthesis and
in there we're going to put a string in
between single quotes of menu one that
way our job is
knows that this button is toggling menu
one so now what I'm gonna do it first
just so you can see how the script is
going to be set up I'm just going to
make that menu element that we just got
in that variable menu dot style dot
transform property is going to be equal
to rotate X of zero degrees that means
it's going to come fully into view in an
animated fashion but we won't have the
toggle mechanism just yet so let's take
a look at that and when I click menu it
comes down but I click menu again and it
doesn't go back up so we have to just
put a a little bit of condition logic in
place to make that happen
so what we'll do before we open that
menu is we'll type in if open close
parenthesis open and curly brace and
then go down under this line and closing
curly brace let's indent that correctly
so the evaluation logic within our if
condition needs to read if the menu data
set dot opened is equal to no then we
want to put the correct rotate x value
to open the menu so we set it at 0
degrees then we want to make sure that
we change this data opened a tribute to
yes so let's go ahead and just take this
reference right here and we'll make that
equal to yes and this will allow us to
have toggle mechanism by putting an else
condition in place now once that else
conditions in place you can just copy
those two lines that are in the if
condition and then we'll change this to
90 degrees and what that will do is
close the menu back up if it's not equal
to no if it happens to be equal to yes
we want to close the menu back up and
then change this to no again so open
becomes no again when you close the menu
back up so does that make sense so if
our data open property is equal to no we
just basically want to open the menu and
then change the data open property to
yes so this will be changed to a yes
value then the next time that same
button is clicked this else condition
will fire off to go ahead and close the
menu back up we make sure we change this
data open property or attribute - no and
that's what gives you the toggle
mechanism so let's go ahead and check
that in our favorite browser you see
perfect toggle mechanism now I'm
starting to lean away from doing menus
with hover effects because I don't like
the hover effect anymore because people
on mobile and tablets and touchscreens
they actually have to click things with
their finger so I feel like it's a more
universal experience for all users on
all devices if everybody just has to
click things to open and close them like
that and you also can't get a a toggle
mechanism such as this using hover
effects because when you hover over it
it'll open when you hover away it will
close back up and that functionality can
be put in just pure CSS you wouldn't
need any JavaScript for that so the only
reason we added JavaScript to this
little application is to give the click
trigger I wanted to click trigger I
don't like the hover trigger anymore so
I give it a click trigger and the user
knows they're opening a menu and they
know to close it again they click this
and you can even have a little arrow
that goes that changes from an up or
down position within this menu

great service that I visit myself and I
thought you guys would dig it too
all this code that we put together here
is going to be available for you guys to
copy and paste so you have something to
start from
if you can't see all the code in the
video we have it in copy/paste form as
well you can just view the description
of this video and you'll see a link and
that link is where the code resides now
what we're going to do is go up in the
CSS and we're going to tweak some things
to make it behave a little bit
differently according to our needs so
right now we see that we have a menu
that when we open it it folds down from
the front now what you can do is you can
go in here and change this to negative
90 degrees and then up here change this
to negative in your CSS as well so it
starts at a negative 90 degrees and it
goes to zero and then back to a negative
90 degrees to close it let's see what
happens see you see it comes down from
the back it folds down from the back
instead of from the front so you can
easily change the way that folds down
now what if you wanted to fold out from
the left or from the right you could
just change this rotate X to rotate Y
let's change all of these rotate X's to
rotate Y save the file view in our
favorite browser and actually we have to
and the reason why it's spinning open
like that hey maybe that's an effect
that you want I don't know but we'll
change its transform origin so to get
the proper effect will just change
transform origin from 50% zero to zero
50 and this will make it open just like
a door so let's take a look at that see
how it opens and closes like a swinging
door now the reason why you saw it
spinning from the middle was because we
didn't have the transform origin set up
correctly so what if I put this on 50 as
well let's see all the ways that we can
adjust this see how it spins from the
middle now so that's more like something
that would spin on a central a centered
axle or axis
okay let's put all this back to the
rotate X now let's take a closer look at
this transform origin let's make them
both 0 so 0 X 0 y you see how it has a
funny angle on it and it doesn't really
fold down centered it's kind of has an
angle on one side and if we put these
values all the way up to a hundred you
see what happens it folds up from the
bottom instead of folding down from the
top and it has a funny angle on it but
if we change this one to 50 and leave
that one at a hundred you see now it
folds up centered there's no funny angle
on it and it folds up from the bottom in
a centered fashion alright let's get it
back to how it was beginning alright so
now I've got the code how it was when we
first made the menu so if you just
completely remove the transform origin
property it's just going to spin from
the center it's gonna rotate from the
center and it won't seem like it's
folding down from the top you see it
just rotates from the center and that's
really an effect that you don't want in
this case but you want might want that
kind of effect in other cases for
instance just popping up a little magic
overlay window on the page you might
want it to fold in just like that we set
it to 50 and zero and that gives us our
folding down effect now let's take a
quick look at the perspective if I
change this to zero and down here let's
change these all to zero you'll notice
that you don't get any 3d perspective
effect on that it just slides down and
it kind of stretches itself sliding up
and down and then maybe that's an effect
that you also want instead of a 3d
perspective and if we change this to
something like 200 you'll see that you
get a really warped 3d perspective so
the higher you make the perspective
the smoother it's gonna look that's why
I started on 800 because I liked the way
it looked at 800 so you see that it's
crazy right
warm warm warm mmm you would almost need
sound effects to put that in place like
okay anyway so I put them on 800 just
because for no reason except that I
thought it looked decent at an 800 pixel
perspective it's not such a dramatic
effect but you still get the 3d
perspective effect okay so the code here
and all the little ways that we tweak
the code should give you a really good
understanding of all the different ways
you can fold content you can fold
content boxes open and closed like a
door you can swing them around from a
central axis or a center at access point
you can also have angles on it and all
kinds of different cool effects and
these don't have to be powered by a
toggle mechanism you can just have
things open and closed with separate
buttons for instance you can have one
button it says open and then another
button right next to it that says closed
but I like toggle mechanism so that's
why we set up the JavaScript this way
and if you didn't have the need for a
toggle mechanism you need just this one
line instead of these six or seven lines
all right that about does it that shows
you all kind of different ways that you
can fold content on your web pages and
remember that all of the code that we
produced in this video will be available
if you click the video description
there's a link where you can copy paste
this code but you might just be able to
write it all yourself just by watching
the video and I'd like to thank our
