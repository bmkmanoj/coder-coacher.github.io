this exercise you can learn to add a
song selection user interface to your
audio programs then you can offer users
potentially unlimited lists of songs to
browse select and play now here you see
a list and when the user clicks one that
song starts playing we're going to start
with the bare bones of an example HTML
file so let's go ahead and start with
the HTML inside of the body element
we'll put the start of a select element
go down a couple of lines and make sure
we close it now we're going to give it
an ID equal to my list and then we're
going to populate it with a few option
elements I'm going to give those value
attributes that way when each one is
clicked it's going to send a value to
the program make sure we close those
option elements as well now for the
label that I want the user to see that's
only what they're going to see in the
HTML I'm going to put the name of my
first song which is Jam on it then I'm
going to put the actual title of the
track as it appears in the folder system
now let me show you my folder system and
you'll have a better picture of what's
going on so this is my audio folder you
can see the names of my mp3 files there
now you might be working with OGG files
and that doesn't even matter so you can
see Jam on it has underscores in between
the words so I'm going to make sure I
take that into consideration in the
value and the value I'm going to put the
underscores because the program is going
to be sent this value when the user
changes anything in this list when they
select any of the options in the list so
this value is going to be sent to the
program in JavaScript and that's how I'm
going to fetch the mp3 file that
corresponds to this option I'll be able
to fetch that stream and play it so
let's go ahead and add a few more option
elements I'm only going to add four but
you can have a giant long list of
songs the person can scroll through and
play okay so that's all of the HTML now
just remember that we're going to add
some event handling to make my list
have a change event and on that change
event we're going to gather up the value
for what the user is selected and we're
going to play that track it's that
simple main now up in our JavaScript
we're going to do the same thing that
we've been doing all throughout these
audio tutorials by initializing the
audio it's going to play in JavaScript
so we put window dot add event listener
for the load event of the window we're
going to run a function called init
audio and above our listener let's go
ahead and put that function into place
and just like we've been doing the whole
time we're going to initialize some
variables now the same as all of the
other setups we've had we're going to
put the audio object into place specify
its source attribute and the first file
that we're going to play by default and
this is only if you want a file playing
by default if you don't want the player
to play by default you can just comment
out those two lines but since we wanted
the first track to play by default we're
going to make sure we put the source
equal to this string which is the
directory audio forward slash jam on it
dot mp3 and then we say audio dot play
now we're going to add some new event
handling that we haven't added yet so we
create a new variable my list which you
can put this variable up here where
we're initializing all of our variable
names and then remove this VAR reference
so my list is equal to the object
reference for this element here on the
page to select element my list variables
now representing this object the Select
list so we add an event listener for the
change event any time a user changes
anything in the list when they select a
different song to play we're going to
run a function called change track now
let's go ahead and add that function
change track and in between the
parentheses where we normally put
arguments coming in we're just going to
reference the event which is the change
event for
my list and we're doing that so within
the function when we're referencing we
can say event target to grab the element
that we need to which is my list and
then we say dot value to scoop up
whichever of these values is being
selected so once we have that value we
put it as the source for the audio
object we say audio source is equal to a
directory plus event target value plus
the extension which is mp3 so basically
you can think of it as taking one of
these values and putting it right here
into place right there between the plus
signs just like we did here so this is
just a way to make the source attribute
dynamic then once you have a new source
attribute for your audio object then you
say audio dot play which makes the new
song play now let's go ahead and run a
quick test
okay beautiful now what you can do is go
into the select element and put the size
attribute and set it to 4 because I have
four songs that means all of them will
be showing by default you see now all of
them all of the titles show when this is
set to one you can see if i refresh
there's only one showing if I set this
to 8 and then refresh you'll see the
list allows for four more option
elements to show by default on the page
and if there's not enough room for all
of the songs as you have it just put an
automatic scrollbar here ok so that's
pretty much the guts of the tutorial
when the user selects any of the options
in the list whichever option they select
that value needs to be sent to the
program now some of you might ask how do
I make the song playlist
label each song like when one song ends
how do I make it go to the next song in
the list and show the user highlight
which song is playing in the list as
each song ends now what you have to do
is combine this tutorial with the
tutorial that we did about programming
array-based
playlists and you'll have to have your
audio end event listener for the event
listener for when the audio ends you'll
have to have that in place so when the
audio ends all you have to do is switch
track like we did in the other tutorial
and then you're going to update the
value that's going to be for this my
list you pretty much just change its
option now you can make it work to where
whenever the audio ends you change the
option through JavaScript and then you
can have your change track function
I are off on the change event because if
you programmatically change the value
for this select list then this change
track function is going to fire off
because this change event handlers here
I think some of you might bring up
questions about how to make the playlist
run in an automated fashion and that's
how you would do it and you can also go
up here and take my list and go ahead
and style it by targeting that that ID
and the CSS and then that gives you this
now with the CSS there's a whole lot
more you can do with this you can
actually knock out the scroll bars if
you don't scroll bar there to show at
all or you can style the scroll bars in
a custom way using CSS you can you can
style every aspect of this select list
and furthermore it doesn't even have to
be a select list these could be
paragraph elements here or little divs
and I can put event handling for those
divs for the click event so when enter
or a mouse down event so whenever a user
Mouse's down on any of those elements
I'm going to make my program send a
value for that element to some about
JavaScript function that's going to
change to that track so keep in mind you
don't even have to use a select list but
that's the popular thing that
programmers use for audio programs and
giving long lists these could actually
just be you don't need a select list at
all these could just be divs sitting on
the page creating a list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
