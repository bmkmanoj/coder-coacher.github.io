number six you will learn how to greatly
enhance the functionality of the photo
gallery that you built yourself from
scratch in tutorial number five you will
now greatly enhance it yourself if you
just follow our around with me my friend
and one could easily apply transition
animations to the events on the page
like when the images change or when the
galleries change from one to the next
JSON has nothing to do with animation or
any animation frameworks that you might
want to apply like a little girl who
wears panties and uses training wheels
on her bicycle the animation aspects are
already in my JavaScript video tutorial
playlist here on YouTube
or you can choose to not learn how to
scratch program animations yourself you
can use your framework that you're
familiar with and little girls can sail
they want in the YouTube comments
okay so regarding video number six here
which we're going to learn how to do is
add this little box and these three
links inside of it that will allow you
to go from gallery one that was the
gallery that you learned how to program
in video tutorial number five and make
it switch to a whole new different
gallery without the page refreshing and
we're also going to show you how to not
only scoop out JPEGs which you can see
all of these are JPEG images here but
this one is a dot PNG and this one is a
dot gif and you can clearly see that
that is an animated gif so it's really
now a multi-album gallery and you only
added three lines of code and I'm going
to show you the three lines of code to
add to really expand the functionality
of this gallery using just three lines
of code because we intelligently
programmed our gallery from the
beginning in tutorial number five we set
it up to be dynamic this way so only
three lines of code will allow you to
switch different galleries and I show
you also so not only do you learn how to
switch to different galleries totally
different folders and dynamically pull
all the image out you will also learn
how to let it load in different types of
files and the three that we're letting
load in are gift
PNG and JPEG
the final aspect of how you'll be
learning to extend the functionality of
this is that it will now take in any
size image and center it in your frame
so you can see in the picture frame div
the images are centered no matter what
size they are you see and if they're
wider than 700 pixels which some of
these are it will auto fit to 700 pixels
so your images can be no larger than 700
pixels wide which would break your
design and make it go way out here you
see what I'm saying
so that's what you'll be learning a
whole bunch of different stuff to extend
the functionality of the image gallery
that you learned how to create yourself
in tutorial number 5 now you'll be
learning how to extend it yourself ok to
keep everything going in line we're
going to start with the same exact files
that we left off with in tutorial number
5 so we have JSON tutorial number 5 dot
HTML and we have our JSON gallery data
dot PHP script which is the magical file
that does all of the dynamics for us so
take JSON tutorial 5 and let's go to
file save as JSON tutorial 6 save and
you can close JSON tutorial number 5
HTML now you see JSON gallery data dot
PHP you can just close that file now go
down in your HTML and right under the
picture frame we're going to add the new
little box see this little box right
here with the rounded corners that's the
box we're going to add now and that will
give you users little links to click on
for changing the gallery from one to the
next and that's an ajax request when
that happens so the page does not
refresh so in order to put that little
gray box there we're going to put a new
div couple of lines down make sure we
close that div and it has an ID of album
menu box and the first thing inside of
that you just want to put an h3 element
that says my photo albums or whatever
title you want to put up top then under
your h3 element you're going to put in
3a tags which are just simple links and
you can see that each href is set to the
pound sign that way doesn't navigate
anywhere the on click
event has returned false JavaScript to
make sure that nothing happens when the
user clicks it that way this pound sign
doesn't show up in their address bar and
really you just want to have an on Mouse
down or on click event that fires off
the Ajax JSON gallery function that
we've had here the whole time and just
make sure that the first link says
gallery 1 the second link says gallery 2
as a label and really you can make them
labeled whatever you want you can say my
soccer team here my football team there
or whatever and then you point to the
folder that you want to grab for that
particular gallery so remember we had
gallery 1 so what I did in my folder
system is I just added gallery 2 and
gallery 3 and I'll show you that now see
here I have gallery 1 that's the one
you're familiar with from tutorial
number 5 then I added gallery 2 let's
see the large icons on that this one is
a PNG this one is dot gif and the rest
of these are JPEGs and I did that just
to spice things up mix it up and make
our programming a little more diverse
then you have gallery number 3 which is
just a different set of images and these
are all JPEGs but I made sure that we
had different sizes some small some
large different aspect ratios different
dimensions on all of those so you can
see how your gallery will Center all of
the images no matter what size they are
and the gallery will not let them
display any wider than 700 pixels on the
page so now you see gallery 1 gallery to
gallery 3 you have to FTP these up to
your webserver your live website online
to make sure you run the tests correctly
ok now that's it for the body element
that's all you have to add to your HTML
and actually let's go ahead and put this
line title into the page top div we're
going to put that directly in the HTML
instead of making JavaScript say that
because each time you change galleries
or the user switches galleries that text
is going to be replaced and re put into
that div and really it only needs to be
put there the first time when the page
loads
okay so that is all of your HTML you can
take the body element and collapse it
and actually in your JavaScript function
you're not going to have to change any
of that either and collapse all your
JavaScript up now I want you to take
picture frame and take the height away
from that and then where you had the
height put text-align:center so what
that's going to allow you to do is have
a taller picture be displayed in full in
that space and if it's a really small
itty-bitty picture it'll be centered in
the picture frame box text-align:center
does that then right under that I want
you to add this div picture frame and
we're going to target the image that
goes into the picture frame and we're
going to put a maximum width property of
700 pixels that way if you load in a big
giant picture that's maybe 1400 pixels
wide it will only display the largest
size it will display is 700 pixels and
it's height will be adjusted accordingly
so it won't lose any aspect ratio or
proportions so if you have a very very
large picture it will be shrunken to 700
pixels wide and the height will be
shrunken accordingly and if you have a
really itty bitty tiny picture loaded in
it will center in your picture frame you
can also put a minimum width setting
here if you want to put min width and
set it to 700 pixels that would make
sure that it couldn't be displayed as
itty bitty and it would have to expand
and distort it and it would actually
blur a little tiny picture out to expand
it like that so maybe you don't want
that but if you wanted to force it to be
700 pixels no matter what you can add
that okay now the last line to finish
off you're a cool little album
application is this we're going to have
the div album box and that's the one
that we added here in the HTML that was
a little gray box with the rounded
borders so you can see the last setting
in it is border radius 10 pixels that's
how we got that order to be rounded like
that all the popular new modern browsers
that people use will support that border
radius setting and then we have a color
of black
that way your little title shows up as
black within that gray box padding is 12
the background color is a very light
gray the width is 200 pixels and it's
set off the top 100 pixels off the top
of the page so you have 100 pixels here
left 856 pixels so you have 856 pixels
from here to here the end of the page
and its position is fixed just like your
picture frame is fixed that way it
doesn't scroll if there's a whole lot of
images in there say we go to gallery one
neither of these items scroll actually
this item this item in this item are all
fixed position that way the only thing
that Scrolls is a whole lot of images
that get piled in here on the left I'll
even take JSON tutorial 6 and save it as
JSON multi-album gallery save so I have
JSON multi-album gallery HTML and that's
what all ftp up to the web right now for
testing so in my URL address bar JSON
multi album gallery dot HTML and there's
the first gallery it loads in by default
in the first picture from the first
gallery gets loaded into the picture
frame by default now if I click gallery
to gallery to comes oh you know what I
have to show you guys one thing I just
noticed that in gallery 2 we're missing
our animated gif and our PNG file and
you know why that is even though they're
in the folder on the server online we
never changed it in JSON gallery data
dot PHP you do have to change one line
in here and I'm going to show you that
right now
okay you see where we have the string
position function here highlight that
and it's opening and closing parentheses
here and we're going to replace it with
this so you can see I just replaced that
with a preg match function now we're
going to use a preg match function that
is utilizing a regular expression and
the regular expression reads that the
file must contain a dot jpg a dot gif or
PNG extension in or
refer to get scooped up and be part of
our gallery so now since you understand
how that works and whatever file
extension type you want to add to that
you can just put another pipe symbol
here dot txt that will pick up a text
file but there's no reason why you would
want a text file to go into a gallery
with you and we have the I we're using
the in case sensetive regex that way if
it happens to be a capital PNG on the
image like that it will still get
plopped in it'll still get scooped up
and put in no matter these are uppercase
or lowercase on the actual file
extension so now press ctrl s and re FTP
that up now go to your gallery live
online and refresh the page now click
gallery two and you'll see now we're now
scooping up intelligently scooping up
all kinds of file types that are images
and plopping them right into our
galleries okay there you go
okay so we just have one more video
tutorial left for the JSON programming
series what number seven will cover is
it will show you how to query a MySQL
database and take the fetched array the
resulting array of data that you get
from your MySQL database and returning
to your JavaScript Ajax applications as
JSON encoded data</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
