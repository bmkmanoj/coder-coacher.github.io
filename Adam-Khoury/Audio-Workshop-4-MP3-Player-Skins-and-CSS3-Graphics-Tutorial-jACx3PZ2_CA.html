series before we begin this exercise I
wanted to let everyone know that after
this video I have to take some time off
from making videos because I have to
rebuild a very large failing deck after
frame and install a couple of new doors
I have to finish my basement which is a
very small basement and a few other
things that need doing on my property
outside and the things that I've been
procrastinating on there long overdue
projects so it'll take me some time to
do all those things correctly but I need
to just stop making videos and stop
going on the internet for all that time
while I'm doing that so I can focus and
get things done so we're going to resume
at the exact point we leave off in this
series to continue very deep into the
audio workshop series of videos in this
part we're going to style our
custom-built audio player components
into a custom skin and for those of you
without graphics editing capabilities
we'll also demonstrate CSS that
resembles the skin graphics Here I am
inside of fireworks you can work in GIMP
Photoshop any graphics editor that you
like and I'll show you what my little
skin consists of it's just a gradient I
don't know what that one's doing there
it's just a gradient you see that
gradient rectangle and it has a little
bit of roundness set on the edges and
then I put just little white stripes in
there and faded them down so you see
they're opacities if I take the opacity
all the way back up you see it's just a
white stripe bring it back down to five
and then I got some speaker graphics and
this was a really big speaker and I just
shrunk it down and put it into place
there
make sure they're all centered up and
now I'm going to file export wizard
continue continue exit and by the way my
my stage my canvas has no background you
can see my canvas clear transparent
background so I'm going to go to P&amp;amp;G 30
to make sure the mat is clear and then
export into my audio project folder and
the images folder go into the images
folder
and I'll just leave it name skin one so
it would be skin one dot P&amp;amp;G now this is
all the same exact code we left off with
in video number three what we'll do is
add a div make sure we wrap all of that
stuff in a div make sure we close it
down here at the bottom and then you can
indent but actually we're going to add
another one so add another div and just
indent that one and then down at the
bottom make sure you close that new div
and indent that one as well
now you can indent everything else into
those two like that that way you don't
lose track of where your little code
segments need to be okay so you want it
looking something like that the first
parent container we're going to give ID
equal to audio player and then it's
child div which is the parent container
for all of the audio controls we're
going to give ID of audio controls and
that's it for the HTML now we can open
up the style element and put in the CSS
that we're going to require and we'll do
it right here under the body rule all
right so we'll target those two div the
audio player gets a width 450 pixels the
height of 60 pixels that matches the
dimensions of my skin perfectly the
background is going to be to an image in
our images folder called skin 1 PNG set
to no-repeat the border radius is set to
4 pixels because in a moment I'm going
to show you how you can not use this
graphical skin or the PNG skin and you
can just set up some CSS that will make
a gradient and then you can add the
speakers as independent images just like
you would add any image to any webpage
okay so the padding for the audio player
box is zero pixels so really you don't
even need that there only if you want it
to Pat it now this next rule is
targeting the audio controls div that's
the one that's inside of the audio
player div and all of your audio
controls are going to be stored in that
div and we give it a margin left that
way all of the controls aren't sitting
on top of that first speaker it's set
off to the left oh really it's set off
to the right a little bit
away from that speaker because if you
didn't put margin left there then it
would all your controls would be over
that speaker so let's test this in our
favorite browser okay so we have our
skin and all I'm going to do now is make
all of these elements display:block and
make them float:left that way I have a
much easier time positioning them
exactly by the pixel and if you want you
can actually take this the start of this
rule and put it right before all of
those button and input rules that way
you're only targeting buttons that are
in the audio controls maybe you have
other buttons on your page that you
don't want affected by this these rules
maybe you have other inputs on the page
that you don't want affected by this
rule so you just take this put it on
that backpack and then only buttons and
inputs inside of the audio controls div
would be affected by these that makes
sense good now remember I said I wanted
to make all of those audio components
that we made display:block and
float:left I'm going to give them exact
width and height make sure that I can
position them exactly where I want them
to be okay so in the button rule we're
going to add these three properties
display float and margin displays block
float is left and margin is top right
bottom left 22 pixels off the top 10
pixels margin space to the right and
then 0 pixels for the bottom and left
now if we view what that gives us we
should see our little buttons any button
elements are going to be positioned
where we want down in the middle of the
player push down those 22 pixels off the
top now we're going to do the same exact
thing for our inputs which are our
sliders
let's get those into place by making
them display:block float:left and then
give them the exact margin space that we
want now if we view this we have our
sliders exactly where we want them now
all we have to do is move this time box
down into place and I want that to live
right after the seekbar
and right before
the mute button and since in our HTML
since that is already placed where I
want it to be between the seek slider
and the mute button all I have to do is
float it left as well and make it
display:block so let's go into our
existing rule for the time box that we
have here let's make it display:block
which it is going to be displayed block
by default so we can just remove that
put in the exact margin space we want it
to have and then make it float left now
let's see if that works yeah there you
go now what I did was I put a little
border bottom on it I'm going to put a
little border bottom on it that's a
little lighter than the rest of the box
so let's go after the background let's
put border bottom
pick a color make it nice and a little
dark but not too dark one pixel solid
and that will make it look a little bit
inset that might even be too bright yeah
you see it's a little too bright so
let's darken it up make it match those
bottom borders on those sliders and
actually do we have a bottom border set
on those where's that I guess that's
happening here in the range border
bottom right there okay now let's take
that and put it in the time box the same
exact there we go
now with a match so they all look a
little bit inset like this little light
coming from the top and the speaker's
also look like there's a little light
coming from the top okay so you've got a
custom player now nice volume slighty
thing you play pause button your
controllable playhead which in some
browsers I think in chrome you'll
actually hear the playback as you drag
like it's rewinding and fast-forwarding
but in other browsers you won't hear
that at all you won't hear the change in
the position until you let go of that
little slider but I don't find it to be
a big deal I actually like the way you
can hear it
fast forwarding and rewinding lets the
user know that they're actually doing
something now what we're going to do is
remove this background for the skin
because some of you might not have
access or capabilities to graphics
editing software right now and you might
want to get a skin on there
will you CSS to do that so instead of
the URL for graphics for actual PNG or
jpg graphics we're going to just put a
linear gradient background that's a
light or a dark gray to black and then
we have our border radius already set so
we should get a very similar look let's
check it out I'm going to make it a
little darker on the top because that's
not dark enough to match that other one
let's see yeah that looks pretty good
right there all you have to do is add
images inside of your what you call it
this div here you can put an image on
either side of your audio controls right
there you just put image tag and then
put a speaker and then put an identical
image tag speaker on the outside of that
div just make sure you wrap your audio
controls div with two image tags and
then you can give those images an ID
float them any way you want give them
any margin space you want and that way
you'll be able to fit your speakers in
there along with your audio controls bar
no problem and then you just put another
speaker here so you can see you don't
need any graphics editor or anything
like that you can use pure CSS and you
can even get those white lines on there
if you study up on linear gradients but
you'd have to add another little
gradient on top of this linear gradient
which could get tricky that's why I just
chose to use the ready-made skin that I
made in fireworks graphics okay so that
completes video number four and like I
said in the beginning of this video I'm
going to take a little bit of time off
but I'll be back before you know it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
