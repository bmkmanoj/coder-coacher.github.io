flash in ActionScript 3 tutorial and in
this lesson we're going to learn all
about how to use the color picker
component from the components library we
dynamically render it to stage and we
allow a user to access the palette and
change one of our dynamic shapes that
are rendered to the stage so each time
the shape is drawn the previous one is
removed before the new shape is drawn
but the desired color that the user
picks and the source file will be free
just like all the others as it develop
PHP comm in the flash tab ok let's rock
and roll
create new flash ActionScript 3 project
and the first thing we're going to do is
bring out the text field it's going to
be a static text field change the color
of my dynamic shape
that's all you want to say
make a little bigger bring it over a
little bit right there now we're going
to show you how to do some targeting so
let's just brought draw out a rectangle
and place it right about there this is
where we're going to want our color
picker to be so let's just give it a
black border and no fill I want it to be
right there when it's dynamically
rendered so I'll get that exact
positioning numbers and I'll show you
how okay so just like in the other
components tutorials when we go and put
in actions layer let's type in a s3 for
ActionScript 3 this can be stage
elements if you happen to have any now
in the ActionScript 3 layer we open the
actions panel by pressing f9 and we type
in this line that imports the FL
controls color picker now let's press
control enter to export and we get those
same old errors color picker could not
be found so again as usual we go and I
find this as an easy remedy just go and
grab the color picker put it on stage
and control X get it off the stage now
press control enter and there you go no
errors now we can continue smooth since
the objective is to allow a front-end
user to change the color of our
dynamically created shape we're going to
show you how to create a rounded
rectangle shape and then dynamically
render the color picker and have the
color picker change the shapes color
each time the user changes color so what
we'll do is open the actions panel by
highlighting the ActionScript 3 layer
pressing f9 now we can code this out now
we're going to have to import the
color picker event or else you'll get an
error when you try that color picker
event right there when you try to
program in the color picker event you'll
get an error if you do not import that
so you need to import that now we're
going to create some variables that are
going to be for the the way the box is
going to look on stage and if it's color
its shape size so let's pop those in and
I'll explain them okay so the rectangle
width will be a integer 450 so it'll be
450 wide rectangle height is an integer
of 300 so it'll be a little bit wider
than it is high and the background color
will be a standard orange you can use
any hex value you want there and the
border color will be black you can also
use any hex value there and these are
all integer numbers so the border size
is going to be set to 2 and the corner
radius is 12 that'll give it a nice
curve on the edges so the next thing
we're going to do we're not going to
render that to stage just yet now we're
going to set some things for the color
picker so let's say color claim a
variable with the color picker name this
is going to be color picker type
equals new color picker
okay
so now we can claim some properties for
the color picker so we just grab its
name C control V color picker editable
and this will determine whether or not
the user can actually put in their own
hex number they don't just have to use
what's in the grid when they're picking
colors they can put in a value you say
false then they cannot put a value in
okay so you say color picker now we're
going to add an event listener to this
thing so when it is clicked we know to
open it up and show the grid the color
grid with a color palette so let's add
event listener grab that and it's going
to be a mouse event dot click all caps
comma and the function that's going to
run let's just call this click handler
that's its popular name and also a color
picker dot move this will place the
color picker where we want it on stage
so in between these parentheses we can
just set the position I'm going to try
30 by 20 to target my little box so now
let me actually move this event listener
and see what happens
I don't see my color figure
oh I didn't add child through dirty
doctor add child color-picker
it's a good reason we don't see it okay
I almost got it so I'll bring it up a
little and over maybe 15 and 15 oh it's
close okay I'm gonna change these
numbers to get it right on into that a
little rectangle I made it's placeholder
then I'll remove that placeholder okay
so I've got my color picker where I want
it to be positioned so I've removed my
little placeholder you can see if we
click it it opens up and it changes its
color so we're not even going to use the
click handler let's just get rid of that
we don't need it let's carry on okay so
now we're going to draw the rounded
rectangle so what that's going to be is
a function that's going to produce the
rectangle in the way we want it to look
so let's say draw a rounded rect this is
going to fire the function off now let's
place the function right here function
draw a rounded rect and the reason why
I'm putting it into a function like that
and executing it in that way is because
I want to use it to redraw I'm going to
use this function over and over and I'll
show you how okay so that's the function
next set up nice now and here we're
going to claim a bar I'm going to call
it rounded rect good suitable name and
this is going to be a shape equal new
shape and now we're going to put some of
the what's the word I'm looking for
the graphics properties graphics that
begin fill will use a begin fill
and you place the background color in
there
remember the background color right here
we defined
okay so graphics that begin fill
background color that's perfect now
we'll say roundedrect graphics that line
style because we have to have well we
don't have to but we want a border
around it and in between these
parentheses we're going to clean the
border size and then the border color
and those values we defined up top with
the others so this is size let's just
pop it in grab it like that put a size
comma and border color just the border
color there we go
and now we're going to draw the rect by
claiming graphics dot draw rect actually
this is going to be a rounded rectangle
so draw a rounded rect so let's claim
draw rounded rect or draw round Direct
open parentheses close parentheses put a
semicolon line between these parentheses
I'm going to claim 0 0 comma I'm going
to put the rect with
right there
in another comma we're going to put the
rekt height
and we're going to put the corner radius
because when you draw a round rect it's
looking for a corner radius value okay
so there's your rounded rectangle now
we're going to end fill so draw a
rounded rectangle dot gonna move that
end fill okay so now it's drawn and all
we have to do is really add it to stage
but before that I'm going to put some
positioning properties on it that X is
going to equal and say 60 and dot y is
going to equal 60 as well and that's
where it will live on stage according to
its top left corner relative to its top
left corner and now all we have to do is
add child
this roundedrect now now we will have a
rectangle drawn to the stage let's check
it out control-enter there we go
but our color picker is not going to
change the color of that shape yet we
just have to put in one more little
function and listener okay now let me
show you the method I created for
changing the color of that shape over
and over without having more shapes
drawn and stacked up on top of
themselves it's going to remove the
current and put the new one with the new
color right on there
okay so let's add eventlistener for the
color picker and it's going to be the
color picker event right here just grab
that color picker event change all caps
and then the function name that's going
to fire off so let's call it color
change
handler okay let's close that up put a
few lines there now this function that's
going to fire off when the color is
changed by the user it's going to have a
few things and I'll explain it's just
four lines so let's see a color changer
this is going to be a vent color picker
event void and open curly brace close
curly brace beautiful nested function
there
okay so let's give these lines up all
right now first thing we're going to do
well let's make sure we have event color
picker event there event :
color picker event fires jet color
picker
can it make me type it all employee give
it to me okay that's that now we can
code out the function and inside the
first thing is going to be a var and
we're going to call it new you int so
it's a new number this is going to be an
integer
open closed parenthesis and put the
semicolon now here we're going to have
open double quotes put two sets of
double quotes there or one set of double
quotes one set of double quotes and then
we're going to put plus sign and you
we're going to use the event it's target
so grab event right there event dot
target which is going to be that color
picker its dot hex value okay that makes
perfect sense and add to the hex value
that's zero X so you can see how when
you're styling these things it needs to
zero X right before the hex value so you
add it and now that's a string that's
getting turned into an okay and number
so you see what that's doing that
actually we have to put an equal sign
there you int
equals we have to make sure right here
we put you in and that would do it now
we've just changed the BG color each
time the user picks one so BG color is
now going to change from that orange to
this new you int new color now all we
got to do is remove child act so if we
remove child at that's going to target a
certain index in the display list and
that certain index is numb
children so we make sure we get negative
one so it removes the shape then you
draw a rounded rect again see grab that
put it right here now the draw rounded
rect function will fire off with the new
BG color values making it a new shape of
new color for the shape now let's see if
it works
control-enter it's beautiful it's
exactly what we wanted
we'll have this source file for you for
you guys to download if you just want to
get your hands on it or you can go
through the video and code out with me
alrighty we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
