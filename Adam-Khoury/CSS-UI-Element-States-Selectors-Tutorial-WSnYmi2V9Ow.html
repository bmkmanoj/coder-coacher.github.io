over the UI element states selectors of
CSS which are the enabled disabled and
checked pseudo selectors first let's
take a look at the enabled and disabled
pseudo selectors so let's see what that
renders so you can see our enabled
elements have the styling that we want
and we can interact with them and the
disabled element has a different style
rule you can use the universal selector
here if you're going to have many
different input types like select inputs
text areas and things like that or if
you're only going to have input you can
just put input right there so there's
specific HTML elements that can be
enabled and disabled so these pseudo
selectors are made to target those when
they're in those states ok now let's
investigate the checked pseudo selector
so there are certain HTML elements that
can be checked like check boxes or radio
buttons so what I have here is two check
boxes and one is set to checked by using
the checked attribute now what this rule
will do is target any elements that are
checked in the document so let's see
what that renders and we should get a
crosshair when we put our mouse over the
checked see we put our mouse over the
checked element we get a crosshair so
you can use this to target any elements
in the document that are checked now we
can do some cool interactive things with
the checked selector and really any
other type of interactive selectors so
one of you guys suggested that we show
the interactive effects using check
boxes or radio and sibling selectors you
click on the label and the element next
to the check is affected now what's cool
is that the element doesn't even have to
be directly next to the check it could
just be somewhere after it in the
document so we're going to show you that
exact thing right now all right in this
example we have an element p1 we're
targeting by its ID right here and by
default it's set to display none so you
can't even see it I'll show you what it
renders so at first you can't even see
the paragraph all you see is the check
box and its label so now this rule says
that when the checkbox is checked any
general sibling of the ID of p1 it's
going to turn to display block that
means it's going to show so let's test
the little application agree to terms
and says thanks for agreeing only if the
checkbox is checked if it unchecked it
goes away easy so it kind of toggles the
display of that paragraph or that can be
a div or whatever you want and this
little checkbox is powering the display
or it's toggling the display of that
element and that covers all of the UI
element state's electors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
