Kamiya once again with another fireworks
graphic design video tutorial for
creating Valentine's Day vector greeting
cards or illustrations for your sweetie
or whatever you're doing okay so this is
the finished product of what you'll be
learning how to render in this video and
we show how to make these little vector
rose petals and the chocolate coming
down and all that good stuff in
preparation for the next video that
we're going to be putting out which is
going to show you how to make vector
chocolates this is really just a scene
that we've created that's going to
showcase our chocolates and then we can
write up top happy Valentine's Day to do
whatever we want after we get the
chocolates in place in the next video
this one you're going to learn how to
make this exact scene that you see which
is kind of like a shell for the next
video and this lesson comes courtesy of
an idea that I like the whole bunch that
share it all as II suggested on YouTube
in the comments section they said it
would be awesome with the tutorial for
how to make vector chocolate because
during production of this tutorial that
we just put out I was mentioning that
you can put chocolates or whatever kind
of rose petals and things that you want
inside of there so since the share it
all se wanted to see some back to
chocolate I thought that was great idea
I like chocolate and I gotta do it right
now create a new fireworks document I'll
make mine 900 by 500 yours can be any
size you want in resolution 72 is good
for the web I'm gonna grab my pen tool
you can see I have a red fill already
set on my pen tool and I'll just set out
on making a curved shape whatever kind
of shape I want
let's give it a sharp edge right there
then come around here and finish it out
and let's draw another shape also
actually let's go ahead and make this
one straight up and down like that so
now let's draw another shape this one I
want to have a real sharp point here at
the tip now let's highlight both of
those and we'll go into our gradient for
the fill and we'll give it an elliptical
gradient now where it's white you're
going to change that to bright red and
now I'm going to move this up a little
bit about right there the same with this
one you can even turn them to where
they're angled
correctly you can also stretch these out
to where they're oblong see if you use
the lip you can stretch them out to
where they're oblong shape so that's
what I'll do I'll have it a little bit
oblong and I'll set it right about there
let's turn that a little bit make it
oblong and there now with both of them
highlighted by pressing shift you can
highlight multiple things I'm going to
go and give it a filter first filter
I'll give it is a shadow of inner shadow
I'm going to turn the angle on it to
where it's more coming from the bottom
and I'm going to make this one white and
I want this one to come in a little bit
more than seven right there looks good
I'm going to adjust that angle just a
little bit more right there and I'm
going to make it a pink instead of solid
white okay now I'm going to highlight
them again and I'm going to add another
inner shadow and pretty much the same
direction that other shadow is going
right about there and this one I want to
be a very dark red so I'm going to go
into my color pallet make it a dark dark
red okay and make it come in just a
little bit more maybe right about there
and actually the white one I'm going to
decrease that one just a little bit
twenty-seven is a bit much right about
there looks good to me
okay now let's grab these two guys and
let's give them one more inner shadow on
the top in a shadow coming directly from
the top and let's make it that really
dark red even darker than that a little
bit darker than that okay all right that
looks pretty good to me now I'm going to
highlight both of those press ctrl-c
ctrl-v and then I'm going to modify and
flatten them that way I can just get a
really good look how they're going to
appear when I shrink them down to the
size that they're going to be within my
artwork and that looks pretty good to me
I can live with that you can take all
the time you want to tweak your rose
petals out okay so I remove that because
I really don't need it I was just
checking things out okay I draw out one
more shape just sort of have a little
more variety my rose petals when I
scatter them around within my scene I'm
gonna make one more shape and give it
the same effects that I gave these guys
here but I won't do it on video just so
we can save some time but you guys saw
exactly how I did these okay so it is
the three that I'm going to work
now if you want to save these to work on
them later and make new ones or whatever
you can just go to control X file new ok
control V you can save this is editable
pedals or whatever editable rose petals
or you could have just pressed ctrl C
while you were here I don't know why I
control I don't know why I've cut those
out press ctrl Z and they'll be right
back so what I'll do is go one at a time
modify flatten highlight modify flatten
highlight modify flatten now I can
resize these so I'll just grab all of
them together resize them make them any
size that I want them to be now I can
scatter these around and like I said
before for a better variety of petals
you would just make a few more instead
of just having three you might want to
make you know seven different kinds or
whatever but I think three will work for
what I'm trying to get across here okay
so to scatter these around we can just
press control C control V and we can
also manipulate the size of some of
these to make them look not so identical
to the other ones and you can manipulate
the way it's oriented like that so I'll
grab all of those again control C
control V control V ok so that's the
orientation that I want now what I'm
going to do is grab my pen tool and you
can see I have a brown selected now you
can go into your color palette and
select any kind of Brown kind of hues
that you want you can see mine is set to
red 116 Green 52 blue 10 you can see all
of my numbers here if you want to get
exact like that I'm going to put that in
my custom colors too so I'm going to use
my pen tool now I'm going to click down
I'm gonna hold my shift key to make
perfect straight lines or perfectly
angled lines as I go around we were
right about here and down to here
I hit right here I'm going to make a
wavy line all the way across so you can
start right about there and just pull
the line click pull the line click pull
the line click and then pull the line
and then click on the last one it looks
like this edge these come down a little
bit more so that's what I'll do
okay now once I have that in place I'm
going to highlight it press ctrl-c
ctrl-v now the one on top you can change
to some other color just so you know
what's going on you move it up a little
bit and actually we're going to save one
more control-c control-v move this one
up a little bit from that one and bring
it back to its brown color so what we'll
do to this one is we're going to punch
it so let's grab the one on the bottom
and then the blue one that we put on top
we'll go to go to modify combine paths
and punch now what that gives us is like
this ribbony type shape that matches
that one so what I'm going to do now is
add an effect of inner shadow and make
it white
or creamy chocolate color whatever and
make sure it's 270 so it's just coming
straight down seven is good let's make
this one maybe three that way it will
kind of look like there's a river of
chocolate coming down through there
let's make that a little bit less yeah
that's good
you can mess with your effects I'm going
to make sure it covers this little guy
too so I'm going to manipulate these
edges a little bit
or I could just move this guy up a
little bit lighter that works too now
I'm going to grab a rectangle and I'm
going to put it covering the whole shape
of the canvas then I'm going to send
that to back control shift down arrow
key now I'm going to highlight that
square or that rectangle I'm going to go
to gradient and give it a set okay now
with this thing I'm going to highlight
it and I'm going to give it another
inner shadow just to play with the
effects a little bit and this one I'm
going to make the dark brown
you can see what that does it kind of
blends with the white and this thing you
can also give this effects for instance
we can give it an inner shadow from the
bottom of black make sure it's coming up
from the bottom 90 degrees you can make
it dig in as deep as you want and then
fade in you can bring down the opacity
on that so you have something like that
it just gives a little more texture to
everything and you can also come in with
a little bit on top too and then bring
down the opacity and that'll just give
it a little more chocolatey milk
chocolatey looking texture okay so now
what we're going to do so in the next
video we're going to show you how to
make some vector chocolates and that's
what really this was all about I just
wanted to have a nice scene for my
chocolates when I go to start to make
them and I didn't want people to be like
Oh Adam how'd you make the rose petals
how did you make the drippy chocolate so
in the very next video in this empty
area here we're going to make some
vector chocolates and then we'll make a
greeting card out of this whole thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
