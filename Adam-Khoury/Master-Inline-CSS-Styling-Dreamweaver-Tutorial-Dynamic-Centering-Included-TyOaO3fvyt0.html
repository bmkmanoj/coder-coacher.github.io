here and i'm working in Dreamweaver cs4
today and you can follow along when i'm
going to be showing you how to do is
Center any HTML element whether it be
your flash file your object tags at
commodity flash file and dream when you
want to send through all that crap div
tags paragraph tags any tags you want to
Center dynamically i'm going to show you
in about 30 seconds or so but maybe
it'll take a little longer cuz i like to
goof around let's go okay i'm a
dreamweaver cs4 or create new HTML and
i'm going to the body tag where all the
page items display in our HTML pile and
i'm going to create a div element let me
use the dip tag and i'm going to use
inline CSS styling here by adding the
style attribute there now within the
style attribute of the div tag you can
also put CSS attributes and their values
within these double quotes so all you
have to do is press space if you're in
dreamweaver its autocomplete and it
makes it real nice and handy and it
actually teaches you a little bit if
you're a notepad you can follow along
but you don't have the autocomplete and
that's cool too i love you now let's
press space and here we have all the
attributes come up so let's make the div
have a width of say 400 pixels give it a
semicolon to add the next little CSS
attribute and its value so after the
semicolon let's hit another space and
you'll see it's letting us go on with
adding another attribute in Dreamweaver
so let's add a height at this time to it
let's go down to height 121 swanee
should be good for this example and it's
all about centering any HTML tag mostly
any HTML tag could be scented like this
using the margin even the body body tag
can be given the margins okay so after
the height we're going to make sure
you have a background color in this div
in this element and let's make sure we
have a border let's give the border a
color of black press space you give it a
size of a nice fine one pixel line of
the on the border and then give it
another space and add solid and it'll be
a nice black one pixel solid line put
the semicolon and that closes that up
and I think that's all we need for now
let's close up this tag with the closing
bracket and it's go down a couple of
lines open bracket put the slash and it
will if you're in Dreamweaver
automatically close the tag for you nice
automatic nesting and Dreamweaver is
beautiful if you're a notepad you're the
best you're the greatest programmer ever
and you kick ass over Dreamweaver users
you're the best ya heard it a thousand
times okay now so I'm going to put in
the con in the content spot for this div
tag hello world I was going to type
hello content for now let's press design
view and see what we have ok there's the
element that I wish to dynamically
Center in any browser that's viewing it
so no matter what size it is it could be
600 pixels wide so the first thing I'm
going to do is add in the style or you
can add it onto the end here put a space
type in ma and margin will come up there
double-click margin and make sure you
set auto see it comes up for you
automatically it's auto and then put the
semicolon and then view it in design
view see automatically centered it's
very easy and you can see the one thing
that made that all happen was that nice
little margin attribute and its value of
auto what that does you see what it does
here in Dreamweaver it shows you it puts
a margin on either side now watch this
when I resize the browser window so
anybody resizing the browser window
somebody has a small resolution on the
monitor they'll see it perfectly
centered somebody very large resolution
they'll see it perfectly centered
even if your box is 700 wide see there
perfecto sentiment though I hope you
liked my tutorial I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
