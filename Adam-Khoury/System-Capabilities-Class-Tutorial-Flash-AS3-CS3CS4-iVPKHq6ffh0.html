i'll be showing you how to gather these
system capabilities of any user that's
viewing your swf file a web page and you
can do this with flash and I show you
how to gather the data and display it in
dynamic text fields here on stage and
I'll publish out by pressing f12 now and
you'll see it working and it shows my
flash version my language operating
system my screen DPI at my screen
resolution and if you were looking at it
the swf would tell you different
information if you had a different
system configuration than I do and this
is handy handy code to know if you have
the need to say resize this the stage
according to what the users resolution
is under monitor if you wanted to resize
certain elements of your file or if you
wanted to show a full screen button only
for people who have the newer version of
flash because some people with the old
versions of flash the full screen won't
work so you might want to code and if an
else statement a conditional that will
you know show the button or not or just
do a whole various bunch of different
things so let's take a look at that
again here it shows the system
capabilities in green there and these
dynamic text fields waiting on stage and
you get all of this code by going to
develop PHP and downloading the Fla file
for free I'm not going to sit here and
code a whole bunch of stuff out on
youtube it would take a long time plus
you wouldn't be able to see it real well
so what's the point of that so I give
you the Fla file free and it kills all
the birds with one stone you get the
file its working one hundred percent you
see it you get all the code on your
system and you can see it all for
yourself and a lot of people complain
that they can't see the code on youtube
so go get the Fla file and you'll be a
happy camper okay so let's talk about
the code now in the code I claim all of
the
the capability values for that specific
user and we pack them into bars here for
easy use in this code below here where
we pack them into the dynamic text
fields so it's going version text
language text operating system text and
so on and so forth and then we put the
values into those text fields sitting on
stage and here is where you would put
your conditionals to say if users
version is or if version text is less
than nine point whatever or ten point
whatever blah blah blah blah blah then
you know you can do something according
to that or something else if you don't
want that user to see a certain thing or
whatever you want to do and also with
the screen resolution is probably where
its most popular doing if and else
conditionals according to the screen
resolution of the user ok so that's
pretty much it and down here I put the
whole list a whole nice comprehensive
list here of all of the things that you
can get at about the user I only did one
two three four five six and there's a
whole slew of them you can see there's
way more than six so get in there play
with them make text fields for every
single one of those things as you can
see which you can access about your your
users and if you were slick you can even
take all this information and send it to
PHP and send it to your database and do
nice statistics gathering using flash
isn't that cool you can gather all the
statistics you want about that language
operating systems screen resolutions
flash versions of the users and all kind
of other things here as you can see
bukid ok we'll see you guys next lesson
and you can get at this code by going to
get the free Fla file like I said
earlier that way you have the code nice
and handy you can open it in flash and
look at it yourself ok bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
