exercise you can learn to create a very
dynamic online quiz test or exam
software the main objective is to give
the user multiple choice questions one
at a time in sequence and grade them at
the end of the exam now the
multi-dimensional array tutorial from
yesterday is going to come into play
within this application build open up
your favorite code editor create an
example HTML file we'll put an h2
element make sure we close it and then
underneath that we're going to put a div
element now let's give them both IDs so
we can target them with JavaScript to
populate them with the data they need
and that's where we're going to show the
user the line of which question they're
on out of how many total questions there
are and this div will give an ID equal
to test because that's where we're going
to actually render the test questions in
sequence one after another
starting with question number one whoo
we're done writing the HTML and that was
tough I'm going to go up into the style
element and I'm going to put a rule
that's going to affect that div with an
ID of test so all of these CSS
properties will be applied and I'm only
using border and padding so that way if
I for instance put the word hello in my
div and then I look at this in my
favorite browser I get this result and
that's where my test questions are going
to appear but you don't have to have any
data in either of those elements because
our JavaScript is going to be populating
those elements with data so the first
thing we'll do is initialize some
variables that our application is going
to require so I'm going to type in var
pose and pose this short for a position
which is going to keep track of where
the user is in the test which question
they're on so to start off it's going to
have a 0 because we're going to have a
multi-dimensional array and the array
all arrays
our within index of zero by default now
on the same line we can initialize more
variables that our application will
require so I'm just going to type in the
variable name test comma test status and
these can be given values initially just
like we gave the pose variable and
initial value of zero you can give these
initial values if you need to and then
question that's another variable we're
going to need choice choices choice a
choice B choice C and correct equals
zero now a multi-dimensional array
should be really fresh in your mind
because we did a tutorial on it just
yesterday so hopefully you caught that
tutorial so next line we're going to do
is create another variable which is our
multi-dimensional array and it's going
to have a variable name of questions
that's plural because it's going to hold
all of the questions so you just put
equals open bracket close bracket
semicolon and now you have an empty
array so to make this a
multi-dimensional array let's just bring
this bracket down a couple of lines and
then right here let's indent a little
bit and put another empty array comma go
down one line empty array comma goes
down another line empty array comma go
down another line and empty array on the
last one do not put a comma now what you
have is a multi-dimensional array that
has four empty array elements within it
because multi-dimensional arrays are
simply an array that contains one or
more arrays nested within it these inner
arrays we're going to require I think
five elements now I'll type in my first
question what is ten plus four now for a
multiple choice a I'm going to have a 12
for multiple choice B I'm going to have
a 14 for multiple choice C I'll have a
16 and if you want more multiple choices
you can just put more elements in this
array that way you can have multiple
choice D and E and F and G however many
you want and finally in the last element
I'm going to put the answer so if you
say what is 10 plus 4 you know that's 14
so the answer is B so I'm going to put
that there B so you see that structure
it's so simple and easy I'll even
space it out a little bit so you can see
it better now realistically most people
who take your quiz or test online
they're not going to know how to program
and they're not even going to know that
they can view the source code usually so
they're not going to be able to easily
get the answer but if a programmer or a
coder happens to be taking your test
then they'll be able to easily get to
these questions and answers they'll be
able to see your full open data sheet
that's why like I said at the end of the
video I'm going to talk to you about
hiding your questions and your answers
really the questions could be in the
source code and the multiple choices but
really the answers is really what you
want to make sure is secret and hidden
and I'll discuss that don't worry about
it now I have all of my questions in
place and yours can have 50 questions or
a thousand questions alright so
underneath the questions array I'm going
to have a little function that I can use
we're just returning the document get
element by ID reference to my scripts
whenever they need it so function
underscore that's the name of it so
anytime you see underscore leading a
line in my code you know that it's
saying document I'd get element by ID
it's just returning the object reference
for the ID string now under that we're
going to place our very dynamic function
named render question open close
parentheses
opening curly brace and closing curly
brace now inside of this function render
question is where the first question
from this questions array is going to be
populated to the page for the user to
see and it's going to put all the
multiple choices there and it's also
going to have the submit button put
there and then when the user clicks the
submit button it's going to go to the
next question so the first thing we'll
do in that function is get an object
reference for the test element which is
this div right here because we're going
to populate its inner HTML with data and
we're also going to put in the test
status element inner HTML we're going to
write question position plus one of
questions length
so this is all very dynamic to where if
you put 50 questions in this array this
is going to say 50 this is going to
render the number 50 my case is going to
render the number 4 because I only have
4 questions now position you can see by
default starts at 0 so this is going to
be 0 plus 1 so that's going to render a
1 there so by default when the
application first loads it's going to
say question 1 of 4 and that's just to
let the user know which question they're
on and how many questions are total now
directly under that we're going to
populate some of our variables with data
so we'll take this question variable and
this choice a B and C will actually put
data in those variables now now if
you're looking at this saying what the
hell is he doing just watch that
multi-dimensional array tutorial where
we showed you how to dig into your
multi-dimensional array to get this
targeted data that you want so we know
that pose is starting with an initial
value of 0 so this is going to be a 0
all of these are zeros which is
targeting array indexes this index you
see here is targeting this element this
piece of data that way this question
what is 10 plus 4 that string is going
to be put into the question variable now
the same for the choice a choice B and
choice C variables they're just going to
get these next following array elements
as their data so these are the possible
answers these are the three possible
answers that the user is going to see in
the multiple choices now directly under
that in our little question box down
here on the page we're going to put the
question we're going to render the
question to the user now we also need to
have three input elements underneath the
question that are the multiple choices
and those need to be radio buttons or
you can use checkboxes whatever you want
I'm going to use radio buttons so for
the test innerhtml we use plus equal for
the rest of the data we want because
we're appending to it if we didn't put
plus equal here only the last line where
you're affecting innerhtml that's the
only data that would wind up in it so
you have to make sure you use
equal because that is appending to the
data that you started here on this line
that's the only reason you see plus
equal there that way they get the
question and then under it they get the
multiple choices you can see I'm just
using simple input radio buttons and I
gave them a name of choices that way
they're grouped together now the first
choice has a value of upper case a
second choice upper case B and the third
choice is upper case C and that's how
you can grade it and you can see in our
multi-dimensional array the answer is B
for this one so the 14 you know is going
to be here when they choose that one
javascript will have the ability to get
the value out of which one they chose
out of this choices group thought of the
choices group will be able to see if
they chose a B or C when we go to check
to see if their answer was correct or
not
so we've got the question we have our
three multiple choices and all we need
is a button that will say submit answer
so here we have a button element with an
on click event that's going to run a
function called check answer and it has
a label of submit answer the user will
see that on the button it'll say submit
answer and then you can run the check
answer function let's see let's just put
that function in place function check
answer and for now we'll just put an
alert we're going to change that in a
minute don't worry now if you were to
run this right now nothing would happen
because this function is never being
called to run so we have to make this
function run when the page is loaded so
when all of these elements are loaded
into the Dom then we can safely run this
function called render the render
question and it will render the first
question so in order to do that we're
going to put window dot add event
listener we're going to listen for the
load event and then when the page is all
loaded and all these elements are in the
Dom then the function render question is
going to fire off it's going to run now
with this code in place you can check
your application in your favorite
browser so you see I get question one of
four put
the test status element and then the
test element itself gets what is ten
plus four and then the multiple choices
and I can choose between those I choose
14 then I click Submit answer and it
says okay we will now we're going to
work on this check answer function okay
inside of the check answer function
we're going to need some code that's
going to look through this name group of
choices to see which one the user has
selected and that just takes a few lines
of code and is a for loop involved I use
my choices variable that we initialized
way up here we'll use the choices
variable and what I'm going to do is put
an array in there when we use document
dot get elements by name what that does
is it results in an array since we have
a group with all have the same name
we're going to have an array of three
elements and they're going to be in this
choices variable so we can make a for
loop that runs over that array and then
we're going to see basically what the
users choice is whether it's a B or C
and choice will be put into this choice
variable that way you can evaluate it
outside of this for loop now and that's
very easy to do we're going to evaluate
whether the choice that they selected is
the correct choice or not so we say if
choice is equal to the questions
multi-dimensional array whatever
question they happen to be on and the
last element in that array which is
these elements here these elements store
the correct choice
so you're basically checking to see if
what they chose matches the correct
choice now if it does we write correct
plus plus which increments are correct a
variable that we initialized up here so
as they go through the test each time
they get a question correct
this correct variable is going to
increment and it will keep track of how
many questions they are getting correct
as they go now the very next thing we do
is we say pose plus plus and that
changes the position which question
they're on
that means the position variable is now
going to be a 1 which means the second
question is going to be rendered into
the test once we run this renderer
question function again so basically you
can just keep firing off this render
question function every time you want to
put a new question on the page in
sequence but you have to make sure that
the pose variable gets incremented by
one before you run this function again
so that's why I put pose plus plus and
then for the very last line in this
check answer function we're going to
make the render question function run
again
so we increment the position of which
question they're wrong
then we run the render question function
again that's what keeps the test flowing
in sequence the test questions they keep
coming in sequence that way and now I
think we're at the point now where the
test will flow so we can check it let's
give it the first answer is what's 10
plus 4 is 14 submit the next question
comes up and this changes to question 2
of 4 so what is 20 minus 9 that's 11
submit answer then question 3 of 4 comes
up what is 7 x 3 21 submit answer then
what is 8 divided by 2 that's 4 now when
I click Submit answer here watch what
happens it says question 5 of 4 and it's
not giving me a new question so what
we'll need is a little if condition
within our render question function here
that's going to see if they are on the
last question if they're on the last
question then we want to grade the test
we're going to grade the test at the
very end you don't have to tell them
whether they're getting each question
right or wrong as they're going through
each question you can just let them take
the test like normal then at the very
end you grade it really you can program
this any way you want
it could be and to where that your
program renders to the page whether or
not they got the question correct that
they just answered it would be very easy
to do that you say if the choice is
correct right
here's where you would just render to
the page anything you want to say if
it's correct or you can put an else
condition here to render out that they
got the question wrong so pay attention
if you want to make the users see if
they got the question right or wrong
after each question is answered then
this is where you would put that kind of
work but mine is set up to just tell
them what they what their grade is at
the end it's more like an exam like a
long exam you would just take all the
questions in sequence and you don't get
your grade until a few days later after
the teacher can grade it but ours ours
will be an automatic process of grading
instant so the first thing within that
if condition is we're going to put in
the test innerhtml
we're going to write you got correct of
questions out length questions correct
questions length in my case is 4 because
I only have 4 questions in my test if
yours was an exam with 50 questions
there would be a 50 there and correct
corresponds to how many questions they
got correct out of the total amount of
questions so you can use these two
numbers in any way you want with math to
grade the test so now I'll go down one
more line and I'll put in the test
status element innerhtml we're going to
write test completed then let's just
bring the position back to 0 since the
test is finished and the correct
variable can go back to zero and I
actually you don't even have to put
those back to zero unless you want to
allow them to restart the test so these
are only in place in case you want them
to be able to restart the test you want
to make sure position goes back to zero
and the correct variable goes back to
zero and then finally we put return
false here and this is only to make sure
that this function render question is
not going to continue after this line
because if you didn't put return false
here what would happen is this if
condition will run and you'll say test
completed thank you and all that crap
and then all of this code is still going
to execute trying to put new questions
into the test when you don't want that
you just put return false and it stops
this render question function from
executing any further past this line so
now let's take the test question 104
what is 10 plus 4 that's 14 submit
answer what is 20 minus 9 that's 11
submit answer what is 7 x 3 21 submit
what is 8 divided by 2 that's 4 submit
tests completed you got 4 of 4 questions
correct now if i refresh the page let's
get all of those wrong or maybe some of
them wrong let's get this last one
correct submit answer test completed you
got one of 4 questions correct so you
can use this correct and questions dot
length numbers to grade their tests and
you can also give them a percentile if
you want to give them a percentage
number of how much they got right or if
you want their grade to be a percentage
number I have a tutorial on percent
programming math so the tutorial that I
have about percent programming is all
about math you can use to render a
percent from a few variables that you
have from a couple of other numbers that
you're working with maybe I'll put that
on the screen or something
a little bit of bit
okay so all of our programming is done
and on your own you can put a lot of
bells and whistles and make it really
feature-rich if you want and it's
important for me to emphasize that
there's probably 10 to 20 different ways
that a programmer can go about creating
an online exam it can be programmed in
so many different ways all right so
let's talk about now externalizing all
of these questions because you might
wind up with a thousand questions in
your exam which would be a little crazy
but some people might and you can easily
externalize that and all you have to do
is learn how to include JavaScript files
into your source code so basically you
just put a script tag here it says
source equals then you say cue list dot
J s and what that will do is include
this questions multi-dimensional array
as long as you have it in a file called
cue list J s so it's very simple to
include external source files so this
array if it happens to get really big
and chunky you can externalize it
now let's discuss hiding these answers
if this is going to be a secure type
thing where an official test for a
university or something like that these
answers need to be on the server hidden
somewhere now what I would do is put
them in a MySQL database or into a PHP
file that can serve as a database and
your Java Script can use Ajax to request
any of the data in that PHP file and you
can use Ajax request to call to a PHP
file that could connect to a MySQL
database and get data out of MySQL
database now really what I would do if I
was going to program an official test
for a university or exams for
universities to make sure the users
can't cheat is I would get each question
one at a time from a MySQL database with
an ajax request so when my page loads
for the user to start taking the test i
would initially go and get question
number one from a MySQL database table
and then
populated into the question box I
wouldn't have all these questions and
answers and everything sitting here I
would have one MySQL table that held all
the answers questions multiple choices
and everything and that's how I would
deliver the content if it was to be a
secure official exam you just want to
learn some way shape or form to make
sure that these answers are not in your
source code and after on the server
hidden securely somewhere and at the end
of your test which you can do is request
all of the answers you can also have
another variable here that would be an
array an empty array and what you do is
push each answer that they chose a B or
C into that array so when they go
through question one they choose B or C
the C is going to get packed into that
array and then the next question they
take that answer a B or C will be also
packed into that so what I'm saying is
basically you can build an array that
reflects all of the answers that they
chose as they're taking the test that
way you could send that to the server
and just compare it to the correct
answers one by one that would happen in
a loop okay you're very aware now that
your questions and answers could be
viewed by smart people who know
programming so you want to make sure to
take the proper steps if it has to be a
secure official exam and make the take
the proper steps and learn all the
things you need to know to work with the
data on the server using Ajax requests
now in the case where you're going to
MySQL with Ajax requests to get each
question one at a time you wouldn't need
this Multi mental multi-dimensional
array all you would need is a position
variable to see which question you're on
that way you can go and get the correct
question from the database as they
progress through the test and you would
just be getting them one by one so
basically your database table could look
this it could be look like the fields in
your database table you can have field
of ID
and then you can have a field of
question which can hold this question
then you can have a field that says
that's labeled CH a CH b CH c and then
finally a field in your database table
for the correct answer so your database
table could pretty much look just like
that and you can request each set of
data one at a time and if you're doing
all the checking all the grading with an
AJAX request to a PHP file then they're
not going to be able to see what's
what's going on in the grading at all
okay now the last little subject I want
to talk about is externalizing this data
array now it doesn't even have to be a
multi-dimensional array it can be a JSON
object and we have a whole long series
about programming JSON so don't be
scared to convert this to JSON because
very easy to work with but having a
multi-dimensional array like this is a
lot slimmer than a JSON object because
each of these objects don't need keys
the the attribute side of the values
doesn't need to be there it can be just
a list of values like it is if this was
a JSON object you would have to have a
string that represents the data like
this it would have to say question and
then colon and then your question would
be next to that then you would have to
say option a colon 12
option B colon 14 so why do you need all
this colon and extra string when you
really don't need it because JSON
objects work with key value pairs you
have to have key value pairs in a JSON
object but in some programming
situations you don't need the key you
don't need some little string that helps
you identify what that piece of data is
if you know as the programmer what the
hell that piece of data is for you
really don't need some little string
next to the data to tell you what it is
now this data could also be populated
from an XML file or you could just use a
multi-dimensional array like I did here
which is much slimmer in my opinion so
there's a whole bunch of different
routes that you can go to externalize
this data sheet especially if you're
going to have 50 questions you're not
going to want that in your source code
you can externalize it into an XML file
a JSON file hell you can put it in a
text file if you knew what you're doing
you know consider all the different ways
and maybe research all the different
ways in which you can externalize your
data sheets if you enjoyed the video you
