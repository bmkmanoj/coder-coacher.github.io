fireworks cs3 by Adam at flash building
in this fireworks cs3 lesson will be
demonstrating how to create gel buttons
for your dream Reaper projects or
whatever HTML projects you're working in
if you're working in flash this these
buttons can actually be made inside of
flash itself so you wouldn't need to
make it in fireworks to bring it in to
flash it can be made right inside a
flash but this is good for making for
Dreamweaver will show you how to make
nice gel gelatin buttons that are nice
shiny buttons and we're going to go
ahead and do a an ellipse
and a rectangle
another square and we'll give it a
roundness and bring around this up I'm
going to make them solid
dark red that's good and not so dark
now
I'm going to select both of them by
holding shift and clicking one and click
the other and holding shift and select
both of them the same time and press
ctrl-c ctrl-v and it will paste them
right on top of each other right there
and we're going to change the color on
the ones on top too bright red and we're
going to resize them
so about right there that looks good
then we'll bring the circle back where
it belongs not one background right
about there and this is going to serve
as like a glow effect inside of the
button and give it a filter of blur
Gaussian blur Gaussian however you say
that and blur it out a little more so to
serve as a little glow back there
hanging out and now we're going to
select these again these two press
ctrl-c ctrl-v and bring to front so
we'll press modify a range bring to
front now the back on top the new ones
and we're going to make those white and
we're going to resize those as well so
you hit the resize tool the scale tool
all they both selected and you can scale
them down and you put them into place
now we're going to give these a linear
gradient so we go down to the gradients
linear and on top we want it to be white
so we can just kind of swap these two
where they aren't put the white on top
the red needs to sync up to the dark red
so we'll double click or click that and
then go to where our read our dark red
is select that and then select the
opacity and drag it all the way down to
zero and now you can almost see our our
shiny fecht coming to life there now
we're going to select the just the backs
the bases where it's a solid dark red
I'm going to filter of inner glow
and we don't want it so dark may be
right there and so you can see already
how they're taking shape and becoming
really shiny looking buttons but we're
going to take it just a step further now
and we're going to see let's put a now
let's just highlight them both ctrl-c
ctrl-v go up here to modify transform
flip vertical and we can drag them down
put them where they should go there this
one looks like it needs to go down a
little bit now this is a cool effect
especially if you're on a black
background you can then take a rectangle
put it over the ones on the bottom leave
that linear like it is the linear
gradient in your opacity up on the
bottom and make it a hundred percent
then make it black and then where it's
white make it black also and then bring
that opacity down just a bit too maybe
let's see
let's bet that one out of here to about
their daily should
and now you have that cool reflective
effect going on there and actually this
thing
all right there and the black needs to
come in more and dominate right about
there and now you've given your button
that nice reflective look so it looks
like it's sitting a nice shiny button
sitting on a on a surface and the
reflectance reflections coming down you
can also take text put it on the button
like grab a wingding or something if
that was a play button let's see where
the wing-dings is it whip weddings
weddings and I think it's for ya press
four and then is your play button symbol
and I always like to stretch mine out
because make it a little wider and then
what's cool is if you grab the linear
gradient of white the white linear
gradient and you modify that arranged
bring to front now it looks like the
symbol is laid in there inside the
button and the shine is on top of it so
that's how it's done so you can see all
the pieces of that
you have your glow that was put on top
of the symbol symbol was given an inner
glow itself the base is given in a globe
a little bit dark to round it off and
then we give it a glow we gave it a
linear gradient on top and shows you how
to make a nice shiny gel button and you
can make all kind of shapes for these
and all kind of sizes and they look
really sharp and smooth and especially
if you had and mate them you put the
this reflective effect on it it's really
sharp and smooth ok we'll see you guys
