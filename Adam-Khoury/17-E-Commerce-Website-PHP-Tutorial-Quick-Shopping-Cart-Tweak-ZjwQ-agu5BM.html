in this quick cart week because here on
YouTube I got caught out there making
leaving the cart open to wear in part 16
on the cart you can change the quantity
you can put in a decimal point there and
that's not cool and Mizuki's the one I
found it see if I put in point five I
press change
they made the price of that item half of
what it's supposed to be we know we
can't have that nope
alright so what we got to do and here in
the video and this is what's cool about
doing the tutorial in real time
especially somewhere like on YouTube
where people can give you instant
feedback as you go
let's see Missoula is the one that found
it and you can read this comment it's on
the part 16 of this lesson series Mizzou
was the one that initially found it
because he put in point 5 and it gave
him half price I told him a couple of
things he can try and then ng Shane
which is Shane UK from the Vella PHP
he's the one that suggested putting a
drop down which would be a good solution
to that problem or you could do
something like Adrienne to 8 1 9 9 0 did
here which is that's pretty good coding
there but I'm going to do something a
little bit different to alleviate that
problem and it's going to be very quick
don't worry going to part 3 or section 3
of the cart PHP and right here will you
gather the quantity variable posted
variable that is the quantity let's go
into file open store admin the login
page you see how we have this replace
function happening here to strip
everything but letters and numbers when
I copy that and put it right under here
I'm going to strip everything but
numbers that way if they put a period in
this is just going to get stripped so
let's filter everything but numbers
so just take quantity variable that goes
there and it also goes here or you can
put the posted variable there however
you want to set it up I'm just going to
leave it like that now if you want to
make sure it's under a certain number
just do this if little if condition next
grab this quantity variable if quantity
it's greater than or equal to 100 then
you can simply say something like this
quantity equal to 99
that way it'll no matter if they put in
a million if they put it in a million
it'll always be at the tops the maximum
amount can be 99 because you're forcing
it here in the script if you want to get
that compact into one line just do that
throw that if up there and there you go
that whole if condition nest is sitting
right there now so if the quantity is
greater than or equal to 100 quantity
equals 99 and you can adjust these
numbers to be anything you need you can
also take that same if condition copy it
put one line under it if the quantity is
less than one quantity equals one
because you don't want them to put a
zero in there if they want to remove the
card item they hit the X button to
remove X so that'll make sure it's in
between 1 and 99 for sure and it has no
funny characters in it this will make
sure it has no funny characters this
will make sure it's not above 99 this
will make sure it's not below 1 so you
can use this approach that I've got here
you can use Adrian I think that was his
name Adrian's approach at YouTube in the
comment section or you can use ng
Shane's approach which is a drop-down
whatever you want to do so stay tuned
for part 18 where we're going to start
talking about the payment
is and the PayPal ipn script will come
very shortly after that you're going to
have a script on your site that's going
to communicate with PayPal behind the
scenes and we're going to be going with
website payment standard because I think
that's what most people would go with
when they're starting out then you
switch to something like website
payments Pro and then customers make
payments on your site they don't have to
ever leave you can click that little
show me video right there and what we'll
talk more about that in part 18 stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
