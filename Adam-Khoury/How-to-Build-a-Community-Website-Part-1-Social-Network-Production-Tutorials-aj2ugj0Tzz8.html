development tutorial series created by
flash building and presented by develop
PHP comm and in this one we're going to
make a much more robust dynamic
community member based website system
using PHP MySQL this time we're going to
throw a flash into the mix and there's a
lot of developers that scoff at me for
showing people how to use flash for
things that they think flash shouldn't
be used for and all of those people can
take a flying leap off a bridge I don't
care not one shred or ounce of what you
think you're old you're a dinosaur and
you should leave the whole situation
screw you and your Ajax and JavaScript
okay so I bought web intersect comm and
I'm going to be using web intersect comm
like a sandbox to wear before you even
delve into the whole tutorial series you
can test the system out to make sure
it's something that you'd want to be
checking out how to learn you know so
I'm going to be using web intersect comm
and build live on the server as I go and
I'm going to I'll be backing up and
everything so I'll probably show you
know some sensitive data that you should
never show anybody but that's okay
because my system will be backed up if
it gets hacked up okay
so let's see the first member system we
created last year at develop PHP comm
some of you guys might be familiar with
it we we're going to use some of those
first few steps to start our new one and
but we're going to branch off into other
other structures to create a more robust
system like I said we're going to allow
them members to upload mp3's FLV files
to play videos on their profile we're
going to allow them to upload pictures
and then make a flash-based gallery to
display those pictures it'll be a
dynamic probably xml-based gallery
that way we can just run an easy loop on
it to display all the pictures so it's
important to note that well this first
video is going to just give the rundown
it's going to talk about what we're
going to be doing in the first few steps
and setting up the server and everything
so the first thing you want to do is
once you get your domain name and
hosting account you want to make sure
you set your hosting account as Linux
and PHP maybe when you buy it if you get
the choice between Windows and ASP or
Linux and PHP choose Linux and PHP
because that's what we're going to be
using in the system and if you're on
Windows and ASP server it might not work
for you so you want to make sure the
hosting account that you purchase will
have will offer free - ql databases you
don't want to pay for those because
they're free we're going to use - ql to
start the system because it's free and
it's powerful i mean you can get you up
into the millions of members with but
not so many problems if you ever see you
can get way up in numbers with your
members and if you see any performance
decreases or decrease in performance in
your system then you can look into you
know getting a more powerful database
system set up for your for your website
but I don't I don't think you'd ever
need to unless you got wildly popular so
yeah I'm going to go nice and slow in
this tutorial series maybe a little bit
too slow for some of you veteran coders
out there and I apologize for that but I
want to make sure that I get the most
you know the most insight in so I can
avoid people coming at me with questions
later
because I'm just going to offer all the
source code free and people can get what
they can from it and so
and you know I'm just one guy so if I
tried to tag a little support for this
kind of system that I'm putting out here
and showing people I would never get any
rest it would be overwhelming so I can't
do anything like that but I'm so that's
why I must go slow I must show
everything nice and clear take my time
and like I said if I go too slow I
apologize
so the first step after the first step
in getting our hosting account set up
and the reason why I'm going to build it
live and I recommend you build it live
is because you're building on the actual
environment it's going to be running on
so you won't run into any snags when it
comes to switching over to your actual
server it's very important and if you if
you're good like me it'll be up and done
in three and four days your whole
website so search engines won't even
have a chance to spy to your website or
even notice it before you're launched in
and done so that's that and so what you
do is you run a quick PHP test file to
make sure that your system is parsing
PHP correctly and I have that at develop
PHP here which one is it if you go to
the PHP MySQL tutorials I'm going to
reference a lot of stuff here actually
as we go and this one is the second link
and the introductions the basics to PHP
is how to check if PHP is enabled on
your server and on this page you'll see
that there's a script there or a file
that you can run and it's called you
name it PHP check PHP and you run it
from your server and you make sure that
you get the proper output there before
you even get started with the system and
okay after you after you sure PHP is
running then we create the database that
will store the member text string data
and files go into their folder now let's
talk about that for a second
I see a lot of people when they discuss
databases online people starting out
working with databases they talk about
putting images and this and that media
files whatever storing those type of
things in their database and you should
never do that and there's no reason to
do that when you're working with a
website type system where you can you
have the power to give your users a
folder and in that folder every time a
user joins the system we create a little
magic folder out of thin air using PHP
and that's their folder it's got their
name on it or their ID on it so all we
have to do when they upload media files
when they upload JPEGs or pictures
whatever and they upload any kind of
media files we sync that directly into
their folder on the server nothing goes
nothing like that goes into the database
and I say texturing data because that's
all I use a database for is text string
data exclusively nothing else any type
of other kind of files go on the server
in the members folder this way your
database runs really quick clean and
smooth so in creating the database you
can go to develop PHP get some insight
into that and that would be on the
member system part one of the old member
system which we'll be referring to some
of those steps first few steps and here
we have the create the database that
will be step one right here you click on
that and you go through all these seven
steps once you get to step seven is a
little script there that you run you
grab this you make this script and this
is a very important little script to the
whole system because this script is for
connecting to the database anytime we
have to connect to it in the code so say
we have some PHP script that
needs to register the member when they
first come and sign up this thing is
going to be cold on this little script
here it's called connect to MySQL dot
PHP it's going to be cold on to connect
to the MySQL database otherwise you
can't sync the data into it and right
here you grab this little file and this
tests this is a MySQL quick test up PHP
basically just read this whole page and
then you're done with step where are we
with step three once you read that whole
page is developed PHP and you get
through it
everything successfully then you're done
with step three then we move on to step
four and I'm already done I created the
database for web intersect calm and but
it has no tables in it yet that's where
I am now I'm at step four here so we're
going to create the member table inside
of the database that's already set and
add the appropriate fields inside of it
that's also a developed PHP under the
member system tutorial let's close that
one out and let's go to step two and
that's where I have a script that shows
you how this this actually creates the
table on the database all you have to do
is run it in your browser so you take
this script control C open Dreamweaver
whatever version you're using I like
Dreamweaver eight I have the newest
version but I like Dreamweaver eight and
create new PHP file and this one is
going to be
just go to the code view just get rid of
all of that they give us as default
let's put all the code in that we copy
there okay now I'm going to do just a
couple of tweaks to this and then I'm
going to explain this line by line okay
okay I went ahead and changed a few
things that I wanted to change I added a
website field and YouTube field so I
want to be able to allow the members to
embed their YouTube channel directly on
the profile and I'll show you how I do
that later on in in later parts of this
tutorial which they'll there will be
many parts that way people can jump in
and out of sections they want to jump in
and out of to go back to or if you're an
advanced developer ready you just want
to see one little part of something I'm
doing you can just head to that section
let's see so let's go ahead and explain
this here we have include once connect
to MySQL dot PHP and that's the file we
made let me show you my directory
structure so you guys know where I'm
starting here okay so say you have the
route to your website hey let me just
close that and show you from here on my
desktop here's my website web intersect
is the one I'm building my new project
inside of that I have two folders one is
root it's going to be the root directory
it's going to model be modeled like my
or it's going to reflect the same
structure that the directory root
directory online is going to have for
the site so here we just have site
design source files which I hold all my
source files for the site and then the
root folder there's image folder images
folder like normal all lowercase and it
just has my logo temp file JPEG and then
the scripts folder I have that connect
to MySQL
a file that connects to our MySQL
database for us every time we need it -
so what we'll do is we'll go back into
Dreamweaver here we're going to make
sure we save this new create member
table file into the scripts folder that
way it will connect to the MySQL it'll
execute correctly for us and then we can
delete it from the server after we get
it up so that line includes that connect
to MySQL file that way we connect with
with this to MySQL the the newly created
database then we print ourselves a
message after it can connect
successfully because if it doesn't it
won't print this message here it will
print out a different message and you'll
see what the error message is but you
print success in database connection
you'll see that line and then if you see
at the bottom success in table creation
that means that it successfully went
through and it did indeed create the
table inside of your database and if you
see no table created that means you have
some kind of problem connecting or
something but whatever something you'll
have to debug on your own
because I can't help you with that
because some there's some sort of
specific environment configuration that
you have is not allowing the system to
work at this early stage okay so let's
talk about what we have here so we just
printed ourselves a couple of messages
but in between is when we created the
table there and we just set a variable
and then set to create the table right
when that variable is accessed by the
PHP file so it creates a table called my
members and inside the table it adds all
these fields the ID field first name
middle name last name country state
you'll see it says not no and on some of
those and that means not nothing or not
empty if you see no that means that that
field can be empty these other fields
when the when that data set or that row
is put into place into the database for
that member some of these things cannot
be empty and we claim that here and some
of them can be empty like the middle
name the YouTube and the website those
can be empty those are no most of them
are not null though because they must
have data in them and so they're set to
varchar' 255 most of them and this one's
set to a date this is date field and the
first one the ID field is set to an
integer field and it has a value of 11
or a length of 11 and that's also set to
not null and it auto increments itself
so when each member joins say I join I
get remember I'm ID 1 next member joins
he's ID 2 and so on and so forth and you
don't have to code that in it does it
auto incrementing okay so what else we
have here we have the account type is
going to be well here we have a text
type field which will hold a whole bunch
of a whole lot of text string data most
of these is just set to hold 255 and
that's as many characters is you can put
into that field it won't hold any more
than 255 the text field will hold lots
more and that's why we set that up as
the bio or the about Me section for the
person so they can put lots of text in
there lots of paragraphs HTML code
whatever they want here we have the
the account type which is an enumerated
field and that has set values of default
of a B and C I create a default values
of a B and C yours can be 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
whatever you want and that has a default
value of a so when somebody joins my
site they are a default member type of a
I want to change it later on the system
I just change it to B or C and then they
can have special privileges on the site
that's what that's for and email
activated that's whether or not the
person has successfully activated
through email which is a security
measure to stop spam bots and make sure
people are real humans when they join
your site you send them an email right
when they register and when they hit the
activation link you know that that's the
correct person and there are a human and
they they are the owner of that email
address that joined your site recently
ok so let's do yep so that switches from
zero which is created by default when
there are accounts created by default
and their row goes into the database
it's zero and then when they get that
email later and they hit the activation
link it swaps to one and then they're
fully activated to the site to login
primary ID key the primary key sorry is
set to ID
it's the ID field here the ID field in
this table is the primary key the unique
key is going to be email right here the
email field and that's going to be
unique because we don't want to have any
duplicate emails within our system and
our PHP code will check for that as well
so let's go ahead and run this bad boy
stop talking and do it
okay so let's save this file save as
make sure we're in the scripts folder
save it as create table create
underscore capital T a ble
press save as press save and then we can
FTP them I use FileZilla to FTP files to
my servers and you can use whatever you
want now let's see here's web intersects
root directory you can see my images
folder my fav icon fav icon is that
little file that shows up here in
people's browser it's really cool to
have those and/or have one of those and
then the index file you see there which
is what we're looking at here in the web
and this is just temporary I'm going to
be changing it real soon when we go
deeper into the system so or into
creating the system let's go into
scripts folder here actually let's just
go ahead and drag the whole scripts
folder with those two files in them or
you can go ahead and create directory
here called scripts make sure it's named
the same press ok double click into it
and just drag these two files there
this one this tool okay now we can run
it so let's go ahead and grab the whole
name of that copy it so we're going to
paste it in the browser right now now
we're going to run it in the browser to
create the table
so we're web intersect or calm or
whatever your website is calm slash
scripts because there's a script folder
we have to dig into and then press ctrl
V to paste that file name right there
create table that PHP press Enter
voila success in database connection
success in table creation that completes
the table setup now delete the file name
create the table PHP and you are ready
to move on let us go it's beautiful okay
so we can press back back to our home
page and let's go ahead and delete that
file just like it instructed us to we
don't need it anymore
we still need that when that one's
always going to stay they connect to
MySQL file is always going to stay in
that scripts folder we're going to
access access that file many times
within our system okay so create table
is done create some more tables later on
in later tutorials for this series but
for now that's going to be the main one
that'll be the main table for the
foundation of the system once you have
the foundation we have the foundation
set up then we can play around with
different things but we'll go ahead and
continue on into part two for this
series now that we have the table
created we'll have will you know make
our homepage here look a little bit more
like a home page would for a community
website and we'll make the registration
form to let the users register to the
site add all of that data from the form
to our MySQL database
and that'll be part two and then we'll
go maybe into a few other things in part
two okay we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
