asked me if I knew how to make two
different images reveal in the same
space according to the users Mouse
position I had never engineered such a
control like that before but I do enjoy
a good quick challenge let me show you
what I'm talking about
here's the finished effect that you'll
be learning to create in this video and
what happens is when a user comes to
your page and puts their mouse anywhere
on any of these types of images it lets
them control the dividing line between
the two images the pair of images that
you have and this would be cool if you
had before and after photos like this is
me before I turned into a pirate and
this is me after I turned into a pirate
and this is just a negative so this is
the school bus in its normal state and
this is a negative that I created for it
and the user can come to my page and
control these in this sort of way okay
we're going to start with the bare bones
of an html5 web document and you can
name it whatever you want and then just
make sure you have some images ready now
the first thing we'll do is structure
out the HTML we're going to first put a
div in place and go down a couple of
lines make sure we close that div now
inside of that div we're going to put an
image tag we'll give it source attribute
equal to the path that you want for your
first image and mine is conveniently
named
one dot jpg all right so now take that
and just make a copy and put your second
picture that is part of that same pair
now the second one we're going to give a
class that way we can affect it with CSS
so this one gets a class of image two
now this div we're also going to give
this a class of reveal so this div is
the main container for your little
reveal effect and then you just slap two
images the pair of images that you want
inside of it it's pretty straightforward
now the reason why we're giving them
classes and not IDs is so that you could
take this
and put this on the page as many times
as you want with different images inside
and finally in the HTML the very last
thing we're going to need is a div that
lays right on top of both images but
we're going to make it transparent so in
your reveal container
you now have three elements and each
element stacks on top of the first
because in the CSS we're going to make
them all absolute position so since
we're going to position them absolutely
they're all going to stack neatly all
right on top of each other if you look
at it right now they won't be stacked
neatly on top of each other but when we
apply the CSS they will be now this div
I'm going to give it a class equal to
activator
because this div is going to serve as
the activator it's really going to be
what controls everything and we do that
by giving it the on mouse move event and
we make that equal to the JavaScript
function that we want to fire off at any
time the mouse moves and that function
is going to be named reveal and we also
want to pass the event as an argument so
you pass the event as an argument
through the function that way when the
function runs you can use this
dynamically for any amount of reveal
elements that you have on a page so say
you put this reveal class container on
the page ten times with ten different
pairs of images this reveal function is
going to work dynamically for all of
them and that's why we pass the event
that way we can target the actual reveal
container
that the user has their mouse over and
that's it for the HTML and I'm going to
be adding another one right actually
I'll add it right now
let me just grab that copy it and I'll
show you how easy it is to put more on
the page I'll just change this to the
image source two three and four and
that's all I have to change tml is all
done I'm going to go up here into my
head element and inside of the style
element I'm going to apply some CSS
that's going to effect
all of these elements here okay and I'll
explain all of it right now so first
we're targeting the reveal class
elements and that is these divs that are
the containers now I just made them the
size that my images are all of my images
are 280 and you can play with these
numbers to be whatever you need them to
be then I just gave the container a
black border solid and I floated those
left that way they can stack on the page
horizontally float left just lets a div
behave like it's an inline element like
an image would behave and then I gave
them a margin of 24 pixels so they're
not crowded on top of each other then
this rule is for targeting the images
any image that's inside of the reveal
container so down here we see we have
the revealed container and we have two
images inside of it so this rule this
position:absolute is applied to all the
images that's what makes them stack then
in the next rule we're only going to
target the image to class which is these
elements here that have the class of
image 2 now what we're doing to those is
you're applying the clip property in CSS
and the clip property allows you to clip
out a portion of the element that you're
targeting so we're targeting an image
and we're clipping it to this rectangle
and I'll actually put a little comment
in here for you guys that says top right
bottom left so my top clip value I have
zero pixels then my right clip I have
140 pixels that's what makes it right
down the center to start out with if you
wanted to start all the way at the left
to show the whole first image you just
put this on zero but I put it on 140
that way they're divided down the center
and then for the bottom value I just put
the height of the images and then for
the left value we put zero as well then
finally we have the activator properties
so this is the properties that are
applied to this div here that we using
for the activator we give that
position:absolute so it stacks right on
top of the 2m
we make it's opacity zero so we can see
right through it
I made its background black but you
don't have to have a background color
there I just put that in place while I
was experimenting we give it the same
width and height as our images and then
we make the cursor the e resize and that
gives you the little double arrow that
goes left and right when the users Mouse
goes over the element they'll see a
little double arrow that lets them know
that they can move things left and right
okay so if we look at this now in a
Firefox Internet Explorer Chrome
whatever you'll see that we have the
starting point for the effect but
there's no control yet I can't control
that yet because we have no JavaScript
in place to control it and basically
what we want to do is move that clip
value this this right clip value we're
going to change that value in JavaScript
according to where you the users Mouse
is so let's go down to our script
element where we put our JavaScript in
place for our application and you see
how our divs activator they have a
onmousemove
event and the reveal function fires off
so we have to have that reveal function
in our JavaScript and here's function
reveal now the first thing I'm doing is
scooping up the event as an argument
that way I can target the element that's
calling the function to run more
dynamically that way we can have many
many of them on the page but not really
have to have a whole lot of code so the
first thing that we do actually there's
only one line that powers the whole
thing let me show you it working first
and then I'll explain that line so when
I put my mouse over any of the images we
get the control that we wanted you see
and it doesn't matter where those images
are on the page okay so when you're
working with the event in this sort of
way where you pass the event as an
argument through the function you can
target the element that's making the
function run so since this when the
users mouse goes over this activator we
can dynamically get to the images that
are it's sibling now down here we have
another activator div and this one will
all
so give our script some insight to who
its siblings are so all we have to do is
target the previous element sibling so
that's what I did I used event that
target which gives you access to the
actual element calling the function to
run which is this div right here and you
say previous element sibling so what
happens if you target the previous
element sibling for this element that
means you're going to target this
element so all you're doing here with
this code that's highlighted in blue
right now is you're targeting this image
which is has a class of image two so
event a target that previous element
sibling lets you target this element
dynamically or this element dynamically
depending on which set of images the
user is controlling at that time so
we've said event our target our previous
element sibling then we just affect its
style that images style property of clip
and we just make that equal to a new
rectangle you see how we're making the
rectangle clip here
that's a static clipping this is a
dynamic rectangle because the right you
see the right value up here all I did
was make this right value dynamic so the
pixels are always going to be a dynamic
number according to where the mouse is
and the way I got the mouse position was
saying event dot client X that tells you
where on the page the mouse is and then
we subtract the event dot target dot
offset left so wherever the elements are
on the page you subtract that number
it's offset left so you subtract that
from wherever the user's mouse is on the
page and that gives you the new clipping
that you need we're just simply clipping
in CSS but we're doing it dynamically
according to where the user's mouse is
and that's the basics of it all let's
check it out one more time you can see
that the clipping region is changing
according to where my mouse is go
over the image so we're just changing
the CSS clip rectangle now before I go I
want to pass along some tips that might
be handy for some of you guys now in the
CSS you simply adjust the numbers to
correspond with your preferred image
size now if you find that the
functionality does not work on tablets
or phones or anything that's a touch
screen you can apply to chivay Nabal it
to work touch events can be put into
place using JavaScript very easily so
all you would do is add the type of
touch event that you want to control the
dual image reveal functionality and that
will make it work on almost any type of
touch screen if you've enjoyed the video
