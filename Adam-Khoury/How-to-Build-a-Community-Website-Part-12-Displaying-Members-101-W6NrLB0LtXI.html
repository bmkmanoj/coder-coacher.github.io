a dynamic community social network
website in PHP and mysql and we're using
some flash and having some other types
of fun and this one we're going to be
working in Dreamweaver cs4 like we've
been throughout the series and we
started in dreamweaver 8 we switch to
cs4 because it's better but what we're
going to do in this one is if we go to
web intersect I'm going to show you how
just for temporarily just for the time
being I'm going to put in a list of the
members right here on top with this
animated flash banner will live
eventually probably the last thing else
I'll do for the site that'll be a
tutorial to how about that so what I'm
going to do is put the run a query in
the database to list out all the names
that we have in the database make them
links to the person's profile just so we
can see everybody who's joining for the
testing beta phase and building phase
not beta really the building phase
because there's never been anything like
this done before this is unprecedented
unprecedented tutorial in here I don't
even know if that's a word but this
tutorial in unprecedented unprecedented
tutorial it's what we're doing here
y'all okay so there'll be a list of
names there so we have to develop that
on the homepage so let's go to file open
the deity the desktop there's web
intersect root root folder and in there
we have the index page and let's also
open the
profile page and we're going to grab
that query actually let's just grab all
the PHP and if you've been following
along you know the source files are
available every step of the way three to
use as you like no questions asks I
won't sue you for anything if you use
this in any way you like except if you
use it as a tutorial on another website
if you offer this as a tutorial like I'm
offering it I will destroy you okay so
what we'll do is grab all this PHP I
think we did that already ctrl-c go into
index at PHP and but you can use this
build any kind of social network
community for yourself or for your
clients make money building for clients
but just don't show it as a tutorial
because I'll get mad and i'll send the
team of mad monkeys to destroy you okay
so let's go to code on the profile page
you see we have no PHP block on top so
let's put paste that in control V will
be copied from the profile page and
session start is not need to be there
because we're not going to access any
session variables rendering this query
loop okay so we're going to connect to
the database let's see scripts yep yep
yep and we're not going to have to do
any conditionals here
let's get rid of those and that
okay now we have an SQL query here say
give us ourselves a note gather all the
members for temporary temporary display
gather all the members of temporary
display so MySQL query is select all
from my members table where ID equals ID
so let's just get rid of to make it a
just a query to gather everybody out
remove the where clause and that's it
select all from my members see how
simple that is and then you can set a
limit here too if you only wanted to
pick ten you can set a limit in there
and you can research limit in my SQL
queries if you like and I will show some
techniques using that later on in the
series for right now we just want to
display the members for temporary
display on the homepage so just so we
can see everybody who's joining see
what's up you know I'm saying be cool
okay so in this query all we have to
gather we don't need all of this
information we just need
these break types everywhere I just need
ID and name
first name and last name I removed
middle name didn't I
you
I thought we removed the middle name
pretty sure I did
that shouldn't be there just comment
that out remember we moved removed it
from the database because we didn't want
to gather let me see file open the
register page see if we still gathering
nope just first name and last name yeah
we removed it I think in part 11 so do
don't need that get out of here bye bye
that's the profile page and see first
name last name first name last name okay
it looks like we got rid of that there
too alright let's get back to what we
were doing here sorry and now we'll go
to pull only the items we need so middle
name definitely don't need that don't
don't need any of those
because the profile that PHP page is
going to access all that information
anyway so you don't need to gather at
all just the name and the ID to make the
link label and the actual link so need
those two items those three items
because we use first name and last name
sign up date none of that none of that
stuff
you
oh yeah we'll show a picture to
see check the credit that mechanism
still in place and functional you leave
that just like it is and it will render
the person's whoever's IDs coming
through this loop here so in the query
we changed it just from selecting one
person to selecting all the persons in
the database and it's going to be
rendered out in a loop so within this
while loop is where you have to set up
the display in variable form and I'll
show you that right now let's type in
members display that list
that'll be our variable name let's make
sure we give it the dollar sign okay
this is going to equal let's just close
it off single quotes lets you a single
quote for a couple spaces single quote
and semicolon alright we're going to put
something in there in a second first
we're going to grab it and put it up top
above the while loop right above it we
have to claim this variable before we
want to use it like that on the page and
because we're going to make this
compound I'm not sure of the proper
terminology for it because I'm not the
smartest guy in the world but what this
variable is going to do is each time one
of these members comes out of the
database in this while loop that's what
this while loop is doing so when you do
it when you run a query like this and
then you run a while loop on that SQL
query then it's going to bring out all
the items that you requested inside of
this loop and this is where you display
everybody dynamically well we'll display
them down in the HTML section but this
is where we gather the list for for
rendering in the HTML section of the
page okay so let's grab when we need we
got a member list started there we added
the dot right here and this dot makes it
compound so each time
this one of the members it hits the loop
it's going to make a new part of the
list it's that simple okay so and it's
all going to compound in this variable
so down in the HTML sectional you have
to do is print out this variable all
right so what we're going to do is write
a link a href first then write the link
out this is going to equal put on our
double quotes and close it and let's
also close the a tag and then let's type
in profile or you can put the full URL
which will do that I'll do that right
turn
and then / profile that PHP remember
that's the page that renders all of our
members dynamically profile PHP and have
to append the variable to it so in
profile that PHP you see we're looking
for this ID this right here so let's
control C on that and it's a pen
appended to the string use your url
variables or yep so ID equals dollar
sign ID to get that ID variable now
there's a link it's going to be a link
to everybody's profile that comes out in
this loop and all you have to do is put
the word here actually that's not going
to render correctly until you do this
you got to add single quote space period
space the space is really aren't
necessary but I like to do it like that
then space period space close single
quote you see what I just did so I kind
of wrapped it and that's necessary for
making the variable display correctly
yeah we're going to do the same thing
ctrl-c grab that whole little thing
there and then this is going to be the
member name first name last name first
name space okay scribe one of these copy
one of these PHP prints here nest and
let's go here display it let's go to
split right there in a grey box where it
says cool animated banner flash by
libera and we don't want it to stay
silent to print out this member display
list so let's change that right there
let's see what we get and let's pop
their last name in there
let's see let's just grab this whole
thing for the space change this to last
name see if this works ftp it up
go to the site refresh his first names
and last names
ok now let's go to see we want to find
out how many
let's see let's try this
right above the query right under the
query let's say number of rows equals
MySQL num rows and put the SQL right in
there now put an equal sign here that
should do it now let's print this out
with it may be somewhere at the bottom
actually this put it right there in the
member display list first thing
there are numb rose members
and we got to make sure that says it's
and space dot
and single quote so a single quote space
dot variable space dot space single
quote to render it out let's see if that
works and let's put a break to break
tags one two and i add break tags like
that by pressing shift enter think it's
shift enter in Dreamweaver see if this
were key I might have broke the code
let's see if I broke it
cool there are 87 members and then it
lists all 87 members now you can click
and there IM is that guy you didn't put
a picture that person didn't put a
picture nobody's putting pictures what's
wrong with you people my dad
what's wrong with people and putting
their pictures up wrestled with that for
the longest time at developed PHP guess
what I did hey there we go Daniel
Schultz word up my man love you bro but
anyway sorry but it developed PHP I
forced in my join form like if you go to
develop PHP in the register form City
join upload your picture it's in the
form and if you don't just press submit
please set an image to represent
yourself you must do that in in order to
join see I beat them I beat the people
who don't like to add an image when they
make a profile somewhere they just want
to get in get the files or get whatever
to look for and get out and I won't
stand for it for a minute I might do the
same thing a web intersect but I doubt
it
okay so that's that now let's talk about
this let's clean it up we don't need a
stylesheet thing from the other stuff we
grabbed and we can take this and make
this like 50 this would be pretty cute
and then we'll add the picture to say
userpic
so you will add it right before the the
words and see if that works index.php
ftp it up web intersect and refresh oops
yes there's something to be noted about
this if i was to wrap this in double
quotes instead of single quotes that
would work no problem but since i'm
using single quotes to render this
string i must make sure that i render it
with the single quote space dot space
variable space dot space single quote
method you've got to wrap it up like
that so it displays right index dot PHP
or so it renders right in the HTML there
it is and now we can see who's cool and
put up their pictures yes check out
david Willis's picture BAM sweet okay
that's that's it for this part I'll be
cleaning this up but it's fun to look at
anyway make sure you know what I'll do
we'll add it to the footer actually i'll
show you how to do that really quick
show you a lit up at magic little better
add magic hmm leave that box gray and
empty let's go open photo template and
right at the very bottom let's print
that out and you can see we're not
there's no query up in here or anything
but it's going to render and i'll show
you index at PHP this is something that
would take a beginner a little while to
understand when it comes to making their
websites with the ftp the footer that
would help for the template when it
comes to making websites with templates
see now it's on the bottom and we can
all go there and look at everybody haha
okay so in the next lesson we're going
to pimp out these profiles make the
profiles look a little cooler make them
bring in the youtube channel we're going
to embed the YouTube channel with the
information i already got from you guys
it's going to be really neat so we'll
see you guys in part 13 the unlucky one
hahahaha</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
