video handbook in this particular video
we'll quickly demonstrate the steps one
must take to create an Android developer
account this way we know what is
required of us before we begin app
development and our account will be
ready to go when it comes time to place
any apps that we created into the
Android Marketplace for others to
install on their devices the first thing
we'll do is open up a browser window and
let's navigate to android comm and once
here we're going to click on the
developers link here at the bottom in
the publish section here you can click
learn more now when you get to this page
it's going to ask you to sign in with
your Google account so since I already
have a Google account set up which is
very easy to create I'm going to click
sign in to it so let's read what it says
since before you can publish software on
the Android Market you must do three
things create a developer profile pay a
registration fee $25 with your credit
card
using Google Checkout and agree to the
Android Market developer distribution
agreement so I'm going to go ahead and
fill in my information here I'm going to
press continue at the bottom the next
page you'll see is register as a
developer the registration fee is
currently $25 now I'm going to click pay
your registration fee with Google
Checkout it says connecting this process
can take up to 20 seconds authorizing
your credit card and the message from
Android Market reads thanks for your
interest in publishing your application
standard markup please return to the
Android Market developer site to finish
your registration so I'm going to click
there so I'm going to take five hours
and read all of this information right
now
and then I'm going to click I agree and
then at the bottom I agree continue it
says you register
into the android market is approved you
can now upload and publish software to
the Android Market whoo-hoo and you can
see down here it says all Android Market
listings no applications uploaded
because we haven't made any yet and
here's the button for me to upload my
application when I'm ready so now we're
ready through the Android Marketplace to
upload our finished product when we get
done developing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
