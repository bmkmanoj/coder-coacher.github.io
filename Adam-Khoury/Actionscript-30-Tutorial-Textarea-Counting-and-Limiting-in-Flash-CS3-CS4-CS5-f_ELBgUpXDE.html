once again with another tutorial and
just the other day I made it a tutorial
for JavaScript all about text area
counting and limiting so on YouTube and
somebody commented it on YouTube and
said hello Adam I think it's easy to do
this in flash could you do a little
example Thanks so what I'm going to do
is show you how to do the same thing
that we did in JavaScript but we're
going to do it in flash now and this
will give you guys a good broad look at
how logic reigned supreme when it comes
to programming and not just knowing a
programming language or knowing syntax
of that programming language syntax to
me is secondary accessing the methods
and properties of objects is also
secondary what comes first in any
programming language is you have to have
strong logic up in your noggin or you're
not going to get anything done really
because once you learn one programming
language really well and it happens to
be a dynamic programming language or
whatever or object oriented then you can
move to any of these stinking languages
they're all the freaking same and I'm
going to show you how easy it is just
using logic to produce the application
same as with JavaScript but now we're
going to do it in flash ActionScript 3
now keep in mind that the ActionScript 3
code that I'm going to be using will
work in flash cs3 cs4 and cs5 so let's
create a new ActionScript 3 file the
first thing we need to do is get a text
area out so what I'm going to do is
create a custom text area by putting out
a input text field so this now is an
input text field and I'm going to set
the alignment to the left
make sure it's multi-line and on this
one I'm going to show the border so
that's what I'm left with and the color
of the text I'm just going to make black
16-point that's good
now it's important to instance name this
text field or this input text field
let's name it ta
now let's grab another text field and
let's pop it on stage and I'm going to
make this one dynamic text and I'm going
to give an instance name of count
display underscore
txt I can resize that one as well I'm
going to take the border off of that one
I'm going to align this one to the right
and I'm going to make it dark green and
pop it into place right there under the
text area now this is an input text
field that means it's a text area it
will input it will take input text from
a user within any of your forms just the
same as if you were to go into the
components library and pull out the text
area component so you have a choice here
you can either use custom input text
field or use the text area component
just drag that out to stage give it an
instance name of TA instead of using
this input text field like I put they
will both serve the same function so
this one is to take in the text where
the person types into the form and this
one is just a little field that they
won't be able to type into or anything
is just going to show the value of how
many characters are left like we did in
the JavaScript tutorial so if you press
control enter at this point you'll have
something that you can type into like
that
and I'm going to have to turn the auto
Kern off
you see how it's right when the
application opens if I put my cursor in
there it starts aligned down that's not
cool so what you do is highlight that
input text field turn auto current off
press ctrl enter you'll see it starts at
the top where it should now a lot of
people encounter that problem with text
areas and text fields within flash and
that's how you fix it just turn your
auto current on or within the code you
can make sure this text area is blank
within the first line of code or within
the first few lines of code just make
this text area blank and it will take a
take away that line break that sometimes
is inserted for some odd reason all
right now check out how easy it is to
limit it max chars put that at 250 so
now that has a max charge value of 250
that way no more than 250 characters can
never be placed into it so that takes
care of your limiting the text area now
you want to count it and put the count
here so now we're going to have to add
some code to accomplish that
I'm going to add a new layer I'm going
to rename it a s3 short for ActionScript
3 and press f9 to open my actions panel
or you can just go up to window actions
and this is where we type in code to
correspond with things on our stage ok
first thing is create a couple of
variables these are going to be numbers
so the first one will call ta Max and
this is going to be an integer and equal
to 250 the next variable is going to be
the max difference because we have to
figure out the difference between the
Max and what is currently in the field
is there typing so all you have to do
just like we did in the JavaScript
tutorial is make sure we figure out a
difference between the TA max which is
250 and what's currently in the field so
for now we're just going to make this
zero and we'll change that value within
a function in just a second the next
thing we want to do is take that count
display text field the one that's
sitting on stage underscore txt text
give it a value equal to by default
starts off with 250 characters remaining
because when the form opens up its going
to have 250 characters remaining because
they haven't typed anything in yet so
first thing right off the bat in the
count display text field if you put in
250 characters remaining you can press
control enter to see what happens when
you do that C pops it right into place
there now the next thing we're going to
do is add the important event listener
to the text area so you type in TA which
is our input text area add event
listener open and close parentheses and
put a semicolon in between your
parentheses you type in event dot change
comma and you can name this function
whatever you want that's going to fire
up when the text area is changed in any
way so if they type something in or if
they backspace and delete things this
change event will fire up so
let's make a function cold I don't know
T a change event you can copy that go
down one line type in function T a
change event open close parenthesis :
void open the curly brace go down a
couple lines and close your curly brace
so there's your function nest now within
the parentheses here for this ta change
event we want to type in e colon event
now your function is all ready to go you
have a listener for the text area so
every time the person is typing in or
they happen to remove letters or
whatever this function is going to fire
off when that happens so the first thing
you want to do in that function is type
in max diff which is our variable that
we created here we're going to give that
a value that's equal to TA Max which is
250 for this example minus T a dot
length property so you can access the
length property of that text area that
means how many characters are in it so
it's 250 minus however however many
characters are in the text area when the
person is typing in or removing letters
at that very moment and each time they
type anything in then you just take the
count display text field and you give
that a value equal to max diff plus a
little custom string here space
characters remaining that will give your
text area the same look and feel that it
started off with but these numbers this
number 250 will keep changing so let's
see if this works let's press control
enter all right my name is doofus so
there you go you can see it's counting
nicely when I backspace counts nicely as
well if I take some text copy it paste
it in
counts it perfectly and watch this it
won't let me go beyond 250 see it just
stops it no more so it's the same
application the same exact logic but
just using a different technology so
that's how you can limit a text field
and also count it in real time while the
person's typing it in flash ActionScript
3 suitable for cs3 cs4 cs5 and we'll see
you in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
