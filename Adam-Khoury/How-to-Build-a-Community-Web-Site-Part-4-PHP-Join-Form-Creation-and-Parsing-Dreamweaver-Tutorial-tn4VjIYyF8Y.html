member-based website system created by a
flash building and brought to you by
develop PHP calm and in the last lesson
number three we ended off
we made our include header and footer
template files that will be Universal
files that will be the same when every
one of our website pages to make life
easier when it comes to layout and
design and changes down the road so we
were working in Dreamweaver 8 when we
created all of this but I want to show
you something in Dreamweaver cs4 that
you might appreciate and you might want
to get Dreamweaver cs4 for this let's go
to open let's go to desktop web
intersect root and let's open that
index.php and the about us or the about
page it's open and you see that you can
see the included files Dreamweaver cs4
by default will show you your PHP
includes and then you can edit them if
you press this button right here it
opens that file for you to edit I'll
show you for the template edit and there
it is so you see how handy that could be
in Dreamweaver 8 all you see is a PHP
little golden PHP block but in
Dreamweaver cs4 you actually see the
included file that is supposed to come
in the way it would come in on the web
and that's pretty handy to have so you
might want to work in Dreamweaver cs4
instead of Dreamweaver 8 when it comes
to using PHP and up here there's a lot
of pre baked PHP code inserts you can
check out what more they have and add
more to the system I do believe
but yeah you might want to work in cs4
and but if you're working in cs3 or if
you're working in actually cs3 does it -
as well I think I'm not sure about cs3
but if you're working in Dreamweaver 8
maybe there's a way to get it to render
this way but I haven't found it yet but
cs4 just does it by default so you might
appreciate that more and it might help
you visually okay so let's take this
about page now we have two pages to our
site let's make one more file save as
it's called this register and this is
where the user will register your
accounts so register I'm gonna name it
register 2 or register
community
now I'll just name it register okay
and press save and now we have another
duplicate file and this one is register
and it's gonna have the same header and
footer and insert or include files so if
you highlight that and you go to code
view you'll see it's just a PHP include
that whole footer template and the
header template right here and then
here's your body section and that's how
it works so if you change and you make a
new page called register.php you don't
want the description say about you want
to say register - and this one the
keywords see there's a register I mean
you would have way more keywords in
there but I'm just showing you an
example all your keywords have to be
different and your description has to be
different in order for you to index your
site better in Google search engine and
let's see the rating I have here and all
of that that's fine ba ba ba ba ba about
now we say register here and now it this
is our register page all I need to do is
put a form in here and that's what I'm
gonna do so in order to save a little
time since everybody knows how to make
forms and Dreamweaver already and if you
don't all you got to do is go into the
help file and type in forms and you'll
show you tutorials right there and help
file you don't have to go online or
anything but if you if you would like
I'm gonna pop mine in and if if you'd
like to see me describe the code live my
line I'm gonna do that afterwards and
we're not lying by lying but chunk by
chunk and that way everybody will
understand every bit of code that I have
in my system and like I said all of
these source files will be free for
download once my system foundation is
complete and so if you'd like to wait
till the very end of everything you can
or if you'd like to follow along you can
also but all the source code might not
be readily available to download and
look at the complete project as a whole
until I'm finished with the foundation
okay so I'm gonna put the form in and
then I'm gonna make a parser all in one
file this register dot PHP is going to
act as the form and as the parser it'll
sync their information into the database
the same exact file plus they'll be an
HTML form here and you can build a flash
form and I have a nice tutorial on how
to build a form components and a
components form in flash to where you
can have country dropdowns with as many
countries selections as you want in
there and all little those nice things
checkboxes radio radio buttons and all
that but I'm going to use an HTML form
for this example in this website so I'll
pop mine in and then we'll explain it
and then I'm gonna pop in the parsing
script on top and then I'll explain that
okay I've got my registration form all
placed in and one thing I forgot to put
in was the include the PHP include
mechanism for the right side panel
advertisement here that's gonna need to
be on every page so before you get way
way into your system and creating a lot
of pages you want to have that include
on there so we'll go to the code view
we'll grab this include once I think you
can use require once in the same fashion
or require as you do include there's a
similar function
or similar method in PHP for including
files called require ok so let's go into
the About section well actually no one
on the register page right here this
take this table column let's look in the
design view
if we click inside that table column we
want to vertically align it to the top
so let's go vertically align top let's
look at the source code okay via lines
hop now let's put this include here
let's call this right
add template there we go
the right ad template and let's make
that file well before we do that let's
go ahead and swap out the table columns
from the about an index page too because
those same ones because we want to make
sure that same files those ads are going
to show on all the pages and not just
the register page so now let's go ahead
and make that file called right add
template file new PHP and let's take out
all the source code and in the design
view let's just stick a table actually
now let's stick a div in there where's
the div do you one of these there's a do
no class on it yet there we go content
here
okay so we'll save this as alright ght
underscore capital ad underscore
template right that I say right side I
think I said right side now let's say
right ad template that's fine save it
and make sure these say right ad
template yep okay so now that template
is good and it'll be included into all
of these files if we look in the design
view see content here so now you see the
magic taking place that's how it works
so anytime on any of these pages the
register page or the about page there it
is it just flies right in because we're
including the same file and if I change
it once here to say just content the
word content and save it if I look at
these pages
it changes corresponds to that main file
and that's the beauty of includes in
template files and so all of the pages
will have the same add or I can make a
new write add template or maybe write
add to template and then have it have
different content in it sink that into
different pages that I want you know
separate content in from the other pages
it's very simple to do once you
understand include files okay so now
we're on the register.php
and i had to stop and show you that
because that was an important part of
the the whole system to have your
includes setup from the start and if you
have to put an e in later you can go
into all of your major pages and lay it
in
might be a little time-consuming but so
it's it's best to plan it all out from
the start but that's all I'll need is
that one column there to add anything I
want I can add a little menu and then a
big banner ad and do whatever I want in
that section and I don't have to even
worry about it now it's great now let's
quickly discuss the HTML table and the
HTML form
that I placed in I have a HTML table
with 600 wide padding cell padding of
five and it's 18 columns or 18 rows and
2 columns and with second column here is
for the fields and the first column is
for the labels and I put a little note
up top for everybody to add my admin
email for the website
- they're just booked and that way you
know since we're start you know where a
site that just is starting out some of
these people might have really high spam
settings in their email account so our
email might not even get through unless
they and that's not everybody it's just
some people it might not get through
unless they add us to their address book
or their email whitelist
or safe sender list so I added that
message to them there to do as a first
step and then here you can see I have I
print an error message and here this is
where any error messages will come up in
red for for the forum if they forget to
put something that we require so in the
forum I'm gonna highlight all these and
align them to the right make it look a
little better horizontal alignment right
you see that push them all to the right
next to their fields so it looks a
little more like it should and we want
to have asterisks for the ones that we
require we're going to require first
name we're gonna require nope not middle
we're going to require last name
actually let's just go ahead and make
this one red I'm going to define a new
style and our CSS here color it red nice
dark red over the bright red bright red
okay okay now let's see what we have you
know now we have a class set up for that
we can just press ctrl C with that
highlighted and sync it in anywhere else
we need it like right here let's make
sure we just grab that the countries
needed province needed city needed zip
code that's needed the phone number
needed and the website is not YouTube
channel that's not it's optional email
address is needed confirm email eat is
needed and then create password and
confirm password are needed and the
CAPTCHA code if you want to add that to
your form that that will be needed as
well now if we look in the into the code
and if you guys are following along if
I'm going a little slow I'm sorry but if
you're following along you'll really get
all the understanding you need to to
understand the system that you might be
working with if you if you pick this
system up and work with it
so here inside of the HTML for the form
just go ahead and put that down you can
see that I'm printing it's a PHP file
register dot PHP so I'm able to print
PHP tags and variables straight into the
value sections for all these let's split
that so you see here first name field
here in the value attribute for this
field
I have PHP printing first name and I do
this for all of these so I can use the
same file in the same register dot PHP
for parsing and showing the form
and what happens is if they enter the
forum correctly and everything goes
through to the database and they become
a member or they get they get sunk into
the database as a as a member and they
get their activation email sent to them
then we we shovel them to another page
we shuffle them to a page that we're
going to create in just a second it's
going to be called a universal message
or maybe user message message to user
something like that will name it message
to users PHP and that's going to be a
universal page that will send all kinds
of messages to on all kind of other
scripts in this script and all the
scripts on the file on the site when we
want to just send them to a page give
them a message and tell them something's
complete or something like that
I feel that's the best way to do it and
I don't use JavaScript to validate my
forms I use straight PHP and I think
it's a lot more clean and effective to
just use straight PHP to validate the
form tell them what they forgot to put
in and it works really nice and so and
it's also really nice too because you
can keep their name if they put in their
name and all this they go through the
trouble of putting all this stuff in and
they press submit and something's wrong
you want to make sure all those values
stay in there and then they can just go
and change what was wrong and it's the
smarter way to code a form I think okay
so or if you want to use flash like I
said for your form I have the really
comprehensive tutorial on how to make
flash components form with pull downs
and radio buttons all that stuff okay so
that's pretty much all there is to the
form it's just a form tag inside of a
table you can see I have my table here
starting tag and then right below it is
the form starting tag if you go down to
the bottom you'll notice that at the
bottom of the form
there's a closing tag for the table and
a closing tag for the forum so the forum
closes first and then the table closes
just like the table opens first up top
and then the forum opens so it just
closes itself like it should nest
incorrectly so the whole forum is inside
this table all the fields that we need
ready to go that correspond to our
database table that we made for the
members okay now I'm going to create the
parse script and we're going to discuss
that in depth the code and and that'll
conclude part four and then we'll move
along to the par 5 okay I have the parse
script all written out and now we'll
talk about it line by line or sections
that we need to cover so you guys can
have a full understanding here of what
it does and so here when we started
before I put in the parse section of
register dot PHP
I had the starts with doctype public and
gives you a head and the meta name and
all that but then I put right above it
PHP tags so the first section of the
file of register dot PHP is going to
check if the form is posted if it has a
post value the first name so if somebody
basically if anybody clicks on that form
submit button
right there then that section is going
to run and let's go back to the code now
if they don't click that button we want
some kind of default values so we have
our if condition here and then we set an
else way down here and all of this would
happen this is filtering and checking
and adding them to the database if they
click Submit and everything works out
fine in the form but if they don't click
Submit these are the default values that
are going to get run into the page so we
have every message which we saw we
placed right here you see every message
so when they come to the page let's go
to it online let's see Internet Explorer
web intersect ok so if we go to the
register page which I put up on via FTP
oh I thought I did let me put it up
reconnect and register register dot PHP
ok so now that's up on our server at web
intersect that's refresh and there is
register dot PHP you see how it is a red
line there says field marked with an
asterisk required that is the default
value I was talking about he feels field
marks within fields marked with an
asterisk are required that's what's
getting laid in there as a default value
because nobody's pressed the submit
button on that page yet when they press
the submit form form button watch what
happens we do some error checking and
all of this says error you did not
submit the following required
information first-name lastname country
all the stuff that we require them to
and now I'm going to talk about how
that's pulled off so we go the first
section of the parse section of register
dot PHP it's all in one file the form
and the parser and the first section is
attaining we take the posted values from
the form and we create local PHP
variables we take the posted variables
and make them local variables then we
strip slashes on them and I'm going to
talk about some things and if I happen
to do something that some of you guys
don't agree with just keep in mind this
is a tutorial basics if you want to show
somebody something different and you're
a PHP master then you should make your
own tutorial instead of bashing mine ok
so or you know just give
a private comment and say hey you know
your tutorial could can really use this
don't make it such a a public thing
where you're showing your ass you know
okay so what we're doing is we're
filtering I'm gonna show you how to do
pretty extensive filtering and security
checks when adding things to your
database and before you even do any
checks and things like that so we're
gonna strip slashes on all those
variables after we turned them into PHP
local variables which trip slashes on
them that removes any slashes that might
be on them like that forward or back
slashes and then because there's certain
SQL injection attacks that people can
perform on your database so you want to
try and prepare for those and just treat
every user as they would you know they
would be a hacker every one of your
members don't give them the benefit of
the doubt you want to clean and secure
all the data that goes into your
database or anything that's
communicating with your database so
we'll strip slashes on them then we
strip tags and the stripping the tags is
not as essential but it stops people
from putting in JavaScript tags which is
pretty cool and uh you really you
wouldn't want tags in any of these any
of these values so you strip them then
we include in the scripts folder or
connect to MySQL because we're gonna run
a check right here really quick and this
is an email check and we're pretty much
just setting up the variable for how
many number of rows that we come up with
when we select the email from the my
members table that we created where
email equals this person who's trying to
join email so what it's saying is this
is a database duplicate email check so
if the that email is already in the
database we're gonna run a check I think
it's down here somewhere and I'll show
you that we're gonna check to see if
they are in the database already and
then give them an error output saying
that email address is already in use
please try another then this part of the
ever handling is well this is where
really the error handling starts here we
just set up some variables and connect
it to the database and then on top we
did that filtering and we're going to do
more filtering before any information
hits the database and I'll show you that
in a second so here we go to conditional
setup for if any of these values happens
to be empty we want information we
require information in those values so
we print out an error message this
displays on top then it breaks two lines
breaks down two lines with two line
breaks and then for each value they
missed if they happen to miss that one
it won't show all of them just the ones
they missed I think it's a really cool
way to do it and on the web usually you
press submit if you forget something you
see a JavaScript box it goes Bing I
don't really like that I don't like
JavaScript too much or using it on my
web pages I use it as little as possible
on my web pages
some people love JavaScript I happen to
not like it all that much I don't find
it to to necessary for my kind of
projects but yours might require it a
whole lot so yeah that's that if they
miss anything it just shows them what
they missed so they can put it in and it
won't parse the data to the database
unless everything meets up just right to
our requirements so here after that
after that if they missed any of the
required fields we say we want to check
and see if their email matches their
confirm email so there's two fields
there confirm and/or create email and
then convert an email make sure those
match if they don't give them the ever
message and you can see this is the same
error message variable here but it
switches upon what the error is and then
that gets output into the error message
section on the page after all this runs
down so none of these sections run
except the one that would be that
particular error for what that person
did wrong in the
four more whatever and that's where all
these else if statements are all about
so the first one is checking to see if
their email fields match or not the
second one check to see if their
password fields to confirm and create
password fields match this and then we
just tell them an error message
accordingly and then the next one checks
for the human check now this one I did I
changed the form a little bit I know I I
might have discussed making some kind of
CAPTCHA I'm not even going to go into
that because it would take way too long
maybe I'll do a CAPTCHA tutorial later
on down the line in a separate kind of
tutorial because it doesn't have to be
really tied into this one just yet but
what I did was a human check and it
really it's good a good against stopping
the spam bot joining a database because
spam bops the spam bots aren't
programmed yet anyway to remove any text
from a field so if you have a field in
your forum here that says human check
and you tell the people please remove
all this text the humans will all do it
they'll remove all the text and then hit
submit and if they don't we give them
that error message in the code and
that's how it works and you can try it
out yourself and see how many spam bots
make it into your database from what I
can see at my database I use the same
method to develop PHP actually and I
don't see not the first spam bot nothing
all humans and let's see where are we
here
so let's go to where we're at there
error messages the human check now we do
the email check remember we set up here
we did that select from the database to
see if the email was present in the
database and I might actually move my
MySQL select real escape string up top
here
I'm gonna put one up here just to be
sure
email let's escape it an email checker
email let's see the email chair this
email one becomes email checker and it's
my square of real escape string and I'll
talk about what that function does in a
second let's put that here
that should work okay now let's go back
to where we were and I'll tell you why I
did that just a second now when we go
and we get all these error messages and
we check the email to see if it was in a
database we say if email check is the
number that we get from the database
output here if there's no email that
matches that email in the database this
will be zero if there is this will be 1
this variable will have a value of 1 so
here we check to see if that value is
greater than 0 and if it is greater than
zero that means it's an error because
that email is in our database already so
we give them the error message but if
it's if that I'm sorry if it's 1 then
it's an error if this value is a 1 I
think I said it right the first time I
don't know I just confused myself but if
this value happens to be a 1 then this
will be an error and it'll display to
them on the page if not then we can
finally parse things to the database and
actually register their row into the
database all those things so when you
run you can go to PHP net and I suggest
you do that if you haven't found PHP net
yet it's the place where you find the
official documentation really for PHP
functions all the mechanisms methods and
all of the user comments that are down
in there so I suggest you check out a
php.net if you haven't yet because
that's where I learned a lot of this
stuff from ok so if you go there and you
read about MySQL real escape string it's
a setup for use before adding things to
your database to escape characters that
people might use to run an SQL injection
attack on your database
and you can read all about that from
php.net and I use that to filter the
data some further and then I also which
you don't see very much and I might be
the only one that does this I'm not sure
but there's you know the little tilde
key above the tab key on a u.s. keyboard
there's a little accent mark looking
thing that's sometimes used in database
queries and I replace all those with
nothing basically I delete them from I
filter the the data even further to
delete any of those first name middle
name and last name say all of those
values if they happen to have that mark
it gets deleted it gets removed from the
string and the website here I'm removing
the HTTP because in the form you can see
we clearly place that for them but some
people are dumb and they'll put like
this they'll type in the HTTP when you
don't want them to so you got to remove
that if they happen to put it that's
only if it happens to be in the string
it gets removed and same for the YouTube
string we just want their YouTube
channel name we don't want the whole
string if they happen to put the whole
HTTP we remove it that's what that does
then we add md5 hash to the password
variable there's about four or five
different hash mechanisms that you can
find and use with PHP I just happen to
use md5 makes a nice hash that I like
and what that does is it takes the user
password and it hashes it up into an
unreadable serial and it's about I don't
know 30 or 40 characters long or 20 to
30 something like that and it's all
jumbled up not humanly readable not you
can't yeah you can't read or you can't
reverse an md5 hash the only way to
I'll show you how it's done when we when
we do the activation script I'll show
you how you find out if the values match
after you run an a hash in your database
so we add a hash to the password so when
and here we're adding the SQL query into
the my members table and this is where
the actual values get sunk in at this
point I'm going to add the first name to
the middle name and this is these are
the values coming from our variables
that they put into the form here and
these are the fields that we want to
claim that we want to put those values
in these fields are sitting in our
database waiting to be populated so we
insert we run a - ql query insert into
my members table first name all that
could all that good stuff that we want
and then we set the values and the only
thing that I should talk about here cuz
those should be self-explanatory all
those values going in except this now
this is a native PHP function that'll
get the date so this will get the date
and it'll pop it right into the database
into that default format that we said
that we want and that's the signup date
that way the user doesn't have to put it
in we just grab it automatically then
the website and their YouTube and that's
it and if there's an error putting the
stuff in it dies and won't more process
and the if you want to put an act symbol
in front of your functions here you can
and that'll hide any information if
errors occur but I don't think any
errors are going to occur with mine I
think it's gonna do well we'll test it
in just a second see if we can join it
so here after we add the values to the
database after we do all that filtering
and checking and ever checking and
everything if everything works out we
we've run these last few filters then we
add everything to the database then we
make we grab the ID that was inserted so
if this hat member happens to be member
5 527 this ID value here that we're
gonna grab it's gonna be 527 because
it's the
the insert you can look at pH php.net
for what that does as well I'm not gonna
sit down here and explain what every
function and mechanism in PHP does
because that's what that site is for
php.net you go to grab that ID and then
we make directory make directory it's
going to make a folder for that user and
you can use their username their first
name and last name or if you have a
system that creates unique user names
into your database then you can use the
user name for the folder I'm just going
to use the ID so when I join this is
gonna be a folder called 1 or named 1 in
the members so actually we have to make
that let's go into FileZilla create
directory let's call it members and
that's a folder press ok let's file
attributes to 755 755 Jamaat ok
and now when members join
there'll be a folder in there with their
ID on it and that's where we stick their
mp3's images video files everything to
do with their profile ok so where are we
here we are so we make the directory and
each folder gets to mod of 7 5 5 also so
they can upload to it no problem and
what else that way the site can access
the folder and they can upload to it ok
so we go to we put the email the user's
email that just joined up into a
variable called to claim a variable call
2 because that's what's going to get
sent this email that we're about to send
is going to go to that person and this
is the activation sequence now we're
going to write a script called
activation dot PHP we're going to put it
in our root directory with everything
else and that's going to be for after
they joined they're gonna get an email
to activate as you know as a proper
human would most big sites do this now
they
to stop the spam bots and everything so
you send them to email and in that email
right here you say you know complete
this step how you doing first name
complete this step but click the
activation link below when ready and
then you setup the link to that script
that we're going to create we had a
couple of URL variables one for their ID
and sequence is going to be their
database password that hashed up line of
stuff that we created from their
password so they'll click that and when
they click that it automatically our
activation script is going to
automatically activate them into the
database so they can log in before that
point before they click that link they
won't be able to log into the site so
they have to be sort of aware that they
have to get that email and click that
link you know I'm sorry give them the
proper messaging and in the site or in
the system okay then you tell them log
in after successful activation using
your email and you list what their email
was and password and you list it with
that password was before you hashed it
up remember and that's it and we say see
you on the site give your admin email
then you set up your headers for running
the mail function and then the the two
variable I don't know why I've got that
there and I don't need that and then so
now we run the mail function in PHP mail
function and you can look into other
mail functions if you you know if you
like using pair or other mechanisms
besides PHP to run they can all be
scripted within the same same script
also but I'm gonna run the PHP mail
function to the member the subject is
defined right here complete web
intersect registration that's going to
be the subject line of the email the
message is going to be all of this hi
first-name blah blah blah activation
link and all that crap and then headers
we send these headers here and that's
going to be the from variable and from
is admin at Weber intersect calm or
admin at your website calm and then
claim the content type as text regular
text it's just a regular text email
ok so yep we run the mail function send
all those things then we set up a
message to user so since we're going to
set up a message to user and I was
talking to you about that Universal
message to user page we have to create
that now so let's take the about Us page
and save file save as
I think it's msg T oh you se our message
to user save it go into the code say
message to I mean I'm not gonna leave
all this but you got to change these
things or else and this search engine
spiders don't like your site as much
this is message they all should be
unique your description and keywords
should be unique on all your different
pages bla bla bla bla message message to
you
from
okay so that's message to use her all we
have to do is print out a variable
instead of this word here will actually
let me just put a table of c90 80% one
column one row okay that's fine and I'm
gonna Center that bad boy if I can here
Center now here is where we want that
message so we just say it's gonna be a
variable of msg I think that's the
variable
I'll put name let's go back to register
and check yep that's the variable name
so we have the right variable name so
this is where they're gonna get that
output output message if everything went
correctly and it's gonna tell them to
check their email because we just sent
them one so all we have to do is grab
some PHP tags and print here the message
to user wrap that in double quotes then
question mark close the PHP tag oh when
you semicolon after the double quote
okay so that will effectively print that
message to user from this other
registration form because right here we
include message to user dot PHP so what
happens here and this is kind of tricky
but it's really cool it's kind of
magical you can include that file this
whole page into this script because
right here as long as you exit this
script directly after none of this page
will come in this registration form
won't even be there but they'll be on
the registration form page
realistically but we'll be syncing this
file into it if that makes any sense and
I'll show you that in just a second
right when I joined now I think I'm all
done okay and right there and here's our
else conditional if the form was not
posted - with variables you place the
default empty variables remember I
discussed that already and that's it
so we mailed to them and then we send
them a little message here when they're
still on our site include this file
that's going to hold this message h2 one
last step activate through email okay
actually I'm going to show you that
right now
so let's go - we created message to user
PHP let's FTP that this is to user - PHP
let's put up register make sure that's
up that's already up and I think that's
it activation we're gonna make in the
next beginning part of the next tutorial
and we're gonna make the activation
script and start on the login login in
the header the login mechanism is going
to be up in the header of our site and
I'm going to show you the scripts for
that - so the activation script and the
header script will be on or the login
script will be in the next part five and
now let's just go to register yeah and
you'll see how this works now if I
submit form it shows me everything I
missed if I put my first name Adam and I
press submit it's gonna take away this
error it says first name here at lunch
see now it's asking me for my last name
so put in Corey Adam Corey took away
last name now once my country so you see
how that works they're gonna put all
these things in and let's say I live in
a Mis Mis si es si PPI
and pick a game I don't live and pick a
game Mississippi but I been there
it's pretty cool pick a game kicks ass
all right so you put in any zip code
online crap see if you submit form it
has more of what it needs now so it's
asking for Less and never checking and
put in three two three two two three and
a phone number you would put your real
one in there the website you don't have
to put that in but let's put it in -
flash building comm wherever that is
WWWE see I'll even put the HTTP in in
there like a dumbass to show you how it
will remove it then I put my youtube
channel
- beer Dean and my email let's use admin
at the better PHP that's good and three
password
let's remove all this text because it'll
give us an error if we don't submit
forms see what happens I might made a
mistake no I think it worked beautiful
look at our work first shot one last
step activate through email okay Adam
one last step to verify your email
identity in a moment you'll be sent an
email activation link to your email
address it's very important if you check
your email host and this is a very
important message you should give you
your members as well
and I don't know if it's just a PHP
function the mail function that I use
but some people if they check their
email like their GoDaddy default email
application thing it's sometimes screwy
ok here I am in PHP myadmin let's browse
it you go to PHP myadmin by going to
your what you call it and put my
password in here yeah this is sensitive
data you shouldn't be showing anyone
ever but I'm okay my system is gonna be
okey dokey
now let's check in the database and make
sure so my members let's click that but
it was just in there
stupid thing let's browse my members
table why are you doing that to me
I'm gonna beat this thing up in a second
just take my keyboard and smash it
straight into the monitor there it is
there's all that information I just put
in picking Mississippi Adam I didn't put
in a middle name and that's fine you can
see our bio body still has a null on and
that's great cuz we didn't set up any of
that yet that'll be later I'm gonna head
it's beautiful
email activated still zero because I
haven't activated yet so I can't log
into the site plus we haven't built a
login form or anything yet first step is
to build the activation the activation
script which will turn this field from 0
to 1 then they can log in but that's a
pretty much our goals so we'll we'll get
the activation script made we'll get a
login script made and then we can start
getting into some cool things just
setting this stuff up this first few
things was a little tedious and sorry
for that but then we can get into the
cool stuff after we do a few more things
to set up the system ok we'll see in
