transform effects like scale rotate 2008
and understand the transform matrix so
to demonstrate this we need a rectangle
so let's go under our CTX object and I'm
going to apply a fill style to it of
yellow or like an orange color and then
we'll type in CTX dot fill rector's to
experiment with an immediate rectangle
and I'll make its exposition 50 its Y
position 50 and give it a width and
height of 100 pixels so if i refresh my
canvas I get my rectangle let's go ahead
and draw another rectangle it's right
next to that one at a 200 X position now
the first transform method that we're
going to take a look at is the CTX that
scale method and this takes two
parameters the X and the y so you have X
scale and Y scale let's put a comment in
that says default scale is 1 and 1 so if
I was to put 0.5 here and then 0.5 here
that's half scale now that scales the
whole perspective of the canvas so if I
was to put this let's see what's the
size of my canvas it's 500 wide if I was
to put this rectangle the second
rectangle at 500 and refresh you'll see
it only goes to about 250 that's because
it's half scale everything beyond this
fill rect we put this fill rect in place
and it's not affected but then we use
the scale method and then things become
affected now the next method we're going
to take a look at is rotate method and
this just gets one parameter of the
angle in radians so let's remove that
comment and let's put this back on 200
and refresh our canvas well first let's
comment that out then refresh now we're
back to normal with no transforms all
right now let's pop in the rotate method
and I'm going to set the angle to 0.1
refresh now 0.15 refresh 0.17 refresh
and you can just see it slowly rotating
around go up to 2 and refresh so if I
put that on point zero five and I was to
add a
the rectangle 350 exposition and refresh
you'll see that both of them the ones
that are set after the rotate method
they rotate according to the top-left
perspective of the canvas now we're
going to take a look at the CTX
translate method which is used for X&amp;amp;Y
movement so the X I'll put it 0 and the
y 0 so if i refresh this we'll see no
transformation but if I want to move it
on the y axis down 50 pixels refresh and
you see everything on the canvas after I
specify the translate method moves down
50 pixels if I wanted to move 20 pixels
to the right I'll make a 20 for the X
parameter refresh so let's put those
back on 0 refresh now if I want to put
negative 50 here that'll make it go up
and to make a go left you can say
negative whatever number and then it'll
go left
okay let's remove the translate method
refresh now we're going to take a look
at the transform method the transform
method takes a 6 value matrix you can
pop in some comments to yourself here
the first comment lets you know what the
values in the matrix apply to so you can
scale horizontally skew vertically skew
horizontally scale vertically move
things horizontally and move things
vertically now a default transform
matrix is these values here so I can
just take those values copy them go to
the next line see TX dot transform and
then pop those values in in between
parenthesis now if I were to refresh I'd
see no changes because there's no
transform being applied because this is
a default value setting for a transform
now you can start playing with these
values so if I went one point one for
the scale X you can see that everything
on the canvas after we specify the
transform method everything on the
canvas is scaled horizontally so if we
go to the Y's
Gail and we change that to 1.1 we should
also see some changes see it scales a
little bit vertically now along the
y-axis so let's put those back to 1
you know what those do and if you wanted
to put that at 0.5 that would give it
half scale at 0.8 you'll be able to see
it a little better so that's a partial
scale on the x-axis and if we put the
y-axis at a partial scale that's even to
that and we refresh so you can go either
direction scale up or scale down so
let's put that back on 1 and 1 refresh
now let's take a look at what why skew
and XQ do so we'll take from 0 and we'll
go to 0.1 and refresh let's put that
back on zero and then let's try point 1
and that skews horizontally to see a
more dramatic effect just raise that
value let's put that back on zero
refresh now let's talk about the X
translate and Y translate so if I want
to move those items 30 pixels on the
x-axis and 20 pixels on the y axis I can
also use negative values there to go in
the opposite direction so now you
understand all of the values that work
within the transform matrix of values
now the very last method within the
transform family is set transform and
that will allow you to more
independently transform assets on your
canvas because it resets the current
transform to the identity matrix then it
invokes the transform method to run so
in order to see that in action what I'm
going to do is remove all these wrecks
and that original transform there and
I'll take this control X and we'll put
it above these things that way you can
still reference it then we're going to
have just one fill rect so we'll have
one orange square then I'm going to set
transform and I'm going to draw another
square and if i refresh that you can see
what we have going on if I remove the
transform and refresh that's our two
squares without
transform so now the second square gets
the transform applied now what I'm going
to do is set another transform then I'm
going to draw another square under the
second one refresh so you can see that
we reset the transform identity and if
you were to use the regular transform
method right here instead of set
transform and refresh you can see that
the third square is adhering to the
first transform even though we're
specifying a default transform before we
draw the third so that's how set
transform comes in handy it resets the
transform matrix identity on the canvas
refresh so that's how you can see a
contrasting effect on how transform add
set transform are a little bit different
but really this one can be a regular
transform refresh and we still get the
same effects but you have to use set
transform if you want to reset the
current transform to the identity matrix
and that completes twins formation
effects on the canvas element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
