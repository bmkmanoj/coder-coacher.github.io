responsive dynamic layouts tutorial
let's take a quick look at the finished
product so you can evaluate whether or
not you want to learn this kind of
technique now this demo web page that
you're going to be learning how to build
with in this video tutorial is set up
with three different style sheets the
first one is large CSS the second one is
medium CSS and the third one is mobile
that CSS now what happens is as I resize
the browser window if the window dot
inner width property it's let's than
1200 pixels I make it snap or switch to
the medium CSS so you see how that
happens it switches to an 800 wide pixel
layout now if the browser window gets
less than 900 I switch to mobile C so
you can see there is a mobile style
layout where everything is dynamically
width so all the D data kind of wraps
around that menu and the menu has a
dynamic width set to it and the buttons
a little bit bigger and the header is a
little bit smaller up top you can see on
the medium the header is a little bigger
the buttons are normal and on the large
it's just a little bit wider so this all
happens as the user is resizing your
browser window so that is what you're
going to be learning how to construct
now I've recently reprogrammed Adam Cory
comm to wear my late-breaking news for
technology developers and science so
it's developer news science news
technology news and this other news kind
of news feeds that I'm going to tap into
where if you want to check daily all the
late-breaking news of technology and
stuff like that and developer coding
news you can peek in at Adam Cory comm
whenever you want and even up top here
and daily news you can get to all the
different specific sections to see the
full listing and like I said I'm going
to be writing articles here and the
reason why I'm telling you this is
because I just wrote an article
yesterday
that's about JavaScript mobile phone
detect and screen size redirect scripts
now what you saw us using here is a
dynamic script that changes the style
sheets dynamically according to what the
screen or the browser window has been
resized to
but if you just want to redirect your
users to a mobile directory which is a
little bit different from what we're
going to be doing in this tutorial you
can use one of these two little scripts
and what that does is redirects your
user if they're on a mobile device to
your mobile directory for your website
and they're two separate ways of doing
it so that's why I listed both different
methods for it so that's just in case
you just want to simply redirect your
users to a whole different directory
what we're doing in this tutorial here
is we're swapping the style sheets so
you're going from large dot CSS to
medium dot CSS to mobile dot CSS all in
real time as the user is resizing the
page but you could also use just a
simple script like this to switch the
stylesheet to a mobile dot CSS style
sheet if you happen to notice the screen
the user screen is less than nine
hundred pixels or if you want to target
their device directly you can do things
according to that and I'm sorry for
talking so long in the beginning of this
before we start with the code but I feel
those things needed to be discussed
because there's a lot of different ways
to accommodate
for a smaller screen or mobile device
and things like that now first we're
going to start with the bare bones of an
html5 web document which is index.html
and I'm going to start with it all bare
so you can see how we build an
application like this from scratch and
even if you have an existing page you'll
be able to more easily understand how to
integrate this kind of thing into your
existing page and also keep in mind as
I've mentioned several times now we have
three different style sheets you have
large CSS medium dot CSS you can see
between large and medium dot CSS there's
not many changes just a few numbers are
different and then mobile dot CSS which
is a little bit different because things
elements on the page need to be
repositioned and made dynamic in their
width so you can see we have dynamic
widths in this version and in these we
don't have any dynamic widths they're
pixel widths and I'll show those to you
again or you can just pause while I'm on
each one of those if you want to copy my
exact dot C
stylesheets you can just pause the video
make sure you fullscreen it and you can
copy my CSS exactly because in the page
where this code is offered on develop
PHP comm I'm only going to have the
index.html file offered to you guys I'm
not going to have the dot CSS
stylesheets there that you can copy and
paste you have to use your own style
sheets okay so index dot HTML let me
just go ahead and close these but just
know that they live in the same
directory so if I go to file open you'll
see in that directory I have my index
page which is my web page and then I
have my three style sheets you could
have your style sheets in a folder
called style it doesn't matter just as
long as you link to them correctly the
first thing I'm going to do is pop the
HTML into the body element of the page
so you can see I just popped in a div
right there for my header and that's the
big gray header that you saw on top then
I have div my menu which is this whole
div right there and you can see there's
only four little a tags within it which
are links so those are my buttons within
my menu div and then last thing I have
is a div my content so each div has an
ID and in my content you can see I just
have some lorem ipsum there which is
just gobbledygook and dummy placeholder
text which I will collapse alright so
there's my divs div my content div my
menu and on the very top is div my
header now in the head element on the
page what we'll do is pop in a link tag
and the link is for the style sheet so
if you've ever used the dot CSS style
sheet for designing your web page this
is the normal way that you link to it
but the only difference is here we have
an ID placed an ID of page style and by
default we want to load in the large CSS
which is the one for people on very wide
screen desktops now right under that in
the head element still we want to put a
script element that way we can place
some JavaScript right here the first
thing in the JavaScript you want to have
your function layout handler
open closed parentheses opening curly
brace go down a couple of lines and put
the closing curly brace in now inside of
this function is where the layout
handling will take place now the first
line in that function you want to make a
variable that is an object
representation of this link element here
this link element has an ID of page
style so we target that by saying
document get element by ID page style so
now this element right here is
referenced in this variable now the next
line is how we are going to change the
stylesheet from large CSS to some other
CSS but we want to put this line in some
if conditions but I want to show you
this line first so you understand what
we're doing now when you run the
function layout handler if you left just
these two lines within it it's going to
switch to mobile dot CSS no matter what
size the user screen is when they are
resizing it or when they first come to
the page no matter what size the screen
is mobile dot CSS will replace large dot
CSS because we're using the set
attribute method which will effectively
change the href attribute and its value
on this link element so let me just
comment out that line I just wanted to
explain that line to you guys because
that's the line we're going to be using
that actually swaps and switches the
href and the value for this link element
which is the link to your stylesheet so
before that line runs you want to have
an if condition and we want to check for
the inner width of the window object so
before we put in the evaluation for that
if condition let's just go down here and
let's make this function run copy it
right here just copy the function name
with the opening and CRO closing curly
brace and put it right there
with a semicolon after it now what this
does is it makes layout handler run so
right when for instance line 13 is being
processed by the browser software it's
going to make layout handler run if you
didn't put this line or if you had this
line commented out this function layout
handler would never run so what we're
going to do when the page first loads up
and the user first comes to it before
any design and
markup HTML is thrown out to the page
we're going to run this function called
layout handler to switch the stylesheet
if we need to to maybe a mobile or
medium size and right above that outside
of the function we're going to type in
window dot on resize which is the event
handler that we want equals and then you
can just put layout handler and that
makes that function run on window resize
so you remember in the beginning when I
was showing you the demo while I was
resizing the browser window the CSS was
changing the whole CSS stylesheet was
changing as I got to certain widths so
the way you do that as the user is
resizing the browser window to run the
function layout handler is you use this
line right here window Don resides
equals layout handler and this runs the
function layout handler anytime the
window is being resized now in your if
condition you want to check the size of
the browser window so you can just say
this dot inner width or you can use
window dot enter width you can use
either this inner width or window enter
width and what that will show you is the
for instance if I resize Dreamweaver
here it'll show you the inner width of
that window the browser window that's
what it will return to you so if the
inner width is less than nine hundred
pixels then we're going to use this line
right here to make the whole page change
to using the mobile dot CSS instead of
the large dot CSS so if the window dot
inner width is less than nine hundred
pixels we're going to make the page
change to use this mobile dot CSS now
you can take that if condition copy it
and just type in and else here and paste
your if condition else if window enter
width is less than 1200 you want to
serve up medium dot CSS then you can
have a final else condition and this
will be if the screen is very large very
wide wider than twelve hundred pixels
you're going to serve up large dot CSS
you see how that works you're going from
smallest to the largest as the user is
resizing their browser window let me run
this in my favorite browser and see what
I have let me resize so right now I'm
viewing large that CSS let me resize
make it smaller
there's mediums that CSS comes into play
and then there's mobile dot CSS because
the browser window is very small it's
less than nine hundred pixels so it goes
to mobile okay so what you're doing here
this line is any time the user resizes
the window so basically when I am
performing this action that is window
dot on resize running the layout handler
function and this line right here only
makes layout handler run when the page
first loads up during its loading
process when it first loads up that's
why we put this line here because layout
handler has to run when the browser
window first loads up or during its
loading process initially this is only
here to make it this layout handler
function run whenever the window is
being resized and for enhanced
performance on the web which you can do
is preload mobile dot CSS and medium dot
CSS using JavaScript it gives you a
little bit better performance so you can
Google search for preload dot CSS
stylesheets using javascript now like I
said at Adam quarry comm I have an
article that I just wrote yesterday
because I know some people are going to
have questions about how do I just
redirect a person to my mobile directory
instead of changing swapping out the
stylesheet I want to navigate them to a
whole new mobile directory for my site
these two little scripts show you how to
do that and also keep in mind that PHP
and Apache can also detect the user
agent which is the browser software and
redirect the user accordingly using PHP
or dot HT access on Apache and I wrote
these because some people like might
like to see how it's done using
JavaScript but PHP and Apache htx s can
take care of detection and redirection
if you want I'll be writing articles
from time to time on Adam Cory comm and
there's always the late-breaking news
but you can see it's always updating
every 30 minutes my scripts tap into
various news organizations and bring the
news in and it's just a news link to
where when you click on that you go to
their actual website to read the article
but it's always updated because I like
to keep on top of what's happening in
the dork realms</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
