webmaster lesson for the develop PHP
miscellaneous video tutorial section and
I have to be sure although my webmaster
friends are up on the latest trends in
web marketing so if you're interested in
marketing web exposure getting more
traffic make it more money and search
engine optimization and the following
free information is made just for you
and if you like helping your friends
that own websites be sure and share this
video with them
Google is undergoing an experiment with
a gadget titled the +1 button which is
gurus way of allowing people online to
give their stamp of approval for content
they deem worthy
it's a widget that runs much like the
Facebook like button widget when you see
the like button on various pages on
various web sites it's much like that
but it's Google's version of that so you
put the +1 button on your page and all
that have a Google account can +1 or
recommend your pages to others online
this button also appears next to search
engine listings for people who are
logged into their Google account making
its usage and appearance that much more
active first we'll show you how this
looks to a person logged into their
Google account when they search for
information in gear I'm going to search
for a developed space PHP and hit enter
and you don't even have to hit enter
nowadays it's great and you can see the
+1 button shows up under every page
results whether it's my page or not and
I can +1 any websites right here in the
search engine results any ones that I
want and if you happen to search for
develop PHP and you're logged into your
Google account you'll see that +1 button
there and you should hit it and you can
see I hit these three links already and
it says you +1 this now I'll show you
what these same results look like to
somebody who's not logged into their
Google account I'll just pull open
Safari or something
right now I'm in Chrome but I'll open up
Safari and I'm not logged in using
Safari not logged into Google and I'm
going to type in develop space PHP and
you can see here is the results and
there's no plus
unbuttoned because I'm not logged in but
if I happen to click on this page I
already placed it into this page so
you'll see it show up right here and
even though I am not logged in what I'll
get from Google is them asking me to
create an account or log in to my Google
account so I can +1 this now that's
somebody who's not logged into their
Google account what it does is recommend
them to either log in to their Google
account or create a Google account if
they don't have one yet so they can +1
this page and I'm going to be showing
you guys how to sync this into your
pages I'll show you the code needed now
let's take a look at what it looks like
to somebody who is logged in and they
happen to land on a page where this
little widget is showing ok Here I am at
the PHP programming course at develop
PHP comm and here's the +1 button that
is rendering on the page and I'm going
to click it and I'm logged in right now
so it +1 that and on my Google account
it's going to record and render that
within my Google account so anybody
that's a friend of mine at Google and
other people that have Google accounts
will see the +1 or potentially see the
+1 similar to the way Facebook like
works which you can see I have a play
right here so this is what it looks like
when you program it in to your pages
directly so finally we'll show you the
simple code needed to apply it to your
pages the way I applied it to mine of
applying this to any web page that you
want is very very simple so what you can
do is go into your head tag and place
this little bit of code so here's just a
little comment and there's only two
steps to this this is the first step you
place this in the head tag or anywhere
in your body tag where script tags can
process so what that means is this
doesn't really have to be in your head
tag it could be anywhere down in your
body tag that you want to put it but
we'll just leave it in the head tag for
this example and now step two is you
simply apply this line of code here and
you add this to your body tag where you
wish it to render so anywhere in your
page any kind of table container or div
container
it anywhere you want this little widget
to appear is where you put this code so
you can see the G+ one tag it has a few
parameters that you can set the first
one is size and I'll discuss the four
different sizes that you can set the
second parameter we have in place is the
count which can be true or false if you
want to show the count or not and the
next one is href which is equal to
whichever page that you want this widget
to affect or beyond the href is the page
which people are to +1 whichever page
you want people to +1 whichever page
this is going on is the page in the
website that you put here in the href
now there's one more parameter that you
can put in optionally that is a callback
it's called Colback and that's equal to
a JavaScript callback function but most
people wouldn't have the need for that
unless you're getting into complex
things with the API now we'll discuss
this size parameter because this one
could have four different values the
first one being small or you can put
medium you can also put standard the way
I had it and tol those are the four
values that you can define for the size
parameter I'll just leave mine is
standard and that's it I'll have this
code up at the page undeveloped PHP
where this video is rendering right
under the video in case any of you guys
will just want to copy and paste it if
you have any trouble seeing the code in
the video ok we'll talk to you next time
