they can create clean SEO friendly URLs
which is the art of taking a long URL
that has maybe many dynamic URL
variables in it such as this one here
and rewriting it to this friendlier
version the prettier more clean version
and my hope is to pass along enough
insight into how it all works so that
everyone can customize all of their own
clean URLs by themselves in the future
no matter how many variables the system
needs to take in from the URL if you
don't already have an HT access file on
your server we'll show you how to create
one now you can just open up notepad and
then go to file save as and just save it
in your website main directory the main
folder for your website on your local
computer side where we have all the rest
of our website files now as save as type
you can just go to all files and then
just make sure it has dot HT access as
the extension save now you can see a
notepad you have a file called dot HT
access the file has no name it only has
an extension and the extension is dot HT
access now it's important if you already
have an HT access file on your live
server online it's important to go and
download that and add to it you don't
want to overwrite what's there already
if you happen to have one so it's
important you go and check within your
FTP software to see if you have an HT
access file in the main directory of
your website what we did just now is we
created a new blank one and what that's
going to do if you happen to have one on
your server when we put this one up it's
going to overwrite all the directives
that you have in your existing one so
that's why it's very important to go and
grab your existing htaccess file if it's
there and add to it now within my HT
Access file before any rewrite rules
be established we have to turn the
rewrite engine on what we'll do is we'll
just type in a comment and anywhere that
you see a pound sign that means that
line is commented out that means it's
just a comment for human reading the
server won't process that line it's just
for you
to write things little notes to yourself
so you can put a pound sign and then
your comment now on the next line down
let's actually turn on the rewrite
engine so all you have to do is put in
this string read write engine on now the
next comment I'm going to put in place
is I want to rewrite for my file that's
called projects PHP and this is what the
rewrite rule looks like for that you
just type in rewrite rule put a space
and then the caret symbol now the string
of text that you have after the caret
symbol is the new directory listing that
you want to have it really doesn't exist
on my site but I want people to navigate
to that and when they navigate to
forward slash custom on my site it's
going to take them to projects that PHP
and I just named it custom to let you
know that you could put any string there
any word so now let me save that I'm
going to FTP this file to my web server
live online now Here I am in my live web
server now I'll just type in /cam press
ENTER to load it and you can see that my
projects that PHP page loads up and you
can confirm that if we go to home and
then hit the projects link the project
link links to projects that PHP so all I
would have to do is go into my code
that's the header in my menu and change
this link instead of navigating to
projects that PHP I can make that link
in the code navigate to custom then when
I load custom when I load this URL my
projects that PHP comes up and I just
named it custom just to let you know
that you can put anything you want there
now it gets more involved in that and
we're going to show you some more
advanced examples right now go back into
our htaccess file I'm going to write
ourselves a couple of more notes that
way we can understand what this ends
II and this L are doing in place there
so we can just go under the rewrite rule
and put in and make this bigger these
two comments
the first comment says NC makes the rule
non case-sensitive so that means if
somebody types in with a capital T here
for the in the word custom it'll still
work if you wanted to force it to always
be lowercase and not let them put in
capitals then you can just remove the NC
now the L that you see here makes this
the last rule that this specific
condition will match and in our case
we're not actually using the rewrite
condition line we're just putting the
whole rewrite rule into one line here
but if you've ever wondered what NC and
L are doing in your htaccess file you
can refer to these two comments here now
we're going to make a rewrite rule on my
server for the user dot PHP file with
the dynamic URL variable of U and this
is how if you have a social network or
something that your system would know
how to render each user profile
according to the dynamic URL variable
now remember the opening picture so at
first it's going to by default it's
going to be like this we're going to
make it look like this
all right so directly under that comment
let's put in the rewrite rule and don't
worry I'll explain every bit of the
syntax to you now let me save this file
by pressing control s I'm going to
reload this I'm going to FTP it up to my
live web server okay so now that I have
this new rewrite rule I can go to the
pretty version of my user file which
currently you can see to get there I
have to go user dot PHP question mark u
equals Jack and that's what tells the
user dot PHP script which user to load
out of the database so since we have a
pretty URL rule in place now for the
users we can navigate to that URL and
that is simply user forward slash Jack
so you can see as many times as you
refresh you still get the correct user
dot PHP profile page to come up but you
have a nice pretty URL now if you put in
different name there it's going to load
atom from the database so to make that
like it was before I would just have to
put user dot PHP question mark u equals
atom and that will load the same exact
page but one version of the URL is just
a little more SEO friendly and pretty
and keep in mind this user dot PHP file
could be named poopoo dot PHP it can be
named anything you want it could be a
secret name that nobody would know that
way they can never load up the URL this
way because they would have no prior
knowledge of what the actual file is
named you just serve them up the URL
this way and it loads the page directly
and they cannot see what that PHP script
is actually named now this example only
deals with rewriting the URL if you have
one dynamic URL variable but you might
have multiple dynamic URL variables and
you need to rewrite rule for that so
we'll show you that right now and then
we'll explain all the syntax that you
see here and how it works so I'm going
to put in my final comment and my final
rewrite rule now the comment says
rewrite for article PHP and we have
dynamic URL variable of ID and a URL
variable of title and I'm actually going
to show you the source code that I have
for user PHP and article dot PHP so you
can see what the code that I have inside
of those two files and you'll notice
that you can just access the get
variables the URL variables in the same
normal way that your script did before
so I'm going to save this and re FTP it
reload it to my live web server ok so
now you can see that I have my article
dot PHP loaded with the proper URL
variables going into it so this is what
that renders the article ID is one and
the article title is Hetal hello world
so you can see that my article that PHP
script has full access to those URL
variables coming in now I'm going to
rewrite it in its clean format okay here
we go
so let's now reload the page with the
clean format of the URL and you can see
that it works fine you can load it up
press ENTER as many times as you want it
still comes up the same as it did before
and your article dot PHP page has access
to these these are actually the get
variables this one and this one this is
your ID and this is the title so now
that you can see everything working let
me go back to the way it looked before
so you see there's the unfriendly or
dirty URL and there is the clean version
now I'm going to explain the syntax of
these to rewrite rules and then after
that you should be well on your way to
customizing all of your own clean URLs
within your systems alright so this
first one that we took project stop PHP
and we made it so where the user could
just navigate to custom and that
projects that PHP would come up now for
the second example we rewrote for user
PHP with a dynamic URL variable of the
username so what we have in the rewrite
rule after the caret symbol is we put
the word user or the string user then we
put a forward slash to specify that
that's going to be a directory and after
the forward slash we put regular
expression logic and this regular
expression just reads that this part of
the URL can have numbers 0 through 9 it
can have uppercase and lowercase letters
but it can't have spaces or any other
crazy characters like that unless you
specify that here for instance if you
wanted to let underscores be in the URL
for this part of the URL you can put
underscore there and it will allow it so
for my example it's only going to allow
numbers and uppercase lowercase letters
and this plus just lets it be a string
length an undetermined string length so
basically this is where the URL variable
is derived in the rewrite so when the
rewrite occurs this is going to derive
the URL variable and this one here is
what represents that so when the clean
URL is navigated to user dot PHP is
still going to get its dynamic URL
variable of U and the value it's going
to have after the equal sign is going to
be equal to whatever dynamic string in
this part of the URL after the forward
slash that's what allows you to navigate
to simply user forward slash and then
the username okay so really
understanding regular expressions will
help you leaps and bounds and will help
you move a lot faster when it comes to
customizing your own clean URLs now for
the article dot PHP which had ID and
title we rewrote the URL just to have
more regular expression matching for all
the parts of the URL we wanted so we
wanted it to say article then forward
slash the article ID forward slash and
then the article title so these two
groupings that you see here in between
the forward slashes of the URL are going
to be resulting in these two variables
one and two that way when article dot
PHP loads with it's pretty URL version
your database is still going to know
which incoming get variables that it has
available and these strings here that
are going to be in the URL in the clean
URL are going to be what determines what
comes out of the database so let's go
back to the server online and let's grab
that URL and then let's just pop it in
here as a comment and we'll be able to
see exactly what's happening so if we
put it right up against that so article
we have article and forward slash that
is a constant that's a static thing that
isn't going to be dynamic in the URL but
this part of the URL is always going to
be dynamic and so is this part so that's
why we have regular expression groupings
in there to allow for a dynamic string
to be in there and that dynamic string
is then represented as this variable one
and this variable two that way when
article PHP loads it can still operate
like it normally does so in this regular
expression grouping you can see that I'm
allowing numbers 0 through 9 uppercase
and lowercase letters and I'm allowing
underscore and the - the - and then once
it reaches a space that's where in the
rewrite rule that you're going to put
the original file name and the variable
structure the URL variable structure so
basically you just write rewrite rule
space you put the caret symbol then the
structure of your clean URL then space
then you put the original dirty URL and
its URL variable structure that way the
script can still operate like normal and
it has get variables of ID and title
still coming in to it now I told you I
would show you what the code looked like
in my user dot PHP file and my article
dot PHP file you can clearly see it's
not very complex it's just requesting
the get variables and then rendering
them on the page yours would be a lot
more complex and be doing a lot more
things and would be requesting data
according to this ID title maybe in the
same with user dot PHP you would be
using this dynamic variable and what
we've done is we've run preg replaced to
sanitize it it only allows letters and
numbers to be in that string it's a way
of cleaning filtering and sanitizing the
incoming get variable so this that you
see here highlighted in blue is simply a
clean version of this by itself so you
just grab the get the incoming get
variable from the URL but this is just a
way to add some cleansing to it same for
article we're grabbing the incoming get
variable of ID
and the incoming get variable of title
it all still works like normal you
shouldn't have to change very much
within your files unless you want to add
more considerations to the script for
the title or whatever if you want to
check and make sure the title is correct
for that ID that article ID or whatever
that's up to you but this is how you get
access to those and it's really the same
way you did before before you clean the
URL you were getting access to these
variables this way and you still get
access to them that way after you clean
the urls up so I'm going to have article
dot PHP source code available for you
user dot PHP source code and our dot
htaccess file all of this source code
