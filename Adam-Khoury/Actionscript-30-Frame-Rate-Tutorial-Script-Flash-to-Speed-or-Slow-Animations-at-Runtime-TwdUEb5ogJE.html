you'll be learning how to create in this
video these buttons that can control
your frames per second of your file
allow the user to control it at runtime
so you can go cracked's be Bionic speed
or normal speed or any animations that
you have hello today we are going to
demonstrate scripting runtime
actionscript 3.0 frame rate adjustments
by accessing the stage objects rain rate
property and manipulating it basically
it will show you how to script animation
speed changes or allow users to adjust
the animation speed of your file as a
place at runtime this functionality was
introduced with ActionScript 3 whereas
in ActionScript 1 and ActionScript 2 you
had to create hacks to accomplish this
sort of thing with the tween engine in
order to save time and focus on the
lesson subject we will start with an
existing animation I made that simply
loops to make it seem like the jogger
just keeps running and running my goal
has placed three buttons into the scene
and allow viewers to make the character
run at a normal jogging speed then a
crackhead speed and finally Bionic speed
so that is what I will do now to my
existing animation and this would work
for any animations you have okay so take
note that my frames per second of my
file is set to 30 and that's the
animation that you just saw with the
character running so you saw the speed
that is there it is one more time I'm
going to highlight this layer I'm going
to create a new layer and I'm going to
name that a s 3 short for ActionScript 3
I'm going to highlight that layer and
press f9 or go up to window actions then
once my scripting pane is open I'm going
to type in stage dot framerate is equal
to let's say something like 90 and
you'll see changes right away now what
we're doing here is accessing the stage
objects brain rate property and making
it 90 instead of being 30 which the vial
is set at so now let's look at it by
pressing ctrl enter she's running much
faster you can tell and you can set that
as high as 120 I think it is the max now
let's take a dynamic text field actually
let's just get rid of that because I
just wanted to show you real quick how
to access that
functionality but now let's show you
some user interaction and some rendering
of these values onto the screen so let's
put a dynamic text field onstage and up
here let's make sure it's classic text
dynamic text and I'm going to name it
test underscore txt and I'm going to
make sure it's black so I can see the
letters in it and I'm not going to put
that on my as3 layer I'm gonna put it
down here with everything else now I'm
going to make that tell me the frame
rate so type in test underscore txt dot
text is equal to stage dot framerate and
this is how you can tell what the frame
rate is to make sure this is lowercase F
and since that's going to be a string
and this is going to be a number we have
to put some kind of string characters in
here or convert that number to an actual
string but since we're going to say fps
before that number anyway let's just go
FPS : space actually equal sign makes
more sense so it'll say FPS is equal to
whatever the stage frame rate is at
runtime so if I press control enter
I should see FPS equals 30 very good and
now you already know how to manipulate
it because I showed you how to change
the stages frame rate now what we're
going to do is add the user interaction
with some buttons I don't have any
buttons on stage yet but let's say I'm
going to put one called BTN one I'm
going to add an event listener to that
it's going to be a mouse event dot click
because when the button is clicked I
want it to change speed let's say go
Bionic that'll be the function that
fires off on click so I can grab that
name and type in the line below function
go Bionic open close parenthesis : void
open the curly brace and go down a
couple of lines and close off your curly
brace
there's your function nest and let's
make sure this says event : Mouse event
now I can make the stage
right here stage dot framerate is equal
to 120 and that'll be super Bionic speed
now let's make button 1 I'm just going
to draw a rectangle primitive to stage
okay now I'm going to right-click that
rectangle converts a symbol and I'm
going to make this a button symbol and I
can name it BTN one in the library it
doesn't matter but here in the instance
name I want to give that BTN 1 make sure
that's what it's named in the code so I
don't get any errors BTN 1 perfect so
when that buttons click right now if I
run it she should go Bionic speed so
let's see if that works
yep okay so there you have it now let me
put in three more two more buttons I
really will change those around will
make BTN more normal
BTN 2 crackhead or whatever let's go
back into the code so let's say BTN 1 is
going to be go normal so let's change
that function name Hall and let's make
it go 30 frames per second that's normal
speed now button 2 is going to go 60 in
button 3 is going to go 120 20 go Bionic
make sure that says go Bionic is the
function name and this is button 3 this
is button 2 and this is going to be go
crackhead make sure this function name
says go crackhead he'll this is going to
be 60 frames per second and we want to
make sure that every time we click one
of those buttons the test text changes
to show what the new frame rate is to
the viewer as they press things so there
you go this needs to be button - there
we go
this is go crackhead speed and this is
go Bionic speed and you can see the FPS
changes in the text field here ok and
finally this is all three buttons set up
with their labels and everything so you
got normal speed crack head speed and
then Bionic speed and you can go back
down to other speeds so that's how you
can dynamically at runtime change the
frames
and one speed of your animations and
allow the viewer to change it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
