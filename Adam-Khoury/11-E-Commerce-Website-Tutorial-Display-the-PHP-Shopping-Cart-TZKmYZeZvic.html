I am so stoked to be here with you once
again in our eleventh part of our
e-commerce website building tutorial
series and before we get started here I
just wanted to mention to some of you
guys if you really want to pull up my
heartstrings and get to the inner Adam
to effect the inner Adam you can leave
me comments like this one oh my god this
comment is so great it embodies and
encapsulates it really makes all my work
worth it
all of these three hundred and some-odd
videos are all worth it when I get a
comment like this I mean all these other
comments are awesome and great don't get
me wrong I enjoy all the feedback but
when somebody says something like this
it just it puts the icing on my cake and
it completes my day I can go to bed a
happy man and I don't care if that's a
man or a woman either way it's not about
the actual physical act but the
statement in itself speaks volumes to me
okay when we last left off in part 10 we
made good progress in programming the
base functionality for the cart and we
even had it roughly displaying some
items but essentially what you want to
do is take each item ID and query the
database when you have access to that
items ID and we're going to put more
familiar cart rendering to where we'll
have a table here with columns and rows
each row in the table will be a cart
item and we'll have the items name its
little thumbnail picture and all that
good juicy stuff that you want for all
your cart items so that's what we're
going to focus on in this lesson is
rendering the cart display the way we'd
like to have it for our custom needs
okay here we are inside of cork dot PHP
in Dreamweaver and I'm going to go to
code view and you can see we have PHP
blocks up top remember we put in section
tool in section 3 as we completed the
last video so up here let's make sure we
have a little heading or title for this
one it says section 1 actually they just
call them all section because we might
change the number on those
this one is if the user attempts to add
something to the cart from the product
page all right so I'm going to collapse
that one that was the first one we built
the first PHP block yeah let's just
leave this section 1 section 2 and
section 3 if I need to change up those
numbers because I may add another PHP
block in there more programming and it
might be above one of these other
sections so I would have to change my
numbers around but for now I'm going to
leave a section one two and three just
like that I'm going to go and open this
code here that is section three render
the card for the user to view on the
page and right here is where we want to
have a MySQL query that's going to
gather out the product title and various
details for each product as it comes to
this loop ok so just so everybody
understands I want to make sure that
everybody realizes that we have a
session card array that's going to be
holding each items unique ID in the
database and the quantity how many of
that item that people have in their cart
so your session your cart array is
holding just IDs which means that we
have to query the database in order to
get the product name and other little
details about the product that we want
but in your cart array if you want to
keep it smart and streamline something
that processes a little more quickly you
all you have to have is the Product ID
within your card array all right so
let's open a file that has the connect
to MySQL code in it right there
connect to MySQL database I'm going to
copy that from index dot PHP I'm going
to place it inside of cart dot PHP
really wherever I want I'm going to put
it right under the script error
reporting up top so right there in that
same block connect to the MySQL database
let's collapse that block back up so now
we're connected to the database for any
need we may have to connect to the
database in any part of this script
so if you connect up top you'll be sure
that the connection is open for any
where you want to use it in this file
now within this for each loop it
accesses each item that's in the cart
array the multi-dimensional array so for
each associative array which is each
card item inside of your cart array it's
going to have in each item variable
created for each item in your cart so
really if you wanted to output this you
could change this code you can remove
this while loop altogether and right
here where it says cart output I'm going
to show you how to access the indexes of
the array so the cart output we're going
to have this one let's remove that value
take this each item variable let's pop
it right there each item you put your
bracket single quote single quote close
the bracket off and in between there you
want to have item ID let's put a dot
there to put a little string on the end
of it with a break tag so let's put a
little note to ourselves here in the
front put a set of double quotes period
so it will append to that string here
we're going to type in item ID colon
space the item ID is going to be right
there in that line now if you want to
access the quantity all you have to do
is type in for this one quantity right
there and that will access the quantity
key value the value of the quantity key
this is accessing the VAT the value of
the item ID key so let's change this to
say quantity now if you run this you
should have a similar display where it's
showing each items ID and the quantity
just like it's doing currently but we're
doing it in a using a little different
programming to render out the same kind
of thing now we're going to change this
up to make a query to the MySQL database
in a second to where you can access the
product name and all the different
details for the product price all that
good stuff
you see I FTP that new programming up
and it pretty much shows me the same
output that it did before
but it shows you in the code as the
programmer that you can grab each items
ID independently and the quantity for
each item within your multi-dimensional
array so within this for each loop each
item that's in your multi-dimensional
array you can access the item ID and the
quantity right here using this variable
you see that quantity item ID now we're
going to take this item ID variable
within this for each loop and we're
going to access the products name its
price and all the other details we need
for it to render our car and also to use
those variables when it comes time to
send all of the shopping cards variables
to the payment gateway to process the
whole transaction okay so knowing that
we can access each items ID through this
loop right above the cart output where
the cart output is getting set to that
variable right under the I plus plus I'm
going to put a new variable in called
item ID and it's going to be equal to
each item item ID okay so you'll have
the item ID for each item in your card
array come through this loop and when it
does it's going to be packed into a
local PHP variable called item
underscore ID so now we can use that to
access the MySQL database for that item
so you type in SQL equals mysql query
select all from products where ID equals
this item ID limit 1 and you put limit 1
because you only want one result now
here you can just have a while loop or
allow you to access each variable the
price the product name and things like
that so inside the while loop
parentheses you put this row equals
MySQL fetch array and in parentheses you
put that SQL query and now you can go
about getting the items for now I'm
going to go ahead and grab just a
product name and the product price
because those are
things that we don't have available to
us just yet and we want to definitely
have access to those things so in the
cart output here just to make sure that
we're getting the things we want out of
the database
let's put item name let's put product
name right there where that variable is
and then the next line we want item
price and we're doing this just to make
sure everything's working this is not
going to be the final display all right
so we're successful in getting out the
item name and the item price you can see
there's the black hat black jeans and
black shirt if I go home and I put in
say this purple shirt there it is purple
shirt ID seven quantity one price is
$4.99 everything in my store happens to
be $4.99 but yours would probably have
different prices for everything I might
change my prices up just for some
contrast okay so do you see what we're
doing here we're just methodically going
through and querying out the information
just the information that we need to get
for each product and we have full
freedom now to design this let's remove
this while loop we have full freedom to
design the cart at this point any way we
want so I think I'm going to go into the
design view and make some kind of static
table that's that looks the way I want
I'll do it here in design view and then
I'll make it dynamic so we'll pick up in
a part 12 where I'll show you how to
actually design the way the cart is
going to look and this one we will just
simply making sure you guys knew how to
access all of the variables that you
need for each item</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
