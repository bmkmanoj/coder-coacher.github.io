one of the actions layer oops okay stop
action alright now we have our actions
layer all set the labels layer we're
going to start on keyframe 2 here and
press f6 and we're gonna put the word
over down in the frame label there and
then also on 11 we're gonna press f6 and
we're gonna put out on this frame label
down here type out and then extend it
out by pressing f5 and you'll see that
it says over and out
and it looks like they're a little
uneven so I'm gonna drag over or out
back one and then the stop action back
one and so the text layer you can just
extend all the way out because I'm not
gonna animate that you can animate it if
you want make it a movie clip and made
it along with this movie clip base we
made here so we're gonna hit after we
get our text extended all the way
through the animation we're gonna hit
keyframe or frame two of the but the
base layer and press f6 and then we're
gonna hit the the one that corresponds
to the stop action and press f6 and
we're going to right click the center
and press create motion tween in that
list now we have a motion tween there so
now we're going to go to that frame it
looks like frame nine there and
highlight this the movie clip we made
out of that base and we're gonna go to
tint
and tinted any color we want really Lucy
let's give it a deep tint - yeah that
one right there it looks good right
about there make it purple any colors
you want really and you can make it
animate to do anything you want really
and let's go ahead and press f6 on the
next keyframe that corresponds to the
out and then press f6 on the last
keyframe and on the last one
you can highlight that and hit the
symbol and take the tint away by
pressing none here and press the center
again and press ctrl-a create motion
tween now we have a motion tween going
in and out on both so when the mouse
goes over this is its Upstate and the
mouse goes over it it does that the
mouse goes away from it it animates back
out to its normal state and it doesn't
stop here it loops back to frame 1 and
then it stops okay it looks like we have
one more frame there that's fine make
sure that it's moving in so there even
get rid of all these see highlight all
these mm-hmm remove frames
okay now between distances are even same
amount of frames and that's right that's
pretty much it that's all you want to do
inside of the button symbol and go back
out in the scene one by clicking scene 1
here and now we can put some code to
make all that this button one instance
get all of those animations working the
timeline animations inside of it so
we'll hit the actions layer press
control not control but f9 you open your
actions panel now we're going to start
the
the ActionScript that will get the the
buttons working first I'm going to make
one button and I'll make another button
and show you how you can duplicate it so
I hit the f9 go into the actions panel
and we're going to type in the function
for the first button function space BTN
1 is the instance name we give it and
this is the event the colon Mouse event
the event is a mouse event and we also
want to put a void in here curly bring
and when close up the curly bracket
there or curly brace what do we call
that stupid thing and then BT and 1.2
and play over that over instance we made
or the over frame label we made inside
the movie clip that's what it's going to
play here all right
that's closed up okay so now we have
functioning button one event mouse event
button one go to and play over that's
exactly what we wanted so let's press
control C highlighted all press control
C and under it let's paste ctrl V and
button one Mouse event rename this out
and actually we have to give these a
different one here so this is but over
so now this says BTN one over is the
function name and this function name is
BTN one out and then let's put our
listeners in for both of those right now
so let's say BTN one got add event
listener
and this is the Mouse event we're
listening for mouse event dot rollover
it's all have to be capital roll over
and we'll put it a comma and the button
function name now
BTN one over and close that up and we'll
highlight all that ctrl C press Enter
control V under it and change this to
say roll out instead of over roll out
and change this to say out as well
now it's listening for the button one
out function and the button one over
function that we just created up top
here and I think that should do it and
to make more buttons let's make another
button this press control C you can make
as many of these as you want by putting
all these in and let's make this a to
keep everything else the same just
change all the BTN 1 - BTN - every where
it says BTN one and then change it to
BTN - and now you have your your second
button functions all set up and ready to
go and to put make it navigate to a URL
or Mouse down or something you just add
another function
BTN one down and you added listener BTN
one down here and it would say Mouse
event Mouse down or click whichever one
you want okay so the buttons are set up
to do their animations so now we need a
second button so we're gonna highlight
this button and actually we're gonna go
into the library first and highlight
where it says button right click it
duplicate it and it'll say BTN copy and
movie clip and you say ok
then press ctrl highlight this one press
ctrl c ctrl shift V move it down and
swap it now we're going to swap it for
the duplication we just made in the
library and now this is instance of BTN
copy an instance name BTN one change to
BTN
- now we have BTN one instance of BTN on
the top one BTN copy
BTN two is the instance name so now when
we'll go into this one and change that
or it says BTN one - BTN - and like I
said you make ten of those if you want
pretty easily
alright now we're back on seeing one
let's publish out see if this works
yeah as you can see they're nice
animated buttons they have a rollover
effect actually let's go back into the
file and change the frame rate to a nice
healthy 24 and then publish out much
better
nice animated buttons now this Fla is
gonna be available where this video is
playing so you won't have any questions
about how it works so you can't get your
code wrong cuz I saw right there and
like I said to add functions to make it
go to different movie clips in your in
your file or to go to a URL you just add
the button to down and then button
function that would be ready and set up
for the down event make it go to a URL
that's pretty much it that's how you
make animated buttons like I said you
can make a whole bunch down through
there they can look like whatever you
want them to look like they can resize
instead of changing color you can
animate them to bulge and get bigger
smaller whatever you want to do so
that's the end of that one that was
pretty simple and we'll see you next
