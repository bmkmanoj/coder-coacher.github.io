Swift 3d version six tutorial then this
one we're learning how to use the lathe
editor and here's the finished product
of what we've created it's a martini
glass with olive and toothpick export
that out and that's what it looks like
okay so for all three of these items
that we're going to create in our scene
here we're going to use the lathe editor
for because that's what we're going to
be focusing on so let's go right into
the lathe editor and the first thing I'm
going to do is click on tangent point
instead of the square point or the
corner point I'm going to create the
toothpick so I'm going to make a point
there right in the center and then maybe
a point right I don't know maybe it all
right there and if you get your points
off don't even worry about it because
you can manipulate them with the mouse
you just highlight that point or not
with the mouse but with your keyboard
arrow keys or with the mouse and you
just drag it out like that
but if you want precision you can use
your keyboard arrow keys so now I'm
going to take this and stretch it out of
it to where it has a slight bump or a
slight hump rather not much of one
because we don't want it to be too fat
what I'm gonna do is make it skinnier
once I get into the scene editor here so
let's click scene editor let's go ahead
and go to scale let's go ahead and put
the radial segments up to 64 that way
it'll give you a nicer looking mesh now
you go to the scale properties with this
item selected in the scene now we can
adjust the y and z factor or rather the
X and the Z factor to make it skinny
make it as skinny as you want now I'm
going to go into the material I'm going
to go to bitmap I'm gonna grab this wood
right here and I'm going to place it on
it I'm going to go into the materials
properties
double click down here where it says you
are wood and I'm going to bring the
brightness up generate preview gives it
a nice tan nice tan wood so you press ok
and there's the toothpick all ready to
go now next thing we'll do is the olive
so without this selected if you select
that again you go to the lathe editor
you'll be able to further edit that but
we don't want that we want to deselect
it and then go to lay that etre now this
time we're going to choose a curve point
and you can just grab a spear if you
want but olives aren't exactly perfectly
round so I'm just going to use this put
a point here point here point there now
I'm going to go and manipulate those
points just like you would a pen tool in
your Adobe programs or whatever to make
it a little more rounded here so you
manipulate these let's get this one
manipulate it there that looks good to
me let's go on to scene editor great
let's get that radial segments up to 64
as well you go into the glossy or flat
I'm gonna go with glossy I'm gonna try
to get an olive color
that looks good to me now I'm going to
go to the scale tool not the scale tool
but the scale mode with that item
selected and now I can just drag it to
be just the size I want it to be right
on the end of that toothpick so with
everything deselected in the scene we're
going to go back into the lathe editor
and now we'll use the corner point so
I've used the tangent the curve and the
corner point one for each of the objects
just to show you how it all works I'm
going to start at the bottom we're going
to make the base of the martini glass
here right about here one nice thin stem
right about there I'm gonna make a point
right about here right there and then
right on the green line I'm gonna
manipulate this point just a little bit
bring it closer to that so the brim is
not so wide bring this down just a bit
and that looks pretty good to me
let's bring this in just a little bit
now let's go to scene editor let's scale
that one a little bit right about like
that
you can hold alt and right mouse to drag
the scene you can left mouse to drag it
around right Mouse to go in and out so
now for this I'm going to bring those
segments up to 64 as well and
transparent clear
now I'm gonna take all of those items
actually let me grab these two so let's
move that down I'm just using my mouse
keys or my keyboard keys with them
selected to move it I'm gonna highlight
this one
well the toothpick and the olive
together by holding shift and I'll grab
both a range group now I can rotate
those I'm gonna rotate it about like
that then I can just grab it in the
scene put it wherever I want it there
grab this bring it up right there now
I'm going to press ctrl a to highlight
everything in the scene arrange group
now let's rotate that a bit and there
you go there it is so that's how you use
the lathe editor to create most any kind
of thing is you might need that would be
a simulated machine lathe type object
okay so we'll see you in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
