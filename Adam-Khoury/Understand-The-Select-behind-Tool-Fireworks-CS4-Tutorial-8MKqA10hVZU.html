discussing your pointer tool and your
select behind tool because not many
people know what to select behind tool
is or does the pointer tool it's very
obvious with that does just selects
things highlights them and move things
around so what I'm going to do is just
draw out an ellipse shape actually I'm
going to draw out three ellipse shapes
all three and graduated sizes they're
getting smaller I'm going to make this
one green make this one orange I'm going
to demonstrate the Select behind tool so
first let's go ahead and place this
green circle to the back so what you can
do is you can go up here to use these
little tools they have handy for you
here bring the front bring forward send
backward and send to back so I'm going
to send to back then with this one I
want it on top of the green one but
behind the blue one first let's set its
opacity to about 72 same for the big
blue one okay now let's send this one
backward so send backward so now it's
behind the blue one and and on top of
the green one so the green ones very
last down in there in the depths so if i
wanted to select that green one i have
to go into the layers here and grab it
and that layer maybe lock the two layers
above it and that would be a big pain in
the butt if I just wanted to select it
may be manipulated it a little bit so
what you can do is you go up to your
select behind tool and it will allow you
to keep selecting as you click you see
what it's doing it's going and selecting
all three of those spheres in succession
and you might need that it might come in
handy when you're working with complex
designs
shapes and things stacked on top of each
other with lots of layers that you can't
seem to get to the one on the bottom
this is a very easy way to do it okay
you will see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
