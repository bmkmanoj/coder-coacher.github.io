to Facebook to supply a link to my
latest fireworks tutorial to all my
friends there and my friends Lani Raj
asks something that I can easily help
with but what he asks his hey bro do you
have any idea how to put text along with
a div border I managed to make one but I
have a problem in the background color
please check similar to this and he put
a webpage that had something similar to
this so what it is is a content
container it's really a fieldset with a
legend tag and I'm going to show you how
to do that right now and then you can
put your content inside and you can
style your content independently of that
tag and you can also style the actual
tags themselves the fieldset and the
legend tag then many times you'll see
this used in forms to section off
different sections of a form but you can
use it really for any content where you
can have a content container with a nice
border and there'll be a title or a
heading stuck right into the border of
that content container okay the first
thing we'll do is we'll start with a
very basic HTML page just the head tag
the HTML tag in the body tag there and
what I'm going to do is open a tag and
I'm going to call it field set I'm going
to go down one line I'm going to close
that fieldset tag I'm going to press
ctrl s to save it and I'm going to look
in design view you can see it gives me
something of a border there now I'm
going to go inside and I'm going to type
in some content I'll just say here is
some content and then I'm going to put a
paragraph tag just to separate off a new
paragraph inside of that field set say
here is another paragraph and you can
put any kind of content that you want
inside of there so let's close off that
paragraph tag now let's look at what we
have in design view so you can see we
have something of a box there with a
border around it that has the content
that we just placed inside now let's go
and give it the legend tag inside of the
field set the first thing is legend
then you can just close it off right
there and then put in the title that you
want so you title your box here now
let's take a look at what we have in
design view you see now if we go back
into code view
let's press f12 to render this in a
browser and you can see what we have
there it has the title of the box here
and the field set is what's creating the
border then you have your content inside
and the legend tag is what embeds a
title right into the fieldset tag now
you can also take this and CSS style it
so let's say we're in a white background
on this let's go to page properties and
Dreamweaver here and let's set the
background color for this page to black
and apply that now you'll notice that if
you render out now and you look at it in
a browser you can't see any of your text
but your border turns white so let's
make the text also white so the text
color by default will be this gray color
we'll apply that okay
now let's take a look at it f12 and we
can see everything now now let's say we
want to change the color of this border
the box border or maybe you want to
change the color of the font inside or
maybe you want to give the box a
background maybe you can do all of that
through CSS right here in the fieldset
tag you can go to five field set space
type in st just put it in the style
attribute with the value of border and
we'll set up a border color of let's say
we wanted it to be red just for example
sake it's going to be really tacky color
but just for example sake make it one
pixel solid and now let's take a look at
it by pressing f12 in the browser we see
that we have a red border around all the
content now now let's see if I can go
and give this legend tag some style here
too and just color it give it a color of
I don't know that yellow see what
happens press f12 you can see now I have
yellow title and a red border
you can even give this background the
fieldset you can give it a background
here and then when you're done styling
everything you can put it up in the CSS
and refer to that if you want or you can
do it just like this so when you're
looking at it in design view and
Dreamweaver it's going to look like that
way you won't see any padding really but
if you go and press f12 and you look at
it in any browser there'll be some
padding there and you can style these
things up any way you like
so if I gave this a background color
this gray now I press f12 say yes you
see now it has a background color okay
so that's how you do it we'll see you in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
