demonstrating how to create amazing
looking back to style Christmas
ornaments that you can hang anywhere
these graphics that you see on your
screen right now are the exact finished
product of what you'll be learning how
to create this is the exact ornament
that I finished up with so I hope you
enjoy and I hope you guys have a very
merry holiday and I might do some more
Christmasy type themed tutorials before
Christmas comes who knows
maybe all right let's create a new
fireworks document I'm gonna make mine
about maybe 800 wide and 500 high you
can make us any excise from resolution
you need you can work at any size and
resolution you want and I'm going to set
my canvas to a very dark red so I'll
click this red here and I'll just bring
down this slider right about there and
the first thing we're going to do is
drag out if you have the rectangle
selected a just hold that down and
you'll see you can drag out a donut
we're going to create the little loop
that the ornament with dangle from where
it would hang from so we can just hold
shift and draw out a perfectly round
donut and then we can bring that in a
little bit actually let's go ahead and
resize this make mine as small as it
needs to be right there imma zoom in on
it and I can grab this little inner
radius dialer right there and move it
out to get the exact size I need and to
control your birth control and mouse
wheel to zoom in and out of your scene
okay or in your canvas so there's your
little loop and you can go ahead and add
a bevel effect or a bevel filter to that
inner bevel and that gives it a more
realistic 3d look with shines coming
from this direction and shadows on the
other side
now we'll go ahead and click the
rectangle tool and draw out a rectangle
now this little guy here is going to be
let's give that a gradient fill a satin
that'll give me the look I want I'll
click down on the satin here and where
it's white I'm going to change that to a
very dark gold color or yellow right
about there
that might even be a little too much
right there's good
and now I'm going to zoom in on that
object by holding ctrl Mouse wheeling
and I can manipulate that I just want
one of those little arcs in there like
that I'm gonna highlight it select
filters here and I'm gonna give it a see
inner shadow and I want the inner shadow
to be white and I want it to come from
the top I'm gonna make sure it's 270
here coming from the direct top bring
this down to about to put the softness
on it and bring this down to two as well
now I'm going to drag out any lips I'm
gonna hold shift down to make sure it
stays even and that 300 by 300 looks
good to me right there I'm going to make
sure it's centered bring it up a little
bit to right about there and I'm going
to go and change the fill a gradient to
a radial I'm gonna change the colors on
that to the bright red here and then a
very dark red here oh I'm sorry
switch those dark red on the other side
there we go now let's take this in the
center and move that I'm gonna make the
dark red a little bit lighter because we
want it to be a little bit lighter than
the background that looks good to me and
you can position this any way you need
to now we're going to give that an inner
glow just for a little lighting effect
on the other side inner glow of the
bright red
and we're gonna soften it up a little
bit more bring this into about six and
then bring the opacity way down maybe
even less
right there looks good to me even a
little less for a very very subtle
effect and if you want to put really
glossy shines on there you can just draw
in some white shapes that would be a
glossy type effect on there but I don't
want mine too glossy I want mine to be
kind of like a matte finish and then I'm
gonna put like gold Fleck type designs
on it Christmasy designs now here is
where you can get really creative and
what I'm gonna do is drag out the text
tool and I'm just going to type in qwe
rty you ope the whole top line and you
can see that I'm using a dingbat fine
let me go ahead and shrink that down so
you can see all of them it's a dingbat
font and I want to get to the uppercase
and this is really handy to use dingbat
fonts you have to you need a quick
little dingbat to supplement for
something you don't wanna really draw it
out from scratch this is a good thing to
do so you can use fonts and I'm going to
show you how to change the font to
actual paths and graphics that you can
work with okay so let's press caps lock
and I'm using car Xmas dingbats if you
want to get the same font that I'm using
car Xmas dingbats
now I'm gonna type in QW er t UI
I'm looking for that horse that's what I
wanted it's the y caps-lock y for that
little horse right there I'm gonna bring
the size of the horse up and I'm gonna
make sure
it's yellow or gold to match that gold
up top really you can make it any colors
you want for any color scheme that
you're going for now 96 isn't big enough
so I'm gonna go about 240 see what that
does
that's really good I like that maybe not
so big maybe 220 there we go so let's
change that text character now to a path
graphic that we can work with that'll be
a native graphics and fireworks that we
can do anything we want with so I'm
gonna go to text with it selected I'm
gonna go to text convert to paths and
then you'll see it gives me a group of
the paths I'm just gonna press ctrl
shift G to ungroup it and there's my
native path and you can see if you
wanted to you can go in here and grab
each point and move it around like like
so see now I have an antelope you know
I'm just showing you that you can really
work with it now and make it your own if
you wanted to use dingbats fonts for
specialized graphics and illustrations
okay so now what I'm going to do is make
that a little bit less wide because it's
going to appear like it's plastered onto
a round surface so I don't want it to be
a normal view I just want it to be a
little less wide than normal so let's
place it right there I'm gonna press
ctrl-c ctrl-v I'm gonna place another
right here okay now let's go ahead and
draw out a donut because we're going to
use the donut now to punch out those
paths that are the horses so I'm gonna
hold shift as I draw this donut
so it punches them out correctly get it
in the center again move the inner
radius to where it wraps right around
that inner spear there now with that
selected I'm going to change that to
maybe green or whatever I'm going to
press control C control V so now I have
two of those I just made a copy but
don't move it what you're gonna do is
select the first horse and the first
doughnut the one on top and then go to
modify combine pads and punch then
you're gonna select this horse and this
doughnut modify combine paths and punch
so that effectively wraps it around for
you and then you can grab both of those
together go down to grain or texture
rather make sure you choose grain or
whatever one you want but I'm gonna make
like a gold Fleck looking effect so I'm
gonna bring it down to about thirty
seven thirty whatever in the 30s so like
transparent and let's go ahead and mess
with this number see how we can make it
look best to you I like it right at
about thirty so that makes it look like
my my little horsies on there have it
like a gold Fleck pasted on glued on
gold Fleck kind of look to it okay let's
go to our shape and grab a star drag out
the star while holding shift to keep
everything even and I'm going to make
the points on this one only four points
I'm gonna drag in the radius and if you
have to zoom in go ahead and zoom in by
holding ctrl and Mouse wheeling I'm
gonna get it to about that look right
there and on the solid fill I'm gonna
change that to a gradient of radial and
in the center it's white and the outer
edge I'm gonna make it white and that
one I'm going to bring the opacity down
I'm gonna make sure this has no grain on
it no texture okay so you see what you
got there now highlight that press
ctrl-c ctrl-v you can select scale tool
that way you'll have access to rotate
the object
so let's rotate this 145 degrees like
that and then we can highlight that with
the pointer tool and we'll have the
radius options again bring that down a
little bit and there you go it's a nice
Christmasy shine star effect and we'll
add one last little thing to it let's
add an ellipse to the top right about
like that and this one we're going to
make a solid white position in the
center of that star the best we can
right about there it's good enough and
then we'll go to filters blur Gaussian
blur however you pronounce that I don't
know I don't care ok so then you'll be
left with something a little like that
and then what I'm gonna do is highlight
those items all together and I can drag
them around wherever I need to put that
one over there press control-c control-v
to make a copy of that and then go to
modify flatten that selection I'm gonna
leave that one there in case I want to
change it up and this one I'm going to
blur just a little bit watch go to
Gaussian blur and you don't want to have
it so blurred just a touch just to take
those hard edges off right there then
I'm gonna take that and position it
right there
I'm gonna bring down the size of it
scale it down a little bit okay now you
can just take little gold balls and make
a chain so you can highlight all of
those items let's drag this down a
little bit right about there and I'm
gonna draw out little ellipse make it
solid gold solid gold and then give it a
bevel inner bevel
smooth bring it all the way up bring
that all the way up and all the way up
and that I'll give you a nice beveled
looking little bead then you can just
put that there and make others make a
whole bunch stack them right on top of
each other like that then you can grab a
bunch as you go however many you need to
make your chain as long as you need it
to be get rid of that last one on top
and let's grab this thing
ctrl-c ctrl-v make it smaller bring it
to front scale it and there you go we'll
put this somewhere over there okay and
you can even take another little one see
you since this is gold/black and you can
make some little tiny shines on the gold
Fleck if you want alright so there you
have it
beautiful vector Christmas ornaments
that you can customize</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
