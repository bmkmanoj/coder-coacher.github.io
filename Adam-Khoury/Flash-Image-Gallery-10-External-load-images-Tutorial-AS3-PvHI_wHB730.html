I demonstrate how to create a dynamic
image gallery and I only made it have
five images and it has an area for the
big picture to show up and area for the
thumbnails to be laid in and you can
make as many as you want you can have 20
thumbnails place them all the way around
this thing if you want if you wanted to
do that that would be pretty cool if you
had thumbnails going all the way around
it in a square or something like that so
you could have a whole bunch of images
in there or if you're really creative
you can put this into a scroller itself
or a sliding menu to where you can have
maybe 20 of these little thumbnails in
there and the way I made it is every
time you roll over a dynamic thumbnail
button you can click them but every time
you roll over there's a little white
movie clip behind it that expands so it
makes a nice cool effect when they go
really fast with their mouse over it or
even if they go slow and let them know
which one there they have their mouse
over and when they click it it loads it
into the frame movie clip there and this
area here this is a frame it's cold I
think in the files called frame
underscore MC it's a movie clip that
loads in the dynamic images the large
version and the the dynamic images for
the thumbnails also load in from a
separate folder and this is what the
fold system looks like we have five
images in there that of the larger pics
and they are 400 x 300 all of them
uniform in size and then the thumbs is
the same pictures but they're smaller
they're 60 pixels by 45 pixels and so it
loads the thumbs in dynamically and the
large pics when thumb gets clicked it
loads them in dynamically and I also
made it have captions this captions
above it
so this blue flower feel the flowers
very shiny and new york city building
and then there's a title up top so let's
take a look inside of the see if there's
anything i need to explain told you all
about that and for adding more within
the code you'll see how you can add more
pretty easily but let's look at seen one
on the main timeline you'll see there's
a layer here called whole gallery and if
you click on what's on that layer it's
one movie clip there and it's the whole
gallery it's the every element on stage
is inside that movie clip so we double
click that movie clip and go inside of
it and you'll see we have everything
structured out on layers we have the
frame background and which is just the
background cosmetics this is the load
words movie clip and that's a movie clip
that has let's see if i can click it
here well once you once you download the
Fla file you'll see that from develop
PHP com once you download the Fla file
you'll see what these movie clips are
when you click on them they have to lock
this layer and then you can click on
that you double click on it and inside
you'll see it has a little animation
with the dots going back and forth and
it's like a little fake loader for
having giving your users an indication
that there's a big image loading into
this area okay so what else do we have
here to show you okay each thumb loader
is sitting on top of the white movie
clip here and you can make 10 I made
five just for example sake but you can
make this Fla bigger the stage size of
your swf make it bigger and you can have
10 20 24 or 48 50 however many you want
put it in put the thumbnail menu inside
of the scrolling menu if you understand
ActionScript pretty well you can do that
but let's take a look at the code
you'll be able to see when you look at
the Fla file once you download it that
how all the layers are set up and what
is on each layer you'll be able to see
pretty easily so let's look at the
ActionScript 3 layer here on top now the
first thing we do is I have code
comments set above each section above
what they're doing here and the first
one is pretty much setting up what the
captions are for each of the five picks
and then we actually i'm not even going
to read what's on top of each section
there because once you read what's on
top of each section inside the Fla file
it will explain what those lines are
doing under that comment and if you have
any questions you can just join up at
the forum and ask your question and I'll
let you know what the answer is or
somebody else might get to it first and
let you know what the answer is but
you'll notice in some of my functions
here like the thumb over functions the
thumb out functions that I have the the
line of code condensed usually you'd see
the function something about like that
but I didn't want to have too much
vertical space here I wanted to content
it also there like that and you'll see
what I did there and you can spread them
out if you need to but there's really no
need to and yep you can add more just by
sometimes the dynamic image gallery is
made through XML and a simple loop that
way you wouldn't have all this code in
here but since this is the simple
demonstration first more of a not so
dynamic while all of the images of
dynamic the thumbnails coming in a
dynamic and the large pics but it's not
in a loop based image gallery that way
you have full control over the stage
elements where they are these can be
moved anywhere you like and they'll be
fed dynamically through this code
they'll get little thumbnails put in
here and this will get large pics put in
here
and I think that's about everything yeah
like I said the code comments above the
code will show exactly what the code
underneath it's going to do and if you
take the time to read all the comments
above the code and say you want to have
eight pictures in yours you're going to
have to go ahead and read what each one
of these do add a line for six seven and
eight all through there and I lump them
all together so it would seem a little
more organized hopefully the way I set
it up it would it will feel and see more
organized to you but like i said if
you're going to do a whole lot of images
or the dynamic CMS system then you'll
want to run an xml file to an xml loop
to to render these out or render them
out through an array through a loop but
this is a good way to do it and have
direct control over where they are on
stage and still bring them in
dynamically everything loads good and
smoking fast so we'll leave you with it
you can download the fla right under
where the videos where you get develop
PHP and we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
