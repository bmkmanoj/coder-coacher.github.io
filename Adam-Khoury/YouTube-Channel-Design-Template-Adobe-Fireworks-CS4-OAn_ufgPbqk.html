going to give away a fireworks PNG
editable template for customizing
youtube backgrounds to make hot sexy
custom YouTube backgrounds for yourself
or any people that might want to hire
you to make a background or whatever you
know I mean it'll be a fireworks PNG
file editable to where you can
manipulate everything inside of it but
it'll be set up to where have nice
rounded corners like this and all that
nice stuff my niece no recently joined
YouTube and here's her channel here you
can go and check it out and what she
does is she sings so that's what she's
doing on YouTube and if you want to have
a custom layout like she's got you can
see I she's got nice rounded corners see
how I later picture back in there behind
everything you could put custom graphics
all over inside of it and i'm going to
show you the file in fireworks in just a
second here but i just wanted to show
you what could possibly be made using
this template okay i just want to
mention briefly that you have to shut up
you have to have a youtube partner
account if you want the extra space on
top here and custom coded buttons and
all that stuff you have to be a youtube
partner to get that feature let's go
check out this file that i'm going to
keep away and the link for it will be
you see how I have this link here in the
video description the link for this
template can be downloaded from the
YouTube description area there okay so
let's go and fireworks and check it out
now what I'm going to do you can see
here is her layout see how I laid
everything back in there and everything
so what I'm going to do is just remove
all this pink stuff and any of the
custom things that I put in there so
it's just a little background
okay so I've removed all of our custom
graphics and you'll see at the bottom
once you open it in fireworks all of the
stuff will be editable you can see we
have a faded rectangle with a faded
gradient on it that goes from clear to
black that way your channel can fade to
black but really fade to whatever color
you want to say your background was
white you just make this fade to white
and all of these colors let's see you
can change all of this stuff just go
open the properties see how it's pink
I'm going to change it to blue and there
you go now what you do is let's say you
wanted to have custom stuff in the
background behind everything you just
draw out or import any photographs draw
out any shapes put any text any effects
you want and you can just put it to the
back so you just press ctrl shift down
arrow key so you can see you can lay
stuff in there on in layers any way you
like and you go to your layering and
you'll see how everything is set up and
it's kind of like Photoshop and you can
actually open this in Photoshop too and
just recreate the placement and the
sizing of all these boxes if you want
this could be even bigger and wider if
you wanted it but quite a few people ask
me how I make my custom layout and
everything and yada yada yada so I
figured I would just give away a file
that was a template that you can make
for all kind of channels so there you
have it all this stuff could be moved
around made different or whatever so I'm
just going to save this zip it up for
you guys and you can go and just
download it free it'll be a develop PHP
com yes you go you take a you customize
you making
is sexy layer you have fun have a good
time okay goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
