html5 canvas tag lessons we learned how
to draw some things into the canvas tag
using javascript now before we go any
further we have to discuss fallback
content because not all browser software
will render the tag and in that case
you'll want to serve up some alternate
content because you have to keep in mind
when working with html5 that not all
browsers are ready to render everything
that it's capable of offering us but
most of the new browsers are all right
before we toy around with our code let's
discuss the logic of the fallback
content what happens is in an old
browser that does not support the html5
canvas tag usage or rendering all you do
is simply put some HTML markup whatever
you want inside of the canvas tag and
that old browser will ignore the canvas
tag and just show that markup instead
now the browser is capable of handling
the canvas tag the way it should like
most modern browsers do it will ignore
that P tag for instance or any markup
that you have inside of the canvas tag
it will be ignored and the canvas tag
will render the way it should where
you're drawing into it through
JavaScript or you're animating into it
through JavaScript okay so now you
understand how the fallback content
works in older browsers they will show
the mark-up inside of the canvas tag in
the newer browsers that do process the
canvas tag correctly they will ignore
the content that you have within the
canvas tag and process the way it's
supposed to using javascript and the
draw methods now in the code we're going
to do this is a page that is drawing a
very simple rectangle into this canvas
tag here but it's not doing any checks
to see if this user might be using an
older browser or something you know so
what I'm going to do is go into the
canvas tag go down a couple of lines and
inside of the canvas tag I'm just going
to put an image tag to an image I have
on my server called fallback image JPEG
and that will show two people with older
browsers that don't have the canvas tag
support now we go up into the JavaScript
now and right before we set up the CTX
variable here we're going to put an if
condition so let's put ourselves a
comment right there
and then let's type in the if open
closed parentheses open the curly brace
and then go under the CTX drawing method
the last drawing method there and then
indent those two where the drawing
methods are now inside of that if
condition and we can highlight that
canvas dot get context and place it
right in and what that will do is give
you the evaluation you need to see if
the user's browser can actually support
these draw methods into the canvas tag
and then and only then will the draw
methods execute and I'll run it in
Firefox there so Firefox shows this
little square that I was drawing into
the canvas tag because it's supports the
tag use but if you were using an old
browser you would see this little
fallback image and this canvas tag would
be completely ignored okay so that's the
logic fallback content it's very simple
to understand and nobody will have any
problems with people viewing their
content in older browsers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
