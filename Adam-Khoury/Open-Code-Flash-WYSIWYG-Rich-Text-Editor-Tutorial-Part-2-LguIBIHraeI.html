WYSIWYG or rich text editor and flash
actionscript 3 we left off in part 1 we
were able to get our bolding
functionality working well you see bulbs
out nice but if we try and highlight
that again and unbolt it no dice it just
doesn't work it'll bold other sections
out if they're not bolded yet but we
want to make sure it unbolts so what
we're going to have to do is program
some logic into the button function and
that's what I'll show you how to do so
here's the code we left off with to make
it bold and what we want to do first is
add a a default bold format so let's put
that right above this format so we got
format bold let's call this one format
def bold for default bold change that to
default bolt and then this to false that
way it will switch it back when we put
it in our logic here so that's the first
step now the second step is to go into
this function since text selection and
right here before we add the event
listener for this function we're going
to add a couple of variables that are
going to hold these two values the value
of input text fields selection begin
index and the input field selection end
index so let's make the first one VAR SB
I that'll be selection begin index and
this is a number variable and it's going
to be equal to this
right here let's grab that selection
begin index of the input field whatever
the user has selected and then we'll do
the same for the selection end index so
we'll SE SEI selection end index is
equal to selection and index you see
there so now we have these number
variables and we were gathering in part
one in nice little variables that we can
use here in this little conditional that
i'm going to set up and this is so that
there is no reporting error thrown so
let's say it because you would get a
reporting error in this function when
you try and do what i'm about to do here
if you don't set it up in a conditional
like this so we'll say if SB i is not
equal to SEI so what that means is if
the user take would happen to take their
cursor and click inside of the text
field the input text field the sense
text selection function would happen and
it would throw a reporting error when
SBI and SB SEI are equal when the
selection bint begin index and the
selection and index say they're both
five because the user hasn't clicked and
dragged over to highlight any text yet
so that would have thrown an error so we
had to put that in so we say right
inside of here we make a variable and
we're going to call this section just to
make it make good sense
and what this is going to be is see text
format this is going to be equal to the
input fields grab that get text format
so that way we can read how the text is
format to do things accordingly and the
bold button will have a kind of like a
toggle functionality when we get done
with it so here we put SBI and SBE as
the two arguments here that are needed
SBI sei
so it's getting the text format of you
know just the section that the user
happens to have highlighted that's all
that that's doing right there it grabs
the section and then we can read whether
things are bolded whether on the lines
are italicized it knows and it will tell
us so what we do is we just check for
that section here so let's go actually
right here you could trace I'll just put
a trace here you guys want to run it to
see what it what information it delivers
to you you can and it will deliver true
or false whether it's bold it or not so
you just run that trace on the section
to see if it's bolted right there so
since we know we can get those kind of
values now we can put some brains into
this function here so let's grab this
whole button function for the make bold
exit or control exit out of there and
then we're going to put it inside of
this conditional where SBI does not
equal SEI
ok
so now we can place an if conditional
inside of this very easily here to do
what we need we'll say if set up a nest
go down there's my if nest and let's
just get the else in there too because
it's going to be in is if and else
condition so the first part will be if
it is not bold make it bold and then if
it is we'll use our format default bulb
and make it false so that we'll unbolt
it make sure we get that correct name in
here format default bold and the
condition is going to be if selection
that bold like on that trace actually
I'm going to comment out that trace
because I don't want it to run but I'm
going to grab that if selection dot bold
is equal to false then we run the that
means if it's not bolded we run the
format bolt and if it is which the else
would come into play then we unbolt it
and I think that's all we need in that
let's see if it works
good no errors so that means it should
try let me highlight this section right
there actually let me highlight this
section between two words and bolt it
now let's see if I highlight the same
section and unbolt it look at that okay
so if I bold that whole section and I
just want these four unbolted that works
it's good I want some in the middle
unbolted say so it works beautifully now
that will give you all of the logic that
you need to really make a smart editor
rich text editor and you can now expand
upon it and I'm just going to roll fast
on this one I'm going to go and get
everything done because I want to use it
at the forums on my site so there is a
nice clean function that sense this text
selection and inside of it we see if
they have dragged and highlighted a
section if they have we make the section
bar then we can use that section bar to
make things bold or italicized or
underlined whether they are already or
not that's what that all means and I
hope you were able to grasp what I just
did there it wasn't very technical it's
just saying you know if this happens to
equal bold then we're going to make it
not bold the way you sense if it is bold
or not is you grab the section bar and
you see if it's bold attribute has a
value of false or true or not and then
you can run things whether or not it's
true or false and it might be a little
tricky but hopefully you can wrap your
brain around it that way you can
replicate and do the same kind of things
and all you would need to do is add
right here make a new listener or
italicizing or underlining and a new
function
that would be function make underline
and same thing if Modell's condition
inside of that function that would say
if it's underline then take the
underline away if it's not underlined
put it under line in same thing okay so
we'll see you in part three not sure
when that will be but it'll be soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
