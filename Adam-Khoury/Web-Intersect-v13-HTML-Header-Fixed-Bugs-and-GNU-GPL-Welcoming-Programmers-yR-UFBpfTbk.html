the other day who I was talking about
the changes I was going to make at web
intersect com well I done did them
because I'm a man on a mission okay so
we removed the proprietary software
which was the flash header web intersect
now has a tutorial which is this video
right here to teach you how to put the
HTML header in place of that flash
header now while removing the flash
header we have no more proprietary
software at work inside of the system so
what I've done is I added the GNU GPL
software license so it makes it free
open-source software that can never be
made proprietary it will always be free
and available people who want to create
social networks and learn how to create
social networks from scratch so I'm not
going to let anybody else promote their
social networking building systems that
are PHP and MySQL based that is so
similar to mine I'm not going to let
them promote from web intersect or
develop PHP com unless that tutor adds
their applications directly into the web
intersect software then I'll be more
than happy to promote their work now
I've got a little list here of seven
things that I've done to change web
intersect to make this version 1.3 and
I'm going to quickly run through that
list to tell you what the titles of all
those things are that I changed after I
list all those things off I'm going to
go into each one a little more in depth
will go into the code and i'm going to
show you exactly what was done inside of
the code which used to be version 1.2 to
make it 1.3 now and all the things you
see at play and in my next video I'm
going to show the process of downloading
version 1.3 and installing it and how
simple the installation instructions
that I have our how quickly you can have
this up and running for you and having
people joining your site
ok now let's quickly discuss how i
change this flash header into an HTML
header pretty easily without too much
pain using the same exact logic we were
using before so you remember we had an
SWF file in previous versions of web
intersect where we had flash
actionscript 3 calling out to a PHP file
which is in the scripts folder called
check user log I kept the check user
logged page and so what I'm doing in
each one of these files where I want to
make sure that people see these login
options appear I sank in a little bit of
code and I'll show you what I did let's
just go to the index file and they all
work the same exact way at the very
tippy top of the page first thing is I
include once scripts check user log so
instead of Flash loading onto the web
page and then calling out to check user
log we're just having the web page
directly using PHP call out to check
user log and run the mechanisms to see
whether or not the users logged in or
not so that's as simple as it is and
where the header comes in is let's open
the header where the header template is
the same file this is the file that the
flash swf used to reside in and all I
did you can see here I changed it out
for an HTML header that has a CSS
background on that table which is laid
out right here you see background image
style header BG that's in the style
folder so i added some things to the
style folder like that image that loads
in behind this table so that way i can
write on top of the table and put links
and everything right on top of that
image and if you're in here in the
header you can uncomment this style
sheet link and you'll see the way your
buttons are supposed to look at
everything
it will render the style from your sheet
but you just keep that uncommented when
it's running on your site but when
you're working on in Dreamweaver design
view you can uncomment that to get a
better look at it what things will
actually look like so this header calls
in login options login options are
created within guess what file check
user log so the check users of the log
is set up just like it was before all
that doesn't spit out log options now
according to whether the users logged in
or not same way we were doing it for the
flash header so that's how that works
now the header template is being fed
into every single page you can see here
same way it was before include once
header template so that load set that
HTML new hit HTML header that renders
the log options according to what the
check user log returns now the cookie
claiming which was number two on the
list which was a very important security
fix let's go to where was that login now
in the old version 1.0 1.1 1.2 in the
scripts hold that we had login and
logout I opted to put login and logout
into the main root folder now so let's
take a look at login logout does the
same exact thing it did before it's just
in a different folder so we're not even
going to look at that okay so when we
login before I'm not exactly sure what
we were using is cookies oh this is
exactly the same exactly the same as it
was before but now it's a form instead
of being in the header in the flash
header where you login it's now it's on
its homepage in its own form kind of
like Facebook
tube develop PHP do that's how we chose
to do it here for this format so here in
the code you'll see when that form is
posted the person is logging in before
we were setting cookie of I don't know
where we use I think we were using the
ID and then maybe the user email or
something like that but I wasn't I don't
think I was using the password but now
i'm using the ID and the password that
way when the check user logged script
runs for the header log options we can
use their password to log them in and
they won't have that vulnerability to
where somebody can change their cookie
file within a firefox plugin and
impersonate another member so if you use
the pass cookie there's no way that
somebody and it's even hashed in this
mode so it'll be a hashed password the
person who wants to impersonate another
member would actually have to know the
users password which so the user would
have to tell the perpetrator their
password in order for an malicious
action to occur and the way it was
before where it was vulnerable in the
prior versions of web intersect is we
were not setting a cookie of the
password and we were just using the ID
and something else and somebody could
have changed their ID their ID cookie
within a Firefox plug-in and
impersonated another member I had that
problem at develop PHP and I had to
squish it real quick but using the past
cookie is something that we can use to
rectify that because nobody knows
anybody else's password unless some
dummy tells another member their
password then they deserve whatever they
get bad happened to their account
because they stoled somebody their
password okay and number three was in
profile PHP which is the page that shows
everybody's profile to visitors for
people looking at profiles we changed we
place the check in here to make sure the
user exists right here I commented it
out real nice so this is all I added
here
and you can see in every page like I was
telling you before where I want to show
the user log options I include once very
first line that executes in the script I
include once check user log PHP and
remember here is the header let's see
where's our header header templates
being right here so it works just like
the index pages with the header now this
check is when the ID comes in before we
didn't have a check in place we weren't
counting the numbers from this MySQL
result to see if that user actually
exists with that ID so if somebody puts
the ID in the URL of ID equals 8 million
it would just show a blank page so I
fixed that to make it to where it says
the user you are trying to access does
not exist on our system press back that
way the user is sensing whether or not
that user ID actually exists to render
the page out which is a smarter way to
do things I just didn't add it to the
system before because it was just tons
of other things going into it I wasn't
thinking no that's number three number
four we added the latest release the
jQuery library that's pretty
self-explanatory like I said on all the
pages that would make sense to put it I
placed it so I added the jquery library
so people contributing to web intersect
software will have it available to them
as they contribute as they build things
that where we got five I added the sea
change the homepage random members pppp
oh that's pretty self-explanatory to
open scripts home page random members I
touched on this earlier I changed it to
where it doesn't look for just memories
with pictures it shows any members that
have joined whether they have uploaded a
custom picture or not in version 1.2 you
can go and get the same name file and
switch it out for this one and you'll
have a script that shows only pictures
only members with pictures sorry and
that's that and the last one is we fixed
the delete function for the log out so
that was here in edit settings parse
edit settings parse I fixed the I put a
last condition in here to say because if
they put in them to tried to delete
their account instead the one yeah if
they try to delete their account in the
form if they put in a password that
wasn't their password it wasn't correct
for their account the page was just
blank and I never noticed that so I put
it in a condition to say if it's not
their password if it spits out your
current password did not match what we
have on file for you try again give them
a link to try again so I added that so
it wasn't just a blank white page of
people like what the hell's going on you
know and the cookies were also remaining
on log out so not on log out on delete
so when they deleted their account I
added where did I put it here if they're
delete choice equals yes we use the code
but we use in the log out script similar
code to make sure that logged out would
need to leave their account because
before it wasn't actually logging them
out and they still saw their name was
gone up top in the right but they had
the account button and everything and it
was just weird functionality you know
they should be logged out and then sent
back to the homepage or something so
that's the way it works now everything
good I'm sorry that was so long and
drawn out but those things had to be
discussed so people who are following
the tutorial series don't get lost in
what I've done to make version 1.3 and
to turn the whole thing into a software
system that has no proprietary software
and it's all open source like I said
we're using PHP MySQL HTML CSS and
jquery JavaScript which is all open
source software what we have now is web
intersect is poised to
we'll show how to create private
messaging systems profile commenting
systems so when you go on somebody's
profile we can have commenting box here
with other members of the site can
comment to this user we can have private
messaging systems we could have a forum
I would like to build the forum and so
it show how to build the form and things
like that you know all kind of things
that popular social networks are doing
nowadays a friends system I just built a
nice friend system at the develop PHP
that requests it sends a message out to
the user who's requesting the user who's
getting a friend request and they have
to accept or not so it's a nice neat
little system all I got to do is put
pagination into it and I also want to
add pagination to the web in two sec
series for all the various places that
might need it which coming up soon the
whole site is going to need pagination
here and there okay so now we have
version 1.3 which is showing you some
security fixes making it all open source
and a few other beneficial things that I
did I went in and fixed you know I read
off the list here now we're poised to go
further with the system and rather than
people copying what I'm doing they can
help me add to what I'm doing instead of
making redundant material kind of
overlapping each other in our in our
lessons we can do a more focused thing
and have one big giant great system
instead of a whole bunch of different
little systems that would be confusing
people learning at develop PHP or web
intersect so I'm not going to allow
anybody else to promote their other
little systems from web intersect or
develop PHP for social network and
community training its web intersect all
the way nobody else is visible to me in
that regard for just that subject I'm
going to be getting into creating new
applications for it real soon like forum
private messaging profile commenting
whatever
all that stuff but first what I want to
do is show how easy the system is to
download ftp to the server change a
couple of things in a couple of scripts
i'll just go by the installation
instructions that i added to the system
you'll see here that there are notes
from adam holds just notes from me that
you'll definitely want to take in and
the installation instructions this is
important because it shows you exactly
how everything you need to change and
then upload ftp things to your server
and that's it you have a system where
people can join you can join test it out
whatever and we'll be taking things a
lot further so thank you guys sitting
through that I know that was a long one
at a bunch of blah blah blah not much
action but that stuff had to be
discussed for people who have been with
me since the beginning of this tutorial
series okey we'll see you next lesson
where we'll have a demo of me installing
the system like I was somebody a noob to
PHP who didn't know anything I'll show
you it's that easy to use and put up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
