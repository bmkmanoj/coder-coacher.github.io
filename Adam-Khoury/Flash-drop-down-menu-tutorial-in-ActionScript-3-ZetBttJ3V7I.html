ActionScript 3 lesson we'll be
demonstrating roll over drop-down menus
in flash ActionScript 3 we had a couple
of our forum members request this one so
I I figured I would take some time and
put it together and I already made all
the elements and I'll be explaining what
they are when I come back into the Fla
here but let's go ahead and publish out
and look at this thing in the browser
and you'll see that once you roll over
the home button the home sub selections
come down service and links and you can
also make these in the Fla to where it
doesn't drop down if you just wanted a
button here instead of a drop down
submenus here you can just have it be a
standard button and it wouldn't have its
drop down that's very easy to do but I
just figured I'd make all three of them
active for you and that way you can
utilize all of them you can you can make
8 however many you want through there so
I just wanted to go ahead and make 3
just to make the tutorial little shorter
so I didn't have to do too much work all
right so what happens is when they roll
over the home button it comes down and
if they go up here above the home button
with their mouse it goes away if they go
to the side it goes away if they go to
this side it goes away because the
services drop down animation comes into
play and what there is is an invisible
button real big invisible Nutt button
but a movie clip behind all three of
these and they're dropdowns so when you
go over the drop down and if you come
down here and you go off to the side it
goes away as well
so you can see how it functions really
nice and quick it's very responsive so
if you go over here and you go off to
this side it goes away if you're here in
services you go up it goes away you go
down to the sub selections off to the
side goes away and so that's exactly
what we're looking for it's all the
functionality we want
and like I said that if you're on one
button and the pulldown when the drop
down is there if you go on top of
another button with your mouse the drop
down for that one then place and this is
all rollover functions going on there so
we'll close this out look at the Fla
again you'll see I have this is a button
symbol and these are all three button
symbols actually and you can see main
buttons layer here
then there's the sub buttons layer here
and it's under a mask the mask layer
actually has three parts to it in one
part in the down one section it goes
over the sub selections for the sub menu
items for the home button there and down
to brings the mask down so if you're on
down one you won't be able to all you
can see is what's under this mask and of
course these buttons on top because
they're on top of that layer but
underneath you'll see only what's
underneath the mask and you won't see
these other five buttons here when the
down 2-plays you'll see only the three
buttons that are under the services menu
and you won't see these four buttons
here under home and these two buttons
under links the same thing when you when
you roll over links you won't see these
other seven buttons you'll only see the
three main buttons on top and the two
that are under links because the mask is
animated to show them when you roll over
the home button it animates it goes and
plays the down one function so when you
roll over the services button it goes
and plays the down to function when you
roll over the links button it plays the
down three function and on the actions
layer it's simple simple stop actions
four simple stop actions so that one's
not complicated at all the script layer
is is set up to to get the rollover
functions for the three main buttons and
here's the listeners the event listeners
for those three buttons and it says go
to and play down one button to is go to
and play down to and button three is go
to and play down three and you can see
how those animations are set up on the
timeline there and now down here this is
very important we have our invisible
clip and it's script for it on these
layers here and those just make it to
where when your mouse goes over this
invisible clip that means the the menu
item will snap back or the whole menu
will snap back to frame one basically
and you can see that happening in the
browser when when you hit when you take
your mouse off of the menu items and it
goes over the invisible button anywhere
boom it snaps back to frame 1 boom frame
1 boom
frame 1 boom frame 1 right there it's
it's uh it's in drop 3 this is dropped
to its drop 1 so if you're in drop 3 you
rollover the invisible clip boom frame 1
automatically so it just goes away
ok and what else we need to tell you I
think that might be about it static text
is for the sub buttons is under the mask
so you can't see those unless you roll
over the button the main buttons are
above the mask so they're always visible
the three main buttons like I said you
can just make the the size of your flash
file a little bit wider and put eight of
these buttons through here and you would
have down one down two down three down
four down five down six and so on and so
forth but it would all be structured in
this in this fashion
and you have to have your invisible clip
has to be on each one of those down
areas it has to be have its own function
name or also to give you a duplicate
function error but you can use one big
clip for that and it's a lot easier that
way and I think that is everything like
I said in the in the code here this is
important there's reference click code
here and if you want to make your
buttons clickable to do something to go
to a scene or to go to a URL I have that
set up to where if you uncomment this
and if you clicked this home button in
the browser it would go to a URL and so
I just set that up so you guys had
reference for making these buttons
actually active once you you get it
cosmetically set up the way you want it
and let's see make sure it's good to
everything okay back in scene 1 the main
timeline there's only one frame and this
whole menu is inside of a movie clip so
you can move it around easily and things
of that nature
that's interesting let's see what
happens yeah I think you could just move
it around anywhere you want in there and
still work all exactly the same
yeah okay so before I reach over ten
minutes here I'll leave you guys with it
and I'm gonna put the fla for download
so you can get to the Fla right at
develop PHP where this video is gonna be
playing right underneath that you can
click the download Fla link and I think
I discussed all the layers the script
you can see the function in the script
yep we discussed that and the main
buttons there yep yep we're good to go
okay
we'll see you guys next lesson and yeah
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
