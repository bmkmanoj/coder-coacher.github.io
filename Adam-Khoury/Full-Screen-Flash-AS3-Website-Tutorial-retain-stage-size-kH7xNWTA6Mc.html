I'll demonstrate how you can allow your
users to fullscreen
any websites or applications you want I
made it to where it retains the stage
elements all your buttons background any
images text and everything on the stage
the size will be retained when they hit
full screen that way it won't distort
any of your stage elements when they do
full screen and I also made it to where
the full screen toggles the same button
will toggle between full screen up and
full screen back down to normal so let's
hit the toggle full screen button right
now it's rendered in the browser here
and I just made a little dummy site
these buttons don't even work and I put
a little fake footer here and so let's
hit toggle full screen button and you
can see it full screen zit and it has
that press escape to exit full screen
nifty message that runs across the
screen for a second and then if you hit
and you might not be able to see it in
the video but if you hit the toggle full
screen button again it goes back to
normal
or you can go to full screen and then
hit escape like it tells you to there
and it goes back to normal but I just
put the I just made the button toggle
full screen that way they had a little
more clear indication of how to get back
to normal view because some people don't
realize that they can hit escape and go
back to normal view so I made a toggle
for you and let's go ahead and close
this out and look at the file here now
the file on the main scene has one key
frame and it has the full screen
ActionScript 3 code layer on top and
that's right there and then it has the
whole site movie clip underneath it and
you'll see it's one movie clip that has
everything in it and if you double click
inside of that you'll have your toggle
fullscreen button here which is on the
top layer site logo which is on that
layer page
Dada's on that layer and footer in the
fake buttons are on that layer and the
backgrounds on that layer so
everything's like kind of just
structured out like a site would be in
flash but nothing's actually working
except this toggle full-screen button
and all that's on this layer on the code
on the actions panel if you press f9 and
get your actions panel you'll see that
there is one line in there and said
event listener for the full underscore
BTN which is this button here and you
can see you down here in the properties
inspector it says full underscore BTN
and so there's an event listener and
what the event listener is doing is
telling on click on mouse click run
execute the function called full screen
up that's on the parent movie clip to
this one the parent movie clip is seeing
one here and so it'll instructs it when
that's pressed by the user to to execute
this code on the main scene and the code
is what it's doing is we're creating a
boolean variable that just switches
between between true and false when we
need it to down here in the function and
these three lines here are the ones that
will keep your stage elements for
instance if you code if you comment out
these three lines you'll see that your
stage elements they also they distort
when it fullscreen so I added these
three lines to make it to where it
retains the all of your stage elements
to where they won't distort and it'll
still fullscreen so those are very
important those three lines and there's
also the alignment is set in there and
then we have the function that runs when
the button is pressed right here and
there's one conditional inside that
checks to see if the boolean value is
full is false or true
and if it's false it'll execute the code
to full screen up and then if it's true
which it sets it to true right here so
if this happens then it sets it it
switches it to false which is sorry it
switches it to true and then this
switches it back to false that way it'll
go back to this when it needs to but in
the else statement of this conditional
we're saying go back to normal so in
this condition we go back we go to
fullscreen and then the else we go back
to normal and so that's how it toggles
in between fullscreen and normal and
that's pretty much it for the code the
code is really simple and one very
important thing and it it won't work
unless you go down here into your
properties inspector and press on the
publish settings you press the Settings
button to there and bring up the
settings and then go to HTML tab and
you'll see that you have some options
here and template you have to press
flash only allow full screen by default
it'll say flash only switch that to say
flash only allow full screen this very
important step to making full screen
capable inside of your applications ok
so then you press ok and then when you
publish out you'll then have full screen
capabilities using that little bit of
code that I showed you and that you'll
be able to see if you go and download
this Fla file then you press full screen
and voila then you toggle back and
that's pretty much it
let's see
and it's nice to use a background if you
can in CSS that way and then make the
window transparent here and your publish
settings as well you can go into your
settings and under HTML window mode
transparent and that's how you do that
but that's pretty much it we'll see you
