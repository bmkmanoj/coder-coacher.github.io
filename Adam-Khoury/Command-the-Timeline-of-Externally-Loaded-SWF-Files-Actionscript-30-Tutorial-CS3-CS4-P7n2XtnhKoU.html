flash building tutorial in this lesson
we'll be working in flash cs3 but you
can be in flash cs4 will be using
ActionScript 3 and what we'll be doing
is showing you how to control externally
loaded dynamically loaded SWF
I recently gave a tutorial about that
was all about loading external SWF files
multiple external SWFs loading and
unloading them and some people had
questions about how to control those
externally loaded SWFs from the main
file so you can control those externally
loaded SWF
from buttons or ActionScript within the
main file and I'll show you how to do
that now so let's go into open and on my
desktop here I have it's called ball
project and inside I have my main file
which would be like your main site and
there's my SWF folder where my external
list of yes that I want to load in would
be stored if I double click that you'll
see there's one called balls so let's
open the main file so here in the main
file for this example you can just think
of this as any timeline in any part of
your Flash application or your Flash
website so say your several movie clips
deep way down deep into movie clips you
can load this SWF at any point at any
timeline as long as you just put the
code in the actions panel and the
correct place in the timeline okay so
I'm just going to do it on the the main
timeline here the main theme layer 1 on
key frame 1 so let's open that well
first let's open the
the external swf so you guys can look at
it and how its structured out okay
inside the external SWF I have a movie
clip with two balls in it and they're
called my blue balls they have an
instance name of my blue balls and if
you double-click inside of it
you can see the animation that runs if
you press Enter
they just go from one side to the other
and they have a stop action set right
here press f9 open your actions panel
and I'll have these files free for
download these example files so you
press 9 you can look at that or press f9
you can look at the action script that's
on any of these keyframes okay so let's
go ahead and press f12 so we output an
SWF f12 publishes when you publish it
outputs to an fw f and an HTML usually
HTML file so in the main file so all
that we really needed to do is look at
the instance name we have here that's
important okay so let's go into my main
file and it's write out the code that we
need to import this thing in okay so
we'll highlight the first or any
keyframe that you want to code it out on
to load your SWF s-- and so basically
what we're doing is we're gonna be
commanding external time lines welcome
any commanding time lines that aren't
even in the flash file the main flash
file until they get loaded in then we
can control them they're gonna be
totally external so you go too far LDR
it's creative a variable for the loaded
object that's gonna load up our SWF and
you can also load JPEGs same way images
okay there's the loader object now let's
type in another var for the URL request
URL let's just name it URL rec and then
I think that's the standard naming for
that in the ActionScript help file I try
to use the standard ones whenever I can
and this is a new URL request let's put
an open eddie small open parenthesis
close parenthesis semicolon in between
put a double quote a couple spaces
another double quote and right here is
where we're going to refer to that SWFs
folder if you look at the structure of
our project you'll see we have the main
file and then SWF folder is where all
your external SWF s-- can be located to
organize things better
and here we publish out there's that
file so that's how we do it in the name
of that file is ballz so let's go back
into the main files coding here and
let's go SWF slash balls that SWF this
will load in or this URL request to set
up to load in this path in this file
if it was sitting in the same directory
you just don't refer to that path the
same directory as your main main file
you just do it like that but since we
have an SWF folder we refer to its
location the balls that SWFs location
within that file within that folder
sorry okay so we go to now let's just
say take the loader object and load the
URL request into it here which is very
simple open parentheses close
parentheses and inside you put the URL
request there and then semicolon and
that should nope nope we got a type LDR
node or else it won't do anything it'll
throw an error
more than likely now we'll go down a
couple lines and now we're going to
create the function that's going to be
the place where let's call this load
handler the function name will be load
handler this will be where everything is
controlled in this example anyway
so we'll nest it off the curly brace we
opened our curly brace here and inside
of these parentheses we're going to type
in event colon event okay
now inside of the function I'm going to
claim a variable for the let's just call
it my clip this is for the to control
the external SWF we're going to convert
it into a movie clip here once it's
loaded in a movie clip instance that we
can then command I'll show you how will
be clip equals let's grab event right
here event that target target content
and that will effectively load the
content of this file into this movie
clip and you'll see that happen right
now I'll test it actually right now
let's go to add child so this will put
it on stage right here we're gonna put
in my clip so you can just control C
there and control V there and now let's
run a trace so you can see what's kind
of going on and trace is for getting
getting it values and things you want to
know without having to put like status
text fields here on stage so you can
trace my clip and see what he what kind
of value it gives you but before you do
that
if we tried to run this nothing would
happen so we need an event listener so
let's just type in a comment listener
LDR for the loader and this is going to
be content loader info
and you can read all about this in the
help file in the language referencing
section and event listener and this is
going to be for the complete event so
let's open close parenthesis semicolon
and inside this parenthesis we're going
to type in event dot complete all caps
comma and then the name of our function
here just grab that control-c control-v
now let's run it
let's first let's run the trace to see
what it gives us so let's press control
enter to render out I've seen an object
is the main timeline of that loaded SWF
and you can see our main file if we
publish out now we've effectively loaded
in that external SWF no problem so let's
go look at this SWF has a frame rate of
24 let's match frame rates here now
let's publish out
so you can see that the publishers out
anytime today a row
hello dere hellofresh her Oh her ow
okay it looks like the frame rate of the
main file affects the frame rate of the
external file let's put this on five
extra slow publish out yeah big time
match up your frame rates
don't forget well you will have problems
okay so where were we
alright now to show how to control this
thing we're going to add some more
interactions within this load handler
function okay now the magic we've all
been waiting for how to control those
externally loaded blue balls from this
time line so let's first thing we're
gonna need is let's see separate this
out a little
and we'll put our code for this right in
between these here just for a visual
separator I like to do to do that so I
can easily visually identify different
sections in my code and comments help to
function this one the first one will be
for the mouse over and then we'll do one
for the mouse out so let's say my clip
over it's a good name for it open
parenthesis type in event colon Mouse
event closed parenthesis colon void open
the curly brace close the curly brace
so now that's function of mine clip over
to the same theme here this will call
out my clip out and this is gonna be
Mouse interactions and now let's take
the my clip movie clip instance name
that we created for that externally
loaded X SWF and we just say I didn't
mean a call fall on your face like that
okay so my clip here's where we control
let's see we're gonna have to I hope I
can get this right the first time so I
don't look like a doofus my blue ball
that's the name the instance name on the
movie clip inside the external SWF let's
see
so you can command the main timeline or
go I'm going to show you go even deeper
and command the movieclips inside of it
dot stop
now we'll have a very similar one for
the
to make it play again movie mouse out
and that looks good
so now we'll set a couple of listeners
here put a little note sit the cinders
these are event listeners for those
Mouse interactions we just coded and
both those mouse functions so let's grab
my clip because that's gonna be the
thing that's going to be interacting on
stage add event or the objects add event
listener
this is gonna be Mouse event dot roll
over all caps underscore over and put
the comma and our function name right
here close the parentheses and close it
all with a semicolon now pretty much the
next one's gonna be the same thing so
we'll just copy it paste it this will be
out
this would be out
okay that should be right so if I've got
this correct then what will happen is
from our main file the load in an
external SWF and from our main file we
will control that SWF timeline let's try
it out booyah
right on my mouse goes over either of
the balls it stops that movie clip
wherever it is
it's pretty cool
and it also commands it to play since
there's a play command on the mouse out
when I move my mouse away from this ball
it replays just like it's commanded to
so now I think that's pretty much it now
you can pretty much fail your way around
throughout all the rest of us from the
main SWS go as many movie clips deep as
you need to let's say inside of balls
here let's say this was a movie clip
that had its own animation and it had an
instance name of ball one you just go in
your main file my blue balls dot ball
one dot stop or dot go to and play
whatever frame label you might have in
there whatever okay so that's pretty
much it that little example very simple
example shows how and I'll have the
source files in this code available for
free at develop HP comp to get at it
that way and but this shows how you can
load in your external SWF s-- and
control their timelines and their movie
clips from this main file and I suggest
you nest your files your external files
into a movie clip so you can give it an
instance name and it just gives it more
for more intuitive control and plus plus
better organization and you can go as
deep as you need into movie clips in
this main code
okay so that's pretty much it just get
rid of that space we don't need that
everything worked correctly good to go
we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
