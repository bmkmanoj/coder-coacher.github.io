paths and JavaScript paths drawing
methods on the canvas element we're
going to start with the begin path
method so we'll type in CTX begin path
open close parenthesis semicolon and you
can put a little note to yourself on
that line that says it resets the
current default path now the next method
that we'll put into play is the CTX move
too and that takes x and y-coordinates
so let's say I start plotting this path
at 50 X and 50 Y and on this one you can
give yourself a comment that says create
a new sub path with the given point then
we're going to use the CTX dot line 2
method with x and y-coordinates as well
so if we make that go to an exposition
250 and a Y position of 50 we should get
a straight line now to see the effects
of that we're going to use the stroke
method and this method strokes the
current default path and the line 2
method creates a new line along the
current path or sub path now if we look
at this in our favorite browser we see a
straight line now we can just keep
adding line 2 methods before the stroke
method so let's go from 250 X down to
150 Y let's take a look at that and we
have another edge to our path now let's
make another line that takes it back to
the x position 50 and the y position of
150 that will give us another edge now
at this point you could use the closed
path method see TX dot close path so
this closes the current path if you look
at that you'll see you don't have to
draw the last line you can also add a
fill CTX dot fill method and that will
give you a filled shape it also has a
stroke and if you want to remove the
stroke you just put filled and then
close path so no matter what shape
custom polygons or circles or ovals
whatever you're making you can use CTX
dot fill and closed path as well
beginpath also applies for all of those
so I'll just leave my stroke in place
now the next thing we're going to look
at is a method that determines to see if
a point if a pixel location on the
canvas is within the current path C T X
dot is point in path and that returns
true or false whether or not the point
specified is within the path so you can
see our path if we specify a point here
let me go ahead and comment this out
let's look at our canvas if we specify a
point that's maybe it just has to be
greater than 50 x and y and it will be
within this area as long as we don't
make it too much greater so if I make it
75 by 75 or 75 X 75 y that would be
around somewhere like right here and
that would be a point in the path so
what I'm going to do is just alert
myself just for testing purposes to see
what this renders if I put 75 here and
75 here for the exposition we'll see if
that point 75 X and 75 Y is a point
within that path now this alert should
say true so I have an alert of true okay
so let's change those numbers to 25 25
to make the point that we're trying to
determine somewhere up here in the
canvas so just change that to 25 25 and
you'll see that now you get false
because the point is not in the path
we'll make a comment that says
determines if a specified point is in a
path now we're going to take a look at
the rect method so let's get rid of all
of this code that we put in and get back
just to our CTX object so we'll put in
CT x dot rect open closed parenthesis
and we're going to put four parameters
the exposition we want the rectangle to
start at the Y position we want it to
start at its width and its height so
I'll make its width and height 100
pixels so it'll be a little box a little
square and let's just put it at an
exposition of 50 in Y position of 50 now
we shouldn't see anything until we put a
stroke on it or a fill so we can either
stroke
or fill it so let's put CTX stroke take
a look and there's a little rectangle
any position any size so if we wanted
another one sitting right next to that
one we could put it an exposition of 150
and if we take a look at that they
should be side by side we want to move
it over a little bit 160 now it has 10
pixels in between them now I wanted to
put two rectangles there so I can show
you guys how to clip method works so
we'll have a rectangle position of zero
X and zero Y for the first rectangle
actually let's leave the first one where
it was and let's put the second one at
zero zero and see what that looks like
alright so what we're going to do now is
clip this second by using the first one
as a clipping region so all we have to
do is go in between those two and type
in CTX clip and it makes a clipping
region out of this rectangle and in
every anything that's within this
rectangle will be clipped within it so
this rectangle happens a portion of it
happens to be within the first rectangle
so the second rectangle should be
clipped within the first so you see what
happened you can't see the rest of this
rectangle all you can see is what's
clipped inside of the first rectangle so
that's how clip works and you can use
that on any kind of shapes and paths
that you're using the next path drawing
method we're going to take a look at is
the CTX dot Arc method now this one gets
one two three four five six parameters
and they start with plotting out your x
and y coordinates so let's say 150 X and
a 150 Y position let's give it a radius
of 100 pixels that way it's full
diameter will be 200 the starting angle
I'm going to leave it 0 and the ending
angle I'm going to put at six point two
eight that is pi times two and then the
anti clockwise parameter either gets
true or false so if you want it to be
counterclockwise you put true if you
want it to be clockwise you put false
and false is the default so now let's go
ahead and Stroke that
CTX stroke see what we get so we have a
circle a perfect circle that has a 100
radius giving us a 200 pixel diameter
okay so in JavaScript you can use the
math dot pi times 2 to also get six
point two eight more programmatically
within the JavaScript language but you
could just put the number six point two
eight if you want perfect circles there
if you use math dot pi which is 3.14
you'll get a semicircle you see so we
refresh the page and we got a semicircle
now what if we change the clockwise -
counterclockwise by putting true for the
anti-clockwise parameter it goes up the
other way so you get a semicircle going
the other way and you can really just
put any numbers that you want in there
now if what if I make that six point two
seven you see a little sliver went away
let's make that six point one you see a
little more of it went away
or it doesn't it makes an incomplete
circle so if I put that on five I should
get a lot less of a full circle one so
you see how that works so I'll just
leave that as math dot pi times 2 and
that gives you a perfect circle now
let's take a look at the arc 2 method
for that we're going to need some lines
or at least the start of a line the
start of a path so I'm going to use the
move to a method in the line tube method
and the stroke just to put a line that's
going across the screen so here I have
my line going across the screen move to
plotted it here to begin with and then
line two drew the line across the screen
to 300 X now right after the line -
right before the stroke I'm going to put
C TX dot arc - method and this takes one
two three four five parameters x1 and y1
s where it begins x2 and y2 is where it
ends and then you just put the radius
I'll make mine radius of 50 so it has a
full diameter of 100 and since my lines
stopping at 300 I'm going to
x1 of 350 and then a y1 of 50 and x2 of
350 and a y2 of 100 that way it goes
down a little bit and arcs so if i
refresh the page you'll see I get a nice
arc connecting that line to the next
line that I'm going to draw so let's
just use the line 2 method again under
the arc tube to draw a new line 350 X
200 Y so it goes and continues that path
now what if you wanted to have a larger
radius like 100 you'll see that when you
refresh it kind of messes your stuff up
a little bit so if I put this on
something like 380 on the 350s you see
what I get now if I put that on
I know maybe 390 would be better refresh
then I just have to fix the last put
that on 390 here refresh you see so it
could be any diameter that you need it
to be and you can connect it up to other
lines within your path pretty easily I'm
going to replace this arc 2 method with
the quadratic curve 2 method that way
you can have a look at that one and that
one gets 4 parameters control point X
control point Y and then the x and y
coordinates so I'll give that the
following values now 390 and 100 is my
subpath coordinates for its x and y
position these are control points so if
i refresh that now what if I move that
390 to 350 this point will move in this
way see if I make it greater like 420
it'll move the other way so you can see
that that is our x position because it's
moving that point along the horizontal
plane go back to 390 and if I move this
to 200 or 150 you can see that that's
the Y position because it's moving it in
the vertical plane that back up 100 now
let me move the control points around
you'll see how that works now if I
change this to 10 for the Y position for
the control point for the quadratic
curve you'll see that the curve goes up
and now if I decrease this to 200
the curve will not only go up but it
will go in this way see if I make it 400
it'll go out that way so that's how the
quadratic curve 2 works this is your
control point X your control point Y and
this is your regular subpath X&amp;amp;Y
positions just like the line 2 method
works
okay now stemming off of that we're
going to take a look at the bezier curve
2 method now what that does it gives you
two more control points so you can get
more of a wavy line or different kind of
curves you have control point one x
control point one Y control point 2 X
control point two Y and then your X and
y coordinates for the subpath so just
like the other one I'm going to make my
x and y the Y was 100 and the X was 390
now I'm just going to set some control
point values and then refresh the page
now let's make control point 1 X 280
refresh and see what that does you can't
get that with the other kind of curves
this gives you more of like a pen tool
effective if you used to working in
graphics editing software used to using
the pen tool you can get pen tool type
lines more of a curved squiggly line so
if we move the other control point X to
something similar like 250 and refresh
if we put this on 300 it starts to
tighten up more what if we change the Y
value for the first control point change
the Y value for the second control point
make it 10 and remember these with the x
and y coordinates so if I put this on
400 you'll see that this point here
simply moves over 10 pixels this way put
their back 390 and that's how the Bezier
curve to method works control point 1x
control point 1y control point 2x
control point 2y and then your regular
coordinates for the subpath
okay that completes the building and
drawing paths and all the JavaScript
methods a control path building and
drawing on the canvas element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
