create some intro vines that you see in
some flash movies in the beginning of
the flash movie you'll see vines that
grow maybe flowers to bloom out of the
vines and things like that and so what
we'll do is show you how they sometimes
use keyframe masking to accomplish that
technique so you can choose ActionScript
2 or ActionScript 3 file I'm going to
just choose ActionScript 3 and there's
not gonna be any ActionScript involved
so there's no worries there so you can
use extra script 2 or ActionScript 3
okay so the first thing we're gonna do
is create the vine graphic and
we'll just take a couple of lines and
make it really easy you can make yours
really nice and smooth looking but I'm
gonna make mine really simple looking
just for the sake of time this file size
in this video
okay so let's put that about there
we'll take the pen tool and make a curvy
one
so you click down and let go and you
click down again and then you can
maneuver how your curve wants to be with
the pen tool they're bringing around
okay so we'll have two kind of lines and
you can bend these lines now you just
grab them
so say you had a vine those thick on one
end and then we'll show you how to mask
both of these to where they'll animate
okay so now we have those we're going to
rename this layer are buying fines and
then then create a new layer above it
and name that one mask and what we're
gonna do is bring out our vines layer to
about see maybe
85 and we're gonna press on the vines
later we're gonna press f5 to extend it
out
then come back to frame 1 and on the
mask layer and we can lock the lines
layer in the mask you later now we're
going to use the brush tool which is
like a paintbrush I'm going to make sure
it's the right size
and the right shape is round yep and the
right color we use something nice and
bright so we know we're dabbing this
thing so what you're gonna do is
highlight key frame or frame two and
press f6 make a new key frame and then
dab with the paintbrush right on the end
of the vine and just do it on both
and if you had a gradient maybe through
here or it was all green through the
vine through here or this blade of grass
or whatever you want to call it he would
just dot the whole section right all the
way through like that and then you get
keyframe both frame 3 and hit f6 and
just do it again and keep repeating this
process until you start moving up hit
keyframe or create a new keyframe on
frame 4 and as you can see all the dots
keep layering layering in there as we
paint a bit so I'm gonna pause the video
right now and actually I'm gonna paint
in all my dots as I go each layer and
when I get when I resume the movie
you'll see all my thoughts painting and
I'll catch up with you ok now that I've
got all of my little dots in and all my
keyframes I have 52 it looks like we
ended up with there so let's go back to
85 and highlight all of these and we're
gonna
them so I can see it there are girls and
you right click and remove frames and
that'll get rid of those and then on the
last actually we'll just keep it looping
you could just put a new layer here and
put a stop action press f6 and put a
stop action right there to stop it from
the vines girl actually we'll go ahead
and do that let's put a stop action and
now we're gonna right-click the mask
layer here and select mask
and now you'll see as you drag your
timeline
they reveal themselves as the as the
movie runs so we'll do is we'll get a
good frame rate here like 20 and then
publish out and see how it looks
there you have it that's how they
animate those vines and the more frames
the more dots the more keyframes and
dots you use the nicer your animation
will be the smoother it'll look and the
more elegant your vines will come out
and these are really crappy looking I
know but you get the idea you can make a
really beautiful structure of curvy
vines and use that method it'll take you
a little while to get all the dots in
there but that method comes out really
nice let's refresh the page and watch it
again it looks cool so that's how they
do that
so that's one trick revealed and see
what else and also if you wanted to put
a flower right on the end of the vine to
bloom at the end of the animation you
would just put it on the the vines layer
with that and use that painting
technique to paint it at the end all
maybe throughout ten or twelve key
frames you paint out your little flower
mask your mask on top of your flower and
it'll reveal it okay so that's the end
of that lesson and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
