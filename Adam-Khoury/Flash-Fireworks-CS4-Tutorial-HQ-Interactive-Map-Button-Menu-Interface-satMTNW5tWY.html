interactive button map interface for any
geographic location that you live in the
world whether you live in the United
States Mexico Canada Europe Asia you can
use any blank map that you can find so
we'll start in fireworks and we'll just
open the map you have to find a map on
your own whatever country you want to
use and it's best to have a blank map
without labels on the countries already
and without lines all over it you just
want the outlines in the shapes and so
once you have that in fireworks we can
go to the make sure it's highlighted on
stage and go to the scale tool and scale
it down to about the size you want it in
flash and this is 646 it's a little bit
too big bring it down just a little bit
569 that's great then highlight or just
press outside somewhere off of the image
and fit canvas okay now we'll zoom back
into 100 okay now to extract each and
every one of these provinces here we
have to grab the magic wand tool so
we'll highlight the image and I'll just
do maybe four or five six countries here
or our provinces to show you how it's
done
and bring it into flash as an
interactive map okay so let's grab the
make sure it's highlighted and grab the
magic wand and let's select the first
one now let's zoom in here I'll show you
how the magic wand works it has a
tolerance so if I bring the tolerance
down to zero you can see how the outline
there
grabs more of the inside of the shape
and less of the outside lines and if you
bring the tolerance up it grabs the
outside lines a little bit tighter you
bring the tolerance up more and it
pretty much selects the whole map so
that's not what we want so let's bring
the tolerance back down now we can see
that it's going to select that one real
nice so with that selected let's go back
to 100% press ctrl-c ctrl-v and then you
can just press the text tool or
something to get out of that and then
once you grab the map you'll see that
that one piece is now separate and
that's what you want so now we'll go
over here and press fit canvas and off
to the side we have our independent
pieces that we're going to assemble in
flash for people to select and that's
going to be the the interface for them
to select the items we want them to
select and if you're maybe a you know a
large corporation or you work for a
large corporation as their website
designer and they service many many
provinces throughout the world you can
create a cool map like this to be the
landing spot for the homepage and then
people can select which province they
live in to get to the information that
is pertinent to them okay so now let's
hit the magic wand so we'll get the next
one
press ctrl-c ctrl-v
let's move that one yeah highlight the
image again the whole image magic wand
get the next one control C control V and
you can keep on going with these just
hit the next one let's see make sure we
get the tolerance set right now I guess
you have to deselect it okay so that's
three that's good for this example okay
so now we're gonna bring everything into
flash and you can bring it in
independently or actually let's put it
back where it goes and then we'll bring
it all in that make workflow a little
bit easier once we get into flash and
you'll see what I mean
okay now just get the last one and that
one goes right there
okay now let's go ahead and fit canvas
and everything is in the place it needs
to be so what we can do is actually we
don't want all of that it's gonna grab
the marquee tool I'm gonna cut a certain
region off of the map because I don't
want all that
okay now you deselect it
I'm not sure how you deselect the
marquee tool' I always go to the text
tool and then I go to the pointer tool
and that D selects everything for me so
you can see what I cut out here this is
what I cut out let's get rid of this
ctrl X highlight it press ctrl X now
let's move this to the back by pressing
control shift down key arrow down key
you see if you press control shift up
control shift down control shift up
control shift down you see what's doing
it's going in between how its layered in
the scene there okay so let's put this
where it needs to go right there
now let's fit canvas now let's take it
all press control C go into flash cs4
cs3 flash 8 flash MX even if you want it
doesn't matter because you can use flash
ActionScript 2 for this or flash
ActionScript 3 I'm just going to happen
to use ActionScript 3 because that's
what I'm used to if you use ActionScript
2 flash MX flash 8 flash cs3 it's all
the same so once we're in let's
highlight the keyframe there and press
control V because we have that all the
images already in our clipboard and it's
gonna paste it right into the stage
there well I thought I had it in my
clipboard ctrl C highlight them all oh
yeah it's it's going in okay so now our
map is in
and we double-click it will see you see
we have independent items look at their
isn't that nice so now what you can do
is just take each one of those convert
to symbol you can make it an animated
movie clip symbol or regular button
symbol I'm gonna make it a button symbol
this one you can convert to symbol again
and you can name it the province that it
is since I'm so bad with geography I
don't even know what the hell province
that is and I'm sorry if you live there
I don't even know the state next to me
in the United States I United the
Americans are stupid you guys know that
I know nothing about geography
okay so let's convert that to a button
let's convert this one to a button as
well okay so now we have three button
symbols they're on top of our map and
that's the only three that I wanted to
make active for the example and you
could have made all of these in two
buttons just take the time to do it but
now I'll show you where the magic is you
go inside of each and you give it an
overstate double-click inside of each
you give it an overstate by pressing the
over frame and hit f6 the down frame as
well hit f6 and in the overstate now
we're gonna right-click that symbol and
convert it to a symbol or right-click
this
this bitmap symbol convert to symbol and
we're gonna make it and graphic let's
just make it a movie clip even though
we're not gonna manipulate its inner
timeline will convert it to a movie clip
and we'll just name it symbol before or
whatever okay now that that's a movie
clip it can now be adjusted in the
properties to give it a tint
let's make it tint red it's good
and then just do the same to the others
over state f6 down state f6 on the
overstate right click convert to symbol
whatever make sure it's a movie clip and
then in the overstate highlight it go to
the properties tab select tint and it'll
give it the same read and do it to the
last one
same thing f6 f6 over state select it go
to properties nope nope select it
right-click it convert the symbol movie
clip okay then go to properties and set
the tint okay now if we press f12 to
publish the file to the browser
look at that we now have an interactive
map button interface and the buttons are
exactly how they should be for a map
selector interface so each button can be
an independent movie clip and it can be
layered in such a way and brought in all
together from fireworks that's how you
do it
okay see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
