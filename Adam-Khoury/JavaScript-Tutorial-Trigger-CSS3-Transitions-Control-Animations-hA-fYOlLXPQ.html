we will demonstrate how to trigger css3
transition animations using javascript
this will help designers and developers
avoid requiring bulky third-party
libraries to have smooth buttery
animations at work in their web
applications and on their web pages so
javascript is simply the trigger that
calls the CSS transition animation to
run exactly when needed and CSS is the
technology making the animated magic
happen and you can target any events of
the document that you want okay now
we'll put the concept to code and create
a few examples to show how it all works
so we'll start with the bare bones of an
html5 web document and in the head
element we're going to need a style
element to put our CSS and we're also
going to put in a script element and
this is where we'll place our JavaScript
okay in the body element let's create a
div element and it's give it an ID
that's equal to box one and we'll close
that div element and in the inner HTML
you can just put some dummy content now
up in the style element we're going to
put our CSS to effect that box one that
div with an ID of box one so we say div
ID of box one gets these specific CSS
properties applied to it and if we run
that in our favorite browser software we
can see what it looks like live in the
browser now we're going to start tying
in some JavaScript so what we'll do is
we'll create a button and this is really
just for developer purposes it's going
to show you how you can target any
events you want in the event I'm going
to go for is on click you see all these
events these are user interaction events
that you can target and there's also a
whole myriad of other events that you
can target in JavaScript for the
document okay so for the simple
demonstration we'll just target on click
so you can see our box has a default
background when the page loads in the
CSS of this light blue color so what
we're going to do is create a JavaScript
function in a second called change BG
open closed parenthesis and you can put
a semicolon there if you like so that
means now up in your JavaScript here you
have two
have a function with that name change BG
so you say function change BG and you
put your opening curly brace there go
down a couple of lines and put your
closing curly brace and you have your
nice function nest all set up and ready
to go now this function change BG I want
to feed it to custom parameters or to
custom arguments and what I want to send
in is the ID of the element that I want
to affect on the page which happens to
be box one in my case and the color of
the background I want to change that to
and this is a magenta color so actually
in the inner HTML of your button now you
can put the word magenta so the logic of
our function is we want to change
animate we want to change in an animated
sort of way the background color of that
box from its original starting value to
this magenta color so now we have to
access those two incoming arguments that
we made so we'll call the first one al
short for the element that we want to
affect and then the next argument will
be color so we'll just make it CLR for
short so we have the element and the
color now we'll use CL and CLR to
represent those values in our function
now the first thing within the function
is will target the element by using get
element by ID so we make a variable
called L M and we make it equal to
document dot get element by ID and we
send the element string into the get
element by ID parameter so now we have
an object reference for that element now
once that element is accessed in
JavaScript you can do pretty much
whatever you want with it so I'm going
to start targeting its CSS properties so
once you target that elements style
property you can then access likes for
instance any of the CSS properties you
want boarder background color blablabla
whatever the width the the left position
the top position if you want to move
things around animate them that way the
height the width if you want to make a
box slide into and out of view and an
animated sort of way you can target the
width and height of an element but if
you want to have an animation before you
change that
CSS property you can just put the
transition CSS property at work before
you change the elements color its
position or whatever so in this case the
transition settings that I want to have
are these and what this is is shorthand
CSS for assigning all of the transition
properties in one line and I suggest
doing it that way so you can set the
transition property and in my case I
want to target the background color of
that element and then the duration of
the animation that means how much time
it takes to occur which you can make
that half a second if you want right now
it's set to one second so over one
second my animation will change from a
blue background on that element to the
magenta color and it's going to be a
linear animation and here's where you
set your timing function for your
transition settings so if you want to
have ease in you can make this ease in
instead of linear or you can make it
ease out or you can make it ease in out
and it helps control the way that the
animation tweens and this last setting
is for your this is a what the hell is
the last setting this is a an offset or
a delay rather so if I was to set this
to two seconds my animation would delay
two seconds but I don't want any delay I
wanted to occur exactly when I call it
but just keep in mind that you can set a
delay for any of your animations
whenever you need now I can change the
elements style dot background color and
all of its background settings to
whatever I want and all I want to do is
change the color so I'll put CLR right
there and what that does is it applies
this hexadecimal color value to the
background property of this box one but
we have a transition set here so we're
going to see an animation if I was to
comment out this transition line in
JavaScript and then run this application
you'll see what happens my box should go
from blue to magenta instantly you see
there's no animation but watch this
put this one line into effect and watch
what we get press f12 run it in your
favorite browser now click the magenta
button so let's refresh that and try it
again you see it's a much smoother way
to transition so you can create any
animations you want using any CSS
properties you want and remember how I
just had this commented out we've all
been accessing and changing CSS
properties using javascript in this way
for years but now that transition is a
new css3 property we can actually put
that into effect in our JavaScript right
before we change an elements CSS
properties so what we can do is now take
another button and well copy that button
and make another button under it and
we're going to target box 1 again and
instead of magenta we'll turn it into a
green color so we'll change this label
to green now let's grab another button
and we'll label that one original and
we'll make it the original hexadecimal
color value of the light blue so now run
that in your favorite browser so now I
can animate this box from blue to
magenta then magenta to green from green
back to the original blue so you see how
that works so I know a lot of people
know about css3 transition property but
they have not caught on to the fact that
they can now use JavaScript to trigger
these animations at any time in their
application flow and that's the
important part
usually people designers who are putting
animations into effect they can only
target when the page loads so they'll
have their animations for instance in
the CSS which makes it static that means
you can't call it really when you want
unless you're using pseudo selectors
like hover so you can call these kind of
animations using for instance a pseudo
selector like hover but I would say
using JavaScript opens up a whole lot
more interaction where you can target so
many more different if
and user interaction to call your
animations to run for instance since we
have this in JavaScript now these two
lines could be used you can run these
two lines of code for instance when an
ajax request gets done so you can
animate any kind of element that you
want on the page right when an ajax
request is completed okay now i'm going
to do some different examples to show
you guys how powerful this can be so i'm
going to change this function to fade in
instead of change BG it'll be named fade
in and i don't need these other buttons
I just want one button actually I'm
going to start with a fade-out function
and I don't need this color parameter or
the color argument and I don't need to
pass the argument here when I call the
function to run in the on click event so
let's make sure that function says fade
out we're targeting box 1 and we'll
change the label to fade out now instead
of targeting background you target the
opacity CSS property for that box let me
say element dot style dot opacity is
equal to zero since we're fading out
press ctrl s run it in your favorite
browser software and fade out beautiful
now what if you want a fade in all you
have to do is copy that function create
a fade in function or actually you can
make one function that goes both ways
but I'm just going to for this a simple
example I'll just show you a fade in and
fade out function separately and all you
have to do in this one is change this to
a 1 because opacity settings go from 0
to 1 so for instance if you have an
opacity setting of 0.5 that means half
transparent and then all we need here is
another button called fade in that calls
the fade in function to run and we'll
change this word to fade in now run that
in your favorite browser so we fade out
and we fade in fade out and fade in now
what if I want that animation to go a
little bit faster I can just change
is 1.0 to 0.5 now it'll take half a
second in its animation duration run it
in your favorite browser fade-out it's a
lot faster now fade in fade out fade in
fade out fade in fade out fade in okay
now let's change these function names
from fade out and fade in to slide open
this one slide closed instead of
targeting the opacity in our transition
we're going to target the height of the
element so we'll change this from from
height and also this one to height and
since we're targeting the height in the
transition we have to make sure we're
changing the height in the actual event
so we'll change it there and there so
when we slide open we want it to be 200
pixels make sure we put that in double
quotes or single quotes and then when it
slides closed we wanted to go back to
zero pixels so we'll change it to
default zero pixel when the page loads
for that box one and we'll change these
function names on the buttons in the on
click event to slide close on the first
one and slide open on the next one and
we'll just put that in the label as well
make this one slide closed and actually
we'll make a default 200 when the page
loads so let's see if this works now I'm
going to slide closed slide open slide
closed slide open and actually the
timing on that and you can make that
happen even faster by putting that on
0.2 seconds and in the CSS if you don't
want the words to show for instance you
see how when we run it in the browser we
slide closed you can still see the
content in the box 1 but you don't want
to be able to see that content really so
you can hide it by setting the overflow
property to hidden so now when we run
this in our favorite browser we'll see
that when we slide closed all the
content is closed up now slide open and
it all comes back ok ok so that shows
you another example and you guys are
aware of so many different
properties in CSS that you can target
and animate I'm just going to show a few
examples but there's so many CSS
properties that are animatable ok now
I'm going to go up into the CSS and
remove the overflow property and I'm
going to set a position property for
this element I'm going to make it
absolute then I'm going to give it a top
property let's say 50 pixels or maybe a
hundred pixels so to be off of the top
of the page 100 pixels and then the left
property which I'm going to set to
negative 400 pixels and since my box is
actually exactly 400 pixels wide it will
just be off screen to the left so you
really won't be able to see it by
default when the page loads because it's
going to be hiding just off to the left
of the screen now here in my transition
for the element what I'm going to do is
change these from height to left so
let's change this one to left let's
change the name of these functions to
slide in and slide out so when it slides
in we wanted to have a 0 left property
in an animated sort of way then in this
function we want the left property to be
minus 400 again so we can just copy that
and put it right there so make sure that
says minus 400 pixels and that will be a
function that slides it back out of view
back off to the left so you have slide
in slide out make sure that your buttons
correspond with those function names so
let's make the first button this time
slide in and the second button control
the slide out and we'll change this to
slide in and this to slide out let's
change this animation back to 1 second
duration just so we see it real nice
ctrl s to save the file and run it in
your favorite browser software so let's
press slide in and slide out slide in
slide out let's change the timing on
that what we're going to do is change
the timing function actually in this
case we want an animation two E's so
we'll ease it in when it slides in and
instead of linear on the slide out let's
change that to ease out and we'll change
this back to 0.5 seconds so half a
second duration on that animation ctrl s
press f12 let's change this from 100 top
to 50 top press f12 so you can see the
slide in and slide out now have an ease
in and ease out factor to their timing
function okay so that shows you a whole
bunch of examples that will get you
rolling and get you experimenting with
all the animatable properties in CSS and
remember like I said there's a ton of
animatable properties and CSS and these
don't even have to be on click this can
be any event you want like on mouse-over
so instead of me clicking that button me
just putting my mouse over that button
will make the box slide out so let's
check that out
let's make it slide in by clicking the
first button now watch I'm not going to
click the second button I'm just going
to put my mouse over it see now if you
really want to know in-depth about
everything you can do regarding this
concept you can go to develop PHP and
check out the in the CSS library you can
click on the CSS level 3 properties and
I just put in the transition the
documentation for the transition
properties and these are all of the
transition properties you can play with
you can also familiarize yourself with
the animation properties and that deals
with setting keyframe animations but for
the most part all you'll need is
transitions to do most of the things
that you do for instance using
third-party JavaScript libraries that
are really bulky all of those kind of
animations can be done with css3
transition to nowadays so you can check
out all of the values for the say if you
want to understand the timing functions
better when I was setting the linear
ease-in and ease-out and all that stuff
if you want to understand all these
timing functions better
you can go ahead and take a look at this
now in the JavaScript library at develop
PHP you see I clicked on JavaScript
library and Dom event list JavaScript
this is what you really want to take a
look at because this will help you
target all of the window events in the
document events as well as some user
interaction events okay so all of these
things that I'm showing you right now
are tied into the concepts that we were
just talking about in this video
tutorial so to really get good at using
css3 transitions and using javascript to
trigger those transitions you really
want to understand all of the events
that you have at your disposal all the
HTML events for instance if you go into
HTML library into the HTML fundamentals
section I have HTML event attributes you
can also check all of these out so
onblur you fire off your JavaScript
function on change fire off your
JavaScript function on click on focus on
input on key down on key press look into
all this stuff man general session
alright so I hope this tutorial on
triggering css3 transition animations
using JavaScript helps a lot of us move
away from using third-party bulky
JavaScript libraries to do simple
animations that can be performed
transition animations that can be
performed using css3 and you'll notice
that a lot of developers kind of have
the feeling that that if something can
be done in CSS that it's better to just
use CSS for that functionality rather
than have a scripting language take care
of it so in past tutorials I've showed
you guys how to use loops timed loops to
animate your CSS properties but we don't
have to use timed loops anymore to do
simple animations like these we can
simply add one line in your JavaScript
that sets the transition settings for
whatever you're about to change and no
loops are needed it's really slim clean
lightweight way to do things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
