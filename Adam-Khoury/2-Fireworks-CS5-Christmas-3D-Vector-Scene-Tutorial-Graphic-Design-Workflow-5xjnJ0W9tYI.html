and welcome to part 2 of creating a 3d
vector quiz machine using fire words
let's grab an ellipse we're gonna make a
snowman we're gonna put it right here
and just make sure the fill color on it
is solid and it matches this blue right
there because it's going to be a
snow-covered object I'm going to start
right about here that's where he's gonna
be sitting maybe even up a little bit
higher I'm gonna highlight it and go
down to filters I'm going to give it an
inner shadow the inner shadow is going
to be white on the edge where I'll be
facing the moon right about there and
you can bring that in as much as you
want but the brightness affected you
that you're looking for and if you want
to darken up the other edge what you can
do is give this a gradient radial and
where it is white you can make it this
dark color and then drag that to the
back side something like that
maybe not even that dark cuz that looks
kind of fake what we'll do is make it a
little bit lighter than that dark color
and there you go okay now I'm going to
fade out that inner shadows just a
little bit more like that then I'm gonna
highlight my shape and adjust the height
just a little bit more bring it down and
I'm gonna select the object press ctrl-c
ctrl-v now the one on top
I'm gonna hold shift and resize just a
little bit maybe like that I'm gonna
drag that up put it on top I'm gonna do
the same thing control C control V I'm
going to zoom in by holding ctrl and
mouse wheel this time resize that new
copy this one's gonna do serve as the
head of the Snowman make that just a
little bit smaller there you go right
about there so now at this point what
you have is a snowman looking object and
I'm gonna bring these down just a little
bit there that looks cool now if you
wanted this guy to be leaning a little
bit all you would do is select those two
objects by holding shift while you
select them
that went over a little bit then
deselect them then move this one over a
little bit and he can be leaning that
way if he's on a hill a little bit like
mine is you might want to lean it just a
little bit who knows I don't care and
actually mine is going to be waving
towards the moon where santa's crossing
in the sleigh so mine's going to be
leaning in that direction a little bit
just it's going to be waving at Santa
now let's highlight this object and hold
control the mouse wheel in or up to zoom
in what we're gonna do now is grab the
you can just click on this background
here or whatever if you want to deselect
that object grab the pen tool now I'm
gonna draw like a little stick arm so
I'm going to start right about here then
just draw some wavy gnarled looking arm
thing then bring it up a little bit
right there I'm gonna draw like a crazy
little stick hand thing little thumb
this is a little finger another crazy
little finger going this way remember
it's a stick so you don't want it to be
perfect like a hand but something like a
hand she's going to be waving to sent a
clasp you know something like that and
then come down here with this leg it is
and you can even make this like all
bumpy like a stick even little waves in
there and then once you get back down to
viola we're gonna make like a little wet
foot shape so you click down there make
a sharp corner point and you come out to
about right here and then you curve in
like that and click down here to make a
sharp corner point click down here and
curve in a little bit there actually
we're going to move that point so once
it's all closed up like it is now you
can hit your subselection tool up here
and move any of these points you want
I'm gonna move this one up because
that's what I wanted right there and I'm
gonna mess with this a little bit to get
the curve that I want I'm gonna
highlight that shape with my
let's go back to a hundred percent that
way we don't lose perspective grab that
shape and highlight it and you can give
it any kind of fill color you want I'm
gonna give it a dark color like black
I'm going to take the edge off of it
that white edge and now what I'm going
to do is give it a little bit of a inner
glow so let's go to filters or not an
inner glow in a shadow inner shadow make
it white and we'll make it not so much
of an inner shadow maybe two and the
directions and the moon would be hitting
it would be about right there and we
want to fade that out because that's too
much so let's bring that fade down to
about two and then bring this down to
about twenty nine percent or whatever
percentage bring it down to whatever
percentage you think is best where it
looks pretty clean I think it looks good
right there now we're going to take that
and make a copy ctrl-c ctrl-v place it
somewhere over here and then just make
sure this item you can hold shift while
you're selecting these these three items
are on top so you can press control
shift up arrow key then you'll have that
hand that other hand way in the back see
that and you want to put it maybe right
about there
now hold shift while you're selecting
and select all of the items that make up
the Snowman so flaw
once all five are highlighted press
ctrl-g and that will group that now
press ctrl-c ctrl-v
so you have a copy see that and flip it
once you have it flipped we're going to
go to modify flatten selection so make a
bitmap out of it then we're going to go
to the filters and adjust the color to
where it turns black so let's make the
brightness all the way down contrast all
the way down okay and then let's do that
one more time
I just color brightness contrast
contrast all the way up this time okay
now flatten that modify flatten
selection you don't really have to
flatten it but I like to now what I'm
going to do is bring it down here to
where it meets up with his bottom a
little bit there and then we're gonna go
up to the distort tool and you can move
it up if you need to a little bit you
can't see it just distort it grab it
right here and distort it this way see
distort it to where it is it would be
the angle that that shadow would be cast
according to where that moon is let's go
a little bit more this way let's try
that so what we'll do is put that on the
bottom by highlighting the snowman and
pressing ctrl shift up arrow key move
this guy just a little bit right about
there
then you're gonna go down to well you
got two options you can go and fade him
a little bit blur Gaussian blur so once
you blur it down a little bit you press
okay let's get it into place as we can
and then I'm going to go up to commands
creative auto vector mask and I want it
to fade out this way and not this way
see he's the one on the bottom and it'll
fade on the bottom apply because this
since this slope looks like it's kind of
going downhill a little bit you don't
want that shadow to be 100% all the way
through there you want it to fade out as
that slope kind of goes down okay now to
create some aurora lights what we're
gonna do is grab our pen tool and start
right about here outside and we're just
gonna make a wavy line as we go through
that by letting go and dragging you can
make little waves as you go through you
just get to your desired length click
and then hold ship and you'll make
holding shift snaps it to angles see it
snaps to 45 90 I'm just going to snap it
to 90 go up click let go snap it to 90
go this way click let go and then snap
it right there and what I'm gonna do on
the edge where it's white up there I'm
gonna match it to this dark sky color
I'm gonna fade it out the opacity all
the way down
OOP that's the wrong edge this edge
opacity all the way down and the edge we
can still see we're gonna make that like
an Aurora color which is usually like a
an aqua color kind of like that maybe
something like that now I'm going to
highlight that press ctrl-c ctrl-v so I
have two of them press ctrl-c ctrl-v and
now I have three of them and the one
that's on the very tippy top the one
that's still selected
instead of green I'm gonna make it a
purple color and then this one on the
bottom I'm gonna make it more of an
orange color a greenish yellowish color
and then I can select all of those just
by dragging here and you can group them
at this point if you want what I'm gonna
do is offset them just a little bit move
this one over this way a little move
this one over along with that one just a
little bit not all the way right about
there
then I'm gonna highlight all three of
them ctrl G to group them then I'm gonna
go down to filters blur Gaussian blur
I'm gonna blur those out a good bit not
so much maybe right about there
then I'm gonna turn it so I can hit the
scale tool and just turn the whole thing
like that
I'm gonna put it up in the corner right
about there and then I'm gonna bring the
opacity on that group down just a little
bit so then you get something like that
and if you want to adjust those colors
you can highlight that go to the sub
selection tool and then you can click
each one see see that one on the bottom
that's a little bit greenish Orange I'm
gonna make that one a little more
blueish green like Aurora color and then
maybe the one in the center that's the
blue one I can make that one a little
more Orange
I just didn't like the way it was lay it
that looks good you can mess with your
colors or whatever and make sure it's
faded down enough to where you can see
the stars and everything behind it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
