file download i teach everybody how to
use flash bars to send multiple
variables into flash and access the
variables key value pairs coming in
parse them out and display them
separately and i'm in cs3 working here
but you can be in cs4 both will run
ActionScript 3 and both will run this
file when you download it from develop
PHP comm under our flash tabs but let's
take a look at it first in the browser
and here it is on the page develop PHP
and you'll see that I have item id value
is 438 an item code value is a bunch of
jumbled letters that I just put on the
page and I'll show you that page right
now and this is the the structure of the
zip file that you're going to download
there's the Fla file the SWF file the
index.php file which is the important
part here and a readme file and in the
PHP file will open that in Dreamweaver
and you can see here I have let's
maximize this you see here I have those
the ID is 438 and there's those jumbled
numbers and you see how I'm using flash
bars here to send them in I print the ID
and the code and you can see it has a
value or a key of item ID for that first
one and item code is the key for the
second one that's why you see render it
out item ID here and item code and there
are the values so there's proof that is
working and
let's show you the PHP file first what
it is is this is just the basic file
that flash renders out when you press to
publish a your flash file you know how
it it renders out an HTML page I just
turned it into a PHP page I put this
little PHP block of code on top to put
up two variables and yours would be
dynamically rendered variables but mine
are static just for testing and the
creation of this tutorial but yours can
be database rendered variables or date
variables numbers that you gather from
statistics or whatever you want and send
it into flash and so the first step is
to put it into the a CFL run content
code the JavaScript code the flashvars
and it goes under the source attribute
there put flash bars but and I'm not
even gonna tell you what you have to put
there because you can just go and
download the source files and you'll see
this is a working application 100% you
put it on a PHP n8 enabled server and
it's just gonna work and here we have to
put it into the object code the object
tags we put a parameter the flashvars
there and also we put it into the embed
tag flashvars goes right after the
source attribute C flash bars print we
print both variables in and flash parses
them out nicely and we'll take a quick
look at the code here if you need any
help with this code join our forums that
develop PHP and we'll discuss it and
start a conversation about it expand
upon it change it up if you need to
change it up whatever you want but first
we claim the offset value because each
text field you'll see can't be sitting
on top of each other so we render it out
in the loop we have to offset each one
so it has spacing and they're not
sitting on top of each other when
rendered out and then
we claimed the key string variable as a
string for flash and then we claimed the
value string variable as a string as
well and the parameters created and it
loads in the root parameters coming in
from flash bars the parameters from
flash bars are coming into the root
level of this document it is flash
document and that's how we access them
with the parameter then we just set some
formatting for the text fields cuz I
wanted them nice and big and a format
font of verdun and then here's the loop
this loop is the magical part that
renders all the variables out for you
and will access the key and value pairs
and that's the end of it so get these
source files if you want to know how to
use flash bars to send multiple
variables into flash at runtime very
useful for content management systems or
member websites if you have audio
networks video networks it's really
useful stuff
ok see you next lesson guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
