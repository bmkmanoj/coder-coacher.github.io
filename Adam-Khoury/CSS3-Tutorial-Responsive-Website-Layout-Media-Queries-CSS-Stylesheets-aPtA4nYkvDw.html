learn to easily create responsive
website layouts using css3 media queries
media queries allow us to target a
particular media type and then apply 0
more expressions to check for the
conditions and particular media features
of thing start with the bare bones of an
html5 web document and we're also going
to create three different style sheets
so no matter what device the user comes
to our site with we'll have a layout
appropriate for that so let's go up into
our code editor and say file new CSS and
we're going to place the following rule
for a div that has an ID of my div now
let's press ctrl s and save this as
small and it'll have a dot CSS extension
or you can just type in small dot CSS
all right so you see I have small dot
CSS and I also have testy ml so within
the body element in test dot HTML let's
place this div that has an ID of my div
now in the head element of our document
let's create a link element and we want
to set it up like we normally would to
link to our style sheet so we'll put in
the rel attribute and make that equal to
style sheet then we'll put our href
attribute and make that equal to our
small dot CSS so this is the normal way
that you would apply a style sheet to a
web page but in a moment I'm going to
show you how to add the CSS media query
logic to this so if we render this in
our favorite browser you can see that
our style sheet is in fact affecting our
web page it's attached to it it's linked
now I'm going to take small dot CSS I'm
going to file save as medium dot CSS and
large CSS okay so you see what I have
now I have my test HTML file and then I
have three style sheets small medium and
large
now in my small stylesheet you can see
my div has a width of 500 pixels my
medium style sheet let's go ahead and
change that to a thousand pixels and in
the large stylesheet let's change this
to 1400 pixels or 1200 pixels whatever
number you want so these represent your
various style sheets that you want to
switch between according to what the
user's screen size or window size is
now to make this link element be a
little bit more dynamic we can add the
media attribute you can see all of the
different media types that you can
choose between there's actually some new
ones and I think oral was deprecated in
CSS too and they added 3d glasses and
embossed I think something like that but
the most common ones you'll see are
print and screen and we're going to use
screen so if you leave it like that
everything will work like it still does
now what we'll do is add and and then
we'll open closed parenthesis and in
between parenthesis we're going to put
the min width so if the minimum width of
the user screen is zero pixels they're
going to be fed small dot CSS now let's
just highlight that whole line that
entire link element let's go down and
let's change this number to 1000 pixels
and this to medium and now let's copy
that one more time let's make this
number 1400 and this large CSS press
ctrl s to save this test HTML and then
render it in your favorite browser all
right so what happens is as I scale the
browser you can see it's switching
between style sheets
there's the 500 pixel width there's the
1000 pixel width and then the 1400 pixel
width okay so as the users resizing
their browser window or when they first
load up the page when the page first
loads all right now I'm going to show
you a different way to work with media
queries in line so let's just open a
style element in the head make its type
text/css make sure we go down a couple
of lines and close the style element
okay so to do the same thing but in line
in CSS you can do this you can see I
just have two evaluations here so
basically if the users screen or window
size is less than a thousand pixels
they're going to get the div is going to
be 500 pixels wide but if their screen
or window has a minimum with a thousand
pixels then the div is going to be 900
pixels wide and you can change all of
the style on the whole page within these
of
valuations so now let's run this in our
favorite browser you can see we're not
connected to any style sheets but we'll
still get the same effect you'll see the
dip in the center goes from 900 pixels
wide to 500 pixels wide according to the
users window or screen size okay so that
just shows you an alternative inline
method and a way to use the @ symbol and
media attribute and you can do this in
your style sheet or directly inline in
the page like I have it here but I'm
just going to go back to the way it was
before but I think using the link
element and changing your style sheets
completely would be a more organized and
smarter way to go about it but if you
need to just change a couple of things
you can use that inline approach so I'll
have both of the code examples on the
page of develop PHP where this video
lesson renders in case any of you guys
need to get to my exact source code
alright I hope you've enjoyed this
