web developer can apply PHP script logic
to their web documents let's experiment
now inside of our PHP web page that
passes html5 validation and we will
demonstrate these different approaches
and discuss them all
okay here's the bare bones of my test
dot PHP web document you can see I've
applied all of the basic HTML elements
that give me an html5 validating web
document so now I'm going to go into the
body section and you can choose to put
your PHP blocks or scripting tags
wherever you like within the document it
can be above your doctype it can even be
below your HTML tag it can be within
your body tag PHP can also be within the
head element anywhere you like in here
so first I'll show you the standard PHP
opening tag and then we'll go down a
couple of lines and put in its closing
tag that corresponds with it so any of
the code that we put in between these
two tags will be processed by the PHP
engine and everything else in the
document will be ignored by PHP so to
easily demonstrate this we can just type
in an echo a set of double quotes and
then the semicolon to break that
statement and in between our double
quotes we'll just type in a sentence so
when I run this file on a PHP enabled
server I will see some echo output to
the page and since I'm going to have a
few PHP blocks in here for this
demonstration I'm going to wrap this in
a paragraph tag good old HTML paragraph
tag now this will you see here are the
standard PHP opening and closing tags
and it's really what you should use for
all of your PHP programming being as
it's the standard approach you won't
have any migration issues between
different servers and any other problems
that might occur when people use a
different approach you won't have those
so this is the recommended approach now
I'll show you the next approach you can
use a HTML script element so I'm going
to open up a script tag and I'm going to
go language PHP close that and then go
down a couple of lines and make sure I
put on the closing part of my scripting
element now let me just take that code
that I had earlier I'll pop it into
place right there instead of saying that
sentence I'll write in the date
dynamically so I can put in another set
of double quotes and in between those
put in two dots to concatenate the
string and it's just a way to append
variable data to a string so I'll put in
date single quote Y single quote and
then close my parenthesis and right
before the date output and copy symbol
so how little copyright little circle
and then the year will display
dynamically next to it and then I'll
just put Adam Cory okay now I will apply
the next approach that you'll sometimes
see people using this one is the PHP
short tags so you can see it opens up a
PHP scripting block but it doesn't have
the PHP letters next to the opening
question mark now we can take this
sentence and let's put it right here
we'll change this name to John Doe press
ctrl s now run this on a PHP enabled
server okay as you can see on my
particular server that all of this
output works just great now it's not
ideal to use the PHP short tags because
if you're going to use the PHP short
tags it has to be enabled PHP short tags
have to be enabled within your PHP dot
ini' file as one of the directors so if
you happen to build a software
application that runs using PHP and you
take that software and you put it on a
different server that does not recognize
short tags nothing will work that's why
it's discouraged to use PHP short tags
this approach here and this one is fine
but it's not the standard tag this one
the first approach is the standard most
recommended and common way that you'll
see PHP programmers writing script and
this is the approach that I recommend
that you go with now it's also
recommended that if you have a PHP only
document so let's say my document has
only PHP script in it just like this
it's recommended that you leave off the
closing PHP tag just like that and see
if it works so you can see my PHP file
has no closing PHP tag but everything
still works just fine and this will
assure that I have no accidental
whitespace occur in my applications
that's only if you have PHP only
documents if you have HTML mingled
inside of your web document you'd want
to make sure to close all of your PHP
tags
okay so that covers the three ways in
which you can apply PHP script logic to
your web documents and you just have to
make sure that your web document has a
dot PHP extension in order for PHP to
run inside of it and remember that the
first approach that we demonstrated is
the recommended approach that everyone
use</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
