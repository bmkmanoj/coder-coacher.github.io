demonstrate how to make auto adjusting
stretchy fit website layouts and images
simple easy to build layouts that scale
to fit the full width of the user
browser window regardless of the device
or screen size a user has so not only
can you stretch your images you can
stretch all of your containers as well
here is the page layout example and code
that you are going to receive and this
is what it renders so we have a layout
that will auto stretch to fit the full
width the browser window and I made the
images also stretchy and there is header
graphics up top that Auto repeat and
what we have in the middle are four
columns so this is like a four column
layout you can make two column layouts
one column layout three column layouts
eight column layouts as long as you get
your percentages correct I have mine set
to 25% each column so that's how I
achieve the stretchiness if the
browser's window is only this big and
the columns keep their 25% so it doesn't
matter what size the users window is all
of that's going to fit in there
perfectly and I also made it to where
when you're stretching it down or if the
users window gets too small it has a
minimum width the whole center of the
page has a minimum width of about 700 so
that's why you don't see it scaling down
anymore but if I was to go in here and
let's see where is that minimum width
minimum width 7 I change that to 300 now
if i refresh the page I can now scale it
down much small easy and that's a
minimum width of 300 pixels for the
container that holds all four of these
columns so you set your minimum width
and it will stop scaling down once the
user's window reaches a minimum width so
you can just protect on whatever you
want
let's put 800 let's take a look and you
can see as I scale now it will stop when
it reaches 800 pixels there for the
container that holds all four of those
columns now as they quickly explain this
code example I slap together I'm going
to assume you have basic knowledge of
HTML and CSS okay so let's open this
back up again and we have this top div
has a background of the top slivered
that's why how we have that gradient bar
going across the top and it's repeat-x
so it repeats horizontally on the
horizontal plane the height is 73 it's
really a 93 high image but I have
padding of 20 from the top so I had
from my height so instead of the height
being 93 which that graphic actually is
since I have 20 pixel padding inside of
it you can't have that say 93 or it'll
be too big so you have a padding of top
20 and padding of left 20 and that gives
you that header that you see there with
those graphics then you can see here div
id of middle has a min width of 800
pixels and I already explained that to
you then div middle we go into its child
divs and we set them to be float:left
with 25% and that's how we get all of
these four columns to lay on the page
horizontally next to each other if you
don't set them the float they're going
to have a block element display and
they'll all stack vertically down the
page so to stack them across the page
all you have to do is set them to float
and then make sure they have a certain
width you can see the width we gave ours
is 25% and that percentage is what gives
you this stretchy dynamics then in order
to make padding around all of these
inside of all of these divs and any kind
of setting you can use pixel padding for
that because it would be independent of
the 25% that these columns have so if
you try to give these columns padding
directly you're going to have problems
with your stacking or even if you give
them border directly on these four
columns you're going to have problems
with your stacking for instance if you
put right here border or if you put
padding you're going to have problems
there for that element because you're
sticking more things into it like border
and padding so what you want to do is
put a div inside of each of those
columns so let me show you that now so
inside of each of these columns
containers there's a div that you can
then add margin space and padding to and
borders and it won't affect your
stacking so let's go ahead and show you
the HTML and I'll show you what I mean
in the div with ID of middle you have
for child divs and those are your
columns then within those divs you have
child lives within those and those are
the divs that
you can style with borders and padding
and stuff like that so that's what I've
done i targeted div middle and i went
into its child divs and then i went into
their child divs and styled them now you
can see inside of each of those child
divs there's an image example image and
some dummy text being written now this
dummy text being written you can
actually just put it in place and remove
my script you can put all your text
there remove my script and you don't
even need this script tag up here I'm
not even going to open that and explain
that to you because it has nothing to do
with the lesson I made a tutorial a few
days ago on how to make dummy text
dynamically so if you really want to
know what I'm doing in this function
here when you look at it you can go and
check out that tutorial I'm not going to
explain it again wasting another ten
minutes just know that this javascript
function up here can be removed and all
you got to do is remove all of these
guys too and put your actual text in
place or lorem ipsum whatever you want
to do I didn't want to have a lot of
lorem ipsum here to create this dummy
text on my page you see all this dummy
text I didn't want that sitting in my
source code while I was designing and
that's why I made that tutorial for you
guys a few days ago so use it when
you're designing layouts you don't have
to actually have a whole bunch of dummy
text in there you can just use
JavaScript to write as much as you want
in but like I said you can just remove
that function and remove all the
JavaScript all the script tags when you
actually go to put your real text there
so you can see all we have is that image
tag right here example image and then
the dummy text within each of these
column divs now you target these example
images here in CSS by going like this
div middle you go into it's child lives
into their child lives and into the
child image that's within the child live
there so this image lives within this
div who lives within this div who lives
within the middle div so that's why you
see the sequence in the CSS here and
you're targeting that image tag and
making sure its width is a hundred
percent and you don't give it any height
if you want it to react the way mine do
you see when I my images get much bigger
as my page gets larger or as the
browsers window is wider and then the
last thing is the bottom div you clear
left on that let me show you what
happens if I remove clear left ctrl s
let's bring my page back and refresh you
see my footer is now up in my content
which is not cool
that's why clear left is in place now
let me refresh then scroll down you can
see my footage down there where it
belongs now now when you have floating
elements like these are these columns
they float side by side you have to use
clear left on the next content under
them if you want that content to
actually be under them so I've explained
the whole file to you and I hope you
have fun TWiki TWiki let's take a look
at the final finished product and so you
can see on like develop PHP I'm using
these kind of tactics you see my banner
up here you can see how it's stretchy
and so are my columns I have three
columns okay buddy so I'll see you later
