courtesy of the develop PHP comm forums
where a tech guy won 127 asks anyone
want to try to take a stab at a dynamic
bar graph which will load with data from
a database and then I responded with I
will that sounds like fun so that's what
I've done here and that's what you'll be
learning in this tutorial which is a
free downloadable source file package
that has a flash file in it that you can
open in cs3 or cs4 or cs5 and it'll also
have a PHP file in it that does the
communication to the MySQL database
here's the finished product of which
we'll be learning how to create in this
flash and ActionScript rate PHP and
MySQL dynamic bar graph tutorial and
this is just the very basics for you
people who would like to get started in
understanding how to create dynamic bar
graphs using PHP and MySQL information
or PHP and XML information for PHP and
text file information whatever dynamic
information that you want to access on
your server at runtime okay so now let's
publish it out and if you publish it out
you might think it doesn't work because
it says undefined and some weird-looking
variable here that's not a number that's
because it's on your local machine still
once you throw it on line work and
access your MySQL database in PHP for
those of you who don't have a server
scenario on your local machine where PHP
and MySQL can run you got to put it
online so let's leave it what it looks
like online the actual running
application you see there it pulls in
Joe's experience level Joe's experience
level in the database is 72 so the bar
grows to 72 pixels wide and that number
72 gets planted right on the end of the
bar so if Joe's experience level was 150
that number 150 would still be sitting
that many pixels off to the right of the
bar so this little text field is made
it's set up in such a way where it moves
along with the bar okay so now let's
discuss the files that you will get when
you download the free source package
from develop PHP com now the first thing
you have to do is make sure you have a
storage mechanism set up we're gonna be
using MySQL in this example so I made a
quick little demonstration table just
for this tutorial and it has three
fields in it ID field which is auto
increment set the primary the user name
field in the experience field the user
name has a bar chart type and the
experience field has an integer type so
that's really all you need to know and
I'm gonna insert some new data here
because my table is empty so this ID I'm
gonna leave empty this ID is gonna be
empty and they're going to be auto
increment and so this one will get an ID
of 1 by default this one will get an
idea 2 by default
now this username I'm gonna make Joe and
then this one Sally so mine's just gonna
have two users your database could have
10,000 users whatever
Sally's experience level is going to be
fifty-six Joe's experience level is
going to be 72 press go and now I've got
some data in my database I'm gonna
browse it and there's the structure of
my database with the data included in
everything so we just have ID username
experience and we're going to take this
experience these experience numbers and
we're going to be sending them into the
flash okay now let's take a look at the
flash file and all you have to do is
when you download the package you click
on this movie clip here on scene 1 and
you'll see it has an instance name of my
graph app in the library it's in the
library you see my graph app right there
and that's this whole movie clip you
double click inside of it you'll see
three layers on the top layer we have
ActionScript 3 and that's where all the
code is if you press f9 you'll see all
the code and you can manipulate it and
then you'll see dynamic elements layer
and then cosmetic elements layer
cosmetic elements is just things that
are non dynamic that make the flash file
look the way it does dynamic elements
are the things that are going to be
manipulated by the code by the script so
we have a dynamic text field here with
an instance name of graph title
underscore txt and we have another
dynamic text field here that's a
instance named X P underscore txt for
short for experience and then we have
the bar the dynamic bar is just a simple
rectangle that's made into a movie clip
and I'll show you how I made that right
now because I know a lot of people will
have trouble with the registration point
here I'm gonna take a rectangle
primitive I'm going to drag it to stage
it could be anywhere we want any size we
want when we initially drag it out I'm
gonna put it at 24 pixels x-coordinate
and that's important for the flash
ActionScript because that X P underscore
txt hey let's make this not so wide
let's just make it two pixels wide yeah
let's make it 16 pixels high
now let's right-click that convert it to
symbol and let's we can name it whatever
we want in the library let's name it
poopoo make sure the registration is top
left so the bar is sure to grow from the
left to right okay or you can have your
registration here in the center as long
as it's on the left
let's press ok and then we're just
instance name this rect because you'll
see in the code that the code is looking
to manipulate an item called rect it has
an instance name of rect sort for
rectangle okay so that's how you create
your bars and you set up the
registration point to make sure it grows
in the way in the direction that you
want it to grow now all we have to do is
check out the script and I've commented
all the code out so I'm not gonna spend
a whole lot of time here but basically
this is the the code I snatched up from
our develop PHP has a whole bunch of
flash lessons and in the flash section
the flash video tutorial section there's
a whole section dedicated to working
with PHP and MySQL I just snatched up
the the basic two way flash PHP
communication code and I altered it a
little bit to do what we wanted here so
if you need really good insight onto how
that works you can go and check out that
tutorial there at the Bela PHP comm but
in the function complete handler here
what we're doing is we're setting a
couple of variables from the information
that PHP sends back to flash because
flash sends out a request right here and
so once flash ActionScript 3 gets that
data back from
PHP we set a couple of variables using
that dynamic data that's coming back
from flash is one variable called user
the other variable is called XP and the
XP is the number that flash is bringing
back for that little graph bar so if we
have the graph title dot text or
underscore text and that's this one here
so graph underscore dot T a graph title
underscore txt text is equal to the user
name coming back from PHP which in this
case is Joe apostrophe s so it says
Joe's experience level in that field now
the rectangle that little green thing we
just created there is set in the code to
have a dynamic width of whatever XP
number is coming back from PHP and then
the XP text which is this little guy
here that always sits off to the right
of that bar no matter how big it is is
set to have an exposition of rect dot
width so whatever the rectangle width is
plus 24 pixels and the reason why I put
plus 24 is because if you click on this
you can see its exposition is 24 off the
edge of the flash file here right off
the edge of the SWF it's sitting 24
pixels in so I added that little bit of
math to make it sync up right off to the
right of the neck of the experience bar
then we just put the value into that
text field XP underscore txt text is
equal to the XP number and you already
saw that here so you can see how it's
rendering in that dynamic information
for us and extending the bar to be what
it needs and basically that's the whole
flash file that's everything you really
need to know about that so now let's
look at the PHP file alrighty this is
the PHP file that flash calls out to for
data at runtime and you can see we have
a PHP tag opening there closing here and
the first thing that happens inside of
that file is that we access the username
that's being posted from Flash
cuz from the flash file you'll see here
it's posting the username of Joe and
that can be dynamically sent in
I just statically wrote it in there but
you can access it from any information
you need that the flash file already has
so what we do is we access that posted
variable of username so basically this
variable is set to have a value of
whatever is being posted from flash so
we use that in our database query down
here and this would be my table name was
stuff I'm just gonna write in your table
okay so here you connect to your MySQL
database which there's all kind of
tutorials on for that if you have any
trouble connecting to your MySQL
database you just consult your hosting
accounts help panel and in the Help
section you can find out how to properly
query your database for your server and
the next line is an SQL query and we run
a MySQL query that says select
experience field from your table
whatever the name is where username
equals Joe or this users username limit
one because you only want one result
from this query then we set up the
little while loop that accesses the
MySQL fetch array and we can put the row
variable on that and we can access each
array field we can access each field in
the array by saying row and that fields
name here so row experience for this
user who whatever username is sent in is
put into this variable here called XP
number now outside of that loop all we
have to do is echo that data back to
flash so we echo user equals username
which in my scenario it's not even
necessary to put the username back into
flash because flash already sent the
username to PHP so flash already knows
what the username is but just for
example sake I wanted to show you how to
send multiple variables back into flash
so we send the username and X P is equal
to X P number so you'll notice in flash
it's looking for a variable coming back
from PHP called X P and that's the
number that we attained in the
experience field there then we just run
MySQL close function there to close up
the connection that we made to the
database since this script is done
running and that's it for the PHP file
so you'll have PHP file you'll have your
MySQL database and you'll also have this
flash file so it's those three things
are in the mix in this tutorial and this
kind of programming is it's very handy
to know this kind of programming because
you can do a lot more in your flash
applications than the normal flash user
the normal flash user is stuck with
static Undine amic items you know you
can have all kinds of dynamics at play
if you understand how to talk to MySQL
and PHP through flash from flash ok and
don't forget that these files will be
available free for download from develop
PHP com all you got to do is go and
snatch them up play around expand upon
it and hopefully you can be making some
pretty badass bar graphs in flash
