libraries tutorial fireworks cs4 and I
promised I would show you guys how to
take one of these animation to these
ready-made animations for loaders and
bring it into flash will render it out
as an animated gif out of fireworks and
import it into flash as frames so what
we'll do is drag that out to stage and
now will fit canvas now when we press
play we have a nice little animation
with not it's not too heavy on graphics
so let's see
you'll want to make it the color of the
background that it's going to be on so
we'll have to make sure in flashes this
is on a white background so what we'll
do is go to file export wizard select
format continue animated gif continue
and then export and then you just save
it to a place call it loader animation
enema
per save
now it's saved onto a hard drive it's
right here on my desktop actually and
let's go ahead and open flash so when
you're assembling your your flash
application or website open a new flash
project and whether it be ActionScript
to or actionscript-3 and you go to
insert new symbol movie clip name it
load animation press ok and now file
import to stage
load animation
from the desktop where I had it and
there it is so now we go back to seeing
one and see there's nothing on stage so
you go into your library and you grab
the new movie clip that you just created
and there it is and now when you render
out voila you have a nice beautiful load
animation ready to go it's light on
graphics and it can be on any background
color you want so that'd be that so you
see how easy that is and that's same
goes for all these other loaders and
animations and fireworks or any animated
gift for that matter any animated gif
could be loaded into the flash and it's
frames be manipulated as you can see
here all that was what is an animated
gif symbol
and I brought it into flash and there's
all the frames okay see you guys next
