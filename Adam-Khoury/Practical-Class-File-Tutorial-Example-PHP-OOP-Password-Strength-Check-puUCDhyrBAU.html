concepts behind PHP object-oriented
programming you're going to learn to put
it to work in a real and practical sense
by creating a password strength class so
if you're still having trouble
understanding when and why - and you
would like a real-world exercise this is
the lesson for you making sure that user
passwords are strong is a great security
barrier for any interactive website and
the reason why we will objectify this
code is so that other PHP site owners
can use it without learning the
procedural code and if you would like it
to wind up in a free PHP class file
repository online that everybody can
share we must objectify it and use a
class file you don't have to objectify
and use object-oriented programming and
class files unless you have a practical
reason for doing so and just because the
you know object-oriented programming
does not mean every bit of code in your
applications should be changed over to
that style so you really only turn to
creating class files when you have a
good practical reason for doing so and
there are some very good practical
reasons for doing so such as sharing it
in free PHP class files repositories
online you can't share it there you
can't share it with any of the people
that know object-oriented programming in
PHP unless you objectify it and it also
comes in handy to have a class file when
you want to modulate things you can also
modulate things without having a class
file but it's a good way to go about it
when you need modulation you're also
getting an experience building homework
assignment in this lesson and the
homework assignment is intended to test
your resourcefulness and your nerd
abilities
first make sure you have two PHP files
ready strong Pass PHP and demo PHP
strong Pass PHP is going to be your
class file so type in class strong Pass
open curly brace and go down and closing
curly brace now you have an empty class
strong pass now the first thing within
strong pass is going to be a method say
public function and we'll name it simply
check open close parentheses opening
curly brace go down a few lines in
closing curly brace now function check
is going to need to be fed one parameter
which is going to be the password string
with the users typing into the form so
let's just make that aptly named
password now within this method or
function we'll create a local variable
called response and we'll make its value
equal to okay because at the end of the
method down at the bottom here we're
going to return response so response
starts out as okay and then it's
returned here down at the bottom but in
between these two points we're going to
do some it conditions some evaluation on
that password string the first check
that we'll put in place will determine
whether or not the password string is
less than eight characters and if it is
less than eight characters we're going
to change this response from okay to
something else so let's type in if get
the if statement all ready to go we're
going to use the derivative function in
PHP the string length function I call
it's true then but it stands for string
length so if the string length of the
password is less than eight characters
we're going to change response to this
password must be at least eight
characters that way we're in response is
returned down at the bottom here it
won't be okay anymore
now I'm going to pop into place and else
if condition that says else if is
numeric password then the response is
going to change to password must contain
at least one letter because when you run
the is numeric function over a string
it's checking to see whether that string
is all numeric and if it is all numeric
then you know it has no letters in it
and a strong password must contain at
least one letter actually it should
contain at least two letters it should
contain an uppercase letter and at least
one lowercase letter this is checking
just to make sure it has at least one
letter in it now I'm going to pop in one
more condition to check and see if we
have a match for any numerals or numbers
in that password string so for instance
if somebody puts all letters in you want
to make sure they have at least one
number in their password to make it a
strong password so if there is no preg
match for numbers in the password then
the response becomes password must
contain at least one number now before I
show you that demo dot PHP I'm going to
give you your homework assignment now
and I'll just type it right into here
okay so you have additional checks that
you must accomplish as your homework you
have to make sure there is at least one
lowercase letter in the password you
have to make sure there is at least one
uppercase letter in the password you
have to make sure there is at least one
symbol character in the password now
there's a whole lot more logic and
strength checking that you can do but
remember this is not a strength checking
tutorial this is an object-oriented
programming tutorial because you guys
were expressing to me that you wanted to
see more real-world examples I'm just
trying to show you how to create class
files and why you would want to create
class files okay now let me show you
what's in demo dot PHP once we have a
form that parses to demo dot PHP so this
page parses to itself if you want you
can echo out server PHP self there but I
just want to keep it simple so I put
demo dot PHP and the PHP that parses it
is right in the top here and I'll
discuss that just a second this is the
PHP script that connects to that class
so the form action is post that means
it'll post the variable of password to
this file this parsing script and this
is setup very basic just for a tiny
little demo and after you have the
password field do you have a submit
button that says check password strength
now down here in the
item of the HTML section of this file
I'm echoing a variable called status
because that's going to let the user
know actually I can show it to you right
now before I even show you the parsing
script here's the application running
live now if I put in a password say of
three characters check strength says
password must be at least 8 characters
so then I'll add more characters to that
check strength password must contain at
least one number so I'll put a number in
there check strength passwords are
strong so parsing can continue here
that's how it works okay so you see the
form and the user interface that I was
just using is sitting right here now
let's talk about the PHP that occurs
when this parsing mechanism is called
into action so the first thing we do is
create two local PHP variables one for
the password and one for the status and
those are placed into the HTML they're
echoed into the HTML down on the page
that way the user can just fix their
password that they were already typing
in they don't have to start over and
that's only for this demo remember this
is just a very basic demo and these
things are put into place for that
reason so if the posted variable of
password is set then this little bit of
code will execute but if that variable
of password is not posted and this code
won't run so the first thing we do
inside of that is we gather up the
posted variable into a local variable
called password then we include once our
strong past class so right here is where
we are calling our strong past class
into action because we're going to
create a new strong pass object instance
and we're going to name it strong pass
so once we have this object instance
ready then we can go ahead and call that
method check and pass any variables that
we want to that function so we create a
variable called response and then all we
do is we run the check method on the
password string that the user is typing
in and you're going to get a response of
either okay or some error message so all
you have to do is evaluate that response
so you say if does not equal okay and
you're going to put in the status area
down here on the page
the response whatever the error message
was else you can put in the status for
the demo password is strong so parsing
can continue here but if this was your
actual parser you wouldn't want to just
display things to the page like we're
doing for this demo you would want to
continue your parsing here that's why I
wrote parsing can continue here you can
add that password to the database or do
whatever you got to do at that point
because the response is okay at this
point okay so now you can see the
practical essence of using class files
and it's also more practical and more
important when you're going to share
things with other people that know
object-oriented programming and remember
you have some homework to make this more
powerful and you also might want to
check to make sure that the users name
isn't within their password some people
will put their user name directly in
their password or use their user name as
their password which is retarded so you
want to make sure they don't do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
