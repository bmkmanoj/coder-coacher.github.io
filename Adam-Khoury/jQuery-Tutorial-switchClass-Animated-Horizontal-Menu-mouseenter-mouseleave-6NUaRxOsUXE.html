you'll be learning how to create using
jQuery switch class method to effect CSS
styles to transition in an animated
fashion from one style to the next so
you can create something like this
animated horizontal menu system so when
the users mouse goes over one item you
can see it animates to a different style
then when their mouse leaves that item
it animates back to the original style
so we'll show you how to use the switch
class method to make very simple
horizontal menu systems with animated
buttons all right I'm working in
Dreamweaver cs5 as my HTML text editor
but really it doesn't matter which one
you're in because we're not even going
to go into design view we're just going
to deal with the code so you can be a
notepad notepad plus plus whatever you
want I don't care all of this code is
going to be free for you to copy and
paste where it plays under the video at
develop PHP calm and I'll shortly put a
link to that page in the YouTube video
description that way you guys from
YouTube can just look in the description
of the video click on it and get to the
code if you want it I'll create a new
HTML file we'll go into the code view
now I'm going to save this file as
index.html on my desktop now the first
thing I'm going to do is apply the HTML
to the body tag of the page so in
between the opening and closing body
tags I'm going to put this code here I'm
going to a marketer go to in-depth about
the HTML or the CSS because the HTML is
very basic and the CSS is very very
basic I will go in depth about the
jQuery that we put in place but I'll
briefly discuss this so in between the
body tag here you can see I have two div
tags one is just a banner which really
has nothing to do with the menu system
and then the other div is ID of menu
which has everything to do with the menu
system and you can see within that
there's just simple a tags and advice
lines separate each one you'll see
exactly what it consists of and you can
see that each one of my little links has
a class set on it of style one which
we're going to put the CSS in place in
the head tag in just a second for that
style and then here you linked to any
page you want to in the HR
so I'm going to put it back the way it
was with each link right on top of the
next or right after the next one with no
spaces in between each because I want
them to line up the way we had it lining
up here all right next to each other and
there's no spaces in between those
buttons and that's what I wanted so
that's why I set up my links that way
it's a very easy way to do that and
that's it for the HTML there's nothing
more to it which is going to put some
CSS to effect this top banner and then
we're going to put some CSS to effect
this menu div and all these little links
inside of it now if you look in the
design view you'll have something that
looks just like that now up here within
the head tag of the document you can see
we have a couple of wines there I'm
going to go under the title tag I'm
going to put in some style CSS styling
so you can see here is my style tag
complete there's really not much to it I
have style 1 and style 2 here and you
can remember on all of my links they had
a class of style 1 to start out with by
default so they have this style 1
applied to them right when the page
loads we also have some styling for the
body tag of the page to give the
background a certain color that we want
and make all the margins zero pixels
then we have some styling to effect this
top banner div right here so this
styling on the top banner div defines
the background color of it the font size
the color of the font and then the
padding that you want for it now the
menu styling this is the actual menu
that all of our little a tags are inside
of all of our little buttons I gave that
style rules of background color the
border color how thick the border should
be the style of the border and then
padding now that's it for the CSS and
the HTML now right up above the style
tag in between the title tag and my
style tag I'm going to add a few lines
that are going to include some
JavaScript files in one CSS file so
these are the four lines I just put in
place and you can see that they linked
to Google api's comm and jQuery comm and
it brings in one two three javascript
files and one CSS file in order to make
this application work
which if you want you can go download
the jQuery files that are needed
straight from these URLs because people
cannot hide CSS files or JavaScript
files so you can actually navigate to
these files if you want online download
them put them on your server and link to
them from your server instead of linking
to them from Google api's or jQuery com
which is totally safe to do so you can
just link to it like I did here or you
can choose to actually go get those
files put them on your server and simply
change the source link to that file now
once we have those in place we can slap
in some jQuery now within the script tag
to affect our CSS and HTML to make the
menu system work so right here above the
style tag again let's pop in the final
bit of code that we need and you can see
here I just popped in a script tag
within it there's some jQuery
functionality happening and it's only
eight lines of jQuery and I'll explain
it in depth so you guys can really wrap
your heads around what's going on and
before we get started explaining it just
want to let you know we're using the
switch class method in jQuery which is
well documented at their site we're also
using the mouse enter and mouse leave
event methods okay let's separate these
so you can see both of these little
mechanisms this little mechanism is for
the mouse enter when somebody's mouse
goes over one of those buttons this
little mechanism is for the mouse leave
method event when somebody's mouse
leaves one of those buttons you can see
that I'm targeting each of the a tags
inside of the menu system so here down
in my HTML you can see I have div ID
menu so I'm targeting that here in
jQuery and then I just put space a to
make sure that I'm targeting all of the
little a tags inside of that menu system
to apply the mouse enter and mouse leave
event methods so when the users mouse
goes over any one of those a tags inside
of the menu the mouse enter event method
will fire off this function which will
execute this line of code basically
that's how it works and then when the
mouse leaves
this one fires off to execute this line
of code so what happens in this line of
code here is we use the switch class
method on this and we use this as an
identifier for whichever little a tag
happens to be the target a tag that the
user's Mouse's over so you can use this
to identify that and use the switch
class method for that element and the
switch class method allows you to place
three parameters or arguments inside of
it the first argument is the style that
you want to change from then the second
argument is the style that you want to
change to in an animated fashion and the
third argument is the duration which is
the time that it takes to complete the
animation basically your animations
speed and you can adjust this number to
be whatever you want so on the mouse
leave mechanism is pretty much just the
opposite you go from style two to style
one in an animated fashion with whatever
duration that you like and that's pretty
much how it works
and I'll put some comments in here okay
this nice code comments for you and I'm
not sure if I discuss the document.ready
function that you see that our little
eight lines of code here are wrapped
within the document.ready function is an
instrumented at the jQuery website so
you can go read all about it but
basically what document that ready
function does is it will allow you to
make sure that all of the elements
within the page are loaded so that way
if you have any event methods or if
you're targeting certain elements within
some jQuery that's in the head tag of
your deck of your document you can make
sure those things are accessed with the
document that ready function or if you
don't want to use the document that
ready function you can just be sure you
put this script tag with all of this
jQuery code underneath all of this HTML
that it's affecting and then you don't
have to use the document already
function but sometimes it's best to have
your code up in the head tag of your
document and use the document already
function okay guys so that's how it
works
let's see let's press ctrl s and f12 to
test this in the browser
yep you can see we have the desired
result that we wanted we're using the
switch class method and the mouse enter
and mouse leave event methods of jQuery
to render this animated menu system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
