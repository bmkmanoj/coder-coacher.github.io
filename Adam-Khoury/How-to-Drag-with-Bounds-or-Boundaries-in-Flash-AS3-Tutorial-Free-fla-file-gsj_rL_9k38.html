ActionScript 3 tutorial it's always good
practice to show the finished product
so let's publish out geez that's taken
forever ok and this is what we have
dragging within bounds dragging objects
movie clips on stage within a bounded
area the stage is a little bit larger
here and I have a rectangle and that's
what it's bound to and that's what
you'll learn in this tutorial ok here we
go
in this flash the ActionScript 3
tutorial I'll be showing you how to drag
within bounds that means pick up an
object and move it around within a
bounded space an area that you define to
where you can't drag it off the screen
or off the stage and I'll also show you
how to do some fireworks and flash
workflow breaking images in if you don't
know how already how to do that easily
I'll show you how to do that ok so let's
get back to dragging within bounds so
first thing you'll notice is I just
created a new ActionScript 3 project and
I'm in flash cs3 but you can be in cs4
and what I've done is made three layers
ActionScript layer image movie clip
layer that'll be the item that we drag
around and a rectangle wreck balance
background and that'll be an image
pattern or something it could just be a
rectangle if you wanted it can be an
invisible rectangle if you wanted but
let's go ahead and get these items here
now and we'll import them as movie clips
so we can just give them an instance
name so here I am in fireworks and I'm
gonna grab one of these images so
actually let's give the background first
so press control-c with that image
highlighted take your mouse highlight
the image press ctrl C
and then go back into flash and on the
image movie clip layer press ctrl-v and
it'll say current frame as movie clip
and that's what you want into and the
objects import is bitmap to maintain
appearance yes and keep all text
editable if you wanted that option you
could do that and press ok
but it's important to import it as a
movie clip press ok and then once that's
on stage just position it to where you
want it and that's the bounds that way
the new object that we put on here is
going to be not able to be dragged
outside of this area people won't be
able to drag it outside this area
because we're gonna use this shape it's
with its height and also its position on
stage let's just put it at 50/50
so it's at even numbers so it's at an x
position 50 Y position of 50 and I'm
going to give it an instance name I'll
select it and call it rec to power a ECT
all lowercase and now go back into
fireworks and let's grab any any object
you want to drag around press ctrl C and
then go back in a flash and control V on
this oops I put that on the wrong layer
I'll remove it now I'm going to import
this one same way as movie clip add it
where you want it on stage make sure it
has even numbers it's not really
necessary but it's best to and then
let's see we're not even numbers but a
decimal of zero on the x and y position
I just like to put all my my objects hit
zero on the the decimal position no
matter what the number is okay so where
were we
let's give this an instance name now
that it's in a image holder one that way
you can put multiple call it image
holder - image holder three if you
wanted to add more I'm just going to put
one and now we got to put this on its
correct layer so press control X once
that's selected and put it on the layer
it should be rex background layer and
that's it now the code I have been here
and you can get this code by downloading
the free Fla file from develop PHP com
you just go to develop PHP comm right
here and you download the free Fla file
to get to the source you see all the
code nice and clear and you see a
working application from the start so
you know it's not bogus what I'm doing
here ok yeah you get to develop PHP and
let me show you real quick hit the flash
and ActionScript tab right there in the
middle and you'll see a whole big list
of ActionScript 3 Fla files you can
download free because you know we just
we just do it that way ok so back to the
code there's all the code I commented
out really nice and what we do is we get
certain object we get the x position the
Y position of this object here and the
the width and height of that object in
code we attain those values and we put
them into variables and we use those
variables to do a little math and now
once we press f1 or f12 sorry to publish
out you can see that hey look at I can
drag my movie clip and what's better is
that it never leaves the bounded area of
that cool image pattern I have
there or whatever rectangle you set back
there normally with dragging it would go
wild and drag everywhere on stage but
this way if you wanted to set a boundary
for your drag they cannot leave the
boundaries no matter what they try and
do and that's pretty much it so this
file will be free for download and you
can check it out if you're interested in
getting this kind of functionality in
flash ActionScript 3 and cs3 or cs4
whichever one you're using alright and
the next tutorial I think I'll show how
to drag within bounds all through code
without adding anything to the stage and
that should be pretty cool for you guys
who are more on the dynamics end ok
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
