webpage theater mode to toggle the
darkness on the page when you want to
bring special focus to an existing box
of content on the page it does not have
to be a movie you can place any HTML
content into the special box that is to
stay active on the page while everything
else on the page darkens and becomes
inactive temporarily so basically you're
just turning lights on and off entering
and exiting theater mode each time
that's toggled and then after the
overlay goes away you can then interact
with all of the page content once again
ok now you see the finished product of
what your going to be learning how to
create within this video tutorial so
let's rock and roll so you'll be getting
this video and one more video that's
along the same lines and the next video
we're going to cover how YouTube pulled
off their lights out for Earth Day
application because theirs was not
covering a page with a dark overlay they
were actually changing the CSS on the
page just to make the page appear darker
so we're going to cover that kind of
functionality too so you guys can see a
full scope of this whole overlay and
page darkening type of functionality
that you see on websites but this one
here that's theater mode that you just
saw the example for we're going to use a
dark overlay and I just have to make
sure that you guys understand there's a
difference between what YouTube was
doing for Earth Day and their lights out
application between what we're doing
here for our website theater mode
application and each would have its own
special purposes within your
applications because it's a different
type of manipulation okay here's the
document that we're going to be playing
with you can see mine is called
light switch example that HTML you can
see we have all the basics for our
document ready to go the foundation the
backbone of it we have a style tag ready
here within the head tag we also have a
JavaScript scripting tag ready within
the head tag of the document and then we
have the body section here what we'll be
putting our HTML content now what I'm
going to do is go ahead and start with
the CSS so I'm going to open the index
page that we worked on in the first
video where we covered how to create a
web page overlay
I tell you what I'll somehow link all of
the videos to one another maybe in the
top left and right side of the video you
can get from one video to the next
that's all along these same lines is
this really four videos that we're doing
so I'll link them all up so don't worry
I'll make it easy for you alright so
here is the code from that tutorial that
we finished and you see where it says
div overlay I'm going to grab that I'm
going to put it into my new page here on
my new application because basically I'm
going to use the same exact code for
that I'm going to go back into the index
page and just grab that div that's the
overlay see where it says start and
overlay I'm going to grab all that ctrl
C go back into the body section of this
new page and paste that in now what I
can do is remove everything what's in
that is within that overlay div and I'm
just going to make that overlay div rest
on one line there the opening and
closing tag for it so there you have
your overlay all ready to go and you
don't need anything else
more for that now let's resume our CSS
the next thing in the CSS we're going to
be targeting an image tag that I'm going
to put on the page in just a second and
I'll walk you through that as well and
that is going to have an ID of light
switch and that's going to be the little
light switch that you saw me toggling up
and down on the page now it's going to
have a position of relative and the
positioning is kind of important because
if you didn't position it correctly
wouldn't sit above the overlay which has
a z-index of two lights which has a
z-index of three and if you recall from
the last video z-index is a way to give
stacking order to your elements or a
hierarchal stacking levels so one can
sit on top of the other so we want to
make sure that light switch is always on
top of the overlay or else when the
theater mode comes into play you won't
be able to turn it off because the light
switch will be under the overlay so
that's the only reason you see
position:relative and z-index of three
it just has a higher Z index value than
the overlay
now you can see I'm giving it a
background image here for the actual
image tag now this is going to be an
image within the image tag in the HTML
but I'm giving it a background image
way my light switch down mode is
preloaded into the page now I set
no-repeat on it because I didn't want to
repeat within that image tag which it
wouldn't anyway but I just wanted to
make sure so basically this line is in
there to preload the light switch down
graphics that way when they click it to
go into theater mode light switch down
graphics are pre-loaded into the page
ready to go and it shows instantly and
then we just set cursor to pointer
within that image tag that is the light
switch that way you can make sure that
when the users mouse goes over it it
changes to the little clickable hand
symbol thing that way they know they're
they can interact with that button or
that light switch if you didn't set
cursor to a pointer here it would just
remain an arrow when they hover their
mouse over that light switch now let's
put that image tag within the HTML since
we just got finished discussing the CSS
for it okay so let's go down in the HTML
I don't need this here and I'm going to
type in webpage theater mode example
then I'm going to highlight all of that
text and press control one that way it
wraps in h1 tag for me now I want an
image tag now this image tag is going to
be the special light switch so you want
to grab that ID name there in the CSS
and make sure this image tag has that ID
now we're going to put on Mouse down
because we want this function to fire
off when the user clicks down with their
mouse or you can use on click event
there if you want I'm just going to use
on Mouse down it'll do the same thing
really but on Mouse down and on click
aren't exactly the same but but my
little application they'll work pretty
much the same so you can use either on
Mouse down or on click whatever you want
so in the onmousedown event we're going
to fire up a javascript function that
we're going to write in one second up
top let's just open closed parenthesis
right there
that's ready to go so that will execute
that function called toggle theater mode
when the user Mouse's down on our light
switch hey let me close this image tag I
just put the closing bracket there now
the next thing I want to do is give it a
source image make sure the image tag has
a source
light switch up by default then the
width of my lights which was I think 19
pixels and my height was 46 I believe so
you just put the dimensions of your
light switch there and you got to put an
alt tag just to make sure it validates
and you can just say switch right there
if you want and the last little thing
inside the image tag is the title and
this will display to the user when they
hover their mouse over it and by default
you want to say enter theater mode and
save the file
control s will save the file boya now
we're going to place the last little bit
of CSS which is for a div that we're
going to place in a moment in our HTML
that's going to have an ID of special
and that is your special content box the
content box that will never get darkened
by the overlay it's the special focus of
the page when people go into theater
mode most of the time you would have a
movie playing there but you can really
have any kind of HTML content that you
would like to put there because I set it
up in such a way that the content will
remain active when everything goes into
theater mode whether it's text or images
in that special box the content will
remain active and you can make the
background for that box the any color
you want when everything goes into
theater mode you can change the color of
the text using JavaScript within that
box using JavaScript you can change the
color of the text within that box
basically using JavaScript you can
change everything about that special box
when the application goes into theater
mode when it goes out of theater mode
you can change it all back using
javascript
okay so div ID special that gets a
position of relative just like the light
switch said and a z-index of four
actually you can give that a z-index of
three two and I think everything will
work out just fine now all we have to do
is stick special down in the HTML now
and that's going to be under our image
tag all right
let's pop that in and I'll explain it
really quick for you is not much to it
it's a div tag with an ID of special
inside of it there's an embed
YouTube video and I got that code by
going to YouTube and underneath each
video at YouTube it says little button
called share you click share and you get
the embed code for the video that's the
exact code that I put it in right there
any video you want you have a lot of
freedom in placing your content and your
div ID special and your image that's
your light switch and your overlay are
not really going to affect all of your
other page content that you might have
existing on the page already now within
this h2 tag I'm just going to put my
webpage has a lot of stuff on it just to
show you you can have a lot of crap
everywhere around all these things and
here right next to your image that's
your light switch button I'm going to
pop in an h3 tag that has the content
saying I can put a title here if I want
so that title will be right next to your
little light switch and I put style
display:inline that way it doesn't take
up a whole new block on the page and
it's sitting right next to your light
switch if you didn't put style display
in line for that h3 tag your light
switch would be above this sentence now
let's take a look at what we have on the
page by pressing f12 if we're in
Dreamweaver to render it to our browser
and you can see when we click this
button now nothing's going to happen
because we haven't programmed the
JavaScript yet it's just a few lines of
JavaScript and we're going to actually
borrow the function from the first video
on overlay to complete our new little
application because the scripting is
very similar we're going to do a couple
of different little things so I'm going
to go to the code in the first tutorial
and I'm going to grab the JavaScript
function that we had called toggle
overlay I'm going to place it into my
JavaScript tag here in the new document
instead of being called function toggle
overlay this one is toggle theater mode
so to make sure we change that save
function toggle theater mode now you see
how we created this variable that
represents the overlaid div we're going
to leave that in place because we have
our div overlay sitting here so we're
going to need to affect that div with
our JavaScript so we'll leave that line
in place we're going to put a new
variable that targets the light switch
so let's grab that light switches ID
down in the HTML and put it right here
bar lights which is equal to a document
that get
element by ID light switch now you see
where we have if the overlay display is
equal to block then we're going to make
it disappear else if it's not showing on
the page we're going to make it appear
so within the else if condition
statement we're going to put a couple of
more lines in both of those okay so you
can see that these two lines are
affecting the light switches source and
title attributes for that HTML element
and the if condition takes care of
making the overlay disappear basically
going back to the normal state of the
web page out of theater mode that's what
these three lines are doing is taking
the web page out of theater mode these
three lines put it into theater mode so
that's why in the title down here you
wanted to say exit theater mode and in
the title here you wanted to say enter
theater mode and you want it to have
different graphics as the source for
that light switch when it's in or out of
theater mode and that's all these two
lines do is they toggle the graphics for
that image and they also toggle what the
title will say when the users mouse
hovers over it and that's it that's the
whole application so let's press f12 and
run it in the browser see if we have a
working script it's beautiful so when we
have our mouse over it and it's in
theater mode it says exit theater mode
we have our mouse over it and it's not
in theater mode yet it says enter
theater mode it's exactly what we wanted
and look how quickly and beautifully
that works instance nice you can also
apply jQuery to this script you see
where you have your overlay style
display block and overlay display:none
you know how in jQuery you can use the
show function to make something animate
over a few seconds to maybe fade it into
view you can just put that right there
all right so I hope you've enjoyed that
tutorial like always I'll have this
script available just for referencing
sake and tune in to the next video if
you would like to see how YouTube pulled
off their lights out for Earth Day
application which is similar to this but
it's a little bit different because
they're targeting CSS and darkening the
page that way in
of laying an overlay and disabling all
this content on the page when YouTube
goes into lights-out mode you can still
interact with everything on the page and
that's what I'm going to show you how to
do in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
