creating custom content management
systems using PHP and MySQL what we're
doing is showing how to build the
Foundation's or just the bare bones of
the system like Joomla or WordPress but
from scratch so you can have ultimate
control over layout and site design ok
so in this last part of the series we're
going to show you how you can get
yourself a free Java Script
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor so
let's go into the admin section let's
just look at it create new page so the
goal here is to remove this regular form
text area here this big area this text
area input and we want to replace it
with a JavaScript based
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor for
editing HTML and formatting things on
the page and some even allow image
upload so the images can be uploaded to
the server and then used on the page by
somebody who doesn't know HTML and it
puts all those cool buttons up top and
everything so that's the goal here and
let's show you some that I know that are
pretty cool and that are available free
and there's like 20 good ones out there
that work decent but I'll just show you
these four because I like them open
WYSIWYG that's at open web we're calm
and you'll see it's a free cross browser
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor and
it gives you all those cool features
that you see on a lot of HTML editing
programs where people don't know HTML
but they can yet style a page out and
what you see what they say is it's a
free cross browser
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor
packed with every rich text editing
feature you need to make your content
management system that much better see
it's targeted for this
it is setup is easy you can quickly turn
any text area which is this this is a
text area you're going to turn this into
this and it's easy see setting up open
WYSIWYG is so easy even a baby can do it
you can turn any text area into a
powerful WYSIWYG editor with just a few
simple lines of code
don't tell me you're having problems
implementing your WYSIWYG editor little
kids do this old ladies do this okay
with no problems every day and we also
have widget editor which is on the
Google code network here and that one's
very lightweight it says it is designed
to be simple to use have a small code
footprint and produce valid semantic
code so there you go
you want something lightweight small and
fast you might want to try which editor
that's at Google code or Ted
code.google.com P which editor you can
I'll zoom in on those URLs then we have
text area rich I'll zoom in on that URL
as well let's text area rich comm and
this one is text area rich is a fully
functional free replacement for your
existing text area HTML tag also
targeting exactly what we want to make
our content management system a little
more powerful and intuitive and then we
have tiny MCE which is at tiny MCE Moxie
cocom I'll zoom in on that URL as well
and that one is a platform independent
web-based JavaScript HTML WYSIWYG editor
control released as open source under
the LGPL
and it has the ability to convert HTML
text area fields like we want or other
HTML elements to editor instances it's
very easy to integrate into other
content management systems
okey-dokey so that's the board that I
recommend okay let's just discuss a
couple of more things so what's going to
happen is when you replace that and the
person does all their fancy editing and
formatting they want and they press
submit it's going to go into the MySQL
database just like it does currently but
now it's going to have a lot of HTML
tags and formatting attached to it to
where when it renders out and on the
front end of the site it's going to be a
lot a lot better put a lot more of the
page control into the clients hand and
in the script let's see which one is
that
let's just go to this edit page edit
page dot PHP so say when they're editing
an existing page your WYSIWYG would be
right there and it would replace this
text area see how easy that is you would
throw a little bit of JavaScript in the
head probably a little bit of JavaScript
right here to render out the WYSIWYG
text editor and then on your server you
go and upload the files for the WYSIWYG
usually just a directory full of
pictures scripts CSS and a few other
things you just upload the whole
directory intact to your server and just
refer to it just like they show you in
the examples each one of these editors
has example pages so it's so it's
foolproof okay I don't really even have
to go through it and show you how easy
it is I'm not going to take the time to
do that because it is so easy so this
would be replaced by the text area the
WYSIWYG text areas okay so we hope you
enjoyed this lesson series on creating
custom content management systems so you
can have a little bit of more insight
into how things like this are built or
really expand a basic system like this
to have your own integration methods if
you want to go into flash you can
integrate into flash you can integrate
into several different technologies
rather than just
relying on CSS with the PHP or the HTML
formatting with PHP and MySQL XML can be
involved flash and ActionScript can be
involved flex can be involved flex and
ActionScript 3 can be involved anything
you want all kinds of technologies okay
so we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
