building web development tutorial in
today's web everybody's looking to have
the better cooler animations on their
website so I put together a file for you
guys that will show you how to zoom
squeeze tween fade dissolve fly make
blinds effect photo effect wipe rotate
and iris so if we publish it out or not
published we'll just export it you can
see the zoom effect pretty cool squeezed
effect between effect which most people
know about it ready the fade effect the
dissolve transition effect fly blinds
which is one of my personal favorites
photo which I also like photo is really
cool nice flash on it wipe rotate
and iris like the end of a Looney Tunes
cartoon or the beginning so those are
the effects that you'll be learning with
this file and this file will be
available 3 a developed PHP in the flash
section under the animations category so
in the flash section under the
animations category you'll find this
file and I'm also going to link to it in
the description of the YouTube video and
here is the ActionScript let me rename
this ActionScript and I set the file up
in such a way actually script 3.0 and I
set the file up in such a way to where
these buttons control this movie clip
which is just like any other object or
button you would have on stage and I
show you how to use those effects and I
even for the tween effect I give you
some other examples that you can use and
there's all types of things you can do
and I suggest you experiment with
changing these values within all of
these transition effects so a lot of
people don't know about a lot of these
effects and they should and it can help
you stay off the timeline help you do
things more programmatically and help
your flash websites new flash
applications come to life without too
much manual timeline construction
whatever you call it okay so this file
and the code will be available in the
page for you for download at develop PHP
in the flash section under animations
hope you enjoy and we hope to see some
some cool transition effects being used
on some flash websites in the near
future okay we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
