ActionScript 3 PHP and MySQL tutorial
brought to you by flash building and
today's lesson we're creating a content
management system website 100% flash and
what it does is it connects to PHP and
MySQL to render pages dynamically and
also allow your client or yourself to
edit the pages on-site in real time so
you can see on the home page we have
some data that Rick put in there and it
said something a minute ago and you can
go right now and edit the home page and
the about page and on the portfolio
static page services is static and
content the contact page is static but
the about page and the home page
I made dynamic these call out to PHP and
MySQL to retrieve this data so let's go
ahead and use the demo you go to the
admin button at the bottom and it gives
you a login form if you put in the wrong
data you see here I give you the
username and the password to log in for
the demo its admin and password but say
I just put it in the wrong data
it says processing no match on our
records try again ok so let's put in
admin and password
login and if it's if it successfully
logs in it gives us a little menu down
at the bottom here since we are the
owner and let's go to a home page now
you see it didn't even hardly even
change the way it looked when I did that
if I go back to the home page see it
takes away that sentence and that button
up top but if I go to edit the home page
puts a little sentence up top it takes
you to a new keyframe in flash and then
it puts a on that keyframe is this edit
button in that sentence and this is now
an input text field so I can edit it
I am very cool
exclamation then press update and it
takes you back to the home page where it
reacts s's the data now we're on the
regular view of the site so about page
the home page see I am very cool
a second ago just said something else so
now when your client updates the site
everyone else in the world and them
they'll see the new updated data in real
time right away and that's pretty much
the gist of it and you can also edit the
about page
I am very cool actually that should be
on the about page let's update that
let's go to the home page and let's edit
that home page and we want this to say
welcome to the show and you can you know
you set line breaks in there and it's
all HTML based data so it will retain
the line breaks HTML line break okay
there it is now we're back on the home
page so right when you press update I
programmed it to send the user right
back to the home page so you can see
that the result of their work
automatically it's very smart
programming in this file so let's go
ahead and look at the inner workings of
it now okay so when you download the
source files and you unzip the package
this is what's inside the folder and
this is pretty much the whole directory
for the complete website or the complete
example that I have on page there and I
have a little instruction sheet here you
can read and helps you get get started
if you're kind of new and but I would I
would recommend only intermediate users
go for this tutorial because if you're a
new flash user you really wouldn't have
the need for something like this this is
really for webmasters to make more money
with so they can offer their clients
better service you understand so that's
really what it's all about so in the
folder you'll see there's the source
file the flash source file and go ahead
and open that just double-click it and
your flash application will open with
that file and you can see there's also
get this over here so when we open the
file go ahead and get the whole thing in
view here and mine open in flash cs3 and
if you use flash cs4 this will also work
for you and this is ActionScript 3 based
so you'll see the as3 site nav code and
this file structure is a tutorial I made
just a couple of days ago if you go to
develop PHP on the home page you'll see
this tutorial and the one under it
easiest way to add event listeners let's
see here's that file I just expanded on
it because it was it was a complete
flash website so I figured I would just
take this and expand upon it that way so
if you guys need to understand how to
build the structure of the framework of
the site that I made take that tutorial
first and then come to this one it would
be a logical order and step step up you
know what I mean
anyways so on the first frame we run the
code like normal that we did from the
last tutorial and here's the button and
here's the pages movie clip and the only
edition now is inside the pages movie
clip we have a clip here which is called
the admin panel and it's on its own
layer on very top of everything else and
on that layer all we have is that one
movie clip if you double click double
click inside of it you'll see on the
first keyframe there's three key frames
and each have stop actions so they don't
loop on the first keyframe we have the
admin button which simple code there
takes them to frame 2 when pressed
there's an event listener and the
function to go to frame 2 that's all
that does when they press that admin
they go to frame 2 boom shows them the
login form here's the static status text
it tells them what's going on as they're
logging in
and here the fields and the button the
login button and the login code now this
login code connects to a file called CMS
control file dot PHP and I named it CMS
control file because it runs the whole
system if you go to that folder you open
CMS control file let's open that in
Dreamweaver cs4 so we can see the syntax
really well my programs are taking
forever to load
okay
let's go ahead and size this down see at
all
all right now
inside the first thing we do in this CMS
control file and this is the one you'll
really want to dig through and examine
and there's really not too much going on
and I Section sectioned off each block
where things are happening
and gave you a little title of what's
happening in that section so you can
understand what's going on we're so in
the first on the top section we just
include the connect to MySQL dot PHP
file and if you need to understand how
to create your database and also let's
go to develop PHP develop HP's PHP and
MySQL section I have tutorial that shows
you how to connect to your MySQL
database where is it somewhere connect
to your minus QL database using PHP and
if you need to learn how to create a
database both of these tutorials with
this member system basic this shows you
in the first step how to create a MySQL
database so if you're very if you're at
the beginning of all this you don't even
know how to create a MySQL database and
connect to it you can learn through
these sections here and but back to
business okay so we connect to the MySQL
database and then we run queries on it
according to what function they are
trying to do in flash here's the login
function and what's going to happen is
they're gonna post a username and
password so we just gather those up then
we connect to the database and check to
see if it's there and the username and
password match up and we run a minus QL
'numrows on the result and we should
have a result of one so we run an if
conditional here that says if the log
and result is greater than zero which it
should be one to give them access we
return a message of all good if the log
in check is zero
this else comes into play and we print
them return a message of no good and so
that's what happens there in the login
section so when they login successfully
in the code we go to and stop frame
three see if event that data return
message is all good we say go to and
stop frame three if it's no good we
print a message - that's a detection the
static text box here that says no no
matching our records please try again
and they can put in the correct data so
on success we go to frame three which
are those buttons that are choose the
page to edit and they can click this one
or that one and these are very simple
codes to just take the user one movie
clip up so we claim parent clip go to
and stop edit home when they click that
edit at home button so that would be the
equivalent of going up one out of that
movie clip into this timeline and edit
home then they land or right there so on
the Edit home frame we have code that
gathers the actually this is the code
that when they press update it sends it
to the control file
in the control file we have well first
let me show you the first set here are
the first five frames that I had from
the original tutorial for these five
buttons in these five pages and you can
go and see that each one has a home
portfolio about me and services in
contact okay so all I added to the code
there was only a stop action on this
frame at the end of that last tutorial
so I added all this code which connects
to the CMS control file and it requests
to see together the the home page text
so we send a request out to that file of
get home text and you see in the control
file so you get gather home page text
send request equals get home text that's
where we connected so the PHP file knows
that that's what the flash file is
requesting so it will only run this
little section of code this section will
not run this and these other sections
will not run either so in the gather the
home page text section we query the
database to get the home body from the
CM CMS content table and then we gather
that in the while loop and then we print
it back to flash the home take a home
page text body and then that what Flash
is sitting here waiting for it to
display it on the home page see this
dynamic text field is home underscore
txt sitting on the home page frame and
it renders that data coming from the
MySQL database so on the own complete
mechanism is where we put it into the
database and I assigned a variable right
here home page text variable it's a
string variable
and that's what we put the data in that
way when they go to edit the homepage we
we can just render that data with the
same query we don't have to query again
to get the data to put it in place for
them to edit it's already there so when
they do edit and by the way this is an
input text field multi-line input text
rendered as HTML and you can see you
have to code it out a little bit
different right here
normally this would say input text dot
text but now it says input text dot HTML
text which you have to assign that to
the text field to get it to render as
HTML or send data as HTML you get it so
to make it render or send as HTML it has
to be selected here and then within the
action script it has to have this
instead of just regular txt it has to
say HTML txt and that's pretty much the
gist of it so when they access when that
data comes in and gets displayed here
from the database that edit button is
sitting right here so when they click
the edit button we run this code and it
updates the the home page data by
sending a request to the control file in
the control file we have update the home
page text that's the next block down you
can see if the send request is update
homepage which it is in flash right here
see then we take what was posted from
flash and we run the MySQL query to
update the table CMS content table with
the
the homebody set with that home new
homepage data and that's pretty much
that and then the files doesn't execute
anything else only that little section
so back in flash when everything's good
we send them back to complete handler
when when the file is updated or the
data is updated my SQL PHP file returns
we say go to and stop home so that way
we don't have to mess around with them
here anymore in the backend we just send
them straight here to the home frame
label see home right there that little
red flag is the home frame label and
then that accesses the new data from the
database and boom shows it that's how
easy it is and here I have the pretty
much the same thing set up with
different code but it's the same type of
code it just has different variable
names same exact code that's running
here to edit the home page edits the
about page too and in the control file
you just have different sections for
each section of the website that you
want to allow the user to update and
manage just create new PHP blocks here
that would that would the scripting
would handle it so like I said it's
slightly advanced you know so I would
only recommend an intermediate users
jump into this if you're a beginner
you're gonna have about a thousand
questions for me and I am not gonna have
the time to answer them so I would say
you know if you're intermediate you can
have an easy time with this if you're a
beginner you're going to struggle
probably a little bit but you know if
you're slick you can wrap your brain
around it it's not that hard and I think
that's everything about the control file
yeah it's pretty simple and the flash
site is set up to render dynamically on
the viewing end and then in the back end
here it's set up to take input and send
to database
and then when they press update it
updates the database sends them back to
that page that they were just updating
so they can view it as a viewer or a
visitor to the site would okay so that
wraps it up and I believe you have
everything you need to understand what's
going on here now and work with it to
expand it into or to implement it or use
it for your client websites and you
might even want to as you build you
might even want to and here actually
I'll show you a cool website that I made
it's a Scott Clark vision and this one
is very cool and this is he can update
the whole site himself and it's a little
more advanced then it's a little more
advanced than the example that I gave
you there but man this thing is cool he
can update all this data see on his
journal page he can also add new entries
and that's a little bit more complex so
as he adds an entry you click one takes
you to another page where all the data
he put in and a picture shows up but
that's a little more complex but the
artist page and a couple of other they a
couple other pages is where he can
update all of this text
and also the links stop the music there
he can put it in link banners I made a
really cool system for him so yeah most
of his website is and here you can see I
made it as proof and then yes so this
website should give you a little
inspiration if you check it out Scott
Clark vision calm and should give you a
little inspiration to understanding what
you can set up like he can even edit his
galleries in the backend so see how they
all just pop in dynamically and he has
power over these if he has more than 12
but it opens new sections look at that
very cool wasn't very nice let's see one
where there's a lot
twenty-eight in that gallery see so what
I do is I each time he puts more as they
go it it gives forward and back buttons
to go through the gallery but this is
all editable by him and you can see it
opens up a nice big view of the picture
and here's all the other pictures in a
gallery this is all PHP and MySQL and
CSS going on here
but on the front end it's uh it's all
flashy pool and he can edit it okay so
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
