in this part we're going to demonstrate
how the range slider input can be used
as a siik slider and a volume slider
we'll also demonstrate how you can
achieve a consistent slider appearance
no matter what browser visitors are
using to view your audio software
because a terrible inconsistency exists
because all browser vendors are jerks
they don't sit down and have a meeting
once a year and decide upon a
standardized look for components because
they're idiots we're going to continue
with the script we left off with at the
end of video number 1 if you happen to
need that script follow me quickly and
we'll go grab it right now you can go to
develop PHP calm and in the videos
JavaScript section I put a new section
in the table of contents for the audio
workshop so you can just click audio
workshop and it will take you to that
section click the first video and here's
the script down on the page now keep in
mind at any point that you want you can
externalize your CSS and externalize
your JavaScript ok so right in between
the play/pause button and the mute
button going to add a range slider you
can see this is an input type of range
that produces the slider component and
we've given it an ID of siik slider it's
minimum value that it could be is 0 its
maximum value that I could be is 100 and
the value that it is by default is 0 the
step is set to 1 to give you a free
smooth flowing slider now right next to
the mute button we're going to add a
volume slider which is pretty much the
same setup except it has a different ID
a volume slider it's minimum value and
maximum value are the same as the seek
slider but it's default starting value
is going to be 100 that means all the
way up because our volume starts at 100%
now if you were to start your volume at
50% you just change this to a 50 now
let's file preview that in chrome now
you see the way the sliders look now
let's file preview that in Internet
Explorer
and that's ridiculous isn't it that's a
ridiculous difference in appearance not
not only for developers is it bad it's
bad for everybody using the Internet
we're going to fix it okay so let's open
up our CSS and just like how we targeted
all the button elements on the page
we're going to target all of the input
elements and for now we'll just make
sure they all have outlined none so we
don't want that ugly blue outline to
appear now let's go and target the two
sliders directly and we're going to give
them different widths
I want the seek slider to be a little
bit wider really that could be any width
that you want so I want my seek slider
just a little bit wider than my volume
slider now finally in the CSS we're
going to add all of the little hacks and
workarounds prefixes that you need to
target various browsers to make it look
the same in all of them and the code I'm
going to apply make sure that it looks
the same in Internet Explorer Firefox
and Chrome any environments beyond those
it's up to you to fix okay
so all of this code right here I just
popped in right there from line 25 all
the way down to 65 and what we're doing
in this rule is we're targeting the
input type range using the standardized
syntax and we're just making sure for
WebKit the appearance is set to none and
then you can go about styling your range
slider now these two rules for targeting
Internet Explorer this helps you style
the track and this one is for Firefox
help you style the track now this is for
the little thumb the little knob this
rule is for WebKit this is the knob rule
for Mozilla Firefox so this is the knob
rule for Microsoft Internet Explorer and
you can play with all of these
properties to make it look exactly the
way you want it to look now let's
preview this in Chrome
okay now I have the slider look that I
want in chrome now file preview and
browser Firefox looks very much the same
you see how similar the slider looks in
Chrome and Firefox that's what you want
to do you want to get a consistent
appearance in any way that you can in
all the different browsers in a year or
two they'll be using standardized syntax
more than likely and all of these little
prefixes will be gone won't need them
any more
so let's also preview that in Internet
Explorer okay it looks pretty much the
same in all three bring up Chrome again
hit Internet Explorer back you can see
Internet Explorer adds a little white
thing around my knob but when I'm
dragging it it looks the same as it does
in Chrome that's no big deal okay let's
go ahead and collapse our CSS or if your
CSS is externalized you don't have to
worry about it because it's not going to
be in your way here anyway all we have
to do is go into our JavaScript and
program these two work which is not very
difficult at all so let's expand our
JavaScript and since we already have the
seekbar
variable all we have to do is add
another one for the volume slider now
let's set object references for the
seekbar
and the volume slider so really you can
just copy this mute button object
reference and make sure you target those
elements by the proper name or their
proper ID rather and then put the ID
there and then the variable name goes
there actually let's change seekbar
variable to seek slider that makes more
sense now you can just copy that one and
do the same thing for volume slider make
sure you get the right ID and put it
here make the same variable name out of
the ID and just make sure it matches
here where we're initializing all of our
variables now we're going to add the
event handling for those two elements so
let's just copy the event handler for
our mute button let's change it
to seek slider add eventlistener let's
just type in code right there for now
we're going to change the event to mouse
down it's when the user Mouse's down on
something now let's just copy that we're
going to add another one and change it
to the mouse move event so any time the
mouse moves code is going to execute now
since we're going to need to target
events we're going to use a function
here where the code goes so you can see
for our mute and play button we just
simply put the name of the function
that's supposed to execute here but for
the seek slider we're going to pass the
event to the function that handles the
listener so we wrap everything in a
function nest and then as an argument
we're passing event and the code that's
set to run in that function of these two
little lines seeking equals true so we
need a variable called seeking up here
so let's put that in seeking initialize
the seeking variable now the seeking
variable is going to toggle in between
true and false and it's part of the
logic that our application needs and
then the next line that happens in that
function is we fire off a function that
we're going to write in just a sec
called
seek and then we pass the event as an
argument to the seek function now for
the code part of the mousemove event
it's going to be this very similar thing
we're going to wrap everything in a
function nest and the only line that
runs in that function nest is seek
instructor seek function to execute
anytime the mouse moves every time the
mouse moves even just a little bit over
the seek slider so all we have to do is
put this function seek into place now
before we do that let's add the event
listener for our volume slider and
that's going to be mouse move as well
and we're just going to execute the set
volume function that we're going to
write right now and since we don't have
to pass any event as an argument through
it we can just put the function name
there all right
now let's go down to our functions and
right after the mute function right here
if you want to put little comment lines
in between all of your functions and
maybe a little note to yourself you can
do that just to separate them all okay
so when the mouse moves anytime the
mouse moves over the volume slider the
set volume function needs to execute so
let's put that into place here function
set volume and there's only one line
needed what you do is you take the audio
dot volume property and you change it
make it equal to the volume sliders dot
value divided by 100 so as the users
sliding the volume slider around you
take whatever value that is you're
divided by 100 and that will properly
set the audio volume now let's give this
a test in our favorite modern browser
beautiful so as they drag or as they
pack they can just tap it anywhere in
the bar or anywhere along the track all
right so right above the set volume
function will add the seek function now
this will operate the seek slider let's
pop that into place so we have function
seek and remember we're taking in that
event that we were passing through
initially as an argument now we pass
event as an argument that way we can
access whatever the element was that's
making the event occur and the code
within the seek function is very simple
we first put an if condition to see if
the seeking variable that we set into
place up here is equal to true you can
see when the user Mouse's down on the
seek slider we set seeking to true that
means only when they mouse down seeking
is going to be true that means only when
their mouse is down and they're dragging
are we going to make it actually change
the tracks position because if their
mouse isn't down and their mouse moving
over the slider you don't want it to
change the tracks position only if
they're dragging it and they have their
mouse down so that's why we put this if
condition in place if seeking is true
and only if seeking is true
then we're going to take the Sikhs
sliders position and I'm going to
explain this code in just a second but
before we explain these three lines I'm
going to add one more event listener to
the Sikhs slider and this is what
changes seeking from true back to false
so we have a new event listener for
mouse up then we simply change seeking
to false now let's explain those three
lines very quickly what we're doing here
is we're changing the Sikh sliders value
we're making the sliders value equal to
wherever the users Mouse's over the
slider and we do that by saying event
that client X that means where the users
mouse cursor is or their mouse pointer
and we subtract the seat slider offset
left position that way we get the exact
position of where their the mouse is
over the seek slider so basically you're
just making the seat slider knob value
where the knob is where that little
thumb knob is in the track you're making
it equal to where the user's mouse is
over the track that's what that line
does then we create a variable called
seek to which this could be actually
since we don't want to assign any
variables in our functions let's remove
that bar let's take this seek to and
let's also make this one of the
variables that we initialize for our
program that way we don't need any bar
nothing we won't be creating any bars
within our functions we're just going to
be changing a variable okay so we say
seek two variable is equal to the audio
duration property multiplied by the seek
sliders value divided by 100 so the part
in the song or the audio track that
you're going to seek two is the full
audio duration times the seek slider
value divided by a hundred then finally
after we figure that up we can change
the audio current time property to the
new seek to position now let's make sure
our seek slider works
okay turn the volume down a little now
as I click on the track it should change
the tracks position go back to the
beginning by clicking now let's drag in
there okay so I'm going to go ahead and
collapse up all of my JavaScript so it's
not in my way and we'll continue on in
video number three and video number
three we'll add the time display and
we'll also make sure that the time
update process makes our little sikhs
lider knob follow the position of the
track as the current play time changes
so you have to make the little knob on
the seat slider actually move by itself
according to where the track is so
that's what we'll take care of in part
three and maybe we'll throw in some
other stuff in that part as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
