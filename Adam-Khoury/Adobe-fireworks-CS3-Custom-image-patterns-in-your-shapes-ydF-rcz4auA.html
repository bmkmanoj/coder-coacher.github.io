demonstrating how to get custom image
patterns into your custom shapes and
fireworks so what I'm going to do is
pull out a few shapes let's pull out a
arrow and arrow and let's pull out a
star and I could have very well easily
pulled out any of those let's see let's
make a custom shape now let's take the
pen tool say you're making a header for
a website or something
it's got
maybe a curve right here
oops well actually I'll show you another
trick you can take a rectangle and put
it over a shape another shape and
highlight both shapes at the same time
and press modify combine paths and punch
and the one shape will act as a punch
out so let's see what we have here we
have three shapes one is custom to our
stock and we'll take the first custom
one and we're going to go down to fill
options actually let me try this down so
you as you can see okay we're gonna go
down to pattern and if you keep these
might come out of you but if you go
under wood 3 you'll see other click
other and it'll let you browse your
computer and then you just pick the
picture you want to put and what it'll
do is lay the picture in there and it's
full size so you just resize it to get
it or it's not so who hmong go in there
and then move it by pressing the dot and
dragging it and you can put that
wherever you want now let's get it just
the right size so it's not too big so
you can see how I'm working the image
I'm holding shift as I resize it so that
way it resizes the height and the width
at the same time and the aspect ratio
won't get whack oh let's see
right about there
okay so you see how I lay the custom
image in there and sort of like what
masking does in flash but it just lays
the image in there and the borders still
stay you can see I have a thick gray
border around it you can do the same
thing same thing to these stock images
or these stock shapes or the pattern and
you can put all kinds of patterns in
there and then down in pattern you just
go all the way down to other and that's
where you can find your pictures browse
your computer grab a picture and it
loads it right in and if you want to put
one with people let's see if we can put
a cute little face in that one in the
star let's see
resize them remember to hold shift so
that the aspect ratio doesn't get
whacked out and then you can position
that where the image is in the symbol in
the shape by moving the stop and you can
see I put a face right in there and this
one same thing resize it move it to
where it looks right in there and that's
it and that's how you put custom imagery
into your custom shapes or stock shapes
within fireworks cs3 we'll see you next
