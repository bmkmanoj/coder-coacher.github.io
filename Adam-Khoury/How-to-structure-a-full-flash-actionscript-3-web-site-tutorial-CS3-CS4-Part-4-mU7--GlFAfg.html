full flash site structure and
ActionScript 3 and we've been talking
about how to make a full site in flash
with the menu system and page system
page movie clips and menu movie clip
that will navigate through your full
flash file and just want to mention to
you guys real quick that you see I use
the tutorial file for the animated
button symbols and you could use the
drop-down menu same thing because it's a
movie clip itself just like the button
menu and we're going to it's going to be
scripted in a similar way okay so now
we're making the services movie clip so
let's just go ahead and go into the
library and where's that about page
let's go ahead and right click duplicate
that one also and we're going to call
this one the videos call the videos
press ok and we got to make one more so
we have four buttons there for pages in
our site this is a really small site and
let's go back to about right click
duplicate and then let's call this one
contact that'll be a Contact Us page and
we'll press ok
and also keep in mind that mp3 players
can be laid in here and if you want an
mp3 song to play on your while there
people are perusing your site you would
just put it in this timeline here where
your background your button menu movie
clip is and your logo and header maybe
put it up there in your header and you
can go to our tutorial for full screen
flash site put the full screen button
right there make your site full screen
okay let's go back into our pages movie
clip and finish up okay so on the
services section we're going to put a
keyframe there and there will be the
contents of the about Us page there and
we can just swap that out because that's
what we want now we go to swap and we're
going to call this or swap it out for
the witch one videos page so this isn't
going to be services this is going to be
videos forget services we don't have any
services or do we have these videos okay
so we have the videos page set up here
and here's the videos clip and it should
say videos down there in the instance
identifier now you can go in and safely
since we swapped it out safely change
everything up inside of it welcome to my
video page actually we're not even going
to leave this text here because I'm
going to go to develop PHP and download
the
video playlist layer tutorial and aren't
you guys glad that I put everything I
nest everything into movie clips when I
make it that way you can just go to the
file open it when you download this
tutorial highlight that on the main
scene there highlight everything press
ctrl C and go into the new site and here
we are inside of our video page movie
clip let's pop this bad boy in and you
can see it's too big for my site but
that's okay I don't care your site
wouldn't be this small so it would fit
in just nice but I'm just showing you an
example of how you can throw anything
you want into these pages movie clips
you know what I'm saying scrollers mp3
players movie players you name it image
galleries whatever you want contact
forms so let's just go ahead and get rid
of that one and let's bring that text
back I was just doing that sharing
example okay welcome to my video page
but if I left that thing there my site
was big enough to hold it it would play
the videos okay so now we have a videos
page let's go out of that one make our
press f6 create motion tween by right
clicking the center and select create
motion tween and now we're going to put
our stop action probably pressing f6 f9
and then type it in the stop action okay
now we have a one more two goals will
put a label here and call this contact
because this is going to be our contact
page and then
bring that one out let's put a keyframe
right there by pressing f6 then press f9
and let's type in our final stop action
and if you had eight pages you just keep
going on and on 15 pages keep going on
and on and on eight million pages just
keep going on and on and on down through
there okay so we'll give this a keyframe
this content there is a video page make
sure you swap it for the one that says
contact contact now we can go ahead and
tween it create motion tween and now we
can go inside of the contact movie clip
and just write contact us
now
welcome to my contact page
okay that's it now we have all four and
let's make sure we have our alphas set
directly to where they all fade in and
they have a little transition effect and
there are bunches and bunches of
transitions that you can figure out to
do inside of here you can have screens
that come in and out you can have little
circles that would fade out of the way
to bring in your content little squares
masking all kind of cool techniques you
can use for transitions but this one is
pretty cool because it's just a fading
in fading out and it makes for a nice
clean quick smooth page transition for
this demonstration okay so let's get rid
of all these frames since we don't need
them the file won't be going past that
so let's remove frames highlight remove
frames and now that's it the inside of
our contact this movie clip is done or
the pages movie clip is done so let's
see on the videos page let's go ahead
and add a movie clip to that oops the
videos page make sure we highlight that
go into the movie clip that is the video
movie clip the video page movie clip
let's bring our digital clock tutorial
oh maybe not digital clock let's see
what else we have here alright but you
guys get the idea you can put whatever
you want in there so that's it for that
I do believe
and if you wanted your background to be
different colors on each page here
here's our background layer you would
just make keyframes there and make it
red make you frame here make it blue
that way when it gets to that spot it
changes to that color but that would be
kind of cheesy but I was just saying for
demonstration purposes you know just so
you can get in there an experiment with
all kind of stuff you know all right so
now we double click out of that by
double clicking on the blank space here
and now you'll be in the timeline that
is the logo and header pages button menu
and background now the button menu layer
is where our buttons are so let's go
ahead and go inside of first before we
do that let's take our pages movie clip
and give it an instance name of all
pages now it has an instance name so now
we can talk to it with actionscript and
control it so we'll go inside of the
button menu now by double-clicking this
movie clip and now we will continue the
the rest and final part of the tutorial
in part four and we'll coat the buttons
and show you how to go inside that page
is movie clip using this button menu
that's in its own separate movie clip
and we'll have them talking back and
forth okay we'll see the next lesson the
final one number four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
