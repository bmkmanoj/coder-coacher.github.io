will be your instructor in this video
lesson in this programming tutorial you
can learn how to create a basic
countdown timer application in
JavaScript this is for creating a short
timer that will run your specified
script when your timer reaches zero
first let's take a look at the finished
product of what you will be learning how
to script in this video lesson till you
see this see the countdown you're
watching okay so when the countdown gets
to zero it updates the page elements to
do really whatever you want you can
update page elements in any way you like
okay here I am oh a HTML page and I'm
going to start off with opening up a
script element I'm going to make sure I
close that script element off and
underneath that I'm going to create a
div element and I'm going to give it an
ID of status because this is the element
that I want to update when the timer has
reached zero now underneath our div
element that we want to effect we're
going to put in another script element
into the HTML page we can actually just
close that one off right here within
that script element we're going to call
a function to run that we haven't yet
created but we're going to create it in
just a few minutes the functions name is
going to be count down and we're going
to send it two parameters the first
parameter is going to be how many
seconds we want to count down from so if
you want to count down from 30 seconds
you put 30 I'm going to count down from
10 seconds then put a comma and my next
parameter for this function is going to
be the element that I want to affect
that's going to be status so I'm going
to put in double quotes the word status
right there the identifier with this div
element right here so what we're doing
is after our div element on our page
we're calling a function to run called
countdown we're feeding it two
parameters the first one being how many
seconds we want to count down from and
the second parameter is the element on
the page that we want to target to
affect so basically right when your page
loads initially right when it loads when
it hits this line right here this
function called countdown is going to
fire off now
all we have to do in the JavaScript is
put that function count down so we'll
type in function space count down open
closed parentheses open your curly brace
and go down a couple of lines and close
off your curly brace to make a nice
function nest now we have two intake two
parameters remember we're in taking the
seconds and the element that we want to
affect seconds and element so we can
actually make those names make a lot of
sense for the variables that are going
to be fed in as parameters we'll call
this one sex put in a comma and we'll
call the next one LM LM is short for
element that way these variables these
dynamic variables will make good sense
to us within our function code now we're
going to create a new variable that's
going to represent the element that we
want to target on the page to alter
while the countdown is running and when
the countdown gets finished so while the
countdown is running we're going to
target the status element to show the
second says they're counting down and
we're also going to target this status
element to show new HTML content when
the countdown is finished enabling
people to go forward or whatever so we
say var element which is the name of our
variable is equal to document get
element by ID LM and you know LM is a
dynamic variable here that's coming in
as a parameter and it's equal to status
so we just made that dynamic so you guys
can target any element that you like
through the function dynamically and you
feed in how many seconds you want your
timer to count down from dynamically
through the function so basically with
this variable created instead of writing
document dot get element by ID
LM every time we need to refer to this
item we can just pack it into a little
variable and just use element dot
whatever and access its properties that
way so now let's access one of its
properties element inner HTML property
is equal to please wait for sex seconds
so this dynamic sex variable so if
you're paying attention you would know
exactly what sex is going to render when
this function runs it's going to render
a ten because that's the dynamic
variable that's fed in is the first
parameter right here as sex so when this
function runs this is going to say
within this div IDs inner HTML it's
going to say please wait for 10 SEC's
now what we have to do is put a timer in
place to D Cremant not increment we're
going to decrement this 10 seconds
number to go from 10 all the way to zero
and when it gets to zero then we know
our timer is done
so that's the basic simple logic
actually here let me just run the page
and you'll see it see it says please
wait for 10 seconds it's not doing
anything not counting down nothing yet
now since we're going to run this
function over and over once per second
we're going to want to decrement the sex
variable so after it renders into the
HTML element please wait for 10 seconds
the next time this function runs we want
it to say please wait for nine seconds
eight seconds seven six and so on and so
forth all the way till it gets to zero
so easy way to do that is just decrement
the sex variable each time the function
runs that way it changes from a ten to
nine to eight so on and so forth and
this line right here does that now you
have to have a way to make the function
run once every second and you can easily
do that with a timer and here's your
timer you can just make a variable name
it whatever you like and call the set
timeout method to run a set timeout
takes on two parameters the first
parameter is the function that you want
to run every interval that the timer is
set for and you can see our second
parameter is the timer interval which is
1000 milliseconds which equals one
second so if you wanted a timer to run
once every half a second you can just
put this at 500
so that would run every half a second
but since I want this timer to run once
a second I'm going to make it 1,000
milliseconds as my second parameter for
the set timeout and the first parameter
like I said is the function that you
want to run you want to execute
at every interval of the timer you can
see we're feeding in the necessary two
parameters remember when we started the
countdown function we gave it two
parameters number 10 and the element
that we want to affect so we have to
keep those numbers being fed into the
countdown function in order for this
decrement ation or whatever you call it
the subtraction of the numbers to keep
track of those so we're going to keep
track of the subtraction of the numbers
every time the function runs by sending
it back through the function and it gets
picked up right here again Z so when it
becomes 9 after it decrements right here
that's going to be sent back to the
function as a 9 so it won't be 10
anymore it's going to be 9 and elements
always going to stay the same
now the scripts not complete yet but you
can take a look at the functionality of
what's going on so far you'll just see
it goes into negative numbers the watch
when we get down to 0 it's going to
start just going into negative numbers
and it'll keep going on forever see now
you don't want that to happen when it
gets down to 0 after it hits 1 and then
it gets down to 0 you want to make some
kind of script or functionality happen
on your page and then you want to stop
the timer so that's what we'll do now ok
now we'll put in the last little bit of
condition logic that's going to allow us
to listen for if that sex variable
happens to get less than 1 if it becomes
less than 1 we want to stop the timer
and then alter some elements on the page
or do something within JavaScript to our
document so here's the last little bit
of code for that you can see it's an if
condition statement and it says if sex
is less than 1 so every time this
function runs remember it starts at 10
sex starts at 10 so after it runs 10
times this is going to be down to a zero
so when sex gets down to a zero and then
this if condition evaluates it it's
going to see that sex is less than 1 so
at that point when it's zero this if
condition is going to pick it up and
it's going to clear time out
which is the method you can run with the
timer mechanism and you put the name of
your timer the variable name of your
timer within the parameter for the
cleartimeout that will stop this line
right here stops your timer from running
then you can just update the innerhtml
of the element which in this case was
the div ID of status now here we're
going to update that element to say
countdown complete wrapped in an h2 tag
and then we can append some more data
using plus equals we can append two more
innerhtml to show up under that h2
element that'll be just a simple link to
go wherever you want or you can put a
button a form whatever you want to put
HTML wise in there you can put in okay
so let's see what we got now let's run
it and when it gets down to one after
the one it's going to be at zero so it's
going to change to one boom
that's how it works the timer stopped
and you show your updated HTML your
updated div elements buttons or whatever
you're updating on the page after the
timer gets done or you can navigate them
to another page using window dot
location then you can locate them
anywhere you want on the web after your
timer gets done okay so we hope you have
enjoyed that lesson and if you guys have
any questions or comments feel free to
put them in I read all the comments I
get at YouTube so if you want to give me
some feedback and you want to know that
I'll get it I'll read your comment that
you put in especially if it's the first
few days after I upload the video I'll
definitely read the comment that you put
in so if you want to see maybe some
further code along these lines or you
have any questions that are stopping you
from creating your application let us
know and myself or somebody some other
viewer of this material we have a lot of
knowledgeable viewers some other viewer
the material might be able to help you
out if I can't get to it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
