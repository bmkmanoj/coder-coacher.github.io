perform animated typing text using
JavaScript for an HTML page scenario
without using flash this royal custom
JavaScript function we created to mimic
the flash actionscript 3.0 animated
typing text tutorial is very similar in
structure syntax and logic program is
becoming more and more universal
throughout all technologies and is very
nice to see that some common
relationships exist that we can adapt
from one technology to the next okay so
here is the flash tutorial that we're
going to be working against that I just
put out on YouTube yesterday and you can
click here to see it now if you want and
the user and the person on YouTube that
requested to see this in JavaScript is
win freak and what they stated was do
you think you could show us on how to do
this using Ajax or jQuery and I think he
just meant using JavaScript because you
don't need Ajax and you don't need
jQuery I mean you could use Ajax and
jQuery but it's almost overkill for this
because jQuery all jQuery is just raw
JavaScript so I'm going to show you
using raw JavaScript how to produce the
typing text animation that way you won't
have to implement jQuery if you're not
using it already but if you're using
jQuery already you want to do something
like this using jQuery feel free but
it's really overkill and you don't need
to use jQuery because all jQuery is is
JavaScript and I'm going to show you the
JavaScript method and what Ajax is is
just a way to call external data from
the server into your script so if you
want to have all of this data come
typing in maybe come out of a MySQL
database or something like that then you
would implement Ajax
but otherwise you don't need Ajax and
you really don't need jQuery which you
can use raw JavaScript you guys are
going to see some really striking
similarities between JavaScript and
actionscript 3.0 I'm going to bridge the
gap between the two from a logic
standpoint okay first thing we'll do is
create a new HTML page
and I'm going to get rid of all this so
we have our HTML tag open and closes
within it there's a head tag and the
body tag in the body tag I'm going to
place a new div with an ID equal to my
typing text I'm just going to close that
div now underneath this div in the body
tag I'm going to put in a script tag
because if I'm going to use JavaScript
here this is where I want to apply it
for this kind of scenario so you can
kind of think of this div as our text
field that we had in flash remember that
TF text field that we had on stage
dynamic text field you can think of this
div as a text field it's just going to
be the container where we're throwing
text into we're going to animate text
into that container using javascript so
let's open the script tag and let's
close the script tag off now inside of
it we can place JavaScript now let's
look at the flash the first thing we
create was a variable called my string
so let's do the same thing in JavaScript
var my string is equal to place your
string data here and as much as you like
alright so back in our flash application
we have a string in ActionScript and we
set a string in a JavaScript now now
what we did was we created an array out
of that string being split so we use
split on that string and it becomes an
array at that point holding each
character because we split it by the
character so let's go into JavaScript
the next line down bar my array is equal
to my string dot split it's pretty much
the same code almost so now in
JavaScript you've taken that string and
you've busted it down into an array
holding each one of these characters
within this string so the first element
in the array is the capital P second
element is the L and so on and so forth
in this array now in this next line down
we're going to create a timer or
initialize a variable for our timer that
we will create because in the flash
ActionScript 3 file we're using an inter
frame event
function which is a way to loop make
something happen many many times over a
time period it's the same thing we're
going to do in JavaScript but we can't
use an inter frame event in JavaScript
because JavaScript just doesn't have an
inter frame event but it has a similar
type thing to let you do the same type
of thing but you can do it in a browser
on an HTML page and it made things any
kind of way you want just like you can
in ActionScript so here we're going to
type in a function called frame looper
make sure we close that function nest so
here we have a function net setup called
frame looper now within that frame
looper function we want to have a set
timeout function running which is your
mechanism to have pretty much like your
enter frame event in flash this will
make it loop your set timeout function
will make it loop because we're because
within this set timeout function we're
giving it two parameters the first
parameters B being the name of this
frame looper function the second
parameter is the time interval so if you
wanted to type slower you make this
number bigger you want it to type faster
you make this number smaller and the
reason why frame looper function and
it's some kind of crazy monkey outside
my door so actually that variable we
initialized here let's call it loop
timer there so within frame looper this
is basically how you make an inter frame
event in JavaScript now I haven't
executed any code within this function
yet but now this function is set up to
loop on itself using a time interval
here that I establish now watch how
similar this is you're going to bug out
or you see this if-else condition
statement I just popped in there it's a
very similar to this if else condition
statement here in flash remember in
flash we said if my array that length is
greater than 0 if and only then do we
shift the array to pop off whatever's in
the in the front of the array one by one
else we don't do anything because once
the array length gets down to zero we
want to shift anymore because we'll get
errors and we want to make sure we
remove the eventlistener which is the
looping mechanism same thing in
JavaScript man if my array length is
greater than zero then you use document
that get element by ID to target my
typing text div and you use the inner
HTML property to place a value into that
div and you use plus equal to append to
it if you would have just an equal sign
there you'll just get one character at a
time overwriting whatever character was
placed in before you put plus equal it
will append and see here my array dot
shift it's the same thing we're doing in
the flash so if you saw that flash
tutorial you know we're doing the exact
same thing and using almost the exact
same code look at that my array that
ship JavaScript my array dot shift and
we're doing the same kind of mechanism
with the if and else condition condition
statement here if my array dot length is
greater than zero then and only then do
we pop off the leading element in the
array and place it into that div using
my array night-shift else if the array
length gets to zero and there's no more
items in your array everything has been
printed then you want to use
cleartimeout instead of removing the
event listener in flash you clear
timeout which is this loop timer and you
put that in the parameter for that
function
you put loop timer in the parameter for
that cleartimeout function that removes
the set timeout that way things won't
bog down your page unnecessarily when
things are finished typing and that's it
look how lean that is that's pretty lean
so let's save this file
I'll save as put it on my desktop call
it test save okay so now before your
script tag closes all you have to do is
type in frame looper and all this does
is it initiates or it makes this
function frame looper start up for the
first time it's almost like starting the
engine for it this line right here will
make sure that this function starts up
once
does startup it uses set timeout to loop
on itself to animate things that's
simple just like we did in ActionScript
3 ctrl s to save it press f12 and see
what we have and you can see it's typing
there really nice now what you can do is
I have some CSS here that I'm going to
pop in for you just as an example in the
head section you see how this div that
we have we're putting text into
magically is called ID my typing text
you can use that ID in your CSS here I'm
going to put it right here on line 3
ready boom so here is your style for
that my typing text you can style it any
way you want using CSS if you know CSS
you can go crazy with it if you don't
know CSS you better get to learn in it
now let's press f12 there you go it can
be a box as big as you like the color of
the text can be any color you want as
big as you want any font you want
whatever and that's all HTML and CSS
we're using JavaScript for the animation
that's it there's not much to it and
I'll have this script available at
develop PHP at develop PHP I have a
learn JavaScript section where and let's
see I have also a JavaScript video
tutorial section that's where I'm going
to put this code so this video tutorial
you're watching right now is going to
wind up right here in this list and the
script that you see me produce here is
going to be on the page with that video
tutorial so you can get at the code if
you like so I'll see you later man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
