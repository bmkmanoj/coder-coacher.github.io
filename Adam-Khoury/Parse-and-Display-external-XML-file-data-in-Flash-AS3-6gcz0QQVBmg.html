demonstrate how you can connect to an
external XML file whether it be on the
web or on your local machine this works
locally on your Windows or Mac and you
connect to the XML file and let's show
you the XML file well first let me
mention that all the files are gonna be
free for download the Fla the XML and
everything you'll need a little download
package on the page where this tutorial
is it develop PHP comm and let's go
ahead and show you the XML file ok so
when you download the package you open
up your XML file you're gonna see that
there's four item labels well there's
four menu items in the menu list tag in
the XML file and each menu item tag
there's two different tags one is item
label one is item phone and item label
is just the person's name an item phone
is their their particular phone number
and you can see that there's four people
and four phone numbers and what I show
you how to do in flash is render the
render it out you'll see there's nothing
in the library here so what happens is
XML is rendered out magically through
programming in ActionScript 3 according
to what's in that XML file if in this
XML file if there were nine names or
nine menu items that's how many boxes
would get printed out in flash okay so
the the ActionScript if you hit f9 you
go into your actions panel we're doing a
for loop and the for loop is a dynamic
loop setup for making your code more
compact easier to manage and simplifying
things if you can work with a loop when
you're rendering things out it just
makes things helpful
helps simplify code so you can see in
the code when you download your files
and look at it you'll see that I have
comments above all the lines where I
thought that I should mention something
to you and if you have any problems with
this code or if you have any questions
about it you can join the forum at
develop a comm and post up questions and
we'll get your answers or we'll try to
but yeah you can see the loop happens
right here the for each loop is about
midway in the script and or it begins
about midway in the script there and
everything in that for loop that for
each loop is it's going to be rendered
out to the stage however many XML items
urn menu items are in our XML list and
so let's go ahead and publish it
there it is so you can see what it does
is publishes when it publishes out but
when it's working on the web it'll set
boxes and inside each box in each box
I made into a movie clip and inside of
each movie clip box there it gets the
name label and the phone number label
and that's pretty much a really general
basic example and demonstration of how
you can get at individual XML nodes and
render them out in a loop it actually
doesn't have to be a loop if your XML
was written up differently you could
access each individual one if you wanted
but since we have four menu items and
things are pretty similar throughout the
menu items then we can loop through it
and display it and I think that's pretty
much it let's see if I have to mention
anything else here yeah there's there's
a lot going on in this loop and
rendering everything out so like I said
if you have any problems you can't
understand the code or have trouble
manipulating it you want to expand it
maybe we can get your help in our forums
develop PHP and that's pretty much it
you can get these files for free at the
download link right under where the the
tutorial is and we hope you find this
one useful we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
