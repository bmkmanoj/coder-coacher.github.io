we're going to demonstrate how to use
flash bars in actionscript 3 and this is
going to be in the form of an Fla file
that you can download from develop PHP
calm and we do this just because on
YouTube you can't see code real well
unless the tutorial list makes his font
pixel 24 pixels and higher which is just
way too big in the actions panel it's
kind of retarded so I enjoy you know
just showcasing the file here on YouTube
showing you what it's capable of doing
and then you can just go and get the
whole thing free the source code I give
you know sometimes a lot of people on
YouTube contact me and say my tutorials
aren't showing the full tutorial or it's
not doing anything for them I really
don't care because I know that the smart
people who understand what I'm doing
here they go to my site and get the Fla
file and then they become more
knowledgeable than flash and you can
just shut the hell up okay so I'm gonna
showcase this file and I'm not gonna I'm
not going to give you the ActionScript
on YouTube you're not going to be able
to see this you idiot you got to go and
get the Fla file okay so anybody who
thinks that this total isn't tutorial
video isn't doing anything for them you
are a freaking moron okay just go to my
site and get the Fla file then you got
the tutorial dumbass okay so let's
continue I'm sorry people on YouTube
really burn my ass up okay so okay
here's the code you go to develop PHP
you download this Fla file to get the
code and it's actionscript-3 code for
pulling in a flash bar and let's show
you the this is the PHP file now what
happens is when you publish out in flash
it makes an HTML file correct okay in
that HTML file you'll see
that you have your a CFL run content
JavaScript going on here with the no
script embed code and what you do is you
turn this file into a PHP file so
instead of being dot HTML it becomes dot
PHP so it's very simple to take that
vile and just rename its extension dot
PHP and then you can write PHP into it
and you can see up top here I wrote some
PHP into the file and it's getting the
users IP address and I'm going to have
this file also in the package in the zip
file so you can get to all the source
but I'm just explaining it here and then
what you have is flash bar parameter
being sent in here in the a CFL run
content section right under where the
source file is set to the source name
you put flash bars right there and you
can see I'm printing in the IP using PHP
printing in the user IP address using
PHP right there so it's name value pairs
you said then with the flash bar there
and then you put a parameter here where
you have all your other parameters like
quality movie allow full screen and all
that you put one more in there call
flash bars and you do the value pair in
there and then in the embed string down
here you also put it in after the source
you put in flash bars equals item ID
equals IP and you printed in using PHP
so PHP is printing a variable into it's
a URL encoded variable into the flash
file then once you get into flash
let's see i'll show you at the site or
at the test area and i'll go to the page
where this is online so it can be
working this won't work on your local
environment you have to be on a server
that processes PHP so if your local
environment your windows or your Mac
machine does process PHP this will work
so you can see I have it up on the web
now and it says your IP sent in from PHP
is and there's my IP address and let's
see let me just publish out so you can
see it you see if you publish out and
you're just on your machine you won't
even see a line there so it has to be on
the web or on a server the process is
PHP so that's how you use flash bars and
implement it into the HTML file and to
get the variable into flash so flash
doesn't have to send a request out it
just grabs it and right when flash is
loaded it grabs it straight off of the
root the root timeline so if you have
any questions about this you can head
them to the forum and ask away and I'll
get you an answer or I'll try two or one
of the other members there will ok we'll
see you guys next lesson and sorry for
beef and about YouTube but</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
