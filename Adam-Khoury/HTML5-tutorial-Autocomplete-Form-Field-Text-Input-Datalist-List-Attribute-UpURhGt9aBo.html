demonstrate how to use the list
attribute of a form input tag to
associate a data list to it this will
give your form input field an
autocomplete feature that is powered by
a data list tag your data list can also
be made dynamic in which Ajax and PHP
quickly access your database of
information to render a dynamic
autocomplete feature just like Google
search bar does here's the finished
product of what we will achieve in the
lesson autocomplete feature for a input
field using a data list that we
designate let's begin with the basic
HTML 5 web page structure and build our
autocomplete data list so the first
thing we'll do is go into this little
heading right here and I'll type in the
word search colon I'll go one line down
and I'm going to open up an input tag
I'm going to make the type text the name
attribute let's give it a name of s R or
CH throw up a search and then ID is
equal to SRC H as well short for search
and we can close off this tag now that's
traditionally how we would set up a text
type input tag but this one we want to
associate a list to it so we're going to
add a new attribute list is equal to
let's call it data list 1 now that's all
you have to do to your input field to
associate a data list to it but now you
have to put in your data list and this
will be a tag that's not seen on the
page but it will be just a data object
that is tied to this input field right
here
ok so let's pop in the data tag and you
can see I have pre-populated options in
it ready to go so all you have to do is
set up a data list tag like this opening
and closing tag you give it the ID of
data list 1 make sure it has the same ID
as your list attribute here and then you
pop in all of the options that you want
for auto completion I'm using countries
here just as an example but you would
have maybe
dynamic data being coming in from your
database populating these options here
through JavaScript using Ajax and PHP
that's how I would use this thing anyway
I would use it in a dynamic sense and
really having it set up static like this
might serve some purposes for you but I
think to have a dynamic search input
field that autocompletes you would have
to tap into your database use Ajax in
PHP to quickly repopulate these options
while people are typing that's a very
tricky process you got to get good at
JavaScript to do something like that and
also you got to be good at PHP and MySQL
to communicate all that data back and
forth you got to be good at JavaScript
for the Ajax you got to be good at PHP
to talk to your MySQL database in MySQL
database gives the data to PHP PHP has
to send it back to Ajax and this all
happens in a split second okay now press
control s go to file preview in browser
and make sure you preview it in Opera or
another browser that you know supports
the html5 data list and list attributes
so you can see right when I focus my
cursor into the field I get all the
options from the from the data list but
if I start typing in a you I'm only
going to get the things in the data list
that are associated with you so on and
so forth it's just like Google search
bar works or Yahoo search bar or other
search engines and websites and things
like that but they're using a more
complexly coded form of JavaScript to
accomplish it with Ajax I doubt they're
using the html5 feature yet what the
html5 feature does it strives to make
that autocomplete field feature more
easy to program for everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
