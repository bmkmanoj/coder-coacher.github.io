calm here once again with another PHP
and MySQL programming lesson in this one
we're going to demonstrate how to render
out dynamic grid layouts and this is a
normal loop output here where everything
comes out linear now using a little bit
of conditional logic and a little bit of
math we can render out a grid layout
which will give you as many rows and
cells in those rows as you like so once
it gets to a certain target number in
this case 3 we tell the script to break
line and make a new table row okay today
we're working in notepad plus plus as
our HTML text editor and you'll notice I
have a new file called grid example dot
PHP setup here and it's blank I just
created it and here's where we're going
to set up our example and I'll use my
online server to access my actual
database at develop PHP comm to show you
how it works
so let's first put in our HTML and body
tags like we would normally start a web
page then inside of that I'm going to
put an h3 tag I'll allow my text to be a
little bigger I'm going to type in
dynamic dynamic PHP grid layout from a
MySQL result set close that tag off ok
now under that I'm going to echo out the
PHP so we're going to assemble in a
little script that we're going to put
above that HTML tag on top so let's just
echo out a variable we're going to build
cold dynamic table so let's call it for
short dy n ta ble close off the PHP
block and there you go now right above
this HTML tag we're going to put another
PHP block let's get rid of that echo
statement and now we have a PHP
scripting block ready to go we're going
to access our database here I'm going to
connect to the MySQL database make a
little tiny query and then show you how
to do a grid layout from that query now
I'm going to pop in to line 2 there a
little bit of code it's going to access
my database and it's also going to run a
MySQL query and start a variable output
this is my output variable see that
variable called dynamic table there
that's the one that gets echoed out in
HTML that we just set up so let's
explain this code to you real quick
actually I'll just type in comments
above it and I'll have this script
available at develop PHP calm for people
to copy and paste if you want to get at
the actual working code that I produce
here but being is you can view this on
full screen on YouTube or wherever
you're watching it and it's crystal
clear and high definition you should be
able to just type it out because I might
not get the code up for a couple days
but I'll have the link in the video's
description when I do get the code up
alright here include
database connection file that's what the
line under this little code comment is
doing or you can just put in your
database connection lines right there
but I prefer to use one central connect
to my SQL file that I just include into
any files that I'm going to use queries
in now this next line is the SQL query
to interact with information from our
database this next line we're setting up
establish the output variable and we
started with the beginnings of the table
so you can see the table starting tag
here that's how we establish the output
variable and you'll notice that this
dynamic table variable it gets appended
to or compounded it gets added to as the
script goes and you'll see the last
little bit of code that gets put into
that dynamic table variable is the
closing row and the closing table tag
you see that little dot there that dot
on that operator makes it compound or
append to an existing set of information
or string data within an established
variable if we didn't have that dot
there this table the starting tag would
get overwritten it wouldn't even display
inside the variable so if we didn't have
these dots here the only thing this
variable when the script runs would
contain would be just this closing table
row tag and this closing table tag so
you got to put that dot there that dot
signifies appending to or compounding
adding to a variable you can see there's
no doubt on this one up here because
that's where its first established and I
use this method some people will put
echo right here on all these lines and
place the script right down inside the
HTML here but I prefer to assemble my
scripting above my HTML gather all my
information and then echo it out in one
little variable in the HTML section just
to keep my pages more organized but you
very well could just take this whole
little PHP block here and throw it right
down there in your HTML
okay what we have here is a while loop
where all the information that's in the
array coming from this query will get
output or we can access it so what I'm
doing is accessing it to compound into
this variable for my little layout and
I'm gathering the ID field and the
member name field so you can see up in
the Select query it's setting select ID
member name from member table this is my
table name in the database order by ID
field descending limit to 15 your limit
could be whatever you want so from that
query we'll have an array of information
that we'll get output within this while
loop
you may have a for loop where you're
accessing data within an array and the
grid layout will still work in that
circumstance but basically within the
loop where you accessing the data or
where you have the ability to handle the
data is where you would put your grid
layout logic you can see in this one
it's rendering out a table row for each
person that's selected within this query
for all 15 so let's run this script and
I'll show you how it has a linear layout
and then I'll show you a few lines you
can add to make your grid layout okay so
I put that script up on my server and
you can see the output that it renders
15 items come out of the database now
let's say if I want to take these 15
results and I want it to be a three by
five grid instead of it being 15 rows
high I want it to be five rows high and
three columns across all right so using
just a few lines of code here I'll show
you how to take your linear result set
output and make it grid so right here
where we establish the output variable
right before we do that let's establish
another variable called I which will be
our incremental number give it a value
of zero all you have to do is down in
the loop before you put any data into
your variable or you echo out any data
you want to have an if and else
condition statement so we're going to
put if open close parenthesis open curly
brace close curly brace put an else
condition or else statement open its
curly brace and close its curly brace as
well so now you have an if-else
condition statement nest all set up and
ready to go so we're going to say
evaluate right here inside these
parentheses we're going to say if I
actually before we evaluate what I is
the number let's iterate it so down
inside of your loop at the very end put
I plus plus and plus plus is a way just
to add one okay now we're ready to set
up
the expression that we're going to use
inside of this if condition statement
and let's see if I can explain this well
what we're doing is seeing if I which is
the incremental number through each pass
in the loop so each time in the loop the
first time it'll be a zero the second
time in the loop it'll be a 1 the third
pass in the loop it'll be a 2 so on and
so on and so on until it gets to the 15
limit or if your index starts at 0 it
might be a 14 limit 0 to 14 if you have
15 results coming out but basically what
this is doing is evaluating if I each
time in the past and the loop pass is
divisible by 3 which is our target
number here we're using the module s
operator which will evaluate whether or
not this value of I each time in the
loop will give a remainder from this
target number to see if it's divisible
so if that expression is equal to 0
which means false there is no remainder
we'll know if this I is either a 3 is 6
+ 9 12 or 15 anything is divisible by 3
so if you wanted your grid to be 5
across you just make this a 5 if you
wanted it 8 across you make this an 8 so
each time we get to a number that's
divisible by 8 8 16 24 32 it would break
the linear layout to help you make a
grid so let's leave that on 3 and so all
you have to do is take this dynamic
variable here that was normally output
there and control X and get that up
inside of your if condition and what you
want to do is make sure that in the else
condition you are making no new table
row so that's the logic if the number if
the incremental number in the loop pass
is divisible by 3 in our case here my
target number is 3 we're going to make a
new row so if it's a 3 if it's a 6 if
it's a 9
it's going to make a new table row
otherwise if it's not divisible by three
it's just going to make a new table
column and keep feeding a linear type
layout so whatever programming language
you're using hey let's type in a little
comment here I is divisible by our
target number so if I is divisible by
our target number in my case here three
in your case it could be any number you
want there so now let's run this script
save it put it on our PHP enabled server
and go to it using a browser make it run
see what happens okay here's the output
we get now so you can see it took those
15 values and it spread them out over a
grid that we specified
you know I specify the number three so I
have three columns and 5 rows so using
this number here 3 and your limit being
divisible by 3 you can make a nice grid
for yourself and this can work in any
programming language you use and the
logic is if the loop pass incremental
number is divisible by any target number
you set then you do a little bit of
different code than you normally would
to break a linear layout and make a grid
all right everybody that's pretty much
so the logic of it if you have any
problems with your code maybe there's
some syntax weird things happen from
what you were copying in the video and
you need to get to the script that I
produce for this lesson you can get it
from develop PHP calm and the link for
it will be in the video's description
area alright so I hope that proves
helpful to you guys and if you know of
anybody else that's asking how to do a
grid layout or whatever you can refer
them to this video because I explain the
logic of it pretty good and most people
who offer you the script to show you how
to do it won't explain the logic as
in-depth like I have here so somebody
who programs in PHP and maybe
ActionScript 3 they can take this same
logic into ActionScript 3 or maybe
if they work in JavaScript whatever
different programming language you can
take the logic of what's applied in too
many different programming languages and
we'll see you guys in the next lesson
