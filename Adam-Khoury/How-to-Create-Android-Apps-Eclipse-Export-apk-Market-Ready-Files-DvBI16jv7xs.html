video handbook now that we have our
Android developer account all ready to
go I've decided that before we get into
any complex app programming that would
be best to quickly demonstrate a hello
world Android app in both Eclipse and
flash cs5 point-five therefore this
video will focus on creating a hello
world Android app using Eclipse and Java
and for those of you who are not
familiar with what hello world is that
is basically the first application that
any programmer would create when they
get into learning any programming
language so really it's the most basic
of basic type application that you can
render in any programming language and
this one will focus on using eclipse
with Java okay first step is go back to
the Android comm website click
developers at the bottom and then the
SDK is what we want to download the
Android SDK and it has tools sample code
and dogs you need to create great apps
so let's click learn more and since I'm
using Windows 7 I'm going to get the
installer for Windows so I'm going to
click this one now the next step is
we're going to go to eclipse org so just
navigate your browser to Eclipse org
click downloads and we're going to get
the Eclipse IDE for Java developers
because that just happens to be the more
popular tool that people are using for
java application development and I'm
going to click windows 64-bit because I
have a Windows 64-bit operating system
so I'm going to click that and then now
I'm going to click this green arrow to
download it and it's downloading it
Chrome is downloading it to my downloads
folder same location where I downloaded
the Android SDK and that one's 99
megabytes and some of you guys already
might have these tools in place on your
machine in which case you don't have to
download it again
now while eclipse is downloading into
our downloads folder we're going to go
and download the java jdk which is
available at oracle comm so you can
navigate to oracle comm hover your mouse
over downloads and you'll see over here
in popular download
it's Java for developers you click that
and then you'll see the Java SE
downloads and that's the one we want as
you can see down here it says what Java
do I need and in order to develop Java
applications and applets you need the
JDK the development kit which also
includes the JRE so let's download JDK
here accept the License Agreement and
then we can go into the downloads and
find the ones we need and I have Windows
x64 so you just pick your proper
operating system here we are on our
desktop with those three items that we
just downloaded from the web for free
now this is the Android SDK this is the
Java development kit and this is Eclipse
so we're going to have to install the
Java development kit first before we can
install the Android SDK because if we
try and install the SDK it'll just
prompt us to install the JDK it'll
prompt us to download and install the
JDK so let's just install the JDK first
allow it and also allow it to install
the Java Runtime environment if you get
that prompt now you just click finish
now I can install the Android SDK so I'm
going to double click that allow it
next click Next
install next now we're going to start
the SDK manager
keep that checkmark in that box and
click finish and it's going to do some
gathering of certain things that you're
going to need so you can see all of
these packages are ready to go and these
that have question marks you can choose
to accept them if you like I'm going to
accept all and then install then seven
years later when all 32 packages are
installed it will say done 32 packages
installed and you can click close and go
how are these things now at this point
I'm going to close the Android SDK
manager and now at this point even
without installing eclipse you can
develop for Android if you know how to
work the command line but using eclipse
to create Java apps for Android is the
preferred method and most people
creating Android applications are using
Eclipse I'm going to try and change that
into most people that are developing
Android applications are using flash
haha now at this point we're going to
setup Eclipse and get it ready to open
so let's extract here so you can
right-click select extract here and on
your desktop it's going to make a folder
called Eclipse right there and you can
put that anywhere you want double click
inside and you don't have to install
anything you can just run it from the
folder here you can double click Eclipse
it's going to ask you to define a
workspace and my workspace is on my
desktop a folder called workspace which
I created press ok all right once the
eclipse is open we just have to install
the Android stuff within Eclipse that
way we have it available when eclipse is
open you go to help install new software
up in the top right here click Add the
name is going to be ADT plug-in and the
location is this URL and the Android
developer documentation recommends if
you have any trouble downloading the
plug-in from this URL
that you can use it without the HTTPS
which is just a security measure but it
should work both ways but first try it
with the s and then press ok says
pending and now it says developer tools
if you hit this little arrow you'll see
exactly what's in there ok now take this
checkbox here to put a check in it and
then click Next review the items to be
installed next and then I accept the
terms and then click finish now if you
get this security warning that pops up
says you're installing the software they
contain this is warning you're
installing software that contains
unsigned content love to grab your blade
you want to continue ok I don't care it
says you will need to restart a clip so
the installation changes to take effect
you may try to airplay the changes
around it's restarting but this may
cause ever so let's restart eclipse now
and here it comes back again click my
familiar workspace ok now if you go to
window you'll see that you have Android
SDK and a BD manager down there you see
that and the last step in eclipse before
we can actually get in there and develop
something for Android is to configure
our preferences so let's go to window
preferences select Android here if it's
not selected and let's place in the SDK
location on our computer and just browse
your computer your Program Files
wherever those are on your system - in
my C Drive Program Files and Android
Android SDK ok apply and there we go now
I'll press ok so the first thing we'll
do is go to file new project Android
we'll just make it an android project
next so let's give this project the name
of hello world contents just leave that
like it is the
that checked and the build target you
can choose whatever you like but I'm
going to choose the Android 2.2 which is
what most people have on their bones
right now or you can target Android 3
which is the honeycomb version of
Android and that's for the Galaxy Tab
and things like that and Android 3.1 is
the very latest but a lot of the code
and the applications that you can create
will be backwards and forwards
compatible between the different Android
operating systems it's just that some
that you create might require Android
3.0 and things like that it might
require Android 2.2 so I'm just going to
target Android 2.2 I'm going to scroll
down some put in the properties section
we just set the application name and the
package name which the package name has
to have at least two identifiers and it
has to be unique unique in the Android
system you keep the create activity
checkmark in place and what this does is
it creates a subclass so the name of the
subclass will be hello world activity
and that's going to be a subclass in the
activity class of Android and the min
SDK version should be in place for you
already now let's click finish now since
we're going to be running this project
and testing and debugging it within the
Android emulator which is the emulator
comes with the package and what it does
is allow you to view how your Android
app is going to operate on the Android
operating system before you actually get
it on an Android operating system so in
order to do that we have to create an AV
D which is an Android virtual device so
we'll go to window Android SDK and AVD
manager then we'll click new over here
on the top right this one we can just
put tests AVD click target tab here and
I selected Android 2.2 I believe for my
application so that's what I'll set for
the emulator and now we can go and click
create a video at the bottom but we're
not going to start it yet now at any
point if you happen to close Eclipse or
you close that little welcome tab you
hit the little X that's on that welcome
screen and you don't see your project
behind that welcome screen you can just
go to file open file you go to your
desktop where you had the workspace
folder you click hello world or the
package that you're creating whatever
application and the dark project file is
the one you want to open and viewers
happens to look like mine and you want
to see the project Explorer window on
the left here you can go to window show
view project Explorer so what I'll do is
click on this little arrow to expand
that source folder then I'll expand this
arrow so I get to a file that says dot
Java then I'll know that's the source
code for my package for my application I
can double click that and it'll load
into the window here so you can see the
code for the HelloWorld activity
subclass which is a subclass of the
activity class in Android ok now we're
going to make our application live by
making it actually output some text or
something and make it say hello world
and you can do this easily by going
underneath the view you have your plus
sign there if you only see one line make
sure you hit your plus sign open that up
and you'll see two lines there where
you're importing certain things into the
application we're going to add one more
line to import the Android that widget
dot text view now we're going to go
under this line and pop in these three
lines of code so what you're doing is
creating a new text field or text view
object and then you use the set text
method on that text to say hello world
so you're defining it so you're defining
what its values will be or its value
whatever string value you want and then
you set context view my text actually
you can comment this line out because we
don't need that now we can run this in
the emulator and see if it pumps out the
words hello world so we'll go to run
click run Android application yes save
your changes then it opens it up in the
Android emulator allow it to load
now you can slide your phone or whatever
device this is open and there it is it
opens up automatically so when you want
to close this thing you can just go down
here if you're on Windows 7 down to your
menu or your taskbar and right-click
that closed window if you don't happen
to have that and it's all it's too big
for you to actually close you can just
go to control-alt-delete start your task
manager target that window and end task
now the final task is rendering this out
as a dot APK file which is the target
file that we need to upload to the
android marketplace when everything is
completed we're just going to export in
debugging mode that way we'll still get
our APK file and things will run the way
they're supposed to first we have to
know where our key store information is
so we can go to window preferences then
you go to android you can open it up by
hitting a little arrow and click build
and then you'll see your default debug
keystore which is in the dot Android
folder so on my system if I go to users
Adam the Android folder I'll have my
debug keystore key in place already so I
can just press cancel on that I just
wanted to see where it is so now I'll go
to file export now we're going to export
to get the apk file which is what gets
uploaded to the Android store when
you're exporting your project for real
right now we're just going to export in
debugging mode but the process is very
much the same if you're exporting for
the market so you go to Android export
Android application next select the
project to export and you can just go to
browse and your project should be there
select it ok no errors found click Next
now we'll use existing key store and go
to browse so if I go to my computer my C
Drive users Adam dot Android debug
keystore double click
and it puts it in place the password is
Android a and D are OID all lowercase
next the key alias will be Android debug
key and that password is Android as well
all lowercase next destination apk file
you see there that's what we were after
so let's just put that on our desktop
we'll save it as hello world actually
let's create a new folder on our desktop
so let's play new folder hello world APK
there's a new folder I'll double click
inside of it and the file name is hello
world save click finish I want our
desktop you can see I have this folder
called hello world APK and there's an
APK file what do you know and that's the
kind of file that you put up to the
market online but like I said it's very
important that you guys keep this in
mind that when you're putting in the
information for your key store
information we used debug keystore file
and you cannot do that when you're
exporting an app for real from eclipse
to put it up in the market you have to
actually use information from your
Android developer account it makes
perfect sense it's not too hard to
figure out ok guys and here is finally
some information that will help you
understand properly signing your
applications you can go to this URL at
the Android developer site and research
app signing that way you're in the know
about everything you need to know about
properly signing your applications
because as you noticed I sign then I
used key store information that was for
debugging mode and I would have to put
in private information that's unique to
my developer account why we're not using
debug mode and after the next lesson
where we show how to do this process and
render out in hello world apk from flash
cs5 point 5 we're going to go ahead and
load that up to the market place so
we'll have something where you guys can
actually go to the market place at
Android and you'll see my application
there so you'll know that everything
that I'm showing is on the up-and-up ok
that'll be in the next lesson well
actually the next lesson will show how
to create the apk in flash cs5 point
five a little hello world application
and then the one after that is when
we're going to actually load up to the
market place and then after that we can
kind of cruise and show you guys how to
do different things in Eclipse and
flashy as 5.5 to better your
applications or maybe to understand how
to begin application development so
we'll see how it goes I'm not sure where
this series will end but we'll
definitely get you guys up and running</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
