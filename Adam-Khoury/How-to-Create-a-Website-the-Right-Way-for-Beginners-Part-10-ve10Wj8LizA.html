the final part of the series that will
call it complete what we're going to do
is add a little photo bar like I have on
develop PHP a lot of people ask me how I
added by footer bar here or my header
bar you can see how they staged stuck in
place you can put any elements that you
want inside of them I'm going to show
you how to do that but we're going to do
it on web intersect and do it up live
and I'll ftp the files after I adjust
them to show you what it comes out like
so the first thing we want to do take a
screenshot of this press print screen on
your keyboard you go into your graphics
program and all you got to do is press
control V or paste you can go to edit
paste and it will put that image that
you had in print screen and what I'm
going to do is use that to design my
bottom bar now I'm going to want my
bottom bar to be about 32 pixels high so
i'm going to go through here i'm going
to draw a bar that's 32 pixels high that
goes across the whole way and it doesn't
have to be very long i just want to get
the design out and actually that little
rectangle i drew there is just about
what i want i think i might add a little
checkerboard to it to make it match that
design so if i go to hatch think i have
hatch 5
yeah something like that not too much
real subtle bring this down a bit bring
this up a bit there we go so that'll be
my bottom bar this is where I'm going to
put links to the terms of use
disclaimers and all that stuff for the
site so now you can just delete this big
image control x fit your canvas around
that bar and then go to canvas size and
make it instead of 8 55 wide orbit why'd
you made that bar just make it about I
don't know 24 or any size where you
think those graphics will help it match
up to one another you can even go to
let's just make it say 12 or 10 so mine
will be 10 pixels wide so let's save
this file file export wizard continue
continue exit go to jpg looks good to me
and I'm going to export it and then you
go to root style and save this as BTM
bar dot it'll be a dot jpg so you save
it into that folder now let's go into
Dreamweaver and watch how easy this is
to do I'm going to go in nuttin to the
index file but into that include footer
I have and at the very bottom I'm going
to put in a new div tag div space and
I'm going to put in class or you can
make an ID for whatever you want equal
I'm going to make the class
equal to BTM bar then I'm going to go
down one put his face go down one more
line and close off that div tag so
there's a nice little div tag we just
put in that's going to have a class
styling definitions for BTM bar all
right now control s save that go into
the main that CSS file that we have for
the site go down to the very bottom and
put in this code have a little comment
here says bottom bar style and here it
ends right there so what you want to do
is just set up a class definition set
for the bottom bar styling and we have a
width of one hundred percent so that
means no matter how big the browser is
it'll go it'll span one hundred percent
and go all the way across the bottom
like you wanted to position is fixed the
bottom 0 0 pixels if I said bottom 10
pixels it would rise up off at the
bottom a little bit 10 pixels and then
the background image is set to an image
in this style folder called BTM bar
strip jpg which mine was just BTM bar
jpg so there BTM bar jpg right 0 pixels
so it'll be smack dab in the edge of the
site all the way across save that now
let's put these puppies up i'm going to
ftp them pick it up actually before I
ftp them up and replace what's online
I'm going to put a couple of break tags
right here just to make sure that the
elements that are in my footer we're not
going to be covered up completely by my
floating div there so let's save that
now let's ftp
include footer go into the style folder
put up the new main that CSS and while
we're in the style Boulder let's make
sure we put up that new image or nothing
will show up BTM bar dot jpg now let's
go back to the side on the home page
let's refresh there we go a nice
gleaming white custom design with my
hatches in it you see kind of matches
the hatches that I have here in the site
borders there you go and you can put
whatever you want down in that footer
bar and it's kind of just like the same
thing I have a developed PHP but a
developed PHP i'm using a transparent
that PNG file a PNG graphics with no
background transparent that i made in
fireworks as well so that's how you do
that and that pretty much shows you how
to and you see why i added those break
tags that way all these links and
everything come up above that bar when
people scroll all the way down but now
here in this section I can put my logo
and then my terms of useprivacy policy
disclaimers and all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
