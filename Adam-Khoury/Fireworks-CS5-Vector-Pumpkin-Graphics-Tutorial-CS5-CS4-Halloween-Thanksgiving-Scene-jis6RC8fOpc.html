getting into full swing we have decided
to once again demonstrate the vector
power of adobe fireworks to show you how
to create a holiday pumpkin vector
graphic the exact graphic you see on
your screen is the one I made during
this video and if you would like to see
how to carve a spooky or smiley
Halloween face into your pumpkin let me
know in the video comment area and we'll
do a part to continuing this video to
show how to carve a face into the
pumpkin after you create it so let's
create new fireworks PNG and I'm going
to make mine about a thousand wide x 600
high resolution 72 because I'm going to
output this for the web the first thing
I'll do is grab my pen tool and I'll
draw the center section for the pumpkin
and this you might have to try it a
couple of times to get the right shape
and you have to be comfortable with your
pen tool now what I'm going to do to
make mine perfectly symmetrical is I'm
going to put a rectangle on top of that
now highlight both of those go to modify
combine paths and punch I'll take that
press ctrl-c ctrl-v and then flip the
copy that's on top put those in the
correct position I like both of them
modify combined paths and union now
they're one piece and actually I'm going
to get a couple of ellipses drawn out
just to be my color palette which you
can save colors in your color palette
but sometimes I find it easier just to
put some circles up here and have those
be my colors that I can always access
i'm going to set up a dark orange we're
also going to have yellow and some green
we're going to make that like a more
like a forest green or an olive right
about there so those are the colors i'll
be incorporating so i'm going to
highlight this and i'm going to go to
gradient and i'm going to give it an
ellipse gradient and where it is white
i'm going to change that to yellow and
where it is black i'm going to change
that to the orange now i can manipulate
that ellipse on that shape and i'll put
it towards the top so there's the center
section of my pumpkin alright let's grab
this put it into view better
and now let's draw the second section so
we'll grab the pen tool will start right
about here click down let go come down
right about here in the center and click
and hold and then manipulate that arc so
you get the shape that you want and that
looks good to me i'll click down there
let go click down here let go now i can
take that one and press ctrl shift down
arrow key to send that to the back and i
can manipulate that gradient as well now
let's draw the third one grab the pen
tool again let's start right about here
go back to the center right about there
make the ark that you want come down
around click down right about here and
hold and then you can bend that arc a
little if you want right there then
click down here and send that one to
back to so highlight it ctrl shift down
arrow key and you can manipulate that
gradient now we'll draw the last one in
get the pen tool start right about here
get about to the center make the ark
that you want bring it on around click
down here click down there and then
we'll send that one to back as well and
let's put its gradient up top now what
I'm going to do is adjust these
gradients make them maybe a little bit
bigger so I'll hold shift down while I'm
adjusting that to make both sides go see
I'm making both sides grow and shrink as
I hold shift I'm going to make that a
little bigger just to get the yellow
more dominant in there right about there
leave that one up to about there I'm
going to highlight these three by
holding shift down as I select them when
they're all three selected press ctrl-c
ctrl-v and then flip those horizontally
grab them put them in place on the other
side but it looks like they should go
looks like 28 y position matches these
ok that looks good i'm going to
highlight all of those and deselect
one in the center by putting my mouse
over it and holding down shift and then
select that one and it will deselect
that one so you can see I only have the
outside one selected but don't move them
with all of those selected let's go to
filters i'm going to add shadow and glow
let's add inner shadow now let's
deselect all of those just by selecting
or hitting the white area of the canvas
and then you can grab these three and
what we're going to do is take the
shadow make it a different color more
like this orange but we're going to make
it a little darker now by going to the
color wheel bring down the brightness of
it okay and we're going to make it reach
in further and we're going to fade it
out a little bit more and we're going to
turn the angle on it to be more towards
the bottom and the same for these I'm
going to grab those three the inner
shadow you can also do the center one
now if you like shadow and glow inner
shadow let's make it that dark color
right there make it come in a little
more not too much on this one there we
go and let's angle it to go the other
way a little bit like that and then
we'll take our gradient and put it on
this side a little more right about
there and really that inner shadow I
don't want it so dominant I'll bring it
down to about thirty something I'm going
to highlight all of them I'm going to
give them an inner glow is that shadow
and glow inner glow and I'm going to
make that a dark orange so let's darken
that up a little bit more right about
there ate it in make it come in a little
bit more fade it make it a little darker
bring it to about 50 ok now you can grab
these independently and you can mess
around with the way the inner shadow is
angled just to have them if you don't
want them to be so symmetrical in their
shadowing like this one I can take this
in a shadow make that one a little
darker if I want and change its angle a
little bit by one
and I can also select a couple of these
like say I want to grab this one and
this one and this one and I'm going to
give those in inner shadow and I'll do
so like this one for now and I'm going
to work on these two what I'll do is go
down to that new inner shadow and I'm
going to make it white then I'm going to
bring it around to where their angles on
the bottom right about there I'm going
to make it only about to make it a
little more sharp and then bring that
down a little bit so you can add like a
little bit of shine on some of them if
you want like this one I'm just make
that in turn make that one white and
then angle it may be that way and let's
make it not so bright there I just
noticed i had the shadow on these three
going the wrong way I think supposed to
be down there instead of on top actually
right there that ankle and make them a
little bit darker as you can see what
I'm talking about so I'll move the angle
to be more towards the bottom where the
shadow is down here and let's just go
ahead and make sure these three have
their shadow set up right bring it all
the way up and you can see I have angled
all wrong supposed to be down in the
bottom there okay and decide we can not
paid them so much so it looks a little
bit different from the other side all
right about their looks good actually
you can even bring those in more if you
want instead of 12 right about there on
that side and you can grab some
independently like say you want this one
or maybe this one to not have such a
deep shadow you can get it independently
and make it not so deep you see that way
you can make it look you can manipulate
the symmetry to where everything is not
exactly
symmetrical on both sides it might have
different shadows you can move these
gradients around to give a different
lighting effects there let's move maybe
this one down a little bit so you can
see it just busts up the the symmetry a
little bit if you do that so let's grab
those gradients move them around a
little bit okay let's grab all of those
and at this point i can press ctrl G to
group that whole set now bring it down a
little bit here and now we can draw the
top the green part on top the stem okay
so let's get our canvas where we need it
to where we can see really good and
let's grab the pen tool now what I'm
going to do is draw a shape starting
right about here and I just clicked and
let go and now i'm going to hold down
when i click this next time right about
here then i'm going to go around to
right about here click and hold down and
go to write about their and click let go
and then i can go right about here click
hold down curve it in right about like
that click down here to make a sharp
point i'm going to come down to right
about here curve that line then we can
go right about there click down then
come to the other side meet that point
click down now we're going to change the
gradient on that to a satin i'm going to
change the colors in that set ingredient
to this green that we made earlier then
we can have the other side I don't know
maybe a little bit darker green on the
gradient grab that thing and send to
back by pressing ctrl shift down I'm
going to bring it up a little bit right
about there then I'm going to give that
an inner shadow select the filter of
shadow and glow inner shadow I'm going
to make it a very bright green so I can
change that and the color wheel from
green to a very bright green like that
if I want I'm going to make it come in a
lot more
fade it make it come in a little more
than that that looks good actually that
inner shadow is a little bit much right
about there is good and the color on
that inner shadow I make it a little
more yellowish there we go and on the
satin let's make that a little more
yellowish to and then mix it a little
more with that green so it's not so
yellow there we go I'm going to give it
may be an inner one more inner shadow of
a dark green on top that way let's make
that dark green make that a hundred
percent let's see how that looks that
looks ok now I can take my pen tool make
a little shape that fills in this little
may be right about like you can pick any
shape you want for that but right about
there will make a good look and cut
press down on that point to make a sharp
edge and then just curve it in now that
one you can press ctrl shift down arrow
key to send to the back and it kind of
look like it has a cut there especially
when we shrink it down and make it small
I can hold ctrl and mouse wheel to see
how things look from a distance and that
looks okay so what I'm going to do is
grab everything I'm gonna press ctrl-c
ctrl-v so I have copy in this one I'm
going to modify flatten selection now I
can really take a good look at what
it'll look like when I shrink it down
for the webpage so let's go back to one
hundred percent by mouse wheeling and
holding ctrl and now you can see the
size that it's going to be in the
webpage it looks really smooth and even
as small as I want to make it it'll have
nice effects on it and all the effects
will be noticed really well so you can
see all three different sizes actually
it looks best when you start to really
shrink it down to be icon sized</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
