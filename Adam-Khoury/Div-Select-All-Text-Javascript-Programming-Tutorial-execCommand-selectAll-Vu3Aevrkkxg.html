house one tool we got a tutorial for you
today I'm just chilling today I might do
a few tutorials what's up I don't know
I'm gonna pop open this can of yoohoo
right now and we're gonna get things
cracking up in here this little video
tip is gonna be all about JavaScript
that's a very simple little tiny thing
but you might find it handy too and
that's why I'm sharing the tip so I'm
gonna go to JavaScript and jQuery
section here under the video tutorials
and then I'll click this text text area
filled counting whatever lesson I want
to go to now when somebody comes to this
page and they watch the video and they
might want to copy and paste this text
so they don't have to write it out
I made it to where when they click in
this div you can see this white
container is a div container when the
user clicks inside the div all the text
gets selected that way no characters
within the text might get left out in
their selection because some people
might miss a line or two or miss a few
characters when they're highlighting
everything so that's not normal
functionality you have to program that
in and I'm programming into my site to
make sure that when people highlight my
code to copy and paste it that they get
all of it now normal functionality is
let's go into the learn PHP section
where I haven't applied this code yet
you can see that the user has to
manually drag their mouse over
everything to get the code and it's
possible that they might miss something
and that's a problem I'll just apply it
to a very simple page that I have here
you can see that if you go into design
view I just have a div sitting there it
has a couple of paragraph tags in it but
it doesn't have to be a couple of
paragraph tags in that div it could be
any kind of content one giant long
string of text or whatever so what you
do is you take your target div which
this is mine right here this one named
div one and you add a couple of
attributes to it I'm going to explain
these attributes to you right now the
first one is
tenth editable' equals true and by the
way I tested this in the newest versions
of Firefox Internet Explorer and Chrome
ok content editable set to true is what
gives us the ability to run exec
commands on that element on the page if
you didn't set that content editable to
true the actions within this on click
event would not occur for you now the
second attribute is the on click event
and what happens there is JavaScript so
javascript is running within this on
click event and we're using document
exec command targeting select all which
is one of the parameters you can use
with exec command and I used exec
command many many times within the
tutorial little tutorial series we did
for JavaScript WYSIWYG production we
were making a WYSIWYG from scratch
showing people how to create HTML rich
text editors and we use the exec command
like 15 times doing different things in
that lesson series so if you really want
to master exec command that's a good one
to follow but we run exec command on
this content editable div to select all
ok let's run it in Firefox let's make
sure right when we click the div that it
highlights everything and it does ok now
let's run it in Internet Explorer allow
blocked content okay that works and then
let's run it in chrome just to be sure
and that works too alright and we're not
gonna run it in Safari because I hate
Safari and Apple and I'm glad Apple is
dead now ok so if you're somebody like
me that likes to offer code or you have
any kind of site that has things that
need to be copy and pasted from it you
want to make sure that everything gets
selected when the person goes to copy
and paste you can use this method for
that ok so I hope some of you bird orcs
find this information useful I'll talk
to you next lesson and goodbye my
friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
