creating a custom forum for your website
using PHP and MySQL and before we guide
everyone through the next couple of
scripts we want to show you some
functionality beforehand so you know
what you're about to build and the
source files for the web intersect
forums what I'm building here is going
to be available free all of the code
that makes up all the source files will
be in version 1.3 4 of the web intersex
software so you go to web intersect home
you go to download and right here
there'll be version 1.3 for you click
that you'll be able to download it and
you'll have the forum scripting it's not
going to be in the configuration file so
you have to create your own tables for
the forum it's not going to be in the
configuration file for 1.34 you'll have
to view the videos and check out the
tables that you have to create and the
fields inside of them within the videos
but these scripts all of this code like
the home page for the forums the section
page all that's going to be included and
I'm going to finish up walking you guys
through the scripts that make up this
basic little boring system then later on
tonight I'm going to package up version
1.3 for okay enough collaborate let's
show you what's going on here so if we
click this first forum PHP dynamic
scripting help we can see that there is
a couple of posts that have been made a
couple of new threads or new topics and
this is all just testing stuff will
probably will probably delete all of
these and start over when I launched my
forum actually
and I also want to let you guys know
that I'm going to make mine a little bit
nicer on my own off of video after this
tutorial series before I really open up
my forums because what we're offering is
a tutorial on the foundations of
building your own custom forum system
we're not really going to spoon-feed
people a really nice polished product
that you guys can do on your own at web
intersect we're about to open this puppy
up I'm going to make the forums and I'm
also going to make a tutorial and file
sharing systems
I'm not sure if I'm going to do a
tutorial for the file-sharing systems
but after the forums I think I'm going
to let the members system go crazy with
it and share files with each other let
everybody know what they've done in
their system how cool it is
maybe you offer the scripts to other
people that might want that
functionality and things like that so
the member system itself or the member
base will come alive hopefully and start
sharing things and I can just kind of
sit back and let everybody amp up the
system like that if they want to share
or if not everybody can just wait on me
but I work slow ok so even though my
forum is not really launched yet and I
don't have navigation on my home page to
the forum's there's some people who are
posting in here I've been posting in
here to test things out and I'm going to
show you how it works a little bit so we
can go to the and I added jQuery for the
reply mechanism and I'll show you how
that works in just a second so let's
click on this SQL syntax and MySQL
database help form and somebody says
need serious help here and I can answer
this person's question and I'm going to
right now so I'll show you how it works
all right so I'm going to go down here
to post the response and if I was not
logged in I wouldn't see this post a
response button it would say please log
in to respond let me click that and you
see a nice form pops up using jQuery
it's just a hidden div with a 4-minute
when you press that button it pops open
okay so here is my answer so I'm trying
to help as if as if the best I can with
my answer here I'm going to press submit
your response and let's see what happens
we're using jQuery and it's Ajax
mechanisms to send to the PHP and MySQL
and then get a response back without
ever leaving this page doing it in real
time on the page and let's see what
happens boom you see the little loading
thing that was there for a second -
little green loader bar and then the
answer was placed directly on the page
with no refresh I could even put in
another response directly submit
response boom
now if anybody goes to this thread or if
you go back to it you'll see that your
posts are there and it shows how long
ago you posted and who you are so people
can click that and go to your profile on
the site so that's pretty much how it
works at a basic basic level I'm going
to tell you guys right now I'm not going
to show you how to implement any
specific WYSIWYG editor out there what a
WYSIWYG editor is little piece of
JavaScript software that you can write
on your own or download free online and
what it is is a rich text editor it will
allow people using your forms to easily
bold things underline and make links and
do other various things like that that
people are used to doing like when they
send the email or whatever and you'll
you'll see the developed PHP forums we
use a WYSIWYG in place in these forms I
use a free WYSIWYG I think mine is the
one I'm using there is I forget the name
of the WYSIWYG I'm not even sure if that
one's in production anymore from the
people who made it but there's lots of
free WYSIWYG is online that a JavaScript
base that you put into your forums to
give people bolding ability and things
like that you can also write it custom
and there was a while back I was showing
people how to do it in flash so you
could even if you're skillful enough in
flash I have tutorials here on where is
it did the open code flash WYSIWYG rich
text editor you can throw a flash a rich
text editor in place there if you're
good enough to know how to parse it
using ActionScript in PHP and in develop
PHP for the longest time I had a flash
WYSIWYG in place in my forums but then I
switched to a JavaScript one about I
don't know two years ago or a year ago
but anyways you saw the form I had it's
just a text area so if we go back to
that thread and if I go to post a
response it's just a regular text area
there's no WYSIWYG nobody can bold
nothing but I programmed it in such a
way it'll give you the ability to
preserve line breaks
and if you wanted to put in a code tag
like this that would go right in no
problem
so say you wanted to put script tags I'm
just right in just a test see there's
the script tags but the script tags are
not active
they won't operate because we're using
HTML chars
I'll show you what we're using in the
script all right so now you see how it
works at its basic level this is all
you're getting for me I'm not going to
give you a super polished software for
your forum that you're going to have to
do hopefully you learned a little bit
something about how your database needs
to be structured and all that kind of
stuff and PHP queries to the database
that will allow you to go further and
make your system awesome and maybe some
people a web intersect might polish this
forum up or make their own that works
with the web intersect system and they
might offer it somewhere I don't know
but I know I'm just saying that because
I know a lot of people gonna be phat me
and they're gonna be like man I want to
dis features that feature this features
that feature in my form and I wanted you
to make it Adam I didn't want to have to
you can't get pissed off at me for that
I'll smack you in the face ok so if
you're working right alongside with me
in the videos you would have this page
ready to go this is your forum home page
and then when you click one of these
sections you would also see this now
what we haven't explained yet is the
create new topic page when you click
this button to create a new topic into
that forum so somebody can make a new
thread we haven't discussed this page
yet called new topic so that's what I'll
be doing in this lesson so let's go into
the code open new topic and let's also
take a look at section so section was
given this button which is a form and I
chose to use a form this time instead of
a link so I changed that link that we
had to a form that way a post variable
is kind of behind the scenes a little
bit and you can see what that form
consists of and remember if you guys
can't see all of this code super clear
on YouTube here version 1.3 4 of the web
intersection software is going to be out
very soon and it's going to have this
all these scripts that we're going to be
discussing here and the ones we've
already created are going to be free for
you to download so just hold on a little
bit when version 1.3 for a web intersect
is put out you'll have all the code so
basically this page is just like it was
when we left off except that I added the
breadcrumbs div here and basically all
the breadcrumbs div is is something that
will allow the user to navigate the
forums more easily go back to the
section they were on and things like
that and you'll see how I coded that all
out you can see there's the div that
holds it div ID breadcrumbs and there's
the links at this point it doesn't
really have to be dynamic because it
just has to lead them back to the forum
home page on this page when you get to
the next page that's when you want to
have some dynamic breadcrumbs going on
which you'll see a little bit of that
too and breadcrumbs is if you don't know
what breadcrumbs means it's like a trail
like when you're walking through the
woods you might drop breadcrumbs so when
your way back you don't get lost you can
follow the breadcrumbs back home but
then what if a little rabbit comes in
eat your bread oh no ok so basically on
section PHP there's a form now that
makes up the button which is the create
new topic button you click that then
we're going to send them to the create
new topic page with is which is new
topic dot PHP and it's going to send a
couple variables that are necessary for
that page to know in order to process
things which is the form ID and the
forum title this that way the page knows
what form section that this new post is
going in or this new thread so now let's
move along to discussing new topic PHP
which is a page you guys have not even
seen yet all right before we discuss the
PHP code in the top of that file let's
look at the design view in the HTML you
can see here we have breadcrumbs again
and here is dynamics going on in the
breadcrumbs so let's see what's going on
there
div ID breadcrumbs there's the static
link to the web intersect home page
there's a static link to the web
intersect forum home page and then here
is a dynamic link to section PHP within
i D of this forum section and this forum
section titles name is going to be right
there you see it that's dynamic that's
coming in dynamically so if I was at the
forum home and I created go to create a
new topic in this section create new
topic you'll see it's different now
that's how it's dynamic okay so in in
that page we have a forum and you can
easily see that forum sitting right here
the form tag is indicated by in
Dreamweaver anyway it's indicated by
this red dotted line everything within
that box is in the forum so you just put
a line there that says create new topic
in the whatever forum section this is
dynamically you spit that out right
there then you create your form in the
form you can see all the code right here
very clearly that's the whole form so
I'm doing is posting to a script called
parse post up PHP which I'm going to
explain to you in one moment making sure
the post type is being sent as a because
this is a new topic so the database has
to know when this topic gets put into it
that it's an a type if it was a reply or
a response it would be a B type so in
this instance it's an a type now this
this input is the topic author and you
can see on a live on the site my name is
sunk into that field but that field is
disabled I can't change that value and
that value does not get sent to the PHP
that's pretty much just for show to show
them their name then input post title
that's what they type in right here if I
only put in a couple of letters says
your title must be at least 10
characters long you don't have to set
yours up that way but I just wanted to
make sure people aren't writing in that
I hate when people do that I want them
to be descriptive with their title so
under where they put in the title we
have a text area here and that's shown
in the source code right here textarea
name is post body column 64 rows 15
actually the columns doesn't even need
to be there because I have the style
with 96% set on that box now here's the
thing if you're paying attention
you want to know how to integrate what
you see is what you get Rick's rich text
editor what you have to do is replace
this text area with your WYSIWYG or
whatever you have for allowing people to
format things very simple just replace
that text area and your form should
still process just like it does setup
here now here is the input button that's
just the create my topic Now button
which is sitting right there you see
that and we're sending a couple of
hidden variables there's four of them
actually one is forum section ID one is
forum section title the other is
dismembers ID and this member's password
and that's pretty much all that form is
doing it's very very simple and this
page is scripted just like the others it
has the header the dynamic header in at
the dynamic footer so that's all that's
really going on in this page now let me
talk to you about the JavaScript
validation now this isn't jQuery or and
this is just JavaScript where we're
validating the form and you can change
this to be jQuery instead if you'd like
to add that but I'm keep in mind simple
I might change mine over later we're
using jQuery in the reply form big-time
but in this one no jQuery if you go to
the actually look at the threads the
reply form this thing is all jQuery the
way this thing works is all jQuery and
Ajax the create new topic page there's
no jQuery going on if you'd like to you
can make it have some jQuery
functionality but mine is just a
JavaScript function that's going to
validate my form make sure that the form
post title has a value if it doesn't you
give an alert please type in a title for
this topic else if the form 1 post title
value length is less than 10 I spit out
an error alert that says your title must
be at least 10 characters long and else
if the post body is empty tell them
please type in the topic none of those
conditions meet it returns is valid
which is true and that will allow the
forum to actually post to the PHP script
which is parse post type PHP which I'm
going to explain in the very next video
now parts posts type PHP is a very
important script to the whole system
you might want to stick around for that
