product of what you'll be learning how
to create if you follow this Swift 3d
and flash tutorial let's render out and
show you what we have true 3d object
animations using swift 3d and flash you
can see there's a nice little timeline
there that you could put stop actions in
or whatever you need to do if you want
that animation to fire off only at a
certain time you put a stop action on
frame 1 and then a stop action on frame
40 you make it fire off by going to
frame go to and play frame 2 and then
make a stop at frame 40 or whatever any
kind of animations this is a really
simple one I know but you can use any
type let's make sure we have a good
frame rate on that let's put it up - I
don't know 24 and control-enter there we
go
it's pretty cure true 3d ok the first
thing I'm going to do is create my
little piece of wood I'm gonna go into
the lathe editor and I'm gonna start
right about here I'm just gonna click
down here then I'm gonna go right about
I don't know somewhere over here when I
click down I'm gonna click down here
then I'm also gonna click down here make
a little rectangle and then close it up
now I'm going to go into the scene
editor and now you can see what I have
if we go into the top view here look at
it from the top you have a nice little
circular object with a hole right in the
center so you can see if we go back and
set the lathe editor
there's our object there that the hole
was created by having this space here
set off from that green line if I had
these points onto the green line they're
directly all that green line you would
see no hole in the center so that's how
I achieve the hole in the center
all right now we're gonna take from the
models library well actually let's put a
material on this first let's put the
texture of whatever this is
let's put a wood texture on it maybe
that's fine now I'm going to go into
let's put the radial segments up to 64
okay now I'm going to go into the models
library and grab out the screw and I'm
gonna put it into the the view pane the
front active view pane there then Swift
3d asked me would you like to scale the
model to fit the contents of the scene
yes okay so there's my screw and you can
see it's already sunk down into the
middle of the the piece of wood and you
can hold alt in the view pane here and
use your mouse your right mouse button
to zoom in and out if you need to okay I
just made the piece of wood a little bit
larger by going to the scale properties
of that object and highlight it you go
to scale and I just messed with the
numbers here a little bit to make it a
little bit larger than it was originally
now I'm gonna highlight this screw I'm
gonna click animate and this is how you
can animate any object what I'm gonna do
is drag the playhead out to frame 10 so
on key frame 10 well frame 10 when I
move this thing a keyframe will be made
from the starting position how it is now
on frame 1 to frame 10 it will animate
to the ending position that I designate
now so what I'm gonna do is go to
rotation and I'm gonna make it spin
clockwise in the direction that a screw
would spin if it's going into something
you can see it's spinning there and you
can see the keyframes were made up in
the animations panel there or the
timeline so now let's move the let's
drag the playhead and see what they gave
us a nice spinning animation on that
that's good so now let's go out to frame
20 with that playhead it's gonna make a
new keyframe when we spin some more so
let's press down on the Y rotation again
make it go clockwise some more
a little bit more and so you just mess
with your numbers to where seems like
it's doing what you wanted to do that's
about right
I'm gonna continue that I'm gonna do it
about four times I'm gonna go all the
way out to frame 40 and that's gonna be
a lot of frames but that's okay we want
it to look good okay so I went all the
way out to frame 40 animating it using
that technique to spin it around
clockwise now frame 40 where the
playhead is we're gonna animate its
position so we can go and select it and
go to position the position properties
and I think it's the y-coordinate again
there and push it down all the way into
place right about there so now you can
see what we've done if we drag the
playhead and there's your screw
animation we can take this and render it
out see what it looks like let's put
some material on the let's put
reflective like a silver on that screw
okay now let's render it out go to
preview an export raster generate all
frames
and now as we play after all the frames
come in and are rendered you can press
play and see what you have it's pretty
freakin cool
and now you can also bring this into
flash you can just export it straight to
flash as an SWF or just render it out to
your desktop as an SWF and once you're
in flash just import it using the flash
menu and what it will do is bring all
these frames in but I'm gonna change the
look on it a little bit the way that
we're viewing it and it looks like let's
go back to animate I'm gonna go back to
frame 40 and bring this screw up just a
little bit position
right about there
that works for me I don't want it to go
in all the way flat cos in I didn't put
a big enough of a circle in the middle
let's see that looks good that's a good
animation right there I'm gonna twist
everything now we can toggle the
animation mode off select anywhere in
this view pane here and press control a
and that will highlight everything and
you can actually group these items now
arrange group and now you can just go
down here to your little ball and move
it anywhere you want it to be I'm gonna
go right about there and I'm gonna
adjust my view pane a little to get it
right in the view I'm holding alt and
clicking down with my left mouse button
to drag the scene around you see that or
you can use the other mouse button and
go in and out alright so now let's look
at this timeline here cool that's
exactly what I want all right now I'm
gonna go to preview an export we're
going to do the same thing raster
generate all frames
okay now you press play and you'll see
what the final rendering will look like
looks like the screw is automatically on
its own going down into place or you
could put a big screwdriver driving it
down into place with it there's a lot of
different things you can do with Swift
3d and then you can export it for flash
you see right here target file type all
different types look at that in a
beautiful FLV whatever you want
avi Flash Player SWF I'm gonna choose
bitmap compression mess with the quality
and you can also change the anti
Alliance quality now you go to expel all
frames and let's put that on the day
stop let's call it my screw and then
save it and there you go now let's go
ahead and take a look at that I got so
much crap on my desktop where is it my
screw it's opening it up in the flash
player you see there that can be brought
right into flash and depending on the
background you set it it doesn't really
bring the background into play and you
can set anything you need to once in
flash you can put glow on an inner glow
outer glow whatever you want to do so
we'll do some more Swift 3d tutorials if
you guys are looking to see how to
animate things and make cool stuff in 3d
just let me know when I'll do it up
okay now I'm in my flash I'm gonna open
up flash ActionScript 3 project and I'm
gonna go to file import to library
and it's gonna give me the Browse
dialogue for my computer system and I'm
gonna go to my screw my screw that SWF
file is going to be imported into my
library and pen and drag this up a bit
let me change the background to black
and I'm gonna go into my library here
and you can see all the bitmaps that
make up that animation all the different
little bit maps but what you do is you
grab the movie clip usually at the
bottom there bring it in and now I can
even give it a filter it's good to
pretty glow let's make it glow bright
white or something very strong very
blurred nice high quality oh look at
that it's nice not too strong I should
be good all right now let's press
control enter and see what it gives you
see it that's in flash now and you can
put down on your webpage or you can give
it an inner glow like whatever you want
to do to make it look the way you need
it to and so that's in flash now and you
can put that on your web pages so you
achieve some really cool animations in
full 3d in real 3d using Twitter 3d and
importing into flash man so let me know
you want to see more I go I go a little
deeper I can make a shirt I can show you
how to make page transitions and
everything's really cool robotic 3-d
page transitions using Swift 3d if you
want to see I don't know
you guys gotta let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
