you'll be able to apply to your web
pages after watching this tutorial
it's a Twitter feed widget thing thing
thing blah blah blah that you can throw
on your web page of uh bobbers and i
show you how to do it dynamically in
case you have a community or social
network okay let's see it in action we
have a couple of members who probably
don't have one yet so you can see on my
profile it's showing my twitter feeds
from my flash building account now if I
go to worm racer oh wait he hasn't put
his Twitter name in yet so he has none
we made it to where it doesn't show up
at all if they have done but if you go
to the home page you'll see I asked a
couple of guys to throw in their Twitter
accounts and Lois Anderson through his
Oh see there's Louis's unique feed and
then we have another member who put his
in or he said he did and there they are
who blocks Killman
no this is for beginners who don't know
about to wear the goodies and they might
want to apply it to their various web
pages and this especially applies to
people who are following the web
intersex series or maybe somebody who is
building a custom community or social
network I'm gonna show you how to make
the widgets dynamic I believe the tweet
button is already dynamic so what the
tweet button is is something you can
slap on any web page that you have
control over it'll put a tweet button on
it anybody who pushes that tweet button
it'll just tweet it straight to their
profile so everybody that's following
them on Twitter will see your website
you'll get traffic and all that stuff
that's why the tweet button is very
effective the widgets is something that
will allow you to put all the latest
tweets from any any account really and
the button is where you can have a
little icon with the T on it
signifying Twitter so people can just
click that and start following any
account that you set up that button for
which that can be dynamic as well but
for this one I'm going to show you about
the widgets now if you go to widgets my
website this is where you can apply it
directly to your website taking the raw
code and what we're going to use is the
profile widget and user name will go
right here
and my username on Twitter is flash
building and actually if you want to
follow me on Twitter that's cool because
I don't really screw around on Twitter
and you can see all I do is I tweet each
one of my tutorials as I make them I
don't really go on there and be like
maybe once in a while I'll do something
goofy but usually all my tweets it's all
down the business each tutorial I put
out I tweet it but anyhow there's the
code a flash building Adam Cory on
Twitter and here are my latest tweets so
this is what it's going to look like on
my webpage so I'm gonna finish and grab
code and here's all the code for it I'm
gonna highlight all that press ctrl C
and now I'm going to apply that to my
web page and you'll see down here where
it says flash building this is what I'm
going to make dynamic I'm just gonna
request the members of web intersect put
in there let's see if I go to a web
intersect
see right here under account options
you'll see we're grabbing links and API
connections and all we have to do is add
one for Twitter you see we already have
the Facebook ID YouTube channel we're
requesting and the website and under
Facebook ID will put Twitter username
they'll add that and then on their
profile that little cool Twitter feed
box will show up wherever you want it so
I'm going to add it to my profile dot
PHP page and it will render dynamically
only if that person happens to have
given me their Twitter username okay so
the first step in adding that widget
dynamically to your community or social
network is we go into the edit profile
page edit profile dot PHP at web
intersect and we're going to put in a
new table row and you can see I already
added it right there right below the
Facebook table row for that forum so
we're going to gather there there it's
where to username in this input field
right here you can see it has the proper
ID and name so where the others are
parsing is we're going to parse this one
as well and we'll also have to add one
field to our database inside of PHP
myadmin
or you can write a little script that
will apply a new field into your
database table so right here where it
says Facebook I'm gonna put the Twitter
make sure we initialize that variable
and where are we right here location
info picture upload links here it is
right here and we're stripping
everything but letters uppercase
lowercase and numbers if you want to let
them out of space you can put that right
there but for now we're just going to
take uppercase lowercase letters and
numbers for their twitter username now
here we're going to update my members
website YouTube Facebook and we're going
to add a new one here after Facebook for
the Twitter a new field insertion
or update a no field update right there
twitter variable goes into the twitter
field that we're going to add to the
mysql database right now
okay now this is very simple to do we go
to the structure of our my members table
within PHP myadmin look for table my
members right under where it says
YouTube and Facebook there we want to
add a new field so let's just go down
here after Facebook go it's going to add
one field after Facebook that field
we're gonna call it Twitter this is
going to be I guess varchar' let's just
make it 255 because that's the max
anyway for save and now under Facebook
we have a field called Twitter that's
waiting for when our users fill in that
form field we just put into the edit
profile page it will go into this
Twitter field slot and that will hold
their Twitter account username and then
finally in your profile page all you
have to do your profile that PHP script
that shows all your different members
all you have to do is dynamically render
it out like we're doing the rest so I
put it into a mechanism to display
Twitter tweet widget or not here just
like we have mechanism to display
Facebook profile link or not or the
youtube link or not we do the same thing
for the Twitter widget so it only
renders if they happen to have that
information there with us if not nothing
rendered if they do have it we render
the nice little widget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
