today because I'm doing just fine that
text typing animation that is the intro
to this video tutorial is what you'll be
learning how to create flash using just
ten lines of actionscript 3.0 so open up
your flash CS whatever version you use
on I don't care and will show you how to
do it ok let's create a new ActionScript
3 file I change my stage to black change
the size from 550 width to maybe 680 you
can make yours whatever size you want my
frame rates 30 frames per second and the
frame rate for this little application
is going to have an effect on the
animation its speed and I'll discuss
that I'll show you what I mean
that's okay already let's create another
layer the top layer we're going to
rename a s 3 short for ActionScript 3
bottom layer stuff so on the stuff layer
you can lock the ActionScript 3 layer so
you don't accidentally put anything
there and on the stuff layer I'm going
to put a text field this is a dynamic
text field I'm going to type a few
letters into it they get the exact font
that I want you can see the font that I
have is Schwarzwald and it's very
important that if you're going to use
custom fonts that you use character
embedding because even though you see it
doesn't mean everybody else is going to
see that font because if they don't have
this certain font installed on their
system a default font like Arial or some
other thing will take over and show in
that spot where that custom font should
be so if you don't embed only your going
to see your cool font so if you want
everybody to see it like it should be
displayed if you're using a cool custom
font make sure you embed that fun
so you format your text field you get it
set up to the color you want it the font
that you want it to be alignment and
everything about it you can even put
filters on it if you want to have it
glow or anything like that drop shadow
whatever I'm going to remove all the
text out of this field and it's a
dynamic text field I'm going to give it
an instance name of T F short for tech
field now that's it that's all you have
to put on stage and now we'll go up into
our ActionScript 3 layer
highlight that frame and press f9 or you
can hit window actions so you open up
your actions panel the first thing we'll
do is create a couple of variables the
first one we're going to name my string
that's going to be a string type equal
to whatever you want to have in your
string so you put string data there as
much as you want to it could be
paragraphs and paragraphs and pages and
pages or however much you want and
here's a little trick you might want to
know you put a backslash n if you want a
line break put backslash n if you want a
double line break so you put backslash n
put one line break you put two of them
together to make double line break
easily in your string you just type in
another line right there okay the next
variable is going to be an array so
we'll call that my array that is an
array it's equal to my string so you can
grab that variable whatever the string
data is here split so you type dot split
open parenthesis type in a set of double
quotes close your parentheses type in
semicolon so what that's going to do is
going to take this string the whole
string no matter how much you have in
there and it's going to take it and cut
it by each character if I was to put the
string the substring of data right there
it would cut it by the word data so
there would be two parts to the array
that I get but since I'm claiming
nothing there it's going to cut it by
each character so my array will be full
of however many characters there are in
my string so using split on the string
we'll break it down like that into an
array and I'm going to show you why I do
that in one second now here we're going
to add an event listener so let's type
in an add event listener
open close parenthesis semicolon and in
between your parentheses you type in
event enter frame comma and you can name
this event function whatever you want
I'm going to call it frame looper
because that's basically what an inter
frame event does if you're not familiar
with what enter frame event does in
ActionScript is it allows you to loop
over the frame and it'll loop slower or
faster depending on how fast you have
your frames per second in your movie
so yours can be 24 or 30 or whatever and
it's going to loop that fast over this
frame 24 times a second so 24 times a
second I wanted to run this function so
let's type in function frame looper open
parenthesis type in event colon event
closed parenthesis colon void open curly
brace go down a couple lines close your
curly brace and there's your function
nest for your frame looper function now
within this function here you can just
type in TF which is that text field on
stage you target that by using it's
instance name there dot append text and
this is how you append a text field and
I would just put the values that I want
to append right here so if I wanted to
append hello into that text field that's
how I would do it right there but I'm
going to do it dynamically by using that
array and since I'm doing it within an
animated frame looper function there
it's going to give me an animated
effector so instead of typing in a
static value in between the parentheses
there we type in my array dot shift and
I'll explain to you exactly what that
does in just a second now what shift
will do on an array is it'll pop just
the first element off of the array right
off of the front of the array so let's
say you have an array or a string and
then you split that string then you have
an array of all those characters my
first character is going to be that
capital
so the first element of myarray is going
to be a capital P the second item or
element in my array is going to be that
lowercase u third is going to be the T
and so on so what happens is you're
appending to the textfield
whatever that first element is whatever
that letter or character is so when you
take that off of the array that P is not
going to be there anymore so that means
the next time this function runs it's
going to put in the U then that you
won't be there anymore in the array and
the next time the function runs it's
going to put in that T that T won't be
there in the array array anymore because
it's been plucked out and printed into
the text field or appended to the text
field but we have to put in just a
couple of more lines because if we left
this just like it is here when the array
was finally emptied after you shift it
so many times it won't have any more
characters left in it or array elements
and you'll get an error in your
ActionScript so you have to put a simple
if and else evaluation statement to take
care of that so right here
we say if my array dot length is greater
than zero
that means we know we can keep shifting
so let's close off that curly bracket
there and then let's put an else
statement open curly brace and close
curly brace in the else statement you
just want to remove this event listener
which is the frame looper because after
all of your elements have been shifted
out of the array you can go ahead and
remove this into frame event because it
won't be needed anymore everything is
done typing and animating to that text
field all right now let's press control
enter and that looks good and keep in
mind that you would probably want to
have a lot more text if you're going to
use something like this or maybe just
one long line of text and make sure you
your frame rate because you can see how
it will dramatically slow things if you
bring your frame rate down
okay so let's discuss the script logic
you can see it's ten lines that's lean
and mean for what it does all right so
just so everybody understands let's
break it down one more time we're
creating two variables the first one is
a string variable and that holds
whatever you want the next is an array
which is your string variable split by
each character then you add an event
listener which is an inter frame event
which is kind of like an animating frame
looper then the corresponding function
for that event listener this function
frame looper which fires off in my case
26 times per second within the function
you run this if and else statement and
the if condition is if my array dot
length is greater than zero then and
only then will I keep shifting my array
plucking things off of the front and
throwing them into the text field else
I'm going to remove the event listener
which is the enter frame event for
animating things because that's not
needed anymore
and I definitely will not do any more
shifting if this else condition happens
if the issue if the if condition rings
true then and only then will this happen
because like I said if your array gets
down to zero elements inside of it and
you try and shift it you're going to
have errors in your script so you can
see ten lines of code and that's how
it's done
so we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
