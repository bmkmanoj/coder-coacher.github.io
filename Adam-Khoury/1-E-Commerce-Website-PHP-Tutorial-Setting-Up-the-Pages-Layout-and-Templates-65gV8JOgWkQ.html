begin with part 1 of our e-commerce
website building lesson series if you
don't happen to know what an e-commerce
website is you can give it a wiki right
now and that'll save me 5 minutes of
trying to tell everybody what ecommerce
website is alright before we get started
in part 1 here we have to let you know
that we're going to be using PHP which
is a dynamic scripting language that
we're going to use to build our shopping
cart and we're also going to use to
interact with our MySQL database so
we're using PHP for our dynamic
scripting language which is the
necessary thing for a system like this
and we're using MySQL database which is
also a necessary thing for a system like
this both are free and open-source and
they work on pretty much any website
host server online and PHP and MySQL are
pretty simple and the way we'll explain
it to you it will be it'll be pretty
painless even if you don't know it or
haven't worked with those technologies
before alright so it also help if you
have HTML and CSS skills just a little
bit to be able to understand what we're
doing when we're laying out things on a
web page and I'm going to be working in
Dreamweaver cs4 you might be in
Dreamweaver cs5 same thing pretty much
so there won't be very much difference
even if you're working in Dreamweaver 8
from way back when pretty much same
thing or if you're working in notepad
plus plus or something like that we're
going to release all the source code so
you won't have any issues with what we
were typing out maybe you didn't see
some period or dot or semicolon that was
in just the right spot and you missed it
and your scripts not working right don't
worry because I'm going to release all
the source code free so I'm working in
Dreamweaver cs4 to assemble all the
source code for the system all right
let's start banging out some pages now
let's create a new actually before we
start making any pages let's just go to
our desktop or any location in your
computer where you want to set up your
store and let's put a new folder I'm
going to call it
my online store so that'll be the main
root folder for my website go to
Dreamweaver and let's create a new PHP
file now let's go to file save as find
that folder you just made where it's
empty inside we're going to put in index
as a title for this PHP document if
you're creating in Dreamweaver it'll
automatically have the PHP extension
when you save it so you see we have
index dot PHP that's the home page of
your website there's the code view
there's design view now we're not going
to set up the home page just yet we're
going to layout every page and script
that the whole system is going to need
to run at a basic level and then we'll
go adding things to the pages that we
need all right now we have our home page
now let's file save as category dot PHP
save now let's save category dot PHP as
product list so category is the page
product underscore list dot PHP let's
say you have shirts jeans socks and
shoes all under the category of clothing
that means when the person clicks
clothing they're going to go to the
category a PHP page and they'll see
shirts 50 of their shoes and whatever
that you have anything that's in that
category you can put an icon for
whatever that they can click on and see
those items product list page is where
the actual all the actual pants or all
the shirts or all the socks and all the
various different shoes will be on a
product list page then file save as
product now this page is going to be the
one that displays individual products
and we'll have the Buy Now button on it
or Add to Cart button and it will have
all the details of the product ok so for
the main directory of our website
we just need one more file so file save
as we're going to save product PHP as
cart PHP and this is the page that when
they're viewing a product and all its
details and they have the Add to Cart
button on that page when they click Add
to Cart then they are ushered to the
cart which will show them all the items
that they want to buy from our website
within that shopping or that visit
alright now that we have all the files
for our root directory of the base
system of the store let's go to that
folder on our desktop my online store
and these are the files that we've saved
into it so far really we haven't put
anything into those files just yet we're
just setting up the structure of the
website all the pages and scripts is
going to need so inside of this folder
let's create new folder and let's call
it store scripts this will be where most
of the dynamics happen within the whole
system now within Dreamweaver we're
going to create three more miles and
that'll be it to run the whole system
let's take cart PHP file save as go into
the store scripts folder that we just
created and let's rename this render
cart and this will be a file that we
need in order to render the shopping
cart to the customer save update links
no so let's take render cart now file
save as connect to MySQL and this will
be the central file that we use to
connect to our stores database database
connection for the the customers table
the transactions table and your products
table save as alrighty
okay file save as last one this one
we're going to call paypal ipn because
in our system we're going to use PayPal
as a gateway so just name that paypal
IPN
all one word all lowercase and we're
using PayPal as our payment gateway
because it's the most widely used in the
world the most trusted and I think it's
the most secure even though they have
had some problems in the past that's
what happens when you're the big dog
online you get a lot of focus put on you
and a lot of pressure put on you PayPal
is definitely the king of online
transactions that's for sure nobody can
argue that so PayPal ipn script is going
to be the one that when people check out
we're going to be able to talk to PayPal
behind the scenes and we'll be able to
see what they bought when they bought it
what their name is and their email
address and certain things like that and
on the site you have to let people know
that you are going to be collecting that
sort of data from them in your terms of
use and you might also have to get
yourself an SSL certificate and we're
going to discuss more about that when we
talk about choosing our online payment
gateway because there's other choices
out there besides PayPal there's a lot
more choices besides PayPal but we'll
talk more about that in part 4 choose a
payment processor all right here I am in
fireworks and I just threw out some
custom text put a little drop shadow on
it and gradient on the text the file
export wizard I'm in fireworks cs4 I'm
going to save it as an optimized JPEG
use this as my logo it's going to sit up
in the header export find your website
and at this point we don't have a style
folder yet so let's create that style
and inside the style folder that we just
created we're going to put this file in
there call it logo it'll be logo JPEG
save as alright alright let's go into
code view of the index dot PHP homepage
change this to say let's make it a store
homepage you'll see in the head section
here
of the file there's no styling it set up
so you can go to the design view hit
page properties down here in Dreamweaver
and you can apply some CSS just to get
it going for yourself real easy so if
you want to change the default page want
to say a standard Arial let's press
apply and you'll see that in your code
view now let's press ok actually let's
apply the link CSS here to the link
color I want to be always bright blue
like that and rollover I want them to
become black there we go okay press
apply
okay now go into the code view and you
can see within the head section of that
file there is now a style tag with some
CSS inside of it now we're going to take
this CSS and we're going to make our
little CSS style external CSS style
sheet with it
press ctrl X so all you're left with is
the style tag and those are rows there
go to file new CSS right there you can
get rid of that if you want and then
paste in control V paste in your styling
that you put within the index type PHP
file
so we save this file save this style
sheet in the style folder and let's name
it style so it'll be style dot CSS save
now in the index dot PHP file we can
remove this style tag altogether and
right here in line six we'll add the
link to the external style dot CSS sheet
that way in each file that we have the
category page product list product page
the card any page on our site we can
feed it that same style sheet that way
all of our links will be uniform
throughout all pages all of the styling
will be uniform throughout all
okay here's the link to your stylesheet
okay so in the home page here right
there in the body tag I'm going to slap
a did so here's my div and it says
content for new did that goes here
inside of it so what I'm going to name
this is div ID main wrapper I'm going to
align Center it that way anything that I
put within this div tag now will be
centered on my page
okay so let's pop in three more divs one
for the header one for the page body
section or the main content section and
then one for the page footer and don't
worry we'll be using some tables soon
enough there's no one let's give an ID
and this is all for the CSS stylesheet
if you're wondering let's give this an
ID of page header so there's one div
that's set up for the page header ready
to go and what you can do is in your
stylesheet now that this has an ID of
page header within your stylesheet you
can put a definition for that ID and
that will style the header on all of
your pages that you have this div ID set
on there's one for the main content of
the page and there's one for the page
footer so let's name these appropriately
page footer page content there now you
get a div setup for your page header
page content and page footer
now you can style each one of those
independently within your style sheet
and I'll be showing you how to do that
don't worry now let's just go in
tourists let's grab that name right
there that ID let's go into our style
sheet just put a pound sign and then
that that ID name open curly brace
or curly bracket close curly bracket and
there you have a nice little spot where
you can put in any CSS if you're in
Dreamweaver and you go up to the curly
brace and you press Enter it shows you
all of the options all the styling and
CSS that you can add to it now let's
just make one for the page content and
page footer as well and I'll show you
how this works in just a second and why
we're doing it
okay now let's demonstrate why we're
doing this and how it works if I say
wanted all say I wanted all of my text
in my header to be color of red and then
in the content I wanted a color of green
and then in my footer section of my
website I wanted all of the text to be
color of let's say that purple or
magenta I save press ctrl s on the
stylesheet and back in my index file I
just put test put some test text save
that go to design view you see it's red
in that div green and that div magenta
in this div now that's a pretty weak
example of why we're doing that but just
think of it this way say I wanted all of
these pages had the header and the
footer and everything and I wanted to
change the color of my footer text to a
light gray or something like that I
won't have to go into all of these
different pages and change it I just go
into my stylesheet page footer color
gray
and there it is
you go back to the index file it would
be grey on all of the different pages so
that's why we're just setting up smart
from the beginning that way we have a
more modular design and a modular layout
but what I do want for each one of those
containers is so if you go back to the
index page you can see there now it's a
single line between each section in the
header div we want to get our logo so
here I'm going to put I think I'm going
to put a table here I'm going to make it
have one row two columns okay now you
can see I have a table there you can
manipulate it a little bit and right
here I'm going to add go into the style
folder and there's your logo alternate
text just say logo okay and you can put
a link on that to your home page
index.php or you can just put the whole
HTTP to your website for that I'm just
going to put index dot PHP make sure
it's border zero so that blue line
doesn't show up around it anyways in the
header you have room here you can even
give this table some padding maybe
twelve
and now in the header you have some room
and I have the other side of this table
the other column here with all kind of
room that I can put whatever I want and
it's very maneuverable and easy to
adjust in Dreamweaver here you can put
as many columns as you want you can also
put another row in there which we might
wind up doing to put a little menu
system okay so just like I said I'm
going to add another row real quick
right here and it's going to be a menu
system so let's just go ahead and merge
these two cells
inside of one you can put your cursor
drag and make sure you highlight both of
them go down here merge says merge
selected cells using spans so now it's
one big cell and you can put a bunch of
links in there so you can put home link
1 link 2 Link 3 and so on and so forth
make all of those links right now but we
won't assign them to go anywhere in
particular but let's just get them
linked and blue or link active and now
if you go into the code you'll see that
you've made links out of each one of
those little words and they don't have a
destination yet there's no where they're
navigating to the pound sign just makes
it navigate to the page it's already on
it's just a way to make a link holder
until you assign what you want it to be
actually this one is going to be
definitely the index dot PHP page or you
can go to your full HTTP comm for the
home link okay now we're going to make
this header dynamic and it'll be a
region template that we can feed into
each file of our website okay so let's
get the code for the whole div ID page
header which is this whole thing right
here so you can just grab the whole page
header div control X now let's use one
of these files we already have sitting
open here you could also use the index
file itself just press ctrl save file
save as template header save in the new
template header file you have now
put that code in that's just the div ID
page header everything inside that div
go back to your index file and where you
took that div out now you go to PHP add
a PHP block and now we just simply
include once within parenthesis we'll
put template header this way if you ever
need to make changes to the information
within the template header you won't
have to do it on your home page category
page product list page product page cart
page
blah blah blah however many pages you
have on your site you just change those
things in one template file now you do
the same thing here with the page footer
include one template footer which we
don't have it but we're going to create
that in just a second let's take this
control X go to template header file
save as name it template footer Save put
the code for the footer in that div id
page footer you go back to index out PHP
now you can see that you're dynamically
rendering in your header now and you're
dynamically rendering your footer now
and it will be that same format for your
category page product list page because
all page need to be different is the
content section
so let's look in the design view and you
can see it looks exactly the same as it
did before the headers there even though
it's only a PHP block which is the
smarter way to program a website if you
have PHP capabilities I think we'll
continue on in part two where we get
some products going and list them on the
home page and we build the MySQL it's
going to hold all of our inventory we'll
put some products in we'll get them to
list Dinah
quickly and we'll get the rest of these
pages going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
