actionscript 3 lesson I'm going to knock
out two birds with one stone we have two
tutorial requests at develop PHP take
care of both of them right now one is
how to build and understand working with
arrays and then the second one is making
cool transition text effects and logo
effects on text and making sentences all
through code nothing manual on the
timeline and here's the finished product
you can see I have nothing on stage it's
all code look at that again pretty nice
and you can thank Mazel and I forgot the
name of the other member who requested
the transition effects on the text ok
here we are in the developed PHP com
forum and the requested tutorial section
and we have a long time very active
member of our site Mizuki who asks about
using arrays and he says I sort of kind
of understand a raise I know what they
do and how they operate but building one
is a different story when would be a
good time to use an array and what kind
of applications use arrays and only use
arrays a tutorial on arrays would be
pretty friggin sweet I think anyways I
hope I used the word arrays are not pay
I think you did and this was maybe a
week ago and so I thought I'd tackle it
for him since he saw active and he does
a lot for the site and around the site
so i'm going to show you guys how to
build an array how to work with it and
best of all I'm going to knock out two
birds with one stone and show you how to
create cool text animations through
script scripted text animations okay
here i am in flash cs3 and you can be in
cs4 and this code will all still
work and apply so let's click flash
actionscript 3 file and I'm going to
adjust my stage the way it looks
changing background to black size yours
could be you know the size of a huge
website or whatever you have going on
but I'm just going to make mine sighs I
need it not too big maybe 124 high so I
don't need very much just going to
display a cool text scripted text effect
in there alright so when working with
arrays and if you're inside of a movie
clip or deep deep deep into movie clips
inside of your your movie then you can
you can put this in the timeline inside
of any movie clip and use the
positioning to have the line of text
animate out anywhere you need to ok so
the first thing I'll do is just name
this as3 because that's the only layer
that I'm going to need I'm not going to
have any physical elements placed on
stage really so open the actions panel
by pressing f9 ok and the first thing
I'm going to do is import the
transitions needed the native
transitions for making things move and
that's at bella transitions dot all and
FL transitions not easy at all and these
are necessary for the movements we're
going to have on the text now the second
thing I'm going to do is build the array
now let's talk about the I'll show you a
simple array structure and there's three
types of arrays let me just press ctrl v
there we go okay here's my array so I
just claim a variable name of my array
the data type for this variable is array
hmm actionscript has several data types
and array is one of them that string
integer number and array is also a data
type so you start your array like that
and all you have to do is claim that the
array is equal to this string
and what the string contains is it's a
comma-delimited or comma separated
values so this is value 1 this is value
to this is value 3 and this has a key
index of one this has a key of two it
says actually this has a key of zero
because all the raised by default start
with the key index of zero so this has
key 0 key one key to key 3 and so on and
so forth and this is value zero this is
value one value to value three and you
can access arrays keys and values to
make programming a little more simple
when it comes to reusing things that
you've scripted out let's say if you
tried to make a cool text effect with
manually on the timeline by putting out
static text fields making them into
movie clips or whatever and animating
them into place and then say you wanted
to change things up it might be a little
difficult so this is a raise or a good
method of processing many things as
opposed to just one thing if that makes
sense and this type of array is just a
simple basic array and you can see it's
just values there and there's also
associative arrays and multi-dimensional
arrays and if you guys want a tutorial
on either of those associative or
multi-dimensional just let me know and
I'll bang it out for you it's not in
hard okay so let's move on here the next
thing we need is we're going to put it
into the script here is the formatting
or how we want our text to look each one
of these characters here in the array
each one of these letters we also have
spaces in there you'll notice they are
going to be made into text objects and
then thrown onto stage through code now
the first thing we want to do is make
sure we get the right format for those
and now you can see what I've done is
claimed the new text format
object and it's going to be have a very
variable name of my format so i can just
use my format here to add properties to
it so i had the color property to find
property and a size property size is 36
my font is however you say that conceal
ian and my font color is going to be
kind of like a darkish gray now conceal
en is one of my custom fonts that let's
see if you put out a text field type
something in it you can see that's one
of my custom fonts that doesn't come
native on everybody's computer so what
you might want to do is embed that font
so go to embed whichever font you pick
that's in your list and if it's a
special font that not many people might
have installed in their computer you
might want to embed it so it shows
correctly for no matter who's looking at
it no matter what they have on their
machine so you want uppercase lowercase
numerals punctuation ok already let's
just make that static static text
actually we don't even need it because
it's embedded now ok we're going to move
a little quicker here we have two
sections coming up all right this next
little section line 11 12 and 13 are
simple variables that we created to hold
numbers and those the exposition y
position and offset hold these values
these numbers it's that simple we're
going to use these in the script refer
to them through their variable name that
way we can access those numbers ok so
next thing we have on line 15 starts a
function and the functions name is trans
complete and that stands for the
transition being complete when each
letter is thrown onto stage and does its
little magical transition we want to
listen to when it's complete and then do
things accordingly and discuss more
about that in the next function that has
that piece of script in it so inside of
this function we have one condition an
if statement and the if statement
is checking to see if my array the
length of it is greater than zero if the
length of my array is greater than zero
we're going to run a function called
police letters let's get that function
now and explain it to you okay I have my
function here let's pop it in okay so it
starts at line 21 and so if the array
length is greater than zero we run this
function to place letters here's the
function place letters inside of it
first thing we do is we create a text
field this is the standard way of
creating any old text field in flash
through script okay so after we create
the text field instance it's not on
stage yet but we've created the object
next line is using a function that is
native to action script called shift and
it's made for working with the race and
what shift does is it pops or it grabs
it actually removes the first part of an
array the first value or the first key
index and its value which would be be in
this case so what's going to happen is
when that function runs the first time
place letters when that runs the first
time it's going to cut the first letter
over there and it's going to use it so
what happens is we say text field dot
txt which we're putting into the text
field that be because we use my array
chip that we pluck that be right off and
we pop it into the text field for
display so now the text field has a
value of B so now and the next time this
function runs it will have a value of a
then the lower case D then the space
then the upper case AE see how it goes
and this function is going to run over
and over and over until it gets to the
very end of your sentence or your word
and then it stops and that's how it
works it's beautiful so where are we
line 25 text field dot set text format
my format that's very simple
apply the format that we created for a
text field up here to the text field not
much to be said about that and var clip
movie clip is creating a new movie clip
object with the name of clip now we have
a new movie clip object and we can add
properties to that so we add child well
first we add child to it the text field
we placed the text field and its letter
value inside and the formatting and
everything inside of the movie clip name
clip then we say clip has an exposition
of expose which is our number here which
can be anything you need play around
those numbers and see what they do and
then the Y pose same thing so it gets
placed on stage at that position now the
first letter that gets placed is going
to be this position 12 and 24 the next
letter that gets placed has to have the
offset applied to it or it'll stack
right on top of the beat you'll have all
your leather stacked right on top of one
another if you don't offset it so you
place the offset value whatever you want
whatever spacing you want between each
letter these letters going to be a movie
clip remember okay so you can place them
wherever you need to using the little x
and y properties of that object okay so
the next thing we do is add child the
movie clip to stage at this point it
gets placed on the stage but before it
can really even get noticed within a
super millisecond this transition runs
on it now let me explain this transition
okay so to get the transition to work on
each little letter in the sentence to
give it a typing effect or zoomy effect
or a flashy of bagged or whatever kind
of transition or easing effect that you
want to use can be applied here so you
can listen to the complete event for the
easing or the transition manager effects
so i'm going to show you transition
matter of manager effect techniques and
if you need to see more
uh methods of using the transition
manager you can go to develop PHP in the
flash tabs the animation section in the
flash a tutorial category the animation
section we have a tutorial all about the
transition managers and scripting
transition effects okay so what we do
here is we claim a new object transition
manager and inside when we claim it we
give it an argument of clip and clip
being the movie clip object here that we
just created and added the text to
that's formatted with our cool for
madame una we put it into the transition
manager and with the transition manager
will do is snatch it up at that very
moment when we add the clip to stage the
transition manager will snatch it up and
do the effect on it so right here you
can claim I'm using two effects i'm
using photo and zoom to make a more
dynamic effect you can use as many as
you want together or just use one so
here is the two transitions that i'm
using and i'm not going to go very
in-depth about it because you can do
further research into the transition
manager class it'll show you all about
it and everything you can use and all
these values you can change so for the
sake of time and basically time i'm not
going to discuss everything you can
change that too we'll just show you the
cool effect and then you can get
intrigued about it and do your own
research sounds good so here in line 35
after we claim the transition they run
actually they add this very when these
lines execute the transition happens so
what we want to do is listen for the
transition complete event and to do that
with the transition manager we just say
transition manager which is the variable
we named for our transition manager add
event listener all transitions is done
in done trans complete so trans complete
is the function that we want to fire off
when this when this particular piece of
text has flown down into the position
trans complete function is this one here
that we claimed at the very beginning
the one that listens to see if the
arrays length is greater than zero and
then it runs dysfunction so these kind
of these functions play off of each
other in a boom boom boom boom boom
until the whole sentence is gone the
whole array has been plucked of all of
its values once it's empty this function
can't run anymore because that condition
won't meet and then the whole
application is done so let's see what we
get let's press ctrl enter
oh I forgot one thing very important
thing you have to make it viral off the
first time manually so place well not
manually but through script place
letters run that function that's how you
execute a function right there any
custom functions you may like this one
that I've made that's how you execute
them that's why we didn't see anything
press ctrl enter so the first time it
runs this makes it run but each
following time the the functions play
off of each bounce back off of each
other so let's press ctrl enter there we
have it that is beautiful all scripted
nothing on stage raise your framerate to
30 and then press ctrl enter you'll see
a nicer effect see that now you can
change all of these values to whatever
you like you can see I have the speed at
point three if I changed it to one and
this tool one you'll see that work looks
much slower see it's got a more bouncy
affect the little photos flash is taking
a little longer on it you might want
that slowness on it i don't know i like
the speed of point three for making a
little sentence really catch the users I
ok I'll have this source file available
a developed PHP under animations and
under the flash tab flash actionscript 3
under animations ok we'll see you next
