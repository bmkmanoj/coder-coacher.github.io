just starting out in flash so if you're
intermediate you can just go ahead and
bypass it but it's all about shape
gradient and Colour tweening and flash
hope you enjoy it's Adam again here
flash building and sorry for some of you
advance guys I'm going a little bit back
to basics because there's a tutorial I
want to create it's not in my site yet
but it's kind of basic so if you're very
advanced in flash and you know how to
shape between real well then skip battle
buddy get on out of here this one's for
beginners we're going to show you how to
shape tween if you don't understand
shape tweening gradient and Colour
tweening and all that good stuff it's
gonna be real quick short sweet so let's
go flash ActionScript 3 file or
ActionScript 2 it's just time line
animation so the ActionScript version
doesn't matter and this works in cs4
exactly the same okay now let's just
turn this thing to black canvas and
let's throw out a rectangle primitive
okay so for the first one I'm just going
to use a rectangle primitive and I'm
going to give it a gradient and let's
say we want that gradient to be colored
let's open the palette and change the
side that's white to that magenta color
there and we don't need an edge on it
now we're going to take the time line
and let's get this thing a little wider
6 for a sick for Eagle
okay now this one we're going to tween
back and forth maybe let's set up frame
rate up to 30 get a better animation to
see things better 25 to set a keyframe
and set another keyframe at 50 so at 25
we want to take it and put it over here
and this will be just a basic example
and we're going to between the color the
gradient and the placement of it okay so
let's go and create the shape tween you
can highlight each section create shape
tween and right-click create shape tween
or you can drag like I didn't make them
all black there and create shape tween
and it'll do it to the whole section
okay so anyways so now you can see we
have the movement so all we have to do
here on this frame is transform the
gradient go to gradient transform tool
and let's turn that gradient around
buddy and then go to the cut or whale
and where is magenta turn it to yellow
or something like that okay so now let's
press control enter okay so you can see
the gradient is transforming and for
tweening and the placement of the block
and the also the the color okay
so we can slow that down a little bit so
people can see it better in the demo
this demo will be at the site with all
the rest see then you can see it a
little better okay now let's do another
quick example let's grab the pencil
let's make a new layer right here let's
lock that layer that one's done
now let's grab the pen tool and I'm just
going to draw out some crazy cookie
shape doesn't matter what it looks like
okay no one's closed up I'm gonna
highlight it make it that blue color
there that's good and now I'm going to
make another keyframe on 45
and let's just get rid of this one
actually let's make it another keyframe
on 90 and on 245 let's grab that and
remove it
control X now let's take the pencil just
put another crazy shape over here
there we go now let me highlight this
one and we put a color on it right now
let's create shape tween create shape
tween okay so now let's press control
enter so you see the outline shape of
the or the out the outline of the shape
will also tween there and let's see what
else can we show you about this okay so
for a last little quick example I'll
just make another layer let's lock that
previous layer and the new layer I'm
going to place just a rectangle
primitive with a gradient something like
that and let's give it a gradient fill
now let's go ahead and to the color
wheel and let's put white in the center
or some other color that we want to
start with and on the edges we can make
it any color we want
I'm not going to go with black since my
background is black so I'll go with it
just a gray
okay now I'm gonna set some keyframes
let's say at 20
then 40 and 60 then
eighty thanks good now let's just bring
this one out to the end here now what
I'm going to do is go to frame 20 and
I'm going to transform the gradient I'm
going to show you how to get a nice
revolution so revolve it and change the
colors at the same time sort of like
what we're doing up top there but this
is a cool effect for like audio players
and such okay let's change that color to
any color we want
there are no mistakes in our world just
happy accidents okay so now let's go to
the next keyframe I like that let's
transform that grade gradient change the
color to a different way yellow that'll
work and then the next transform this
gradient around even more almost to a
full revolution and change the color so
whatever we like let's go with the blue
okay now let's shape tweening this whole
thing grab this highlight it make it all
black through there and then right click
create shape tween now let's press
control enter see there it makes like a
cool disco ii effect since it's really
cool for audio players when you've got
music bumpin i think that's a really
cool animation to have going with music
and if you're slick you can tie it to
the amplitude in ActionScript 3 mp3
amplitude to where this thing will jump
to the beat well so that'll be
funky-fresh you should do that
right now go alright anyway this one is
for beginners to just understand shape
tweening real quick and carry on by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
