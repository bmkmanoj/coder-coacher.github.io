create a website the right way for
beginners part 5 and at this point we
have our whole layout set up we're using
include files external CSS we want to
make sure our layout at this point
before we add anything to the header of
the pages or any menu systems that
evaluates at w3c so let's go there now
you just go to Google search website
validation or any search and let's put
in our URL web intersect comm check
beautiful I have the green light I
passed now it says I can add this to my
website to show it's as you may display
this icon on any web pages that
validates to show your readers that you
have taken the care to create an
interoperable web page so let's grab
that I don't really need the P tag I
just want to a P tag is a paragraph tag
which you don't really need so down here
in the include footer I'm going to go
and put where it says validation links
go into the code view there right there
in that div I'm gonna put a couple of
the line breaks they're mine 3 i'm going
to put in that little linking cool they
gave me and next to that i'm going to
put a couple of spaces and dreamweaver
you can just press ctrl shift space put
a few spaces in there let's go back to
the validation service let's check our
CSS it says validating CSS style sheets
if you use CSS in your document you can
check it using w3c CSS validation
service let's do that now put your
website's URL or any page that you want
to check into that field press check
and congratulations know CSS errors so I
want to show people that too that I
taking the time even though I don't have
much on my site yet it's not much really
to be validated but it's handy now this
way let's make sure these have a border
of zero this one as well because if
their links and you don't have a border
of zero one of their going to have that
ugly blue link border around them so now
let's click let's save that include
footer file let's go two vials illa
again an ftp that include photo file
backup I'll show you what that does now
I'll show you why it's handy to do this
at this early stage in the process let's
go back to web intersect there we go now
let's refresh on the bottom you see we
have two links now to image links one
that goes to validate this website's URL
the any page that it's on so if this is
on the contact page the about Us page
the inventory page it's going to check
that page because of the code that's
used here you can see it's referring to
the referrer which means whichever page
it's asking for and also the same with
the CSS i do believe let's see check
referrer yes so with the CSS it'll do
the same thing let's check it so now
even anybody else who's visiting your
website can click that little icon and
say wow it is pretty impressive he's got
interoperable website now many people
support these icons you know why because
not many people can know how to program
a website that looks good that then they
could support these icons on even
develop PHP I had it validating for two
years straight I switch host like three
weeks ago and now all of a sudden it
doesn't validate I'm gonna have to
change a little bit of the code and I
think it has something to do with my PHP
any vial or maybe my HT Access file
getting switched a little bit but it's
no big deal develop PHP pretty much the
whole thing almost the whole site
validates
there's a few things on it right now
that make it not validate and it's a
pretty bangin looking site and so is
this one this one's going to be awesome
looking and I'm going to make sure that
this one validates the whole time all
through production after i put menus
headers page content I'm going to keep
these here and make sure on my site
validates the whole time now I'm going
to check in safari firefox chrome and
internet explorer to make sure it looks
exactly the same and all four of those
well derp I don't know why I said
internet explorer because I'm in
internet explorer right now press ctrl-c
on my URL there minimize Internet
Explorer let's open up safari so I don't
have to check internet explorer since
that's the one I use mostly a lot of
people knock me for using it mainly but
I use all of these suckers when I'm
designing sites I use all the major
browsers to check it see what it looks
like all my pages in all that in
browsers pop that URL in press ENTER and
here come the graphics there we go now
any page you go to this header file is
loaded in and all these graphics are
loaded into cash persons browser cache
let's go to about that PHP you see it
didn't even have to load that headed
back in super fast go back to the home
page refresh it super fast that's a fast
loading site and it validates so we got
Safari check let's go to Firefox
man Firefox takes a long time to load I
hate Firefox so I'm sitting in waiting
on it might as well say I hate it well I
got nothing else to do hey yeah I really
don't like Firefox you know why look at
the text watch this I'm what are you
guys something let's go to the homepage
google's homepage and internet explorer
look at look at the text it's nice
crispy it's just like it should be
Safari it looks even better look at a
Firefox why is the text looks so crappy
even on the buttons look at that s I'm
going to zoom in with the camera look at
that s now look at internet explorer
look at that s all the text looks a lot
smoother and cleaner ah just from a
designer's point of view I don't like
Firefox just for that fact alone that it
makes my text look like crap so let's go
to our URL in Firefox a lot of
developers like to use firefox because
they're super geeks but they don't
understand that most of their clients
are using chrome and internet explorer
hate to tell you okay so it will be
passed in Firefox now last one is Chrome
it all loads up
there you go
now you go to the about page mine is
taking a little longer to load into the
browser's because I have several
programs that are connected right now
that are for instance i'm uploading
video to youtube my wife's on the other
computer in the living room sucking up
bandwidth playing farmville on facebook
all kind of crap that's why if you see
any these this image taking a second to
load that's why that's happening
normally it's super fast you can go to
web intersect right now and see how fast
it'll load and once that header is
loaded in any page you go to it doesn't
have to reload it you see you refresh it
boom okay okay so we'll see you in part
6 where we will add some things to the
page and I think part 6 will call it
quits unless you guys are real hooked on
this series and you want to see more
cool stuff that i might add to my site
maybe we can go a little farther who
knows bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
