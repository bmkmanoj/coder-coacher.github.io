search scripting and interfacing this
lesson is another that comes from a
viewer request so first let's take a
look at this viewers request so we can
all get a good feel for the meet of the
lesson I'm a new programmer and I need
help making an A through Z search on my
page using only letters A through Z
please can you help the first thing
we'll do is make an example that HTML
page this is where you would have your
button so any page where you want to
have your buttons show up or your links
for a through Z this is the code that
you would put on that page first up in
the head tag we're going to open a
script element and make sure we go down
a couple of lines and close that script
element the first thing in the script
element we're going to create a variable
called buttons so we'll just call it BTN
s for short is equal to nothing at first
then under that you want another
variable named letters and make that
equal to a string with a through Z in it
ABCD WXYZ now what we're going to do is
take this string this is now a string
object and we're going to take that and
split it to create an array and the
variable name for that array will be
letter array now in order to split that
string of letters we're going to say
letter array is equal to letters dot
split and then you can put the separator
you want in between parentheses of the
split function or the split method and
the separator I want will be nothing so
if I wanted to separate by space I would
just put a space there if I happen to
have words in that string then I could
get an array of all the words in that
string but I don't have any spaces in
that string so I'm going to put nothing
there and what it'll do is split by each
character in the string so this letter
array will be an array that's made up of
all these different characters each
character in the alphabet will be its
own array item in this letter array and
the reason why we're putting everything
into an array like this is so you don't
have to write 27 or 26 links on the page
and you don't have to write 26 buttons
on the page you can write those in a
loop
long as you have the array set up like
this so I'll show you how to get all of
the buttons for the alphabet on the page
using just like three lines instead of
26 now after the letter array is
established I'm going to set up a for
loop with an index of 27 so basically
this for loop will run 27 times or
however many times you need it to run
you just change that number here and
also you can try to use the letter array
dot length property and put it right
there have it a little more dynamic if
you don't want to have a static number
there now each time this for loop runs
so each pass of this for loop we're
going to put a line in place that
establishes a letter variable that will
represent each letter individually
within the array now to get each letter
popped off of the front of this array
each time the loop passes you say letter
array dot shift now what that does is
the first time this loop runs is it pops
the a right off of this array so you'll
your or your string array will look like
this the a will be off of the front of
the array it'll already be processed
into your data handling then the second
time the loop runs the B comes off so
that's what shift does it just keeps
shifting the first character off the
front of the array so the first array
item gets shifted right off the front of
the array okay does that make sense so
that's what shift does now remember that
buttons variable that we created up top
here we're now going to append to that
variable a whole bunch of little buttons
so you say BTN s plus equals to append
if you just wanted to put the one value
into that variable you would just use
the equal sign but since we want to
append and not overwrite that variable
every pass of the loop we want it to
append that's why we're going to put the
plus sign so it doesn't get overwritten
each button being laid into this
variable will not overwrite the ones
before it so you can compound HTML data
into a variable this way and then simply
in the body
right this line so you open up the
script element and make sure you close
it here and inside of your script
element you simply write document dot
write all of your buttons to the page
now press ctrl s and run this in your
favorite browser software you see what
you get a through Z now what if i click
one of those letters see I get an M
because in the what I did was I ran a
little JavaScript alert on the on click
event of that button so each button has
an on click event with an alert that
shows the value of the letter it's
coming through the loop and the letter
value also shows on the button itself as
you can see now keep in mind these don't
have to be buttons and you can style
these buttons any way that you want for
instance you can give these a class if I
wanted to say button class equals my BTN
s and then all I have to do in my CSS in
my head element of the page my CSS just
put a class for my buttons style them
any way I want and if you don't like
this dynamic approach you can just
statically write 26 buttons to the page
one for each letter of the alphabet I
just thought I would show you guys a
more programmatic approach a dynamic
approach at this point in your
application production you have to think
to yourself do I want Ajax to handle the
data gathering from PHP so I don't have
to refresh or reload the whole page or
do I want to take a more traditional
approach where I can have my buttons on
any page and then I send the user to a
search results PHP script where PHP
picks up the search variable and renders
results on a separate page so that's
what we're going to do we're going to
take a more traditional approach for
this lesson but keep in mind that you
guys can easily set up Ajax requests and
I'll show you how right now
if you want this all to be Ajax you can
just say Ajax requests instead of alert
now you have a function called Ajax
requests on the on click event now you
have to write that Ajax request function
and you're going to be sending in
and the dynamic letter variable so right
under the for loop you can just save
function Ajax request open close
parenthesis opening curly brace and
closing curly brace now here where you
intake the dynamic argument you just put
in le T short for letter then you can
just make another alert here for
developer purposes and you'll clearly
see how you can easily Ajax this
variable of letter or let to PHP you can
simply ajaxify the whole thing so I'll
write in the alert Ajax send the
variable space and then outside of my
double quotes I'll put that variable in
the dynamic variable in the string and
then on the other side of the string
let's write to PHP now so that's what
Ajax is made for and I'm not going to
show you guys Ajax requests tutorials
every time that I talk about using Ajax
in one of my tutorials I've made tons of
tutorials that show Ajax requests
without using any frameworks or
third-party libraries and Ajax requests
is just a few lines of code and any
nincompoop can program it especially if
all your objective is to send one
variable to PHP you can send a whole
slew a whole group of variables to PHP
using raw Ajax but if you just want to
send one variable post it to a PHP
script it's not rocket science it's only
a few lines of code I got plenty of
tutorials on it at develop PHP com
so I'm not going to be showing you guys
an ajax requests tutorial within this
tutorial and i'm going to try not to
make redundancy in my tutorials all
right now run this in your favorite
browser so if I click the letter P it
says Ajax send the variable P to PHP now
if I click X Ajax send the variable X to
PHP now so you run a simple Ajax request
post the variable of letter whatever the
letter is to the PHP script the PHP
script is going to query the MySQL
database spit results back straight to
Ajax and that's how Ajax works but since
I'm going to show a more traditional
approach in this lesson
to navigate to a search results page
we're going to take a more simplistic
approach
so in this Ajax request actually let's
just change this function to my search
or actually let's name it alphabet
search and make sure you take that name
copy and also put it here in your on
click event oh we don't want a capital
there let's just camel case that so we
got alphabet search and alphabet search
matching there now what you're going to
do is send them to window dot location
is equal to whatever a file that you
want to send them to and then all you do
is append that variable as a dynamic get
URL variable I'll show you how all that
works so let's name the page we're going
to send them to search result dot PHP
then you put a question mark to append a
dynamic variable onto the end of this
URL and let's just put an L and that
stands for letter actually let's just
put letter to make it very clear to
everyone is equal to and then outside of
the double quotes you just put plus let
it places this dynamic argument of
letter right here so now all you need is
a search results PHP page setup to
intake this dynamic get variable of
letter I so you go to file new make
yourself a new PHP script then you're
going to pop it in code that looks
similar to this the first thing you do
is just establish a results and letter
variables you're just initializing those
or defining them now before you can run
code that's going to search the database
you have to have in some kind of if
condition to see what the user is
searching for and to make sure that
those variables are set so we say if is
set the post or actually these are get
variables you can use get or post so if
you want to setup each of your buttons
in your HTML side of things to use a
form for each of the buttons or you can
use one single form for all of the
buttons you can do something like that
or you can just use a get variable so
you can use forms or actually JavaScript
you can set up code in JavaScript where
you wouldn't have to use forms but you
can still post that variable without
Ajax if all you want to do is relocate
the location of the page to search
results so let's say this page has
search results dot PHP okay so now let's
fix this script up to make sure it's
right if is set the get letter incoming
get letter variable if it's set and if
the string length of that get letter
variable is equal to one basically the
string length of the variable coming in
for this little program would be never
less than one and never more than one it
will always be just one that's the
string length of that variable because
they're searching one letter but you can
make this condition read any way you
want if you're allowing to search for
more than one letter in some other
program but this one set up a specific
way for alphabetic search so you can
make sure that there's only one letter
in that variable so if there's any more
letters in that string variable
none of this code in this if condition
will run so only if this condition is
met
well this code run so if the so if
everything is right the user is using
your application correctly then you'll
get the letter variable sanitized and
cleaned and ready for database
interaction to avoid SQL injection you
use preg replace to clean that variable
of anything other than a through Z so it
can only be a through Z and I put the I
here just so it can be in case-sensitive
non case sensitive so uppercase or
lowercase and in our case we're using
all uppercase so you can remove the I
and make this capital A through Z and
what that will do is not even allow
lowercase a through Z to be posted or
sent to this page and picked up as a
dynamic variable only capital A through
Z if you set it up that way but believe
it the other way it was that way if you
want to send lowercase instead of these
being all capital you change them to all
lowercase if you want and then this will
all still work capital or lowercase it
doesn't matter but all that it will
allow is one letter through it will
strip all spaces funny character
numbers and only leave letters in that
string okay now here's what you do Magoo
you connect to your MySQL database here
or up top if you need to do it
beforehand but just make sure you're
connected to your database before you
run this kind of SQL syntax so this is
the kind of SQL syntax you run when you
want to search in a field in your
database but only by first letter so say
I have a database table called movies
and in that movies database table
there's a title field that holds the
titles of all the movies so what we do
is use the like syntax with the
percentage symbol in front of our
variable letter to specify that we want
to search by first letter only so for
instance if the dynamic variable coming
through is an R it will get only movies
from the movies table let's start with
the letter R this kind of SQL query and
I'm not putting that into query code
because I know a lot of you guys are
still using MySQL some of you guys have
made the switch already to MySQL I which
is a more efficient way to interact with
your database so I'm not going to put
either way that way you guys can use any
approach you want then once you set up
your MySQL query or your MySQL I query
you use a while loop that corresponds to
that query to append database results
into this results variable and you
append results into PHP using dot equal
in JavaScript we use plus equal to
append results into one variable instead
of overriding that variable each time
what we do is append in PHP using plus
equal so make sure within your while
loop that you're using plus equal to
populate the data in the results
variable after your while loop and you
get all the results that you want out
then you close your while loop with a
curly brace and then you close your
database connection here you put MySQL
close function or if you're using MySQL
I you use the MySQL i underscore close
function then your results variable will
be a a pact variable that has all of
your database results in it and what you
do is you echo that anywhere on the page
that you want and the reason why you see
me having this line you wouldn't have
this line in your application because
all of your results would get
overwritten at this line but I have this
just in this tutorial to show you what
this is going to render to show you that
the HTML and JavaScript application side
of things is in fact connected to search
results correctly and sending variables
to it correctly that's all this line is
doing you should not have this in your
application new all right so like I said
right here or anywhere on the page you
do have another PHP block where you're
echoing the results variable and that
would be all of your search results so
if you want to have a whole bunch of
HTML here your header and all that crap
before you echo your results you echo
results into your page anywhere you like
in your design flow buddy now all we
have to do is make sure we're on a PHP
enabled server before we try and test
this application if you try and test
this on your normal computer where you
don't have PHP setup it won't work if
you like just by a computer and you're
trying to run this script like you would
like we did our JavaScript you see this
all works because that's JavaScript this
won't work if you try and run it on your
local machine because it's PHP it'll
work on my machine because I have PHP
installed but if you don't have PHP
installed on your local machine on your
computer it's not going to work put it
online on a PHP enabled server okay
here's a live example of working on a
PHP enabled server if I click the letter
D it takes me to the search results dot
PHP page with the letter variable of D
and it says PHP recognizes the dynamic D
and can search MySQL using it if I click
back and hit H you can see that changes
to an H you can search MySQL using that
using the syntax I provided here for you
select all from movies where title field
like letter you make sure you put the
percent symbol there to signify or
specify that you
want to search by first letter only now
whether you're using Ajax or a more
traditional approach like we're using
here you can still use this same sort of
logic but the only difference is is Ajax
would be calling to the PHP script for
the data instead of the PHP script being
its own entity really this PHP script if
you're going to use Ajax would just be
its own little entity that's just a
parsing file to get data back for Ajax
but having a search result stop PHP page
is a more traditional approach and it's
better for SEO still at this point I
would think that search results would
still have better search engine
optimization and get better indexing if
you use a more traditional approach as
opposed to Ajax searching and Ajax
pagination but I might be wrong about
that we can debate it if you guys want
anyhow I'll give you the example dot PHP
you'll see it's not much code going on
here and the search results dot PHP if
you need to get to my source code I'll
