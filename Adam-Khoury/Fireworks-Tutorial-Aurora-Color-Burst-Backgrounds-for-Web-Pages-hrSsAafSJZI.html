recently got done making dev booth calm
and a few people have messaged me and
asked me if I can show how i made the
background see behind the page is kind
of like a roller type lights or you can
call them color bursts they're kind of
reflecting off of a surface the same
colors of reflecting off of the surface
there and we'll be using fireworks cs4
if you'd like to learn how to make some
cool airy Aurora colorburst type
backgrounds and the best part about it
is it's very attractive and it's very
very lightweight mine is a thing twenty
five kilobytes for 1600 wide background
that doesn't repeat it's just a one big
solid image one big solid jpg that's
like 25 kilobytes loads super fast and
I'm going to show you how to render it
out so don't worry okay here we are in
fireworks cs4 and first thing I'm going
to do is create a new document here and
it's going to be let's just make it a
good 1800 wide or you can go about 1600
let's just do 1600 and we're going to
pin ours to the left you'll see what I'm
talking about ready soon let's make this
800 okay now i have canvases white i'm
going to change it to black now you can
see I have my scroll bars here so I can
see the whole thing now my monitor is
1600 wide x 900 I think hi so it's 1600
wide 900 high and I would imagine that
most people that buy a monitor from
walmart a circuit city best buy wherever
they probably going to get one that has
similar ratio if they buy one nowadays
so you want to make sure that your
background is wide enough to fill up
their screen pretty nice you know what
I'm saying okay now the first thing I'm
going to do is create some color bursts
and we'll use the pen tool for this just
grab the pen tool and let's set the
color we want I'm going to start with a
nice orange like that I'm just going to
go through here and make little spikes
little shape you ap i'll show you the
bottom is not very important there we go
and now i'm going to manipulate a few of
these dots a more dramatic effect on the
bursts okay that's good will be a little
closer to the top you can use any kind
of shape that you want get creative with
it actually I'm going to make this one
the blue control C let's highlight it
now let's control C control V so now we
have a copy sitting on top of that one
let's manipulate the size just make it
about that big and let's change the
color to a nice bright green now and
take that one ctrl-c ctrl-v resize this
one I'm going to make it maybe orange or
yellow maybe yellow ok now I'm going to
put some over here
you can see I'm looking at mine at
sixty-six percent that's why you can see
pretty much the whole thing in the
window there let's give that a fill or
I'm going to do the same thing and put
smaller ones on top of it ok now I'm
going to take a black rectangle you can
see I put some extra ones on top there
too using the same method so I'm going
to get a rectangle from the Tools menu
there and I'm going to put it all the
way across the screen alike so I'm going
to make it black I'm going to make this
one group ctrl G highlight these three
ctrl G highlight these three ctrl G now
I have three different groups and now I
can move them around after I blur them
to get it in the exact spot that I want
them go back down to the blur Gaussian
blur and there it is ok now let's take
this one and move it down a bit and move
it over a bit now all we have left to do
is create the reflections ok so to
create the reflections it's going to be
rather simple all we have to do is
highlight that one let's hold shift
highlight the other one over here and
we're going to group we're going to
press ctrl-c to copy and ctrl V to paste
so now we have more copies on there
let's press ctrl G and let's group those
now with those grouped we're going to
bring them to front
now I'm going to modify and flatten the
selection now I can cut them so what I'm
going to do is cut them right there on
that edge so let's go to the marquee
tool with them highlighted and let's
just draw the marquee and around that
area and then press ctrl x so you have
it cut now on the ones will be flattened
now let's flip them vertical now simply
drag them down into place okay so
there's your reflections zoom into one
hundred percent get it right at the edge
right about there now what you can do is
take that and fade it bring the Alpha
down on it so it's at a position of your
liking now you see on dev booth I have
kind of like dark spots where this one
is kind of bright so you can do that by
just drawing in shape take the pen tool
and you'll make a black type shape just
make it from know maybe here to write
about their do something like that go
across make it black blur it as well
let's see where's the blur Gaussian blur
and let's bring it blur down some
wherever you need it it's okay then you
modify and you flatten that selection
because you don't want that black faded
part coming up into the nice bright part
there and so you use the marquee tool
again and make sure that's highlighted
with the marquee tool and place control
x you'll see that it removed that dark
faded blurred out black that was coming
over the top there we don't want and
there you have it that's how i made the
background for dev booth calm ok so
after you create your reflections you
get your little dark patch on there you
can go to file export wizard continue
continue and then exit and then once
you're in this image preview screen you
can select what type of image that you
want and you'll see mine is a JPEG you
want to bring the quality up a little
more you set it up to maybe 84 it's only
50 kilobytes that's still super tiny you
probably go all the way up to 88 look at
that still only 60 kilobytes for 1,800
wide background that's 800 pixels high
as well and then when you export it
saves it as a JPEG anyway you want on
your computer and then you can upload it
to your website now at the bottom if you
want to make sure that it fades to black
well you can go here rectangle grab it
out to a rectangle across the bottom and
make sure you give it a gradient of
linea make the linear gradient black on
black on both sides then make the one
opaque on top and that will assure that
you have a fade to black on the bottom
then you just set your web page
background color to black and if you
happen to need to know how to get this
on a web page you can go to develop PHP
in the learn CSS section
there's a create backgrounds for your
HTML pages and this can also work in
flash you can put flash with the
transparent background where is it you
can put flash with transparent
background and have flash elements above
that Aurora style background so that's
how it's done hope you have enjoyed this
one and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
