building tutorial in this lesson we're
not going to mess with any code at all
we're just going to show you how to make
awesome animations we're using fireworks
cs4 for the graphics and we're using
flash cs3 to animate things and bring
them to life and use it for the
eventually put it on a web page and we
this is a forum request one of our
members saw a myspace profile so thought
was really hot some cool animations on
it and was asking if anybody could show
how these kind of animations are made so
I thought I'd put it together all right
and see what else should I tell you oh
yeah if the blades look crappy in the
video the spin animation on the blades
looks crappy in the video you can go to
the link description link in the
description and click that and you'll
see where it is the page where i put a
demo because i don't think these
animations on those blades spinning
around are going to render out real nice
so if you want to see it real nice how
its intended to look you can go and
click on the link in the description
hello everybody and welcome to another
flash building tutorial and in this one
we have a for remember who would like to
know how to animate a helicopter and
make lights coming out in the bottom
animated and have an animated blades on
top spinning blades so the first thing
we'll do is you got to get yourself a
helicopter you can see my helicopter is
sitting on no background and that's what
that's what we want I'm gonna make sure
you have a helicopter that's cut out
nicely
and nothing does better for that then
the magic wand and then touch it up with
the eraser that's how I got mine all set
up and so once you get your helicopter
body then you want to make a blade for
it so bring out an ellipse and you can
grab or you hold down on the left mouse
button to see all of these tool options
here which ones you want to pick grab
whichever one you want and you hold down
shift to make sure it's a perfect circle
while you're dragging see if you don't
hold down shift you can get egg-shaped
and oval on you okay so let's make it
little guy there and now to make the
first part of the blade I'm going to
grab the pen tool and I'm just going to
make a basic shape here
for a blade
so what you do is just click and drag
and click and drag move it and put it
where you want it you can even zoom in
by holding down control and zoom in and
out with your mouse wheelie if you're on
Mac its command mouse wheel zoom in and
out very easy in fireworks while you're
drawing so let's put that right where it
wants to go or right where I want to put
it click and then connect it up and now
go to the body fill black the edge fill
none
okay now it looks a little crooked but
that's okay doesn't have to be perfect
it's going to get Blair it anyway so now
we're going to move these down a little
now we're going to take this and control
C control V and now go to the scale tool
you move this or actually you can go to
modify or actually if you're in cs4 you
might be in cs3 though some tools up
here in cs4 but we'll just go to modify
transform vertical flip it vertical drag
it into place
let's fit canvas
now I'll highlight these to make sure
they're in the center they're good
enough press ctrl-c ctrl-v that copy and
paste copy the copies of those right on
top of themselves and now with those who
highlighted go to modify transform
rotate 90 degrees move them up into
place and now will fit canvas again and
there you go now we can take that and it
looks like that would be about the right
size make it a little smaller then it's
peaceful baking
and
that's good now we can group those with
them all selected just highlight all
five those shapes press ctrl G or you
can go up to modify combined paths and
union now it's all one piece or one
shape all one path rather and so now we
want to make sure that we have a copy of
that so let's go to press with it
highlighted press ctrl-c ctrl-v or
command V if you're in a mac and spin
that bad boy around by angles until you
get it right there okay so let's see
what we need is one then the other and
let's just grab them all but we won't
group those together I'm going to put
the helicopter right there I'm going to
highlight this one and this one
and we're going to go to the distort
tool when you try to match up these
lines to wear distorts you see the line
of my dash the box there I'm going to
try and line it up to the line of the
ship or the helicopter about like that
now let's drag those two on to the top
where they belong and there you go well
it's not done yet but
this actually looks like we can just
distort it a little bit more to angle it
just right right down this way that
looks better
here we go
now
that's just about perfect okay so now
we're going to bring this all in the
flash let's grab the helicopter first
make sure we can bring them all into
flash let's now I'm going to do it one
at a time press ctrl-c and the
helicopter actually it's a little bit
big to let's shrink it grab all of those
items highlight all of them and scale
them down oops make sure we're on the
scale and not just distort we don't want
to distort that one we're scaling it
down that'll work it's a good size now
let's take just a helicopter body bring
that into flash control see
let's go to actionscript-3 file in flash
cs3 but you can use ActionScript too
we're just going to use basic action
script commands if we do use any at all
and you can be in flash in 84 mx2 as
well okay so let's go to set the size of
this thing the way we need it let's go
maybe it's 700 wide and we'll go with
400 too high that's good we'll make the
canvas a dark gray and press ctrl-v to
pop in the helicopter body put it where
anywhere on stage you it can be moved
around so you'll see that's a movie clip
of copy for when you bring it in from
fireworks like that and now we're going
to bring in the first blade and i'm
going to i'm going to make these flatten
these two bitmaps
so highlight one go to modify flattened
selection the other one highlight modify
flattened selection that way they're not
Pat's anymore and their actual images
bitmap images okay so let's go back in
here take the first one control C I'll
be that one and bring it into flash put
it right on top
let's get the other one as well
actually that's wait on the other one
let's highlight both of these together
convert that to a symbol call it a whole
copter whole copter the entire copter
movie clip okay now inside of it let's
go and make some layers here
let's grab this well first let's insert
a new layer layer 2 let's grab the blade
control x highlight that new layers
keyframe and ctrl shift v to paste it in
there in place on the stage in that new
keyframe on that new layer will call
this blades call this one body and we're
going to make one more call it lights
and that's going to be under the body or
light
you can put multiple lights I'll just
show you one example so now we have to
get these blades animated and in order
to do that we're going to make its own
movie clip so we'll highlight it convert
the symbol name is blades movie clip
okay double-click inside of it now what
we want to do is bring in well let's
make a new keyframe here insert frame
insert blank keyframe ok so now we have
a blank keyframe on frame three and
that'll probably be just about right
let's drag it over to frame to actually
right click that other one and remove it
so we have a new open keyframe there
it's bringing out of the blade this one
control C
and right there control V press ok bring
it in his movie clip now we're going to
see if they match up pretty good in
position by going between one frame and
the other ok
so at this point we can take a first
glimpse by pressing ctrl enter and
that's a nice little animation let's get
our frame rate higher so we have nicer
animations maybe to about 24 should be
good or you can set it up to 30 for it
to be ultra smooth publish it out in the
browser I'm going to take a look at it
there we go that's beautiful
now what you want to do to finish it off
is go back out to where you have your
layers here body lights and blades
highlight this movie clip blades go to
filters plus sign blur give it a blur of
14 15 14 might do it 14 let's go to
medium and bring that back down now 12
now let's press control enter and take a
look at it that is perfect see that's
even that's a better animation than the
one that the gentleman from our forum
referred me to I don't want to get all
conceited but damn I'm good all right so
I mean all I have to do is see something
on a web page and I can recreate it
usually when i recreated it comes out
better than the original okay so that
shows you how to animate the blades now
let's get the light in there and we're
done for this portion of what the
gentleman wanted to see so let's go up
to seen one make a move our helicopter
anywhere we want now you can even
actually animate it in this timeline if
you set up your movie clips right you
know everything is nested correctly so
back inside we'll go to the lights layer
so I went double click back inside the
whole copter and inside the lights layer
I'm going to put just going to use the
pen tool here and I'm going to position
right where I think the light would be
under the helicopter what about right
about there over there
I'm going to bring it down to the earth
so you click once and you bring it down
towards the Earth then you click again
over here you're just going to make a
basic shape
this makes to where we can't see the
chopper anymore by hitting the eye on
that layer and let's finish this up here
may be right about there and close it up
now we can we have a shape now we can
put a fill on let's give it a fill of
gradient make sure the edge is nothing
now with the symbol highlighted of the
shape highlighted go to the gradient
transform let's make sure it's white on
top make sure it fills the whole area by
dragging this a dressy put it to the
edges now go into the color palette and
make it white where it's black
now where was black and we turned it
white double click that again and bring
the Alpha all the way down to zero so
also bring the Alpha down somewhat on
our top color top white to about 72 that
looks good and we can also adjust the
points here as well and I think I want
to do that because
let's see can i adjust these points
thought I could see ya
I think I have it too wide let's bring
it in a little there we go
now
let's get this one
a little more
close together that's good now we can
convert that to a symbol make it to
where we see the chopper again convert
this to a symbol movie clip name it
light press ok and what should we do
here yeah let's convert that to a symbol
again and call it copter light so inside
of it would be lights now so copter
light that's ok so see here this is
copter light and inside of it is light
here we're going to animate this to go
rock back and forth so let's go to free
transform take that registration dot in
the middle put it up to the center to
where we can rock it now we're going to
the first position i'm going to start it
right about here second position go to
maybe
no no 12 press f6
and let's go ahead and rock it out
24 press f6
they do that right
it's going to have to go back so yeah
now 36 put another key frame
and we'll rock it back then we'll put
create motion tween not sure if I set
that up right I'm gonna find out let's
see well they could have came right back
here see that's what it should have done
let's go right there there we go now we
can just get rid of this between sorry
about that that was very amateur of me
remove frames and now we have the
animation we want we don't have to put
any stop actions or anything and we'll
check the speed on it first we're going
to go back out here where we have blades
body and light grab the light and blur
that as well you don't want it to be so
sharp on the edges so you blur it blur
it nice and thick make that a medium and
there you go now let's press ctrl enter
okay that's going a little fast so let's
go back into that movie clip
double-click and to extend these out by
just dragging the keyframes there may be
260 and 30 now let's press f12 to
publish out in the browser and there you
have it folks nice animated helicopter
and for the example the gentleman showed
there was two side-by-side or flip
flopped horizontally so you you just put
that one there on the maintain press
just grab that ctrl c ctrl shift v to
paste it in place modify transform flip
horizontal and slide it into place or
you can drag it
and there you have it
now you have two helicopters that are
looking for a crook maybe put your crook
well you put yourself right in the
middle the example that the gentleman
showed at the forum for the the myspace
channel he was interested in copying or
not copying but using those types of
ideas it had two helicopters
back-to-back like that person the
musician was sitting right in between
here with sweaty text and so I'm going
to also show do a couple more tutorials
for what that gentleman wanted to see as
far as animations and how to create them
manually really cool ones and flash like
this and like I said you can make this
black and it will all work how good this
looks that looks so good you can't see
your blades too good on the black but
you could if you let's see if we go in
there grab the blades
and as long as with the blur let's add
another filter no I mean oh go there
let's go to properties and give it a
brightness see if this works haha there
we go now press f12 and now you can see
you blaze real good in a black canvas
oh man that is super sweet it looks hot
like I said you can animate those in you
can bring those in from on the main
timeline or if you nest your movies
correctly they can come in from afar or
from off scene on to your scene whatever
you want okay and so will be showing
sweaty text hot City sweaty text and
rolling clouds and sky beyond everything
and then that will be all the the
animations the gentleman wanted to learn
how to create okay we'll see you guys
