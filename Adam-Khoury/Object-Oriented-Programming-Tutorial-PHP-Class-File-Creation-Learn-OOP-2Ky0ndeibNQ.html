the process of creating PHP class files
we will also show you how to connect to
your class file and script to it using
an object-oriented programming approach
in PHP sounds exciting huh recently I've
received a lot of requests from viewers
here at YouTube asking me if I could
demonstrate how I create and connect to
my class files in my scripts so we'll
provide you with a code example and
discuss the whole process right now
okay you can follow right along with me
first thing to do is get yourself a new
example dot PHP document ready or you
can name it whatever you want but just
make sure it's a PHP document and get
your PHP opening and closing tag ready
to go now let's write a small script
that has a function will write
procedural code and then we'll simply
objectify it into a specialized class
file and you'll also be learning to
script a bad word filter function in PHP
if you don't know how to do that yet
okay first we'll create a string
variable and we'll name it STR for short
and put a set of double quotes and then
semicolon and inside the double quotes
is where we'll add our string now we're
just going to hard code a string into
the script but you would maybe take this
string from a form where you people are
typing into your website and here's my
string I am a jerky buttface I also know
a lot of other jerks now in your string
you would put really strong profanities
like the F word the C word or the S word
but I didn't want to have anything too
strong in this video tutorial that way a
lot of young people can benefit from it
too and I don't get yelled at by parents
so let's just pretend that these are
really bad words now I'm going to make
an array of the curse words that I want
to search the string for and filter out
and replace them with something better
let's make this variable equal to an
array open close parenthesis semicolon
and in between the parentheses is where
you can put your array elements my first
element in my array is going to be the
word jerk I want to filter it out of all
text and then the next word I put a
comma another set of double quotes and
in between there I'm going to put black
face and a comma another set of double
quotes the last curse word is idiot now
in your example you would just put the F
word the S word maybe the C word or the
B word whatever you want to put now
we're going to copy that
and go one line down and paste it now
let's change this from saying curse
words to replacers now you can just
replace those any way that you like
let's just put a star star there but
base let's just change that word
altogether to cute
and let's say idiot let's just put star
star there and you can have as many as
you like in it you can have a hundred
different words and have your replaces
array set up to match those so what
we're going to do now is use a function
in PHP that will allow us to compute
those two arrays and use the one to
replace the other where those things are
found if those things happen to be found
within the string so create a new
variable call it cling STR clean string
let's make that equal to string I
replace PHP comes equipped with two
functions for replacing like this string
replace and string I replace string I
replace lets you string replace without
having to worry about upper or lower
case so it's in case sensitive string
replace non case sensitive so it will
replace a string whether it's lowercase
or uppercase pound or whatever so the
string I replace and string replace get
three parameters the things you want to
search the string for which are curse
words comma the next parameter is the
replacers or the things that you want to
replace those curse words with and then
the subject which would be the string or
the thing that you want to do the string
that you want to do the replacing within
now string replace and string I replace
also work with single values so you
don't have to put an array in there you
can just put single values to replace
one single value with another but it
also gives you the option of feeding
arrays to it so you can just replace
large lists at one time and what's nice
is it replaces it globally that's why I
put the word jerk in there twice to show
you that it's a global replace it
doesn't just replace and filter out the
first occurrence where the curse word is
found it replaces every occurrence where
it's found okay now this is still all
procedural code now let's echo that out
echo the clean string now run this file
on a PHP enabled server
okay so you can see what my string looks
like after it runs through that little
filter now what if you had four or five
different forms on various different
pages on your website and you wanted to
do this kind of replacing in all of them
that's where modular programming comes
in handy is because you wouldn't have to
keep running all of these lines in all
of those different files and furthermore
if you ever wanted to change the setup
of your arrays you would only have to do
it in one place in the module or in your
class file okay so that's the scenario
is we have a lot of forms on our site
and a lot of intake areas where people
can type in comments make posts maybe
there's forums whatever you got going on
and you have to use this in ten
different documents on your website now
that is when you want to create a class
file now these lines were only going to
be in one document and run that's fine
they can just be here procedurally just
like they are but if you're going to use
it in multiple documents over and over
again you want to make it modular and
dynamic and reusable and that's where
creating class files comes in really
handy now we're going to make this code
operate as a function that we can call
so let's type in function call it clean
open closed parentheses opening curly
brace go down a couple of lines and put
the closing curly brace now you can
simply just take these lines right here
control X pop them in the function
indent and let's make this function take
in a parameter which is STR so STR
already matches here so we don't have to
change that now let's take its echo and
control X and let's put it up in the
function as well and just change the
echo to return because you don't want it
to echo right there you want to return
it to the line that calls this function
clean so we have string now let's run
function clean so make a new variable
call it clean underscore STR is equal to
this clean function so you can just copy
that and put it right there put a
semicolon and just so nobody gets
confused let's change this variable name
to
during okay so now you've set it up this
is still all procedural code but now
you've set it up to be a dynamic
reusable function but it's not external
to where this function could be used by
multiple documents within your website
only this document can use this function
so that's the art of objective I encode
is making it reusable throughout the
whole system now you simply go down one
line echo this variable now because that
would be your clean string I'll change
my string a little bit just to make sure
I know it's working let's just put those
curse words in there ctrl s and now run
this let me refresh my example and you
see everything works just fine okay
now the part we've all been waiting for
the object-oriented programming approach
as it relates to creating PHP class
files and having modular external
reusable functions okay so let's take
this function ctrl X and get it out of
there bring this all to the top then you
create a new PHP document and name it
curse filter PHP all right inside of
curves filter PHP I'm going to open a
PHP scripting block make sure I close it
I'm going to create the class now type
in class just name it the same thing the
files name curse filter and then you use
opening curly brace and you go down a
few lines and put in the closing curly
brace you can put a space there if you
want then you pop in your function let
you head in your clipboard
make sure you indent that a little bit
and indent these into the function now
now you can get rid of the X any extra
lines that you have there that you don't
want so you see all I did was I took
that function and I placed it into my
class named curse filter that's in my
class file named curse filter PHP okay
so you've just created your class file
and you can do that with all kind of
different code that runs within your
applications or your software now it's
important that I show you how to connect
to that that way we can still use that
function clean because this file is not
connected to the class file yet so now
I'll show you how to connect to the
class file and then
scrip to it just as if the function was
in this file okay
so the first thing we'll do is include
curves filtered PHP so you include your
class file using the include ones
function now let's go look in curve
filter get the name of your class ctrl C
copy that and then let's go right here
under where we included type in dollar
sign and paste so new variable is curves
filter and that's going to be equal to
new paste curves filter object from the
class file so you're creating a new
cursor filter object right here and it's
in a variable now called curse filter
okay so we'll just put a little comment
line here just to separate visually that
we are connected and the object is ready
to be scripted against okay now the last
thing is inside of curves filter you can
see our clean function is inside of our
class curse filter so we have to
actually tap into it in order to make it
run it won't run the way it is sitting
here so what you can do is put
parentheses around everything just put a
set parentheses around everything put
some spaces here and in the front you
put in your curse filter object variable
and you use dash and the greater than
symbol then you can bring this back to
where it's just space one space
separating it now that's how you make
that function run as you go into the
curves realtor object and you direct the
clean function to run with whatever
parameters that you want to pass through
it which in our case we're passing the
string so when the string goes through
it you can see it's picked up right here
as the variable STR and then it is
processed within all of our code and
returned as clean string so it's
returned right here to this variable and
that is how object oriented programming
in PHP works in relation to class files
that are external and modular reusable
all that good stuff
so now just change your string a little
bit press ctrl s and now run this file
okay so you can see our sex okay so you
can see that our test is successful and
you will have effectively created a
class called curse filter and
you can call it in 25 to 100,000
different documents that you want to
call it into and use it now it's handy
about it is if you ever want to change
anything in this function or in these
arrays or whatever you don't have to do
it in 20 different files you do it in
the class and then all the files that
are connected to that class like example
that PHP is it will reflect those
changes and run the new code so that's a
really good way to manage your software
production logic
now if you've made it all the way
through the video lesson what have you
done you started with a few lines of
simple procedural code then you turn
that into a dynamic function that was
also procedural and then you took that
function and you created a class file
out of it that you can connect to using
an object-oriented programming approach
in PHP and if you want you can call it
poop like I do that's the acronym that I
invented for it because it's PHP
object-oriented programming OOP
all right I hope you found this lesson
useful and there's a little bit more to
object-oriented programming as it
relates to class files in PHP and if you
guys are hungry for more educational
video material along those lines I can
surely supply you with it so just let me
