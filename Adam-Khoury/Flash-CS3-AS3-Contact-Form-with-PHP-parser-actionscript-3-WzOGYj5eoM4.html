ActionScript 3 contact form that posts
its variables to a PHP parse file which
then in turns emails you a HTML
formatted email with all the information
in it and if you have any trouble seeing
our movements or anything we click on
and talk about and such you can go to a
develop PHP comm and see this video
playing and it's clear big format if you
hit the flash tab the develop PHP comm
and you can also join our forum if you
want to take the script further or have
any questions about it ok so first thing
we'll notice is we have actions and
notes layer and we have a note right
here that's why it says notes and our
ActionScript is also ready to go on
those two keyframes there then we're
going to create a new layer we're gonna
name this layer status text and then
we're going to create another layer and
we're going to rename that layer form
and response and let's get our actions
back up top ok now we're going to
highlight let's put the status text in
the middle actually I'm going to
highlight the form layer and the
keyframe or frame 2 and hit f6 to create
a new keyframe and then back on keyframe
1 is where we're going to start building
the form and the first thing we want to
do is hit the text tool and bring out a
input text it says static text right now
so we'll change it to input text and
we'll adjust the size of it to where
would one our form to look like and show
border around text make sure you click
that that we see the white behind it and
also make it single line
input.txt make it black and align left'
and we're going to give it an instance
name of name underscore txt okay so once
we have that we'll put it about where it
should be then we'll press we'll
highlight that one we just made press
control C and then ctrl shift V and
paste in place and then drag the new one
that you just pasted it in place down
and give that an instance name of email
underscore txt and we'll do that one
more time highlight email txt and ctrl C
and then ctrl shift V drag it down and
then make this one multi-line and make
it larger just drag it out and we also
want to give this an instance name now
of MSG underscore txt okay now that we
have those in there put them where we
like them to go and then select another
text tool here and put that on stage and
put the word name :
and make this a static text and let's
color it yellow or something
looks good get that in place and
actually let's align this one right
since we're going to have all of our
text in there it needs to be aligned to
the right for these so press control C
control shift V let's do it again
control C control shift V I'm using my
arrow keys to drag this down and this
one we're going to call message or type
in message in this one we're going to
type in email okay so we have name email
message and we have message underscore
txt email underscore txt and name
underscore txt as input okay so the next
thing we want to do is on the form layer
we have to create the dynamic text field
that's going to be our status text so
let's go ahead and hit the text tool
again and we're going to make this
dynamic text field and status it's going
to be its name status underscore txt and
that we want to make no border not
selectable dynamic and colored green or
whatever bright color you want Center
align it a multi line is good
and that one's ready to go so this is
gonna be a status text that tells the
user what they forgot to put when we do
our handling forever handling and also
to bring a data string over to keyframe
2 when we get to that point but you'll
see what I'm talking about in a moment
ok so now that we have that dynamic text
field made that's going to be our status
field we're going to drag out of our
library that we already have pre-made
submit button which is an ordinary
button I made a little while ago made
just like any other button I'm gonna
give that an instance name of submit
underscore BTN submit underscore BTN and
now that we have that on key frame 1 all
of our form stuff now we're going to
select actually the status text go ahead
and select status text and control X and
we're going to put that on the status
text layer where it should go
control shift V to paste in place ok now
we're good now we're going to hit form a
response layer key frame 2 and on key
frame 2 we're going to create another
dynamic text field so we can just
highlight status text and press control
C and then highlight the form and
response layer key frame 2 and press
control shift B and then you can drag it
down make it bigger because this is
where the response is the reply and
response is going to be displayed to the
user after the form is submitted on key
frame 2 and we're going to name this one
reply reply underscore txt and status
text fills key frame 1 &amp;amp; 2
so it's for frame 1 &amp;amp; 2 there's no
keyframe on frame 2 so that that way you
can be accessed by this one we needed to
in the ActionScript code and that's
about it
so we'll press save and we'll publish
out and once you publish out you set
this up when you're on your server
let's see make sure we didn't forget
anything here keyframe - it looks good
okay yeah when you save this and publish
it out you get it up on your server you
grab that PHP par script we have to go
with it you'll see that you have you are
emailing from a flash contact form in
ActionScript 3 have fun with it guys
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
