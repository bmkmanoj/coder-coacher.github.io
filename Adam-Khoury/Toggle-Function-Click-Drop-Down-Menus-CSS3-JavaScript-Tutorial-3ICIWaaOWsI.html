creating this click to toggle they're
like touch screen friendly NAB systems
or drop down menus if you go to web
intersect comm and you click the
Navigator button you'll see that
navigation menu slides down into view
all nice and animated and then to get
that to go away you can scroll and
everything but to get that to go away
you actually have to click to toggle the
menu system closed again and I made the
little arrow go up and down on the
button you see see how the little arrow
flips up and down according to which
position the menu is in going to have a
little up beep-beep and then it gone
down blue and this here is the
standalone version that you're going to
get as source code that you can tweak so
I have my logo here have a nice top bar
that has a gradient set on it and then
we have a button sitting here and when
the user clicks that button you'll
notice that a menu slides down and then
a little tick arrow changed its position
from down to up now when I click it
again the little arrow will change its
position once again to the default
position and it just slides open and
close like that and nigga the user can
hit it really fast if they need to like
that or if they want to if they want to
be annoying and it still won't mess up
the functionality and you can put
whatever you want in there so be
creative you can put images new
containers in there you can float some
divs side by side right next to each
other whatever you want to do so I'm
just going to explain the code very
quickly and then give you the code and
you guys can tweak it to make the menus
more unique and make them your own
and I just wanted to show this picture
of me because a lot of people online
yell at me for never updating my profile
picture so here's an updated profile
picture of me the reason why I'm
building click to toggle style menus is
because users on mobile devices and
touchscreens really don't get a hover or
mouse over event that we developers can
target and most CSS and JavaScript
drop-down menus in the past of
programmed using mouse over and mouse
out events which is just not available
to a touchscreen users we have to
consider that some people might be
coming to our websites using a
touchscreen device or a touchscreen
computer now a touchscreen technology
can trigger a hover event if the user
holds their finger down in one place
long enough on the screen but I think
it's best to directly target the click
event which is the moment the exact
moment that the users fat finger presses
the screen and there's also touch start
and touch end events that you can
investigate for people on mobile devices
or touchscreens that are in that little
family of events that you can target
especially for touchscreens but if you
use the click event like I'm going to
use here that's the same thing as touch
start pretty much it just doesn't give
you the coordinates on the screen of
where the user clicked unless you
program that in basically all I'm saying
is the click event is good to use for
people on a PC with a mouse or for
people with a big fat finger on a
touchscreen and you'll have a more
intuitive and consistent menu system for
all of your users so if a user goes to
your system on a touchscreen it'll be
the same exact thing as if they go to it
on their PC alright first we have a top
bar div and that top bar div let me open
this in Chrome string down a little bit
so that's the top bar div is that gray
bar with a gradient on it at the very
top
now this div ID logo right here that you
see with the word logo in it is where
your company logo would go in the top
bar
and then you have div ID of sections
button holder and that is the div that's
holding this button and it only really
needs to be as wide as that button is
and then inside we have the actual
button which you can style that button
to look like anything you want I didn't
do any styling to that button now also
inside of the button in the inner HTML
of that button we have a span with an ID
of nav ro and that's how I was getting
the arrow to go up and down and change
because basically it changes the inner
HTML to a different arrow according to
what position that menu is in if it's up
or down so we change that little tick
arrow to go up and down according to
what position the menus in and we target
that with JavaScript now the very last
thing is we have the sections panel and
that's the actual panel the div that
holds the black area here of the hidden
little panel that comes sliding out so
that's the containing element it's
called sections panel and inside of that
we have a div and that is the div that
you see here in light grey that the
words are inside of so we have that div
and then words inside of it and you can
target all of these things with CSS
which I'm already targeting them with
CSS in the application so you won't have
much trouble with finding where to style
things and stuff like that okay so all
of the HTML I'm going to collapse back
up now we'll open up the style element
and we'll look over the CSS let me get
that window back up here and what you
see is we have the body margin 0 pixels
so there's no space on the edge of our
page and the background is set to a
light grey color that's this color here
you see down in the body now the top bar
has a background gradient color a linear
gradient then we give that bar a height
of 60 you can see it's height is around
60 pixels now the top bar logo I'm
floating left that way this div that
holds the logo can sit right next to the
Navigator button holder div you'll see
both of those divs are set to float see
the sections button holder
and the logo div are both set to
float:left so they can sit horizontally
on the page right next to each other
and I give the sections button holder
div a padding top of 16 just to bring it
off the top here of the top bar and if
you want to target that button to style
it and CSS you just put another rule
right under here that would be targeting
the button inside of that and let's see
if we put a background color background
color is bright orange and then let's
refresh the page now you see I have a
bright orange background there so that's
how you can target that button you can
also give that button an ID if you want
and target the actual ID of that button
down here okay then we have the CSS for
the sections panel itself remember the
sections panel is this black container
that has these rounded edges on the
bottom here and I'm getting those
rounded edges by using border radius
zero pixels zero pixels 8 pixels 8
pixels so we have zero pixels here zero
pixels there 8 pixels here 8 pixels here
roundness and we have to make sure we
position it absolute that way we can put
it exactly where we want it so you can
target after you position it absolute
you can target the top and the left
properties so I put it 60 pixels off the
top so the menu seems to slide out from
under the top bar we're starting with a
height of 0 pixels that way you cannot
see that element and it's really sitting
right there but it has a height of 0
pixels and when you hit that button
javascript is causing some css3 to run
to affect the height property and
animate it to make it look like it's
opening up and then it just reverses the
height to close it up back to 0
so that's why you see it says height 0
pixels that way by default you just
can't see it so it has a width of 550
and you can easily see that the
background color is black and it set off
the top 60 pixels and it set off the
left edge
160 pixels so that way it opens up like
right under that button then I set the
overflow to hidden just in case you put
a whole bunch of stuff in there and it
pours out of that container you don't
want it showing outside of that so
that's why overflow is hidden and
z-index is set to ten thousand just to
make sure that this sections panel that
slides open will be above any kind of
content that you have on the page that
might have a higher Z index and if you
have anything on the page that might be
going above your menu or your menu might
be sliding under that content you can
just give that content a lesser z-index
value and just make sure that your
sections panel has a higher Z index
value than any other element on the page
and that that way it'll sure that this
little slighty menu comes out on top of
all the other content that's down in
your page now this last little bit is
very important because the transition
property affects the height of the
element in JavaScript in a moment what
we're doing is affecting the height
property of this sections panel so when
I tell JavaScript to change the height
of this sections panel it's already
going to be animated and I don't have to
do anything in JavaScript because I put
this one line in place I will have I
will have no JavaScript based animation
going on in this application it's all
css3 because css3 can handle these
simple transitions and we can target any
property we want so I'm running the
transition effect over the height
property and it takes 0.3 seconds for
the animation to occur in a linear
fashion and there's 0 seconds delay now
here we have the styling it's just the
simple styling that is for this light
grey div that sits it's a child div that
sits inside of your section panel that
slides down so that's the light gray div
that you see inside of the sections
panel you can style it any way you want
okay now let me collapse the CSS back up
and we'll now discuss the JavaScript
which is where the toggle magic takes
place so when we click that button
let's look in our HTML see this button
in its on click event we have toggled
nav panel function running and we're
sending it the ID of the element that we
want to toggle in this case it's our
sections panel div sitting right here so
when the user clicks that button toggle
nav panel function executes and it takes
in the argument of which element that we
want to adjust the height of what we do
in the first line is we make some
variables for our little script here
first variable is called panel and
that's going to represent the object
reference for the element on the page
which is our sections panel we made nav
arrow target the document get element by
ID nav arrow on the page that's in the
button that way we can easily change the
innerhtml to make that arrow tick up or
down then we have a max height property
and I have that set to 300 pixels that's
the amount that your menu will slide
open mine only slides open 300 pixels
let me show you so this height this
maximum height where it stops is 300
pixels if I was to make this number let
me change that 100 pixels you'll see
that there's a big difference when i
refresh it only opens 100 pixels you see
so I'll leave that in 300 you can put
that number anything you want now the
logic we have here is saying that if the
window is fully opened at its max height
then we're going to close it by making
the style property set to 0 pixels and
remember in our CSS we already put the
transition property into that sections
panel div in the CSS so anytime you
affect that height property of that div
it's going to be in an animated
transition fashion so that's how the
animation takes place even though you
see no animation taking place here in
the JavaScript it's because it's
programmed into the CSS so that's why
you see 0 references to any kind of
animation here in the JavaScript
but yet we still get nice animations
alright so if the panel's height is
equal to the max height which is 300
pixels in my case then I make the
panel's height equal to zero that
animates it at that point closed it
closes the menu in an animated fashion
and I make sure that I change the nav
arrows that innerhtml
back down to a downward facing arrow
that's what this HTML is for it gives
you a downward facing arrow and if the
height happens to be closed and they
click the toggle button then we're going
to make the panel's height property
equal to 300 pixels that way it animates
open 300 pixels and then we change the
little nav our old inner HTML to an
upward facing arrow and basically that's
all the logic in the JavaScript so now
you have JavaScript HTML and CSS that
makes the whole little application run
and you can tweak the crap out of it you
can really customize the way it looks
the way it runs the way it's animated
and all kind of stuff this is Adam
