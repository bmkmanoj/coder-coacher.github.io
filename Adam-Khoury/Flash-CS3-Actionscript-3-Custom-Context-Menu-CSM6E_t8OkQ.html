lesson will be demonstrating how to
create custom context menus that right
click menus that you can customize on
your HTML page if you have an SWF you
can right-click it and you see I have a
custom context menu here where I put a
text string on the first one and then
the second one I put a button where you
can replay my animation so every time
you click replay it replays the
animation without any buttons it's all
in the right-click menu and I hide the
built-in menu items and you can put as
many of these these items in here as you
like you can have eight of them in here
if you want doing various things and
saying various things so let's get right
to it will click flash actionscript 3
file and I'm going to restage the size a
little because I don't need it so big
for what we're doing here yours will be
any size and frame rate get to about 24
I'm gonna make a little movie clip and
then press ok and then this layer we're
going to name movie clip
the layer above it will name actions and
that's where we'll put our action script
so in the movie clip layer will go ahead
and drag out it text static text field
and we're going to write flash is cool
okay
now right-click that convert to symbol
may get a movieclip symbol registration
centers fine it can be named whatever
you want because that's the name in the
library and press ok down in the
instance name here where it is important
we'll put my movie clip as an instance
name my movie clip and then we will
double click inside of my movie clip and
convert this aesthetic text field to a
symbol again another movie clip and name
that whatever you want press ok and here
we'll do some inside of this movie clip
we'll do some animation on a timeline
here press f6 on frame 10 make a new
keyframe in the center create motion
tween then highlight a frame 10 and then
hit the free transform tool with the
text highlighted over the movie clip
highlighted and we'll resize it down
small then we'll hit frame 20
right-click the center create motion
tween
highlight frame 20 make it bigger
highlight frame 30 hit f6 right click
the center create motion tween I light
frame 30 and resize and then do it again
on frame 40 and then create motion tween
and will resize it to be big again and
then on this will put a stop action that
way it tells it to stop and not loop
back to the beginning it'll stop right
there so it'll bounce twice and then
stop so let's double click here in the
gray to get back into the main scene or
you could press main scene right there
and now we'll start putting our action
script make sure wave in its name my
movie clip and we'll put our action
script in and first thing we're going to
do is build the first item that goes
into the custom context menu and that's
a variable will name it menu item 10
