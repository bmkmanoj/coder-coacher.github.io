automatic numbering of web page elements
so first let's take a look at our HTML
and then we'll apply the CSS to make the
magic happen on top of the HTML let's
take a look at that HTML rendered to the
browser so you can see there's a big
heading a smaller heading and then three
items under that heading and then this
other heading has four items under it
okay so that's what you see here is the
h2 are the smaller headings this h1 is a
big heading and you can put as many
items as you want in there but I'm
keeping it nice and short just for the
lessons sake okay so right above the
HTML let's add the CSS so we'll open up
a style tag and we'll put the type as
text CSS then we'll go down a couple of
lines and close off that style tag now
inside of that style tag I'm going to
put some CSS just a little bit and I'll
explain it to you right now okay this
first line and this second line are
pretty similar they're using the counter
reset syntax to reset counters every
time one of these elements are rendered
to the page this counter will reset so
that the next time the element is
rendered again to the page it'll have a
reset counter so for instance every time
every occurrence on the page of an h1
element will reset this section counter
then every time an h2 element you can
see that happens twice on the page every
time that is rendered to the page this
subsection counter gets reset so that's
what those two lines are doing sets them
back to zero then we're simply using the
before selector to place content before
the tag renders so you can put any kind
of content in so if I was to type in a
bunch of nonsense then save that and
render that to the browser you'll see
that there's a bunch of nonsense every
time an h2 element is met now let's
remove this gobbledygook right there and
let's take a look at what's happening
within this line we rent it to the
browser you can see it puts a 1 a dot
and a space before my element or before
the content in my element so you know
that number 1 is derived or is come
this counter function right here and
then you use the counter increment
syntax to increment the section number
so this number section is going to get
incremented for the next h2 element that
the page happens to hit so let's take a
look at that see this is the first h2
element that gets a number one the
second h2 element gets a number two
that's why you see a difference in those
numbers they're incrementing then we do
a similar thing for the paragraph tags
let's take a look at that really quick
before we discuss it you see in the
paragraph tags before the content within
the tag CSS is adding the section number
then a point and then the subsection
number so you can see it says 1.1 1.2
1.3 letting the viewer know that these
items are under main section of 1 and
then you can see down here these start
with the number 2 just to let the viewer
know that it's under the section 2 so
the way it's getting the number in place
is using this counter function and then
you put your dot as a string and then
you use the counter function again to
list the subsection number and then you
put a little space right there and then
after that you increment the subsection
and that's why you see different numbers
here 1.1 1.2 1.3 the 1 2 and 3 that you
see there are incremented subsection
numbers and that's pretty much it and
the before functionality works very
simple you can just if you wanted to see
how it is in its raw form you can just
add content to it of whatever you want
if you didn't want to have counters like
what if I want to say poop dot real big
before every age too let's see what
happens say poop dot poop that then that
messes up your your counting or your
automatic numbering so the before
selector really isn't doing any of the
incrementing or anything like that it's
just it sticks content before every
occurrence of that tag is rendered to
the page it's going to put content that
you specify here right before that
content all right so that's how you can
achieve automatic numbering using CSS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
