here with another flash tutorial geared
for actionscript-3 suitable for cs3 and
cs4 and this exercise is going to be
demonstrating how to add pressing enter
on the keyboard to submit forms to your
project and this is very handy to know
because most people when they're using
any kind of software they can fill in
the form data using their keyboard
typing all the form data and press ENTER
on your keyboard directly to submit the
form they don't have to put their mouse
on the button physically and press it
they can just press enter in the
keyboard and that's what we're going to
show you how to add to your flash files
here
okay first thing is create new
actionscript-3 file and once inside I'm
going to drag out a rectangle primitive
and it's going to be my submit button I
change the color from black and the fill
to some other nice light color that
works for me okay now put some text on
it let's say submit make sure that's
static text and back I'm just making a
button for the form you guys all know
how to do this already okay so now with
all my elements with a button sitting
there I'm going to highlight both of
them right click convert to symbol
button type I'm going to name it my
button my BTN that's good in the
instance name i'm going to give it the
instance name of submit BTN and this is
the name that i will communicate with
the button through coat now we have that
button let's add a dynamic text field to
stage now just to listen for the status
of what's happening make it dynamic give
it a instance name of status underscore
txt now let's go ahead and make it
bigger you make any size you want it and
align left is good 14 dynamic multi-line
that's great all right now we've put in
some code now this little application is
just to demonstrate the code exercise
that we're going through here and this
would be like a form or maybe a chat box
you have on your site or whatever that's
flash-based that has a submit data
button after somebody puts in some data
then they're used to pressing enter on
their keyboard from HTML forms that's
how HTML forms work you can put in
something to a text field press enter
and it submits the form so people are
very used to that kind of functionality
so it's a good idea to give it to them
when you're making your flash
applications too so they want to be able
to press the button to submit
data or just hit enter in their keyboard
now let's create a new layer insert
layer above the layer the graphic
elements and everything on it double
click it and rename it as3 because
that's where our actionscript-3 is going
to go now let's say we have instance
name their instance name on that okay
now we can talk to those two items
through code now let's go to the a s
three layer and press f9 or you can go
and just open your actions panel so
let's highlight that keyframe press f9
put in some code okay this code that I
had pre made and I just paste it in is a
button click event listener and the
mouse event click function click
function like most people use you didn't
hear that and then so this would be like
your form basically most warms have a
submit button listener that has a a
function targeted on it and that
function fires off well that function is
triggered when that button is clicked so
this application should work now if i
press ctrl enter you click the button
yes it does work okay that's great so
that would be your normal scenario how
most people have the form set up now I'm
going to show you how to allow people to
simply press enter using your existing
form setup and your button and
everything they'll just be able to press
ENTER on the keyboard so let's go down a
couple lines and I have some more pre
written code here that i'm going to show
you and explain now on line 10 let's
paste this in so it's not very many
lines extra needed and a lot of these
lines or me putting in comments talking
to you about what the code is doing so
what happens is we set a staged event
for the to report the key down when
somebody presses so basically we add an
event listener to the stage which is the
whole flash file and we add the event
listener listening for the key down when
somebody presses any key on the keyboard
we're going to report key down which is
this function here that fires off
function report key down you see the
event this keyboard event and it closes
way down here and the actions that
happen inside of it are nested right
here so the actions that happen inside
of the report key down function are we
create a variable called key code and
it's in a number type or integer type
and it's the event dot character code
and this is the way you can access what
key is being pressed and they all have a
number for instance enter is 13 and I
found that out by doing this trace so
when I pressed enter on my keyboard
trace key card codes showed me that it
was 13 so knowing that I was able to
code in an if condition here and saying
if my key card code that i pressed
equals 13 happens to be the enter button
because you don't want somebody's to be
able to press thick the L key and submit
a form just the enter key so we can
target it using this if condition ok now
the part here that's the last part to
explain is so if if the key code equals
13 that means if the enter button is
pressed on the keyboard the enter key
then this is going to happen so what
happens is we target the submit button
this button on stage we already made we
target that submit button and we add
dispatch event function to it and inside
that dispatch event function we add a
new mouse event of mouse event click
which will actually force the button to
get clicked it won't just simulate the
button being clicked it actually clicks
the button when you press Enter ok so
let's test it out
control-enter let's press submit okay
that works fine let's press control
enter again try it out now i'm not going
to press the submit button i'm just
going to hit the enter key see there you
have it both work exactly the same and
you can just copy and paste all this
code i have right there just change the
name of your submit button right there
and it'll work for you okay i have a
happy thing goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
