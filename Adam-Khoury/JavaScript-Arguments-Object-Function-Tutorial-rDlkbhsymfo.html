arguments object in JavaScript which
enables us to create special functions
that can intake an undetermined amount
of arguments all of the functions that
we write have an arguments object tied
to them that we can access you can get
an example dot HTML file ready and we'll
just create a function let's name it do
something
open close parentheses opening curly
brace and closing curly brace and let's
make this function in take a string
argument so what we'll do in that
function just for testing purposes is
alert ourselves this string of text now
let's make that function execute and
let's pass a string argument or a string
parameter to that function so this is
what a normal function that you would
write might look like so let's run that
in our favorite browser so we get the
alert string argument hello instead of
accessing this as the variable string we
can just type in arguments and in
between brackets we can put the index
number that we want to access for the
arguments list in sin in this case we're
only have one argument coming into this
function so now let's run that and see
if we still get the string output the
string hello is still output so you can
see that we're accessing the arguments
object and you can also write this like
this you can write do something dot
arguments and then the index that you
want you see see this gives you the same
result okay and you can also since
everything is a descendant of the window
object you can just type in window dot
dosomething arguments that Blair and you
get the same result and similar syntax
could be in between brackets you can
make that a string and this syntax also
works if you remove this dot let's see
yep but really all you have to do is
type in arguments and then put the index
number that you want so let me change
this output in this alert
and I'm gonna put another string so
let's put string 1 for that variable and
then string 2 for the second variable
now we can output both arguments plus
double-quote double-quote
plus arguments 1 which will give us the
second one in the list so we'll just put
a space here now what we can do is add
the second string the second parameter
run that in our browser and we get the
string hello world that's because we
picked up both arguments using the
arguments object and we access the list
item that we want within that object now
we're going to take a look at the length
property so what we can do is just alert
arguments dot length property and we
should get to see we get a 2 that's
because there are two items in that
object and it's not an array this
arguments object is not an array object
it's a instance of an object object that
means we can also iterate over the
length of that object so let's just grab
that and we'll make a for loop for open
close parentheses opening curly brace
and closing curly brace say var I equal
to zero as long as I is less than
arguments dot length we're going to I
plus plus now this for loop is set up to
iterate over the length of the arguments
object you can see we have two arguments
now we'll just alert ourselves the
arguments I index as they pass through
the loop let's check that hello and
world so we got both arguments now using
the arguments object we don't even have
to declare these variables for the
parameters being passed as arguments to
the function we can just remove them
altogether but we're still going to get
access to them see hello and world
now we can just add an undetermined
amount of variables let's put another
word goodbye let's add a number 100
let's add a boolean value now let's go
ahead and run that hello world goodbye
100 and true all of those arguments got
passed through the do something function
and processed in it without us having to
declare it between the parentheses we
don't have to declare the individual
variables we can just scoop up the
arguments object and dynamically iterate
over it now they can also be assigned
within the function so if for any reason
that you wanted to change the first
argument the first string argument
coming in its value to something other
than what's being passed so we can make
it poop so this is just how you assign
values if you ever have the need to any
of those incoming arguments see poop
it's the first one and there's also just
one more property associated with the
arguments object we'll just alert
ourselves for testing purposes the
arguments dot collie property and what
that does is it returns the function
that the arguments object is associated
with it's the function do something so
it only has the length property and the
collie property and it think in the
future it's going to have a caller
property so we can also write functions
that would compute numbers or do some
kind of math according to an
undetermined amount of arguments or
parameters being passed to the function
so you can see this function sum is just
going to add up all of the arguments
that are passed all of the number
arguments that are passed through the
function so this should give us a 10
seven twenty and thirty that should give
us a thirty see all of those numbers
have been computed inside of the
function so as you can see the arguments
object allows us to create functions
that can take in a variable amount of
arguments an undetermined amount of
arguments and process all of them and
the arguments object is an instance of
an object object if we go back to our
original function and let's just alert
ourselves type of arguments that'll show
us the type of object that the arguments
object is and it's an object object you
can also look at its constructor
function dot construct order and that'll
show you exactly what it is it's a
function object constructor so it's an
object object so it's not an array if
that was an array we would have seen a
type of array and the array constructor
but it's an object object and that's all
there is to it I'll see you in the next
