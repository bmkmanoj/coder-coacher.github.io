asked by viewers to show both flash
effects and pulse effects so we're going
to combine both into one tutorial since
pulsing and flashing elements has such a
similar code arrangement first we'll
show you how to flash elements so I'm
going to go into my example that HTML
file and right under my h1 heading I'm
going to add another h1 heading it can
be any element that you want in HTML so
for the inner HTML I'll just type in
flashing elements if we take a look at
what that renders it's just a black page
with white text on it so far now I'm
going to go up into my CSS and I'm going
to add a class called flash it opening
curly brace and closing curly brace so
anything in my document that's given the
flash it class we want to apply an
animation to and it's a keyframe
animation so within that CSS rule what
we're going to do is type in animation
colon
I'm going to put the name of the
keyframe animation that we're about to
create and I'm going to name it simply
flash then we have to put in how we want
the animation to run and I'm just going
to have a linear animation how long it
takes for the animation to occur I'm
going to put one second and how many
times we want the animation to occur and
I want it to be infinite because it's
just going to keep looping if I want it
to happen only five times I would put a
5 in place of the word infinite but if
you put infinite that means it'll just
keep looping now I simply apply my flash
keyframe animation and that's very
simple to do so right after the @ symbol
and the word keyframes you put the name
of the animation and then you just put
as many keyframes as you want in there
and if you're used to working in
something like flash authoring this
would be your first keyframe
this is your second keyframe and this is
your last keyframe and if I wanted 10
keyframes in there I would just say 0%
10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% and so on until
I
to 100 that would give me 10 keyframes
so in this keyframe arrangement we only
have 3 keyframes in the first keyframe
the opacity for the element is set on a
full 1 then on the second key frame of
the animation the opacity is brought
almost down all the way to 0 it's at
point 1 you can make that a zero if you
want and then on the third key frame of
the animation we set the opacity back to
a full one now all that's left to do is
give this flash it class to any of our
elements on the page let's go down to
this h1 put in class is equal to flash
it now for quick demonstration purposes
just go and test this in Firefox or
Internet Explorer and you'll see now you
have smooth flashing elements now any
elements on the page that you want to
give this class flash it will become
flashing elements all right now we're
going to add WebKit to that to make sure
that it runs in Google Chrome so we also
we touched this in Internet Explorer
we'll see everything works just fine but
at the end of the lesson we're going to
add WebKit prefix to make sure it works
in Safari and Chrome now let's move on
to the pulse effect and the pulse effect
is a similar keyframe animation setup so
what I'll do first is I'll go into my
body and I'll put in an image and this
is just to a heart dot PNG image that I
created and I'll show you what that
renders you see now we have a heart on
the page right under our flashing
element so now basically I'm just going
to copy this whole arrangement the flash
it class and the animation that the
flash it class attaches to the element
so I have the animation and the flash a
class copied I'm going to go right under
those pop them in and change this to say
pulse it and the keyframe animation I'm
going to name pulse now my heart has a
default size of I think 200 pixels and
it's width so what I'll do is I'll just
change this from opacity to width and
we'll start it at 200 pixels I can just
copy that and replace these opacity
settings
for with settings and then change the
middle one to be whatever I want it to
grow or shrink - I'll make it grow to
240 pixels and I can change the timing
on that animation the way it behaves and
all the aspects of the animation so
let's put that on point 5 so it beats
fast now we have to make sure this
pulsate class isn't referring to the
flash keyframes animation we have to
make it refer to this pulse keyframe
animation and that should be all set now
what we'll do is we'll go into the image
we'll type in image class and we'll put
it in pulse it now the heart should
appear to be beating I'm going to Center
everything in the page just so it pulses
better text-align:center now let's
preview that in Firefox there you go so
you have pulsing elements and flashing
elements and basically the logic is just
you're taking it from one state to
another state and then back again and
making sure that it's smooth that way
there's no abrupt transition and slap
the WebKit prefix on to the front of
that so you have the version with the
WebKit prefix and you have the version
for all other browsers and this won't be
something that we have to do always you
won't always have to use the WebKit
prefix because soon enough all
webkit-based browsers won't need this
prefix anymore it's just something we
have to do temporarily now let's view
that in chrome and there we go we have
flashing and pulsating elements that's
it there's not much to it if you enjoyed
