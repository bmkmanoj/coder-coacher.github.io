product of what you'll be learning how
to create using ActionScript 3 and flash
cs4 but keep in mind this will also work
in cs3 and cs5 just the same
let's press control enter to show you
the finished file and that keeps looping
and you'll see that it's a little
mixture of code a little mixture of
manual animation that we create but it
could be 100% dynamic if you like and I
discussed that a little bit okay I'm
working in flash cs4 but you could be in
cs3 or cs5 doesn't matter as long as you
use an ActionScript 3 create new
ActionScript 3 file I'm going to change
my stage to black and really what I'm
going to do is I'm going to bring in a
custom background you can do the same
you can bring it in from fireworks
Photoshop Illustrator wherever you made
press control-c there Bioworks
go into flash and on this first layer
I'm just going to press control V import
a single flat bitmap as movie clip ok
that's what I want I'm going to make my
stage match the size of this thing so
this thing's 681 299 681 to 99 I have a
frame rate of 30 frames per second
that's just going to be my static
background thing and I can name that
background I'm gonna give it another
layer this layer I'm going to call radar
background and that's simply going to be
an oval so you can specify your color
for your stroke and your fill before you
even draw the oval out or you can change
it afterwards so it's not too big a deal
so just draw in your oval alright so see
I have an oval here and it has a stroke
of 2 pixels and fill colors black the
stroke is a bright green you can see
mine is 280 by 280 so it's important to
note that you can make the color for
these things whatever you want so I'm
just going to highlight the fill there
I'm going to open the color palette for
the fill that I'm going to change it to
something that's like a dark green and
you can even make it darker if you want
make
really dark green there we go and the
stroke I don't want that so bright maybe
right there that looks good
now let's create another layer and this
one we're going to named wedge wedge and
far will have two things on that layer
so what you want to do is grab this
whole object and make sure you
double-click it so you get the fill and
the stroke selected press ctrl C go onto
the wedge and bar layer and press ctrl
shift V now once you have that in place
just lock that and actually you can make
it to where you can't see it anymore
then you want to take the radar
background make sure you highlight the
whole thing the stroke and the fill
convert it to a symbol I'm going to make
it registration Center press ok we don't
have to give that symbol an instance
name because that's just the radar
background for looks but I convert it to
a movie symbol so we can see the exact
center there all right so right above
the radar background layer I'm going to
create one more layer and I might not
keep this layer but for now I just want
to put a line on that layer right here
and as you draw your line down you can
hold shift to make sure it draws it in
perfectly straight and this stroke can
be really thin so you can make that a
very thin stroke now to make sure you
have that in the center just select this
radar background and you'll be able to
see if your line is dead center or not
just by moving it you can see I had mine
dead center when I drew it and that's
dead center so you take that line and
you press control C control shift B go
up to modify transform rotate 90 degrees
and there you'll have your perfect
little like reticule X or cross set
inside of your radar background and
those lines can just people looks hey
let's just name this layer lines now
let's unlock and make sure we can see
the wedge and bar layer again now this
one you can give it a fill of pink if
you want hot pink remove the stroke
altogether so you just have a pink fill
or whatever color you want to make that
so what you can do now is
grab a rectangle not a rectangle
primitive just a regular rectangle and
draw it out so I'm going to change the
color of that rectangle to some
different color I'm going to highlight
that control C control shift V I'm going
to move it so I move my copy and before
I let it go I'm going to press control C
control V again to make a third okay so
you see what I did I just put three
rectangles together to make one solid
shape I'm going to highlight this one
I'm going to take the Alpha down way
down on it maybe like twenty-eight
something like that so I can see those
crosshair lines behind it because I'm
going to cut out a wedge so now I'm
going to take this shape and move it
into place to where it fits perfectly
with this point matching this point here
you try and do it the best you can I'll
even zoom in on mine to about 400 to
make sure I match up those two points so
now you can see mine is still selected
because you can see all the little dots
on my shape still but now if I click
over here and I deselect it once I
select it again and press control X to
remove it it also removed and punched
out that circle leaving me just a wedge
right here that's what I wanted I can
put that back up to 100% alpha okay now
we take this thing go into the color for
it change it to a gradient fill now once
you have a gradient fill you open your
color palette to manipulate both edges
of that gradient so let's make this edge
that's white a bright green this edge
that's black let's make that a very dark
green to kind of try and match our radar
backgrounds color and take the Alpha all
the way down on that side now we're
going to transform the gradient so you
go up here to the transform tool make
sure you have the gradient transform
selected now we can turn this wheel here
and what we want to do since our little
bar is going to be revolving rotating
clockwise we want to make sure the
gradient is really the other way around
to where the bright part of it is on
this bottom edge here
and then it kind of fades off at an
angle so I'm going to twist my gradient
around so now I have it twisted around
and I'm going to move the gradient now
by holding this Center dot you want to
wind up with something that kind of
looks like that
where your gradient would come in at an
angle and be most bright at the top or
along this line all right so now that
wedge you have there you can right-click
it now convert it to a symbol it's going
to be a movie clip and this is very
important that you make the registration
bottom-left okay so you see the point
the registration point is now this
corner right here
and this is very important when we go to
revolving it rotating it through code so
now let's go ahead and add some code to
get this thing animated we go and put in
a new layer call it a s3 hit f9 you can
also lock that layer so you don't
accidentally put any objects on it you
just want code on that layer and here
we're going to have an enter frame event
which if you guys have seen any of my
other tutorials you'll know that this
enter frame event is used for animating
things or looping really it lets you
perform processes many times very
quickly so now let's give this an
instance name this movie clip call it
faded wedge and right here in the inter
frame event you type in faded wedge dot
rotation plus equals I don't know maybe
something like for whatever speed you
want it to go the higher this number the
faster it'll go the lower the slower
it'll go so let's see what that does by
pressing ctrl enter so now you see you
have your faded wedge that goes around
and round I'm still going to add one
more thing to that because it doesn't
look very authentic I want a line like a
bar a nice solid green bar to be at the
front of that wedge so on the wedge and
bar layer I'm simply going to draw out
another rectangle primitive I'm going to
make sure that's just a solid green
whatever color I want to make it maybe
not so bright I'm just going to give it
a height of two just change that to a
two I'm going to drag it into place here
let's zoom in on that so you can see a
real
so you see mine is set up to meet right
in the middle and it looks like we're
right in the center of that line let's
get right on the front of that wedge
right there you can see my width is a
little too long so let's move it in
actually I'm going to make the height
just one move it down into place right
there right in the center so I'm going
to try to make it meet the center point
right here as much as I can my right
click it converts the symbol make sure
the registration on that is Center left
okay let me give that an instance name
of radar line so now in the code I can
go in and just add another line here
make sure I put radar line here and
it'll go the same speed and the same
rotation you see there so now you have a
nice line that can click pick up on
blips or enemies you may even make a
beep I might even show you how when an
enemy is seen in the radar it'll flash
green when this revolving line hits it
and it'll also make a blip sound some
kind of beep will add so I'm going to
add one more thing to the wedge and bar
layer just grab a little oval primitive
I'm going to right-click it convert it
to a symbol movie clip it doesn't matter
the registration on this because I'm
just going to put it right on top here
and you can see I just applied it right
on top there if i zoom in to about 400
you'll see it real good see right there
ok so that's what I have right now looks
like that Center dot needs to move over
one maybe right there there we go okay I
just added some text static text to my
radar background layer I'm gonna lock
all my layers that way I don't
accidentally put something there that I
don't want to put on them now we're
going to add the enemy which are little
blips that are going to show up little
animated blips that will show up on the
radar screen so we'll make it to where
when the sensor bar goes over them
they'll make a little sound a little
bleep sound or whatever flips out and
we'll try and make it to where they kind
of light up they really glow and then
the glow dies down so we're going to
make a custom animation to do that so
before we create that layer and
everything let's just go to file import
you go to the sound that you want import
to library whatever sound that you want
to bring in and now inside of my library
I have this sound called metallic vibe
and that's the song I'm going to use so
whenever a blip is picked up on my radar
screen that's the sound that will alert
now before I go to making the custom
animation that is going to be our little
enemy blips I have to mention to some
people because a lot of you guys are
advanced ActionScript users and you know
about something called hid test object
so you can use some hid test object
evaluations if you would like to just
put another layer here and put some blip
movie clips in a dynamic sense moving
around on the radar screen and use hid
test object to see if the sensor bar
comes in contact with any of those
little blip movie clips that you have
but to make it look the best I think in
the easiest way to go about it to where
I don't have to spend two hours
explaining a whole bunch of code is
doing a manual animation and I think
you'll like the results but there is a
way you can do this all dynamically by
using movie clips that would be your
little enemy and using hid test object
between the movie clip and the censor
bar that's revolving around and around
and I already tried it hit test object
works when that Center censor bar is
going around and around
you can put code to evaluate with hit
test object to see if censor bar comes
in contact with enemy or blip but we're
not going to go that route in this
tutorial we're going to make a custom
animation that's a movie clip it looks
smooth and it will correspond to the
revolving this radar sensor bar so right
above the lines layer let's add a new
layer and let's rename that blip movie
clip or you can name it enemy enemy
movie clip this is where we'll have a
little movie clip with our little
animated blips we'll have the time
amount just
right to where they correspond to the
revolutions that we create and you got
to be careful that if you change your
speed to change your custom animation
because we have this running through
code so you can change the speed of that
little bar the little censor bar that's
revolving around and around and the
wedge so if you change that you're going
to want to change your custom animations
speed as well for when blips are firing
off so let's just grab a oval primitive
and draw it right here to create the
first blip and then we'll right-click it
and convert it to a movie clip symbol
okay so there you can see I have a green
circle I'm going to resize that to be
very small maybe 3 by 3 3 pixels by 3
pixels burner converts a symbol this
registration could be top left it really
it could be whatever you want okay now
all the work for animating this little
enemy guy is going to be done inside of
him now that he's a movie clip you can
double click it go inside actually
before we double click and go inside
let's go back into the main scene let's
put it at the position we would want it
to be entering the radar screen so right
about there maybe I'll right at the very
edge that's where we'll first pick it up
and sense it so now let's double click
inside of it now what we're going to do
is animate this little guy remember now
he's just a shape so let's right-click
it again
and convert to symbol make sure he's a
movie clip that way because moving a
movie clip around and adjusting
properties giving a global effect is a
whole lot easier animating those kind of
things on a movie clip symbol that's why
we just made it a movie clip so when the
application starts up this little sensor
bar and that wedge is going to go around
and around and very quickly the first
time around we're going to need to pick
up this bleep so the first thing that's
going to happen is let's see maybe
around frame 20 will make that thing
snap into view and we'll see if that's
the right frame so on frame 1 you can
make the alpha for that zero that way
nobody can see
see if you zoom in you'll see you cannot
even see it until you get to frame 20
then it appears we're gonna see how that
works out let's try it
okay frame 20 was way too early
let's go extend this out you can just
highlight that and drag that so now I'm
at frame 120 where it appears let me try
that goes around up took a little too
long that time frame 60 check it out
press control enter see right when the
bar goes right about there it showed up
now right there where it shows up we
want to have that sound ping off so
let's go up give it a new layer right
there in frame 60 press f6 create a
keyframe and there you're going to add
that sound right here now you press
control enter so it gives you a little
but we really want this thing to glow
when that happens right when the bar
goes over we wanted to really light up
and glow and then kind of fade out so we
can create the fade out effect by going
to about brain oh no maybe 65 and then
head hit f6 on that keyframe hit f6 to
create a keyframe there then maybe I
don't know frame 75 you put a keyframe
there as well go in between them create
classic tween and then you take this
thing from full alpha all the way down
to alpha zero right here alpha zero and
then you can move your mouse through
there and you'll see how it'll fade out
real quick that might be too quick for
you so you can just grab that a hold of
that keyframe and move it around
wherever you need it so let's see what
happens now control enter and then it
fades out
if you want to put a bright glow on it
actually these two key frames can be one
in the same so I'm just gonna remove
this one I'm gonna clear key frame I'm
just gonna move this one back by
grabbing indirect and then right here on
this frame and highlight this item and
I'm going to put a glow on it and glow
effect glow really bright green make
this medium strength really really
bright so you see how it'll start really
bright and dim out now so now press
control enter and you'll see a little
more realistic radar pinging going off
what we have to do is time it so the
next time around he's a little bit
closer and then it pings off again using
this this movie clips timeline just like
with a put the first ping enemy pane
enemy ping ping so I'll just keep using
this layer for the put a little dot and
then use this layer for the sound when
it needs to fire off so I'm going to
gauge the next time where I need to put
these frames so actually I can highlight
all of these frames once you have them
all highlighted you can right-click them
and copy them copy those frames that way
you can do the same thing but just in
another location let's bring this back
down to maybe about 200% get that
interview real nice next time I wanted
to ping off I want my object to be maybe
right about here so that's what I'll do
let's go out to maybe what the first one
took 60 frames probably 130 I'm going to
highlight all these frames then I'm
going to right click paste frames you
see what it did it put that same
animation there of my little dot now all
I have to do is move my dot or you can
just create a whole new animation the
way we did the first time so right here
where it starts I'm going to move its
starting position and its ending
position so you just highlight the
starting position grab
the object and move the X and the y but
right about there
that looks good or maybe it will make it
have an arc an arcing movement something
like that and right here again we put f6
and add our sound over here you can just
press f5 right here you add the sound on
this keyframe that we just created add
that sound once again we might have to
move these frames around if it's not
timed right let's check it out see if it
see if we timed it correctly well no and
the movement the ending position I still
have to move that one that's why it
animated to the side so where's this one
this one is 33 and 8 the ending position
is still at 0 so let's make that 33 and
8 make this 33 make this 8 and we
definitely know by checking it out that
it went off too early so we have to move
these frames a little bit so all we got
to do is drag and highlight them once
you have them all highlighted like that
just move them grab them and move them
there so now mine is starting on 164 the
second blip and see if that's closer oh
it's very close so I'll move it back
just a little bit all right let's try
that
much better so now you can see it's
moved so you guys get the idea now you
can just keep going with that animation
and make sure everything is timed out
just right if you need to extend any
frames here you can just press f5 like
if you wanted to go to 220 just to time
things correctly you press f5 on those
frames do whatever you need to do you
can continue moving your dot around make
ten little blips if you want and also
keep in mind like we mentioned before
that if you are a super dorky dynamic
guy you wanted all of this to be
rendered dynamically have dynamic
movement and pick up the enemies using
bleeps you're going to have to use
something like hit test object or other
more advanced code to sense when that
censor bar that's moving around and
around hits an enemy otherwise you could
do it just the way I did it manually
right there so that's what you wind up
with and just finish off finish up your
animation but any sound you want design
into weight designing to look any way
you want so I'm going to finish mine up
and put maybe a few more blips in there
till the enemy reaches the center
coordinate all right guys have fun
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
