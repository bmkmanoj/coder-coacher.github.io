will show you how to instantly swap or
change the style sheet on your web pages
without reloading them the web page
doesn't even have to refresh or reload
and it'll be like Joshua changed
instantly like magic okay we're going to
start here with the bare bones of an
html5 web document darky now in the body
element we're going to type in this and
we are going to make sure we wrap that
in an h2 element that way it's nice and
big on the page we can see it real well
now under that h2 element we're going to
start a button element so here's the
opening and closing button tag now
inside I'm going to put an on click
event and I don't like these to be
uppercase like Dreamweaver makes an
application I don't know why it does
that but I like all of mine lowercase
and I think the official way to write
them all is lowercase Dreamweaver will
camelcase them you see all of these
event handlers or camelcase in
Dreamweaver when it puts it in I don't
know why now we want this first button
to say dark stylesheet because when that
button is pressed it's going to change
the whole page to use the dark
stylesheet now when the button is
clicked we're going to execute a
function called swap stylesheet and
we're going to send it one parameter one
argument is going to be passed through
this function it's going to be the name
of the stylesheet that you want to
change to now that's all you need in
your button now we're going to make two
more buttons just so we have some more
examples in variety so you guys can see
how far you can go with it make as many
as you want I'm going to make this one
stay blue stylesheet I'm going to make
this one say default stylesheet and this
will make default dot CSS load this
button will make blue dot CSS load now
you go up into the head section of the
document and we're going to open up a
script tag I'm going to make sure the
script tag has a type of text JavaScript
close it right there the opening script
tag and then put the closing part of
that script element right there now you
have a place to put JavaScript within
your document so when either one of
these buttons get pressed we have to
have a swap stylesheet function ready to
execute the JavaScript so let's
place that in right now function swap
stylesheet open closed parenthesis open
your curly brace and go down and put the
closing curly brace there you have your
function nest all set up and ready to go
now this function is in taking one
parameter which is the name of the CSS
file that we wish to change to so let's
just put the variable name for the
parameter will be sheet and that will
hold the value sheet will hold the value
of the CSS stylesheets as they come in
now within this function we're going to
manipulate a link tag so we need to put
that link tag in right now and this is
going to link up to the default
stylesheet like you would normally on on
a web page
so you put link and the first thing
we're going to do is give this link tag
and ID you might not normally do this
because this is just the normal way you
load in your default style sheet or
whatever into your web page so normally
we don't give the link tag an ID but but
in this case we are and we're going to
call it page style because we're going
to need to talk to that element through
JavaScript now the next is the rel
attribute and that we set to stylesheet
and then we make sure we put the type
attribute and that we set to text CSS
and then href for the style sheet that
you want to have via web page and we're
just going to type in default dot CSS
just like you normally would now the
only thing different about this link
element from how you would normally have
your link element loading in your
stylesheet is it now has an ID okay now
just one more line of code and we're
done inside of your Swap style sheet
function you're going to type in
document dot get element by ID and the
ID that we're going to target is going
to be page style which is our little
link tag or link element that loads in
the default style sheet for our web page
now on that element we're going to use
the set attribute method that takes two
parameters the first parameter is the
attribute of that element that you want
to affect so I'm going to put href
because I want to effect the href
attribute here of this link element on
the second argument we pass through the
set attribute method is sheet and you
remember that holds the value of
whichever style sheet is being requested
to low
into the page so at this very moment
when this function executes this line is
going to run and it's going to alter the
HRF of this link element to change
whatever stylesheet the page is being
styled with and it happens in real time
there's no reloading refreshing or
anything it just occurs and that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
