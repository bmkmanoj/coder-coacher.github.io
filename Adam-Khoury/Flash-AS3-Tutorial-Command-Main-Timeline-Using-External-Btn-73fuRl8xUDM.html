here and this one's going to be short
and sweet we're going to be working in
flash cs3 in actionscript 3 and this
will also work in cs4 with your
actionscript-3 projects and we have a
full remember who is looking to load
external swfs into the main FL a
container file or the main st swf
container file like we show in one of
our tutorials and I link to it here and
so you can see the URL to that tutorial
that shows you the files that I'm about
to adjust here to expand them and give
the functionality that the NIMH Chi was
asking for and so what we'll do is what
what name she wants is to have the
external swf buttons inside of it
control the main timeline of the main
file and that's exactly what I'll show
you how to do okay so let's minimize
this let's open up main file so you can
see a s3 command external loaded swf
that's the name of the tutorial okay so
all we have to do is open my main file
from that tutorial lesson and I'm going
to package up this whole new tutorial in
its own separate package that way things
will stay separated and new since this
is different functionality okay so here
you can see there's nothing but these
words let's just get those off here
remove them and you can see there's
nothing on the timeline is just the code
there's no objects here there's just a
code that's calling in the external swf
and then we control the items in the S
sub yet but what our user wants are for
remember once is a more of like a click
function to where the buttons so will
duplicate that role
out eventlistener right there and then
we'll give it a click name here let's
just say click my clip click so all we
need is a little function let's call it
my clip click function we just
duplicated that rollover function or the
my clip out function and we renamed it
Mike click click so now we'll just
change this to say go to and stop let's
say 20 of this main timeline this is
what the users after let me show you now
let's go to frame 20 new keyframe let's
just put the word yay I did it see how
easy that is now what's going to happen
is when I click the buttons or in my
example they're going to be the little
blue balls flying around when I click
those but those would be your buttons
just pretend that those are your buttons
is the same thing so if they're sitting
still if they're moving it doesn't
matter we're going to give them the the
items in the external swf are going to
control our main timeline here it's
going to shoot to frame 20 when we click
them of the main timeline and you saw
the code adjustments I just add an event
listener for click let's make sure this
says click and then go to and stop 20 of
the main timeline here you seem pretty
easy there's a couple of ways you can go
about this too there's many ways to skin
a cat in flash so let's press ctrl enter
and see if when I press when I click on
the blue balls that are flying around if
it shoots the main timeline here to
frame 20 we'll see if that happens so we
should see the blue balls and the word
yay if it doesn't work we won't see the
word yay okay so there's the blue balls
oh wait sorry
let's put a stop action here if you're
going to have a timeline you got to have
a stop action there if you're going to
have more than one frame or else it'll
loop ok so now our stop action comes in
there's our externally loaded swf it
came in you see that now if I say these
are your buttons in your external list
of you up when you click one you see
that i clicked it and it shot to frame
20 of this main timeline you'll see thou
that's how it works very easy so I'll
package this up and maybe I won't have
it for download but I'll at least get
the video up so you guys can see exactly
what i did and modify that file or I
might just stick the lesson up I'll have
the source files in the description of
the video if I do ok see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
