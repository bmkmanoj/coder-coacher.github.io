tutorial which is accompanied by a free
flash source file that anyone can
download you can learn how to program
the combobox component which is
drop-down lists and in this particular
application I made it to where the combo
box is populated has different lists
populated into it according to what user
has chosen that they want to choose from
a list so here we have jackets if they
choose jackets there's three jackets in
Area C leather sheepskin and wool they
choose cars becomes horde Mustang
porsche 911 and dodge viper and then
when they choose one you see how it says
porsche 911 you chose Forks 911 you
chose ford mustang change the jacket
list then it says you chose sheepskin
you chose leather so it's pretty basic
demonstration on how to make your combo
box component a little more dynamic
select create new flash actionscript 3
project and the first thing i'm going to
do is change my stage size to maybe 2 40
and height I'll leave it 550 why that's
good that's okay and here I'm just going
to put BG for background layer this one
I'm going to put controls do a little
more manually with this
component this combo box but it can be
created in very much the same way the
other ones do dynamically so
actionscript three layer controls layer
and background layer in the background
layer I'm just going to draw out a
rectangle to serve as my background
there for my little application white
with a black edge okay so first thing
I'm going to do for the controls layer
let's make sure we lock the background
layer and lock the ActionScript 3 layer
2 on the controls layer let's highlight
that go into the components library and
grab the combo box drag that out now
let's give it an instance name of cb1
combo box 1 now we can refer to it in
our code using that instance name let's
also change the width now I'm going to
drag out a couple of button instances
and work with them manually as well in
the button instance tutorial we showed
you guys how to show you here we can
just take this one press ctrl c ctrl
shift V now we have to we'll just give
them in different instance names
okay so this one go two parameters label
we're going to change this to cars and
this label we're going to change two
jackets okay cars jackets and our combo
box I'm going to make sure we have
instance names on these buttons so let's
go back to the properties tab and let's
give the jackets button an instance name
of jackets underscore BTN just to keep
it simple underscore BTN cars the same
thing cars underscore BTN now we'll just
do one more thing for the controls layer
and that's a dynamic text field drag
that out give it an instance name of
status underscore txt
that looks good bring it down a little
more let's make it about 27 nice and big
you can see what's going on okay also
drag these down a little
it should only be one line so let's go
single line it's not much data it's
going to be displayed there a little
smaller ok now we're ready to add the
code that we need bring everything
together let's make this black so we can
see it that'd be nice huh actually let's
make it green okie dokie
all right now
put that right about there is where it's
even under those two buttons as best we
can okay now we can code it out in the
ActionScript 3 layer we can go ahead and
lock the controls layer let's make sure
it takes fields right status single line
yes yes great okie dokie now we can lock
the controls layer 2 in the ActionScript
3 later let's press f9 to open our
actions panel start coding in it first
thing we're going to do is create a
couple of functions for populating the
lists according to what the user presses
what they would like to choose from cars
or jackets let's put a colon here void
open curly brace and close curly brace
now what we're going to do is add
objects or add items rather to cb1 and
their label so add item the open
parentheses close parentheses in the
semi colon within the parentheses we
open curly brace and close curly brace
now within the two curly braces all we
have to do is type in label colon and
then give it a string whatever label you
want this will be ford mustang
that's good get some spacing in here
okay now the next one is going to be
very similar so you just grab that whole
line let's go down one line pop it in
and one more now once we have those any
changes of values here for the label
which will be the value when it gets
sent in a form type situation ok so
Porsche 911 and let's change this one to
dodge viper case we have ford mustang
porsche 911 and dodge viper so what's
going to happen is this is not going to
populate this combo box right away it's
just a function waiting that we are
going to fire off of the appropriate
times to populate that combo box with
this list so let's grab that whole list
let's make another list called jackets
list
so we have jacket list now let's just
change these when you use the same combo
box I'm just going to switch the lists
leather we kind of jacket to anyone here
have a sheepskin and maybe a wool jacket
okay so now we have our two functions
that are going to populate the lists
when we need them to and now we're going
to add a function here it's going to be
for the cars button and we're going to
add another function for the jackets
button so when they get clicked so
siphon function let's do the cars button
first cars
BTN click into the function name
this is going to be a vent mouseevent
colon void open curly brace close curly
brace there's our function nest for the
cars button click function now oops now
we need an event listener so we say cars
underscore BTN except the name we gave
it let's make sure cars underscore BTN
and jackets underscore BTN so cars
underscore BTN add event listener and
it's going to be a mouse event for this
click function here so siphon mouse is
bent dot click all caps comma the name
of the function will go right there so
let's pop it in cars put and click right
there okay
so now we can take that control see
actually let's go ahead and make the
event listener for the jackets button
really quick and this one will change
the name of the function so they don't
get duplicate function name ever and
this one will be jackets the way they
have the listeners corresponding to
separate functions so we need a function
for that jackets button let's call a
jacket button click there it is okay
now since we're using it in this type of
situation the first thing that has to be
done when each button is clicked is we
have to remove the data within the combo
box if we don't it will just keep
stacking in and adding more and more
data adding items so we have to claim c
v1 dot remove all so we're going to
remove all the items that were
previously previously inside of the
combo box ok so we remove all then the
next line is going to be running the
card list function here executing it
there's our custom function that we made
now we're going to execute it right here
make it run at that moment so what's
going to happen is the combo box gets
cleared of any items that were in it
that are in it and then it gets
populated with whatever list you like
according to what button the user
presses and we need one more thing here
so we can show some status about what's
going on so in the status text field is
equal to the string that will say you
clicked on the cars button
that's it now
the data within this function is going
to be very much the same we remove when
they click the jackets button we remove
all the items because we don't want cars
in our list so we remove all the items
and we put the jackets list inside
jacket list this function will execute
and add these items to the list first
they'll be removed of course and then we
advil items then we say in the static
text field you clicked on the jackets
button and that's pretty much that now
let's put one more event listener cb1
for the combo box itself put the on
change event so let's grab this add
event listener open closed parenthesis
and semicolon now within the parentheses
here this is going to be a change event
so let's claim event dot change comma
and the function that we want to fire
off on this change event when the combo
box when you know when they bring down
the drop-down list and they select
something from it that is the change
event and we're going to have something
fire off when that happens this function
right here that I'm about to create
let's call it display selection this is
going to be quick and easy let's see
let's grab this line right here
put it right here let's go down one more
line say function closed off the
function nest change the function name
to display selection and this is going
to be event colon event we don't want to
say mouseevent there and now we're just
going to put something in the status
text field which is going to be a string
that says you chose and then we're going
to append to that text with the value of
what they chose so you claim you get the
value of what they chose by doing this
CB 1 dot selected item dot label so
it'll pull that selected items label
into whatever you need to go to if
you're using this in the forum situation
you want to send this to in the form to
you yours it perform sorry if people are
using a form on your site and you want
to send this data to yourself an email
or place it into a database that's how
you access the value of what they chose
right there okay so I think that's
everything everything should be good to
go so now let's press control enter
press cars button it says you clicked on
the cars button and look at that we have
a cars list in there now before the
portion dodge and when I choose Dodge
Viper says you chose you chose Dodge
Viper it's exactly what we wanted now if
I click the jackets button it should
clear this list and put jackets in this
list and not cars you clicked on the
jackets button and inside the list is
three jackets types sheepskin wool and
leather click on the cars list back to
cars okay so that shows you a pretty
strong level of dynamics about how the
combo box works and I was using a little
more manually this time just drag
dragging it out to stage from my
components library instead of creating
it dynamically all through code but you
can create those dynamically all through
code just like anything else it's very
easy and before we wrap this little
example application up on the controls
layer I'm just going to slap some
graphics I have here in fireworks group
that
modify flatten the selection control see
let's bring it into flash put it right
there on the controls Leah by pressing
ctrl V bring it in as a movie clip there
it is cars &amp;amp; jackets let's put that on
the bottom layer dar we go tires
beautiful let's bring these down a
little there we go
vertical ok we'll see you guys next
