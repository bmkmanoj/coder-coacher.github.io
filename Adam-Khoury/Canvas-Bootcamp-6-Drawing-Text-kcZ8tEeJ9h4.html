JavaScript methods behind drawing text
and text strokes to the canvas element
the first thing I'm going to do is add a
couple of comments that way we can all
see the parameters that the fill text
method and the stroke text method intake
so the first parameter they take in is a
text whatever string of text is to be
displayed then the x position and the y
position for that text and the max width
is an optional parameter so first I'll
use the fill text method CTX dot fill
text then I'm going to add the
parameters needed first I'm going to add
the string of text and I'll just write
in text on canvas now the next parameter
is the exposition we'll put that at 50
and the Y position we'll put that at 50
as well so if we refresh our canvas over
here we see that we get the string text
on canvas now right above that we're
going to use the font property and we're
going to put in a space separated list
of attributes for the font so I'm going
to add the space separated list of
attributes that I want I want it to be
italicized bold then I want 56 pixels
for the size of the text and I wanted to
have the Arial font family and if Arial
is not available it'll fall back to
sans-serif
so if i refresh my canvas now I get all
the attributes that I want applied to
that font so really you could just put
it on 400 for normal and then 900 for
bold or the word bold if I change the
size if I put this at 30 pixels and if
you don't want the text italicized you
could just remove the italic and it's
normal but I'll just leave that in place
so you guys can reference it now I'm
going to add a fill style which we
learned about in previous exercises and
this is an orange color let me refresh
now I have orange text now I'm going to
write in C TX dot stroke text which is
another method we can call on that will
add a stroke around our text and we can
just borrow the values that are in our
Phil text method put them in the stroke
text method and refresh our canvas then
we get a nice stroke and you can use
line styles and stroke styles to style
this stroke and we learned about those
in previous exercises you can use CTX
line width for instance equal to three
and then refresh then you see you get a
three pixel width on your stroke around
the text so lots of different ways you
can style the fill and the stroke for
your text let's get rid of that line
width now we're going to apply the text
align property so we'll type in CTX dot
text align and we're going to make it
equal to start by default
let me put single quotes around
everything that way it's all consistent
you can have single quotes or double
quotes around all of these strings
alright so we'll see that start has a
default setting if we refresh our canvas
we see no change but if we change that
to end refresh we'll see that our text
moves change it to left-to-right
and center so I'll just leave it on
start that way you can specify certain
alignments for the text now we're going
to apply the CTX dot baseline property
and the default baseline is alphabetic
so if i refresh I should see no
difference or what if I change
alphabetic to top and refresh middle and
refresh bottom refresh hanging refresh
you'll see that some of these settings
are identical to other settings within
the list so I'll just leave mine on
hanging now if you wanted it to be where
the stroke or maybe another line of text
had these properties applied to it or
the Styles you can just take your fill
text control X and put it above those
and then that way your stroke will be
the only thing affected by those
properties so let's refresh you'll see
that the stroke has taken on these
properties the align and the baseline
properties but the fill of the text has
not that's because we drew the fill text
in and then we assign those properties
and then we draw the stroke and that's
pretty much everything there is to know
about drawing text on the canvas now of
course you can animate that text but
animation techniques are something we're
going to cover in later exercises we're
going to get through all the basics
first now if you want to add the
optional max width you can put this at
something like 200 and let's also do
that well you don't have to do it for
both you can just do it for the fill and
then refresh you'll see that it has a
max width now of 200 pixels the same
goes for the stroke text method so let's
put that on something like 300 so it's
not so squished there we go
and that completes the JavaScript
methods and properties behind drawing
text and text strokes to the canvas
element in the next exercise will cover
