here and I would love to show you a
finished product of what we're about to
create but I haven't created it yet in
this project we're just gonna wing it
we're gonna build as we go and I'm not
gonna rehearse or pre create the
application and we'll have a better
sense of the workflow that way we're
gonna make is an mp3 player that has a
clickable scrollable playlist that way
all of the song titles and artists would
be visible in a scrollable list and each
song whether you have 500 or 300 can be
clickable in that list and I believe it
could be an unlimited amount of songs in
it and the nicest thing about it is it
will be xml configured that way somebody
without flash could use this application
for their websites so you can as a
developer build something like this and
sell it if you make it nice enough so
I'm gonna be teaching everybody how to
make their apps a little more modular a
little more content management system
type applications to where somebody
without the actual software can
manipulate it with simple text files or
XML files let's rock and roll you don't
have to be an expert in flash to build
this with me you can be a complete
beginner I'm going to show you
everything you need to norming and I'm
also gonna release these source files
for free after we get done creating it
so people that come into the lessons
later on maybe in the year they could
just snatch up the files right away but
and nobody can get to the files actually
right now because all of the sites are
down and GoDaddy is working on the
issues so once my sites are back up all
the files will be available again all
right let's get the building this thing
let's create new ActionScript 3 file
this is gonna be set up in a series
because we're gonna cover quite a few
things and we're gonna make sure that
somebody beginning can follow along with
this as well so we don't want just to
fly through everything
for all the experts in flash to say okay
I see what he's doing good good good
good good let's go some of you guys get
too antsy you know just fast forward if
you get impatient don't yell at me all
right
so let's go into the components library
we have a new file here I'm gonna set
the frame rate up to 30 just to match
with UCS for guys is you have 30 by
default and I'm going to make the
background black well let's make it that
gray color there okay now I'm gonna drag
out from the components library list
this is gonna power pretty much it's
going to power a whole mp3 player and
we're gonna also add buttons later on
like play buttons back and forth and all
that good stuff but what we want to do
here is and I can't say for sure how
many features we're gonna add but it's
gonna be pretty full-featured and the
main focus of it is going to be this
clickable playlist so once we have this
onstage and it's highlighted its given
an instance name of list keep it simple
now let's right-click it convert to
symbol call it my whole player that way
we do this so that if you have a full
flash website there won't be any
timeline discrepancies or issues or
complex you can just pop this little
movie clip called my whole player
anywhere in your full flash website or
if you have an HTML website you want to
put this on a page with mingled with
HTML you can do that also but we'll make
it this way so both scenarios will work
okay the first thing we're gonna cover
is making this list component customized
and rendered and designed exactly the
way you want because you might not want
the regular the cells in the list to
have the regular white background with
the black text on it you might want a
black background on the cells with a
white text or maybe black background
with a blue text so I'm gonna show you
how to do that so first thing we'll do
is double click inside of our whole
player movie clip
and now here's the list component let's
go ahead and go into the help and scribe
a for loop I typed in for loop press
enter or press search and there's a
little for loop example let's copy that
now let's go into the actions panel by
highlighting layer one actually on layer
one let's leave that list component by
itself and let's add a new layer by
clicking insert layer and we'll call
this one a s3 now in the ActionScript 3
layer let's just lock that so we don't
accidentally put anything on it
highlight that key frame and press f9 or
go up to window actions and here we're
just going to type in let's put a stop
action because we're gonna have a couple
more frames in here there's going to be
more than just this one so they want to
have a stop action first thing in our
application now the next thing we want
to do is put this for loop in that we
copied from the help file there and I
like my function setup like that so I'm
going to bring that bracket up now here
where it says trace I so this is going
to put five items I'm gonna have it put
ten items change that five to a ten and
remove this trace and here we're gonna
type in list dot add item and here's how
we're pushing items into the list cells
to render what is going to be in the
list and this is just going to be for
example sake this isn't going to throw
our actual mp3 songs in the list but we
want to make it look the way we want it
to look before we actually program it we
want to design it so in between the add
item parentheses there we'll type in a
curly bracket and a couple spaces is
another curly bracket let's put a space
in between those there okay the first
thing we're going to type in is label
and this is what's going to be showing
in the cell and we'll just say label
colon is equal to the value is going to
be
song + I so we have to do is that this I
hear because I is the the index of the
loop so let's go ahead and use that
number and each time the loop goes over
these ten items it's going to increment
this little I number so this variable of
I is gonna reach ten eventually when it
gets the end of the loop but it'll have
a value of one through ten as it goes
through the loop so we can say song plus
double-quote double-quote
and in there actually the song has to be
in between double quotes sorry type the
word song space and then plus I there we
go so that's the label it'll have on it
let's go ahead and press control enter
and see what happens see okay so it says
song one starting a song zero you wanted
to make that it started one you just
make this a one okay so that's a good
test now we can design this thing now
that we have some items in it we can
look at it and actually design it the
way we want it to look now let me stress
again this for loop is not how we're
going to be adding the songs the actual
songs to our player this is just
referencing how the player looks right
now so we can design it let's change the
width I'm gonna highlight it change the
width to say 300 I'm gonna make it nice
and wide so let's press ctrl enter you
see the effect that has so now you have
a nice little list each one's clickable
and when you click them they turn blue
when you go over them they have an over
effect of light blue and you can change
all of that I'm gonna show you how to do
that right now the first thing we want
to do is make those cells change from
white to black see those cells in there
so let's double click inside of the list
component right now
inside you'll see all the things that
make up the component and those are
little movie clips that you can double
click and manipulate so let's go to the
sender the cell renderer skins
double-click it and this is the easy way
to manipulate things see the up skin
double-click that one right there is
where you can edit it highlight it
change it from white to black now go
back to scene 1 or my whole player
double click into my whole player and
then press control enter now you see
I've made the cells black and that blue
effect is it's pretty cool but I'm gonna
change that too to not be so bright so
what we'll do is now you'll notice that
on the cells you can't see the text now
unless you put your mouse over it so we
can change that text color inside of the
component and by the way this method
works for most of the components it's
all we have to do it now is type in
lists list dot set renderer style open
close parenthesis semicolon in between
the parentheses let's type in a set of
double quotes a comma and the function
not the function this variable here for
the format that's how it's going to be
applied to the list component here we're
going to type in text format now let's
press control enter together to see what
we have should be white text there you
go now the text doesn't show up when we
have that bright blue on the over we're
gonna take care of that too I'm gonna
tell you I'm gonna show you how to
manipulate this whole thing to look
exactly the way you want it easily
okay let's double click inside of this
list component and tweak it some more
where we need to tweak it cell renderer
skins
and the one was the over skin that was
so bright
let's go into that one make sure we
unlock and view all items there so you
unlock it make sure you have colors in
those view view blocks there now
highlight that and change it to any
color you want I'm gonna go with a
custom color maybe blueish yeah
let's go blue I like burrow
I reckon or rot okay so maybe nice dark
something like that okay
now let's press control enter oh yeah oh
yeah like Mizuki says let's go in to
change that color make it a little bit
darker we want a very subtle effect so
we're not tacky as designers we gotta
think
don't be tacky now look how subtle and
sweet that is as smooth as butter baby
now close that out and go back into cell
renderer here and you can also change
the outline that it's gonna have I'm
just gonna leave it the way it is now
let's go into list here click list and
you'll be in the list section of your in
your movie clips of that list component
now see the scrollbar skin if you press
control enter it's almost too bright for
our little design we have here now so we
can change that by double clicking
inside of this control bar and yeah just
manipulate all these the way I just
showed you
let's let's get this one first I'm just
gonna do a couple and then you can you
can do whatever you want up we went this
one first click double click that
this is a group double-click inside the
group and it has that color on it and it
looks like it might be have a gradient
so you go over to the color wheel
instead of selecting here you go to the
color wheel I think I just changed the
color let's go see yeah but it has a
gradient on it so you don't want to
change the color there you go to the
wheel or the color palette rather open
the color palette and then you'll have
the gradient to manipulate there let's
make this dark black really dark and cue
and then make the other color on the
other side of the gradient dark as well
maybe right about there vertical now
let's go back in here and then go back
in here and we can manipulate the other
things as we go so you can manipulate
all these stuff I'm not going to show
you on video because now you have the
gist of how to go in and manipulate all
these components bar skins and cells and
all that stuff and set the text ok let's
press control in to take a quick look
you can see now we have a nice black
scroll bar and I'm gonna change it to be
to not have that bright white on the
over effect but you can see what I'm
shooting for now and you can do the same
similar thing I'm gonna adjust all the
all the colors that I want and then I'll
resume
okay I'm pretty happy with this push
control intern I'll show you this is
what I have I adjusted the the up and
down arrow buttons and I'm gonna do it a
few more tweaks on it you can see how I
made everything took it from its
original gray and white to more of a
black and chrome and dark blue effects
alright let's go back into a whole
player movie clip let's just go in the
scene one so we can get a normal view of
our stage again double click into the
whole player and there's the list
component okay so let's take another
quick look at the code we have going so
far this a little example here will be
we'll get rid of this but we're gonna
keep this formatting and the next in
part two I'm going to show you how to
get the we're gonna take a look at the
XML file and how simple that is to
adjust for anybody and we'll also go
into bringing that XML file into flash
parsing all that data and putting it all
into this scroll each song that you want
to add to the XML file and what will
happen is song one will be playing by
default when the application opens we're
gonna program it to be playing song 1 by
default and each subsequent song that
gets clicked upon it's gonna make that
song stop and the new ones start playing
so look forward to part two when we'll
have we won't get to where it's an
actual finished player yet in part two
but we're going to load the XML and
understand all that parsing it and
setting up these list items through the
X external XML</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
