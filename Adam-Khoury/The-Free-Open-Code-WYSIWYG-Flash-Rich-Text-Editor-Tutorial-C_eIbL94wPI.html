another flash building tutorial in
today's lesson we're going to show you
how to create or start creating your own
what you see is what you get rich text
editors the WYSIWYG so if you go to well
first let's look at what call requested
here in a flash input text box I want to
know how to get buttons that make the
font style different like the toolbar
right above here bold underline italics
and Link maybe even HTML can anyone help
me because i want to add this to my CMS
website so this is handy if you're
making user input forms or if you have
CMS systems that you create for your
clients if you're a web developer and
you want to give your clients the
ability to change the data on their web
pages whenever they like without you
having to do anything so if you want to
program them something like that that in
that's what we're going to show you how
to do if you click post response here
and this could actually turn into the
community project that we've been
looking to all collaborate on if you
guys want to join me on this I'll show
you how to get the system started so
what we'll do is try and mimic this
thing here this wysiwyg editor is what
you see is what you get rich text editor
which is javascript-based you see if i
type in text into the forum and I bold
it or italicized it it takes to those
things or you can change the color and
we want to do that in flash and the
reason why this is good for us to be
doing here at develop PHP is because
this is a fully custom program site
which there's not many sites that are
custom program nowadays so I'm
struggling with the issue of giving this
rich text editor who's javascript editor
to chrome and safari users
so if you guys want to help me expand
this what we'll do is we'll pop it in
right here once we get it all made and
plus we'll deliver it to the web as a
free open-source little at flash
application that anybody can use for
their projects and a lot of people will
use it because it will be browser
universal so this one it doesn't work
for chrome and safari users and it works
for internet explorer and firefox users
it shows up but for Chrome and Safari it
doesn't so if we replace it with a flash
one everybody in our forums will be able
to post and format their code and
everything just the right ways exactly
how we wanted to so I think that's what
we're going to do ok let's start this
flash actionscript 3 rich text editor so
I'll click flash file actionscript 3 i'm
in flash cs3 and you can be in flash cs4
working in actionscript 3 and the first
layer i'm going to name interface make a
new layer on top of that we'll name this
one actionscript then we're going to
grab a button out of the common
libraries window here go to buttons and
I really like these gray playback
rounded buttons the gray ones drag one
of those out i'm going to double-click
inside of it unlock these two top layers
and remove the elements that are on them
by pressing ctrl x highlight and press
ctrl x and then go to indicator delete
that layer and on the left the only
indicator layer left let's put a letter
B to stand for bold make it black
sighs it right there we go make sure it
gets right in there where we want it and
on the overstate let's press f6 and the
downstate f6 and the overstate let's
make that a blue see how that looks
press control enter oh that is static
text to make sure that static text
should have made them sure that with
static text first now that it's static
text it will look better move it up a
little 11 all three okay so that's great
there's our bolding button this is the
button that will be used for bolding so
let's make sure it's on the interface
layer and put it up top somewhere now
let's drag out a input.text multi-line
everything looks good 15 align left now
let's give this thing's both instance
names well we can make sure we have the
rendered text is HTML selected that'll
be very important and the show border
around text there we go now we can give
these instance names make this one input
field keep everything named in a
common-sense fashion this will be bold
button p 0 LD be TN bold button and
input field now we can code this these
two items to interact with each other so
we'll highlight the ActionScript layer
let's make sure everybody knows what
this is extra script 3.0 highlight that
layer press f9 to open your actions
panel and let's type in input field
first thing is we'll make sure the input
field is empty when people come to the
page or if you're going to have data put
in there let's make sure we render this
as HTML text or we always refer to it as
HTML text equals nothing but if you are
going to have data you're going to query
data from your database and pop it into
that field then don't put this line
but for the forum posting type purposes
and input type purposes for online rich
text editors and input forms we're going
to use this make sure it's empty when
they visitor first comes take bar will
set up variable here for formatting the
text field to bold and we'll set formats
for each little one italics underlining
and all that good stuff so this is text
format equals oops format equals new
text format now we have a new text
format we ready to go let's put open
closed parentheses and semicolon now
under that we're going to set the format
bold here just grab that for my bold
bold equals true this sets the value of
the bold attribute to true for this text
format and you do the same thing for
italicizing underlining coloring and all
that stuff let's go to input field add
event listener this event listener is
going to be for the when people click
their mouse the cursor inside of that
text field you'll see what it does add
event listener
open parenthesis closed parenthesis
semicolon and inside the parenthesis
this is going to be a mouse event that
click all caps and the name of the
function that we want to fire off and
we'll name it something intuitive sense
text selection it sounds good so action
script will be sensing text selection in
this event listener and the function
since so since text selection create
right here so we'll just save function
since text selection is event
colon mouseevent
close parenthesis colon void open curly
brace and go down few lines close the
curly braces now we have a nest set up
for our little function here so inside
of this function what's going to happen
is when they put their mouse like I'm
doing here i got my mouse on this word
and i'm highlighting it right when i
click down that's when this event would
fire off on this text field on that
input text field so right when i would
click down even if i didn't highlight
any this is going to fire off and start
sensing things so inside of this
function we're going to type in bold VTN
and we'll give this bold button an event
listener so we can just grab that whole
thing you'll see so now we have an event
listener inside of that function for the
bold BTN to make bold will name the
function of fires off here make bolt
when we get this function written in
right now we're done it shows you how
easy it is to make one of these function
make bold actually let's just grab all
of this here function change this to
make bold hmm function make bold event
mouseevent void close up that nest for
that function and inside we're going to
type in input field
dot sit text format and you see all
these things that are turning green in
here these are all native to
actionscript-3 to where you can go and
research really well what each and every
one of these things do I know a lot of
people look at my scripts or a lot they
look at code online and there they look
at it and say what is that thing doing I
have no idea what it just looks like
Greek and Chinese to them because all of
these things can be researched and you
understand exactly what it's doing in
this in the script otherwise it's just
some word you don't understand what it
does you know and when you set text
format what you can do is listen for
certain things and and place certain
things within the text field so let's
put the first thing inside of this set
text function or set text format
function will or method rather will put
this formatting which is bolding the
desired formatting we want and then
we're going to sense the cursors so
let's here let's look at this right here
on line one there's character 123456
right there at the F if I was to
highlight that word field it's going to
set the beginning index at six and then
the ending index is going to be six
seven eight nine ten it's going to be 10
that way flash will know exactly what I
have highlighted the whole section and
then it will perform the bold on it so
let me show you how we do that here
we're going to type in input field
input field dot set sorry selection
selection begin index and this is how we
sense where the mouse or the cursor is
the beginning of the highlighted section
now input just grab this hair and put
field dot
scrabble this too
put it right there
dot selection and index and that again
get that accesses the ending point so
now flash knows within this method here
exactly where I've highlighted the text
and then it sets the bolding format
right here see there's three things
inside of that three arguments there the
formatting we want the beginning
position and the ending position it's
that simple it's not any more
complicated than that so I think we're
all set we can probably hopefully you
don't get any errors and everything
works export let's type in I my name is
Adam and I am new to this planet and if
I want to highlight new to this planet
and make it bold Booya baby Adam creates
rich text editing for the world open
source let's go ahead and make this our
collaborative project because this thing
is really cool we can just put bolding
underlining and put color selectors
anything we want to put in there smilies
you name it so it'll get more and more
complicated as it goes I mean this is
just a really simple demonstration you
see anywhere you want to highlight and
bold it out and you have a submit button
down here but I bing bada boom it sends
it to the database and now your
information is stored in the database
with nice formatting and formatting you
want and since this text field is set at
as HTML here render as HTML
then it preserves all of that gets
thrown into the database and even if you
wanted to display that data on HTML it
will still respect the formatting that
flash gave it isn't that beautiful okay
we'll see you in the next lesson and if
nobody wants to join me on this I'll
expand it myself nanny nanny boo boo
