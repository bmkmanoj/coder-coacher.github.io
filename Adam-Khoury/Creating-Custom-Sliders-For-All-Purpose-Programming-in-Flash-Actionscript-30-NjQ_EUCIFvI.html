from the deli PHP calm here once again
with another video tutorial this one
going to show you how to create flash
custom sliders using ActionScript 3.0
because let's face it the slider
component that you can pull up in the
components library and flash is poopy
it's really poopy people you know it I
know it
flash knows it Adobe knows it everybody
knows it so I'm going to show you how to
make custom sliders and sleep right now
you're watching this video on youtube
you go down near to the volume you
adjust the volume it's a little sliding
thing I'm going to show you how to make
that in plaster just like the guy who
programmed that flash player for YouTube
created his little sliding thing for the
volume and this one goes right in line
with our multimedia programming
tutorials for sound programming in
actionscript 3.0 but I'm going to make
it like a separate tutorial because it's
very multifunctional multi-purpose can
be used by many different things and not
just sound or video programming you can
be in flash cs3 cs4 or cs5 in this
tutorial ok let's create a new
ActionScript 3 fun no once inside I'm
going to grab the rectangle primitive
tool and I'm going to draw a rectangle
primitive that is approximately 100
pixels wide by 20 pixels high and don't
worry guys I'm going to explain every
little thing all along the way you're
going to be like whoa nobody ever really
explained anything so thoroughly like
this young man has Wow I'm going to
change the color on that rectangle to
something it's like a light gray now I'm
going to draw out in oval primitive on
the same layer I'm going to make sure my
oval primitive is 20 by 20 so now I have
an oval primitive and let me change the
color on that so you can see it real
good and get the Alpha all the way up so
I had my Alpha down that means the Alpha
would be up on this one tool let's put
that up there we go so now we're going
to make sure the coordinates match on
these two guys by putting them both at X
0 y 0 and this is just so we don't get
lost in where the pixels are so you can
see now that the circle is perfectly
inside of the bar with the bar starts
there because it has a height
and a width of 20 in the bar is a height
of 20 so everything is going to match up
fine once you get the x and y
coordinates matched up on those things
so let's right-click this one convert it
to a symbol make sure it's a movie clip
symbol registration top left okay press
control shift down arrow key to move it
to the bank there's the circle right
click that one now convert to symbol
movie clip registration top left again
okay now let's give that circle an
instance name of slider knob and let's
give this rectangle an instance name of
slider track now grab both of those you
can hold shift if you want to select
multiple items convert all to a symbol
we're going to nest these two objects
that we just created into a movie clip
that's okay now let's give this movie
clip an instance name of my slider so on
the main scene in the main timeline you
have a movie clip now that's called my
slider inside of it you have slider
track and slide our knob those are both
movie clips as well so now we're going
to put some code we can put a new layer
there and call it a s3 and put some code
here that's going to affect these two
items that way we can drag them so we're
going to use simple drag-and-drop code
to be able to drag this circle within
the bounds of that slider track now
before we even put any code in here we
can go back to scene one the main
timeline there and that's where the
movie clip that holds everything is and
it's important to note that this can go
anywhere you want now you can put it any
way you like use your arrow keys to drag
it around or just grab it and drag it
around to put it anywhere you want on
your stage you don't have to keep it in
the upper left-hand corner like that
once it's contained into a movie clip
because once you contain in a movie clip
you double click inside of it you'll see
that each one is still at X 0 y 0 see
that's all we need so in the main scene
where this little component this little
custom component is hanging out it could
be anywhere on this stage and everything
is going to still work correctly so
let's go back into that movie clip where
these two items are the ActionScript 3
layer press f9 to open your actions
panel or you can go up to window actions
and here's the code that you want to
apply now I'm going to zoom in on it
real good and it'll help if you full
screen this and watch it at the most
clear value I think it's 720p to see it
the best that way you can distinguish
semicolons from commas and periods equal
signs and all that stuff you can see all
that real clearly and I'm also going to
have the code for this available at
develop PHP so a link for the code that
you can copy and paste for this is going
to be in the description of this video
but if you want to just type it out
yourself real quick there it is so let's
see what happens when we test this now
so you know you see I can drag that
circle tightly within those bounds you
see that it doesn't go outside of those
bounds at all that's what I wanted now
let me explain this code to you alright
so what we doing here is you know we
have those two items on stage one is
called slider knob that's this little
guy the other ones called slider track
so what we're doing is grabbing the
slider knobs width and the slider tracks
with and we're packing those into two
variables called knob width and track
width those are number type variables
now we're creating another variable for
the track X and the slider track x
position really in this case is going to
be zero but we're doing a dynamically
just to show you how to do it
dynamically there but that's equal to
zero so basically you could have a zero
there and that would still work the same
I believe now the bound width is the
track width minus the knob width so this
thing is 100 pixels wide this is 20
pixels wide so that would give us a
value of 80 for this bounds width and
then we can apply a bounds rectangle
which the actionscript 3.0 help file
shows you how to apply bounds rectangle
to you're dragging code that way objects
can't be dragged outside of the bounds
that you specify so I'm using these
values to create a bounds rectangle
using the track X which I just told you
how we got that value this is zero this
is zero bounds width we just figured out
is eighty and this is a zero as well so
that gives me a bounds rectangle of 80
wide and that's what I wanted then we
simply add an event listener to the
slider knob which is a little round
circle and that's for Mouse down so when
somebody puts the mouse down and holds
it down we start the dragging that's a
function called start dragging and
here's that function right here and
inside of that function the slider knob
dot start drag method is applied and
we're using the bounds rectangle there
to keep it within a bounded space then
we simply down here this is for when
somebody lets go of the little knob and
they want to stop dragging so we add an
event listener for mouse up and Mouse
out to fire off the same function which
is called stop dragging here and what
happens inside of that function is we
say slider knob that stop drag now all
we have to do is make it to where this
represents a value of zero when it's all
the way over here and when it's all the
way over here that represents a value of
100 and then in between we have 1 to 99
in all this range and this I'm going to
show you how you can make this as long
as you want this track so let's go
inside of this movie clip here that is
the slider track I'm going to show you
how to put a more visual track in there
let's get a rectangle primitive let's
draw it out and mine is let's change the
color to black something nice and dark
and put the height on about I don't know
maybe two just so it's a nice lean
little track and the width is 100
matching the width of that rectangle
that's there already this is my slider
track that's just for decoration that in
line I put in alright so back here where
you have the knob in the track again if
you press control enter you'll see that
you have a nice dark
thin track there to move that circle
along kind of like the Windows Media
Player volume control and you can go in
here and you can put the alpha for this
color all the way down that way you can
even see it if you want you have
something like that so let's go back
here where we have our code for the
dragging we have our symbols right there
you can go inside of this slider knob
and convert this to a button symbol and
I'll show you what that does
watch press control enter and you'll see
now that you have the little hand
pointer when somebody goes over it it
gives them the hand symbol indication
that they can interact with that object
you can also make the hit state for that
a little bigger without affecting its
size so if you double click inside make
a new layer go to the hit state on that
new layer press f6 and you can just put
a rectangle there as big as you want or
as wide as you want so let's just put it
right here for now right over that shape
I'm going to take a rectangle I'm going
to plop it right there I'm going to take
the Alpha down in that rectangle I just
put in so I can see through it put it
right where I want it and now I'm going
to make sure it's only on the hit state
so I'm going to drag this select this
and drag it over to the hip frame so now
you'll have something like that
basically you want it only on the hip
frame that way it doesn't affect the
size of the button but it gives the
button a more clickable area I'll show
you what I mean see if I'm over here all
we have to make sure this extends press
f5 on that layer so now if I press
control enter you'll see that now you
have a bigger click area or grab area
for that little circle thing and that's
what you want because sometimes those
little knobs that you create a very very
small so now I can grab it right here
and drag it if I want or on it and it
just helps me hold on to it better too
but it still it won't affect your drag
you see it's still within the same
bounds okay let's go back here to symbol
3 where we were where we have the code
for the dragging here now we're going to
go one symbol up into the main scene now
on the main timeline
the root of the flash file what I'm
going to do is put out a dynamic text
field here I'm going to name it status
underscore txt make it any size I want
make sure I have the color that I want
let's make sure that alpha is up all the
way so I'll have a solid black now I'm
going to add another layer here or you
can put the code right on the same layer
this is how you're going to access the
value of where this little knob is being
dragged within the track I'll show you
how to access the value of this like it
was a component so in layer 2 here let's
name this one AS 3 as well so we don't
get confused let's open the actions
panel and type in this code now what
enter frame event does is it allows you
to maybe listen for something many many
times per second or it allows you to
animate something over time and
depending on your frame rate that
determines how fast mine is going 30
frames per second that determines how
fast your enter frame event will fire
off so mine is going to be firing off 30
times a second so within that on enter
frame event what we're doing is putting
a value into this status text field
right here the first thing we do is
create a variable called slider value
and that's going to be you int and I
made it you int type and not number
because I didn't want it to have any
decimal points if you had this saying
number actually here I have to remove
this divided by 3 I'm going to put that
back in just a second when I show you
how to extend the length of your track
but but right now we don't need that
divided by 3 and the reason why we're
using you int like I was just explaining
is because we don't want this number
that we gather here from the slider
knobs x2 have any decimal places we want
it to be a round number now the number
you're going to get using this code
right here is always going to be a round
number but if you do anything like / -
or your / 3 or 4 it's going to have a
decimal point to the number so what you
can do is use you int instead of number
type variable to make sure that that
decimal never even comes into play so
instead of using math floor or math dot
seal you can use you int to forego
having to use that kind of code to round
that number to round any decimals into a
whole solid number so initially you
create the variable for the slider value
and this is going to be before your
enter frame event really ever fires off
you're going to see where the slider
knob dot x position is inside of that my
slider clip here
remember we named this whole clip my
slider so this code is going into my
slider accessing the slider knobs dot X
position right off the bat but this
number is going to change here because
people are able to slide and drag that
knob along that track so in the on
interpret events you want to be
listening for that where that knob is at
all times if somebody happens to drag it
and then you change what's in the status
text field slider position is equal to
the slider value variable now let's see
what we get press control enter
you see and you'll notice that it's only
going to go from 0 to 80 and I'll show
you how to fix that that's no problem
now the reason why it only goes to 80
because of the width of that knob so
let's double click inside of my slider
clip and there's the knob there's the
track now the knob you can see is 20
pixels wide so let's extend our track 20
pixels so let's make sure we grab both
of these rectangles in here grab the
width property and make it 120 now watch
what happens it's a very easy fix
goes all the way to 100 now so we've
achieved our first goal creating a
little knob that we can drag along a
track that has a starting position of 0
and an ending position of 100 with all
the values in between and you can see
how it's assembled and I'm going to have
this source file free for download at
develop PHP com so you'll be able to get
to the code you'll also be able to get
to the actual working file that
create here in the tutorial now let me
show you how to easily extend this thing
let's go into the slider track again and
instead of make sure we're in the inner
timeline of that here let me bring this
alpha up so you guys can see what's
going on so you're just manipulating the
shapes width
see these are not movie clip symbols
these are just those shapes that we had
the two rectangles inside of the slider
track I'm going to make those say 320
instead of 120 so now I'm going to go
back into symbol 3 actually back into
scene one where we have the code that's
listening in the on into frame event and
here I'm going to reapply that divided
by 3 so the viewers was 220 you would
make this divided by 2 so I'm going to
divide mine by 3 I'm going to make sure
I add that here too and remember you
don't have to add any rounding code for
this equation because you're using you
int if you're using a number type
variable here you would have to round
this code using math dot floor or math
dot seal so now let's see what that does
we should get 0 here 100 B all the way
at the end over here now so you see how
that works so that's how you can
customize the look and the length of
your slider let's say you wanted this to
be a rectangle instead of a circle like
the YouTube volume slider is just a very
thin rectangle you can change slider
knob from being a circle to a rectangle
there and instead of being 20 wide it
might only be 5 or 6 pixels wide that
means you make your slider bar 306 or
however many pixels wide your knob is
that's how many pixels you
overcompensate your slider bar for that
make sense it's very easy to do it that
way I think so we can slide this thing
along this bar and that's all nice and
everything but we click here really what
we want to happen is for this circle to
go to the position that we specify when
we click down on the track and that's
very simple code I'll show you how to do
that right
so make sure you're inside the movie
clip where you can grab the slider knob
and the slider track and in the code
there open that up we're going to add
one more little section of code couple
of lines now what we're doing is adding
an event listener to the slider track
that's this guy here adding an event
listener of Mouse event click and the
function that's going to fire off upon
mouse click is snap - and here's that
function right there function snap - so
inside the function snap - we're
commanding a a text field and the parent
movie clip so if I go into the parent
movie clip that's right
here with all these things so I'm going
to put another text wheel there because
I need one and I'm going to call it
Mouse underscore txt MOU se underscore
txt and that's going to read my mouse
position whenever I click in that track
so let's go back into this movie clip
here the reason why we have movie clip
parent code in use here is so we can go
up one parent movie clip and hit that
mouse underscore txt text field to give
it a value whatever we want so when
somebody clicks down we want to record
what the mouse x-value is the moment
they click down and here's a little if
condition that will make sure that so
let's say somebody clicked right here
you want to make sure that your circle
your little knob doesn't go further than
the bounds so I put a little math in
there in the if condition to say if the
mouse X is less than the bound width
which is the value we got here
and mouse X is greater than the knob
width then we can move the slider knob
exposition to match the users Mouse X
position so it gives me this watch when
I click here see and it won't let you
click too far towards the end see right
here it won't let me do anything it's
not clicking only if you're a certain
ways in to the track like right here or
right there but not too close to the end
so the circle doesn't go overboard and
it's really more effective if you have a
little bar like YouTube slider there
volume slider is a little rectangular
thin sliver but you can see as I'm
clicking it's going wherever I command
it to and it also records the slider
position perfectly 0 to 100 okay so
that's how you program custom sliders
and we're going to be putting this
functionality into effect in our sound
programming and video programming video
tutorials where we're showing how to
build multimedia players for playing mp3
files or flvs online you're making your
own custom players</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
