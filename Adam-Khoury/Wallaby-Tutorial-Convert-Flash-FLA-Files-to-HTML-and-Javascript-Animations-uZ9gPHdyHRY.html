introduce and show how to use Adobe's
new experimental technology called
wallaby wallaby is a technology that
Adobe is developing which will convert
the art and animations in an Fla file to
its HTML programmed equivalent so it'll
render out SVG and JavaScript required
to give you an HTML equivalent of an Fla
animation in art now this is wallaby as
it stands today and as you guys know
technology moves fast so look forward to
this changing pretty rapidly especially
if the flash and HTML community want to
see more of this kind of thing so as it
stands today which like I said these
things will change pretty rapidly it's
just an experimental beta technology
today that means they're testing it out
they're getting feedback from users and
things like that and today it currently
requires cs5 Fla file so if you have cs4
Fla files or cs3 Fla files you will not
get the HTML rendered only cs5 flash
files and it's not fully compatible with
html5 yet which html5 isn't even fully
released as a working standard yet on
the web so you don't even have to worry
too much about that yet I'm sure that's
all going to be fixed because it's all
beta wallabies all beta right now so a
lot of things are going to be changing
but those are the three key things that
you want to keep in mind it's in beta
technology right now so it's not an
officially released software it
currently requires cs5 Fla files and
it's not fully compatible with html5 yet
ok now we'll show you where to get
wallaby so you can download it and play
with it so I'll zoom in on this URL real
good APA so you guys can see it real
well and I will also put it in the
video's description area so you just
click this box here and you can see it
just came out March 8th 2011 was the
pre-release so once you tick that box
you'll have two options here download
for Mac or download for Windows I'm
using Google Chrome so when I select
download for Windows it's going to start
downloading the file here and you can
see my green bar is going around and
it's almost done it's 13.5 megabytes if
you download for Mac it's a little bit
larger than that
okay my downloads complete I'm going to
show and folder so this is where it's
going to wind up on your computer so
whatever browser you using you download
the file to your computer
and I'm just going to cut it from there
and I'm just going to get it on my
desktop I'm going to paste it here I'm
going to double click it run and now
we're going to set some options here
that shortcut to my desktop I want now
I'm not going to start it after
installation first I'm going to create
the flash animation then we'll start it
up and convert that flash animation and
that's the location so continue yes I
will allow that so now it's installing
the Wallaby application click finish now
I'm going to open up flash
okay now remember I said you got to have
flash cs5 some of you guys are going to
try and do it with cs4 and CSV you yet
I'm going to create new ActionScript 3
file I'm going to go into the shapes
grab oval primitive draw to the stage
now once drawn I'm going to right-click
it I'm going to convert to symbol
movie clip okay I'm just going to
animate that little movie clip I'm going
to go to frame 40 then I'm going to go
to frame 80 I'm going to go to create
classic tween there right click here
create classic tween so what I did was
on frame 40 I pressed f6 to create a new
keyframe and then frame 80 I created a
new keyframe and then i just
right-clicked in between those and
create classic tween now all I have to
do is go to frame 40 and select this
item and move it that way it'll animate
so I'm just going to take it from here
and put it over here
simple drag will do or you can use your
arrow keys or the numbers for
positioning it's press control enter and
see what we have very simple animation
of a blue ball going back and forth and
it's going to loop on itself because
there's no stop action very simple file
I'm going to go to file save as to my
desktop I'm going to create a new folder
call it blue ball inside that folder I'm
going to name this flash cs5 document
blue ball save now I can close flash I'm
done all right now here's my little
wallaby icon that I have on my desktop
after I installed it I'm going to double
click it I'm going to go to browse I'm
going to select an Fla file on my
desktop the one that's called blue ball
right there in that folder and I'm going
to press convert now it's going to allow
you to name the converted output file
I'm just going to put blue ball HTML dot
HTML I'm going to save it and it should
render everything out and say status
blue ball dot Val a conversion
successful so now let's go into that
folder here called blue ball
now you can see along with the Fla file
there's a whole lot of other things now
and they have a name of blue ball HTML
let's open up the blue ball HTML HTML
file so when you open this file you'll
see the animation going back and forth
and that is not a flash file so if you
right-click it you'll see that there's
no flash involved it's all JavaScript
now to understand how these things
you're animating you're going to have to
understand JavaScript and this system
uses jQuery to animate things and to
load and unload things so you open up
your blue ball HTML javascript file and
the jQuery file that's just like any
other jQuery file there's nothing
different or special about that one
except that it's 1.4.2 but you want to
look at the functions inside of this
blue ball HTML javascript file and then
you can also let's open this with
Dreamweaver and I'll show you what the
inside of blue ball HTML dot HTML looks
like let's go to code and you can see
there's the code for it it's calling in
the jQuery file and it's also calling in
the blue ball HTML j/s file so both of
those scripts are available to this HTML
file and you can see the div class
wallaby movie and then div class wallaby
underscore one that's how those scripts
communicate to these divs and you can
see the image is an asset which is in
the folder here right here that's an SVG
asset in order to render out the little
blue ball that's pretty much it so you
just study the files and you can get a
little bit of an understanding how Java
Script is working when it converts a
flash animation so remember after you
convert there's no flash involved at all
it's all HTML and JavaScript ok guys so
there's your introductory tutorial to
wallaby Adobe's brand new experimental
technology for converting flash
animation and artwork to HTML
