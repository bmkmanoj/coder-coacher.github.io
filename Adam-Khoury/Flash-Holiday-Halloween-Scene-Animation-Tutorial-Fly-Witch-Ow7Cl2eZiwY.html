thought it would and it was really fun
to make but anyways you guys wanted to
which I give you a which she's animated
flapping in the wind all that good stuff
going one side flying to the other and I
decided to place a little haunted castle
in there but new layer made it just drew
out a quick little haunted castle there
and she's flying in front of the moon
and then going off into the distance
into the castle so if you want to watch
the first part of this series I'm gonna
put the link right here you can click
that and check out the first part of the
series where we created the scene and
the flying bats coming at us and this
one we focus on the witch which was a
request from you guys and don't forget
if you want to see the whole structure
of my file and the way it is all the
guts of my particular vial you can go to
click the link in the description of the
video and like all the rest of the most
of the rest of the flash tutorials at
develop PHP the source file is available
free so you can dig around in it
have fun
how you doing everybody and welcome to
part 2 creating happy Halloween scene
animated style in flash cs3 or cs4 and
super we have so far here we're gonna
put a witch
I tell you guys we were gonna put a
witch flying across the moon and so what
I did was I placed a little haunted
castle thing on the mountain here
instead of her going from one side to
the other
I wanted her go from this side into the
castle like into the back or something
flying into the back or whatever
something like that that would be cool
she start up here somewhere and go down
in there
and she'll start big and kind of shrink
as she goes to make it looks like she's
going into the distance well since I'm
much better my fireworks pentool I chose
to draw my path my shape in fireworks so
here is my witch and I drew her in such
a way to where she didn't have too much
detail that way when I wanted to shrink
her down and flash when we animate it
even if she's that big it's still kind
of distinguishable what it is and that's
why we wanted so we have a shape here
let's just press ctrl C and I'm in
fireworks cs4 but you can use a pen tool
just the same in flash I'm just I like
fireworks pen tool better for some odd
reason but no reason at all okay so
let's go to the haunted house layer see
where I put the haunted house let's Lock
everything haunted house lair it's right
above the moon so let's click the moon
layer and add a new layer let's call it
which now control V now we're going to
keep all paths editable that's important
as movie clip bring it in okay so now
she's a movie clip and there she is
that that that that that okay so if you
go inside first let's uh let's go inside
see you double click twice into that
clip and there's the editable object the
editable shape where you can adjust
points see if I wanted to drag her a
little hat down here I can do that easy
see what I'm saying so that's what we're
gonna do we're going to animate her by
moving these little things around make
it look like everything's flapping in
the wind really fast and then we're
gonna move her across the scene going
across the moon in front of the moon and
down into the haunted castle
so really you can animate her any way
you like so I'm gonna do it while she's
really big on scene there then we'll
just shrink it down the way we need to
okay so now so here we are in the main
team we just brought her in let's
double-click her and let's double click
or again to go inside the drawing object
I'm gonna take that and press control X
I'm gonna go back in the scene one
yeah I'll just delete that movie clip
we've started right there now let's go
back into that movie clip don't go back
in the scene one but we do want to make
a new layer and paste this control shift
of V okay so now it's a draw it's a
shape instead of the drawing object on
that composite path let's remove delete
that layer so you see what I did I just
went into the composite path remove the
object the shape and side of it out made
a new layer above it and pasted that
shape and you can tell you're on a shape
when it's dotted like that okay so now
let's make a new keyframes make a new
keyframe here press f6 and let's move
our stuff around let's move that down
move this up maybe like over here let's
move these things let's grab these two
dots you can grab just the edges if you
want
oops I didn't want to do that
let's highlight the subselection tool
and grab just the edges this one you can
hold shift to select multiple edges
let's bring this thing up to do
something like that let's make this one
thicker bring this one down a little bit
just randomize it you know make it make
it cool try not to move her position but
you can just move her the points move
her foot down a little okay so that's
frame too I'm gonna continue on I'm
gonna make about maybe six or seven
frames and kind of loop it and I'll show
you know I'm gonna make like maybe just
three or four and then I'll show you
once I get those three done or those
four done I'll show you how we kind of
reverse the animation to make it smooth
okay so now I have my four frames and
now if I drag my playhead through here
you can see I got it to where she's
looking like she's gonna be looking like
she's booking it through they're
clocking knots alright so here we go on
frame one first let's get to the regular
selection tool we're gonna do is take
frame for actually take frame three
we're gonna put it right here I'm gonna
take frame two and put it right here
then we're gonna take frame one and
actually not frame one we're just gonna
loop those those two after frame four
and you'll see why I'm gonna grab this
frame frame three ctrl C go to frame
five right click let's create empty key
frame insert blank key frame and press
control shift of V then go to frame two
ctrl C F frame six highlight frame six
right click insert blank keyframe
control shift V so now you'll have a
nice loop animation see it'll be going
in and out and then when it gets back to
frame one you'll see a loop around so
let's take a look at what we have let's
go back to the main scene let's bring
her into view press control enter
then she is flapping in the wind and all
we have to do is make her smaller and
that just very simply you can take a
whole lot of time with your animation
but she's going to be a little bit
smaller there so she'll look a little
different so now all we have to do is
convert her to a symbol so this is on
her in the main timeline let's convert
her to symbol
let's color which lying uit ch ch
okey-dokey
now let's make of the let's go and
double-click inside of her make it the
size we want her to be
when she first comes into scene
maybe right about there I'm just gonna
start right about here and then she's
gonna fly into the castle would be very
cool
all right let's click a frame I don't
know whatever you want I'm just gonna
put her on a straight path I have a
tutorial at develop PHP in the flash
section of the video tutorials there in
the black section for motion guides in
the animations I think is the animation
tutorials under flash from motion guide
you can make or go on a curve to pass if
you like but I'm not going to show that
in this tutorial let's go but if you
wanted to put it on a curved path you
can easily do that with the motion guide
I think you can just right click add
motion guide put a line that's the
motion and blotter bada-bing bada-boom
okay so let's go and maybe you know know
frame 1516 let's make it go really slow
at first and then kind of speed up as
she goes away
well maybe faster at first and slow down
or she goes away 25 and then frame 75
let's just see how that looks create
motion tween create motion tween now
let's bring her maybe to about right
here
resize her I like that and then on that
last keyframe let's bring her into the
castle and that's it
it's pretty much how it works let's see
what we have
oh that's awesome kind of like she makes
a turn there and goes to the castle you
can see how she's animated the whole
time but let's slow her down because I
really want to see that animation
because it's really cool so I want to
see it play out nice so let's just drag
these keyframes something like that oh
that is sweet dude who is the man I
don't miss the man but that's an easy
way to to manually oh man it looks
really good I'm gonna slow it down even
some more my 80 and then 70 so there you
have it folks witch flying across the
moon you ask and you receive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
