going to have some creative fun and
fireworks making a 3d looking version of
the Android robot let's create a new
fireworks document PNG I have mine set
to 1000 by 550 okay now I'm gonna go to
Google and hit images and I'm gonna
search Google Images for Android logo
and I'll grab this one I'll just click
on that then I'll press View image and
then I can right click that copy that
image go into fireworks
press ctrl V to paste it and it's
humongous so I'm gonna scale it down you
can hold shift and mouse wheel to get
that zoom in and out functionality so
there's a hundred percent I'm gonna make
it just a little bit smaller than that
the larger you can work with it the
better because you'll have better
resolution when you go to shrink it down
for a web page or whatever but really
all we want to do is get the shape off
of this thing that way we have the right
proportions to the 3d version so now
let's go into our tools and we're gonna
grab out a rectangle now let's put our
little crosshair right about at the edge
of the rectangle for the body of the
robot and then we'll drag out until it's
about the width of the body all right so
I'll move it over one pixel I'm gonna
make it 206 and 187 now what we can do
is just make that a totally different
color for now and then you can round the
edges on that rectangle until it meets
up on the bottom you don't want to you
don't have to worry about these top ones
meeting up for now because we're gonna
fix that but we want to meet up those
bottom edges so you can see how when
you're rounding it you want to just make
that bottom edge meet the green bottom
edge its curvature and you can adjust
the opacity on that square that
rectangle if you like by going like that
so you can see if it matches up well
that looks good to me now we have the
bottom body curvature correct now we got
to fix that top so we'll just grab
another rectangle and put it up top and
we'll make sure it meets the dimensions
of the one under it we'll bring this
back up to a hundred opacity so grab
both of those together
now and go to modify combine paths and
union that way it's all one piece now we
can take out an ellipse we're going to
do the same thing for the head pretty
much we're gonna try and line it up I
think it was 206 right this was 206 wide
so we want to make that 206 and bring
down the opacity a little bit on that so
you can see this needs to be a little
bit wider so let's make that like 224
that's a little bit too wide so let's
make it 212 and that looks good enough
to me so now we're going to grab another
rectangle draw it over that ellipse only
until it meets that edge with the bottom
of the robots head is so meet that edge
right there and then grab this one and
this one together by holding shift and
then go to modify combine paths and
punch now you can bring the opacity on
that all the way back up now let's do
the arms and legs and those are very
simple you just grab a rectangle and
cover that arm just about like that and
then you can round a hundred percent on
the edges it looks like it could be
wider make it 47 wide and a little bit
higher as well
138 okay now let's take that control-c
control-v put one over here as well
right there and we're gonna grab another
one ctrl-c ctrl-v and put it right down
here to cover that leg and then
control-c control-v and move that one
over with your arrows until it covers
the other leg now all we need is the two
little antennas so let's grab a
rectangle and we'll make it about I
don't know about that wide and about
that long doesn't have to be perfect
maybe about like that and we'll round
that 100% it looks like it should be a
little thinner so I'll make it six
pixels wide so now I'm going to grab
that ctrl-c ctrl-v and I'm gonna go
ahead and rotate that until I have the
same rotation as the one there I'm gonna
put it right over on top of it highlight
that when I put in place ctrl-c ctrl-v
flip the new copy and just use my arrow
keys to slide it on over to cover the
other one now all we need to do is bring
the opacity down on this head and put in
the eyeballs so we'll grab an ellipse
and we'll throw in two little eyeballs
put them in the right position there and
I'm gonna go ahead and make that white
for now press ctrl-c ctrl-v and use your
arrow key to just slide the other one
over into place now you can return full
opacity to the head now you don't need
this anymore back behind there you can
just move it off to the side now we'll
be turning all these shapes green and
we'll be putting gradients on most of
them to give them depth now I can go
ahead and select that and press control
X to remove it I'm gonna highlight all
of these shapes just bring them down a
little bit and put them in the center of
my stage on my canvas and I'm only
keeping this here to refer to those
colors but basically you just want to
copy that color you can also just have
drawn out a rectangle and then copy the
color like this see so whatever way you
want to do it now you can get rid of
this control X just so long as we have
the color available whatever way you
want to get it all right now what we're
gonna do is make it look like it has a
satin finish and it has a 3d appearance
the first thing we'll do is start with
these guys up top so we'll change the
color on that to that green and for
these we're just going to use the simple
bevel and emboss filter so you select
both of those by using shift and then go
to bevel and emboss inner bevel now
since I like the way this one looks
better I'm gonna press ctrl-c ctrl-v
make a copy flip it and bring it over to
where the other one is and just remove
the one on top so grab the one on top
press patrol X now they look identical
you can take the head and the eyes
select all three and bring those back to
front by pressing control shift up arrow
key so now the antennae are behind those
shapes so we want light coming from the
top and we also want a perspective of
looking down at the robot a little bit
so what we'll do is grab an ellipse
and we're gonna put that ellipse right
here on this edge try and line it up
with that corner and then draw it out
and make it not very high maybe twelve
changing the heights of ten might be
good enough so now I'm going to change
the color from solid to gradient and I'm
gonna give it a radial gradient and in
the center make it this green and on the
outside I'll also make it this green
then I'll take that green on the outside
and make it much darker okay and also
make the one on the inside a little
darker now we're gonna take the head and
we're going to change the color on that
to a gradient radial and on the inner
we're gonna do the same thing put the
green on the inner and outer colors and
on the outer color we're gonna make it a
little bit darker and we'll make
actually the outer edge not so dark
maybe right there now we can put the
gradient anywhere we like within that
area so you can bring this down here put
it up top wherever you want I'm gonna
make that a little bit lighter the one
in the center a little bit lighter so
you can just tune your colors to make it
look any way you want now the eyeballs
we're gonna select those together and
we're going to make those a gradient as
well
radial make them both green and actually
the outside we're gonna make black
instead of green then we'll just take
one of those you can zoom in by holding
ctrl mouse wheel zoom in and adjust that
gradient if you like I'm gonna put mine
right about like that or maybe right
about there actually now down a little
more like that then I could take this
one control C control V and just move it
over in place where the other one is and
then take the other one on top and
control X now they both look the same
now we want to get another ellipse over
the head starting at this edge here and
meeting at this other edge of the head
and then move it up into place to where
it matches right there so you have
basically what you're doing is you're
giving the bottom of the head a little
curvature so that you have the 3d effect
so I'm going to grab those two shapes
together go to modify combine paths and
union them now you can select all three
of these items together ctrl shift down
arrow key to send them to back and if
you want you can maybe put a little edge
on those eyes now no wage probably looks
better well maybe if we make a black
edge now that's too much no edge now
this character is going to be shrunken
down to the size we want to display it
on the web but at first you want to make
it pretty much as big as you can make it
on the screen then when you shrink it
down it'll have better resolution so now
let's give this a filter of inner shadow
coming from the bottom so we're gonna
change the angle to 90 because we want
the light source coming from the top so
we're gonna give us an inner dark shadow
coming from the bottom maybe three
pixels let's see what that looks like
maybe even a little less let's make that
two pixels now we're also gonna give it
an inner shadow so add another inner
shadow and this one we're gonna make it
white or you can make it a very very
bright green I'm gonna make softness
raise the softness up a little bit now
we can select the body what we're gonna
do to that has changed the color from a
solid red to a gradient bars we're gonna
change the color of the bars to our
green and on the outside we're gonna
make that bar a little darker and even a
little bit darker than that let's go
ahead and take these two legs and send
them to back by hitting ctrl shift down
arrow key now what we want to do is take
this little ellipse here and we can just
copy that one basically press ctrl-c
ctrl-v bring it down here and make it to
where it meets up you go ahead and
control and mouse wheel and zoom in put
this to where it meets up
right about with this point right here
and this point right here so grab it
make it hit that point right there when
you bring it up one right there and then
adjust its width to where it meets this
other point right about here so
basically what you're doing is adding a
curve to the bottom of this guy because
he needs that since we have a downward
we're looking a little bit down at the
robot so this has to be bulged this
shape has to have that on there or it's
gonna have that flat appearance and you
don't want that so you put the little
shape on there then you select both of
those together or to modify combine
paths and union so now you have a little
bit of bulge that you need down at the
bottom or the curvature now this shape
here that little one needs to go back to
top so you press control shift up arrow
key now select this shape and we're
gonna do is add just a very small amount
of white drop shadow so we'll go to
filter shadow and glow drop shadow make
that white let's tighten it up by making
it maybe four and the angle we want is
270 straight down if you're having
trouble with the dial you can just make
that 270 with your keyboard and press
Enter and we're gonna take that and make
that drop shadow not so faded bring that
down to three then bring the opacity
down a little bit and actually you can
play with the height of this see how
it's 10 I'm gonna make it 12 again see
what it looks like I think I like that
better I'm gonna highlight all of these
red rectangles that we put in place I'm
gonna change that from solid to a
gradient bars as well I'm gonna make
them pretty much the same color as the
body so put that at the bright green
color and put this one as the dark green
and the outside now if you don't want
such a bar look you can change that
bright one make it not so bright make it
just a little darker
and it'll blend a little better so first
we want to put a let's see let's go
ahead and grab all of those again by
holding shift as we select and looking
at these eyeballs they just look too big
to me so I'm gonna make those instead of
23 I'm gonna try 17 by 17 that's a
little too small
how about 19 yeah that looks better to
me so let's also make that one 19 and 19
we might have to move this one over a
couple of pixels I think like that now
let's also put some shadow on the bottom
of this body so let's go to filter
shadow and glow
inner shadow and we're gonna make the
inner shadow come from the bottom we'll
put it on 90 the angle will be 90 and
we'll make it fade in a little bit more
the softness will bring the softness in
a little bit bring down the opacity just
a touch and that looks pretty good now
let's take all of these little feet and
hands let's take all the four of those
rectangles by holding shift and we're
going to give those filters of inner
shadow and we're gonna make it come
around from the bottom again so we'll
put that on 90 and bring the softness up
a little bit and the opacity down just a
little bit now these two we're gonna
give those an extra set of inner shadow
and that's gonna be white and make that
come from the very top so we'll put that
on to 70 and make that softer a little
bit and bring down the opacity just a
touch now you can see if we change our
background our canvas from white to
black everything still looks great and
it looks like we need to bring this up
one maybe two pixels right there
let's go back to a white background now
what you can do is go ahead and select
all of those things press ctrl-g and if
you want to make a smaller version press
ctrl-c ctrl-v make a whole copy go to
modify flatten selection and then you
reduce its size and you flatten it
before you reduce its size that way you
maintain a nice clean lines and it has a
very sharp resolution when you shrink it
down to that size see how nice that
looks
and it gives the Android robot a whole
lot more life now you can take that one
control C go to file new
and get it ready to put on a webpage all
you have to do now is go to if you if
you want to make it a clear background
PNG you can take your canvas from white
to nothing that'll give you a clear PNG
then you go to file export wizard
continue continue exit and then you hit
JPEG or if you want a PNG 32 to keep the
transparent background you can do that
and export it on to your computer then
you'll have that file all ready to go to
put on the web or anywhere you want to
put it and it might even help to grab
this thing ctrl C put a file new and
make a really big one so you can put it
the width that maybe a thousand pixels
wide 800 pixels high okay and then press
control V paste a little copy in there
and then you can just grab it and hold
shift while you resize it see how you
make it really big like that and then
take that control C control V modify
flatten selection and then when you
reduce the size of that one you'll have
really crispy lines the resolution will
be nice and tight so it looks really
good at any size that you make it but
when you're creating it you want to make
sure that it's really big before you
reduce its size down so you keep clean
lines you don't want to make it really
small but you can shrink it down to be
really small when you're done and this
one here this big one or really this one
the original one we worked on is the one
you can keep for editing later or
whatever but I was just showing you with
these I don't need to save those I was
just showing you with these how to
export it out and how to make it really
big and flatten it then shrink it down
so you can keep really tight resolution
on your lines now there's tons more
things you can do with this instead of
having a satin finish you can make this
little robot have a more glossy finish
you can put added effects onto it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
