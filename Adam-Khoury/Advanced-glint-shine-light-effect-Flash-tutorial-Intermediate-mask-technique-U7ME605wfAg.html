masking I will show you the finished
product here it's the glint effect with
an intermediate masking technique glint
effect with the intermediate masking
technique any version of flash you work
in in this flash tutorial which is
suitable for all versions of flash we're
gonna show you an intermediate masking
technique and it doesn't matter what
ActionScript version you choose I'm just
going to choose an ActionScript 3
version and I'm in flash cs3 okay so
we'll get right to it I'm gonna open
fireworks here I'll bring up fireworks
where I have a an image I'm gonna grab
that image highlight it press ctrl C and
then get back into flash and press ctrl
V to paste that on stage and bring it in
as a movie clip okay so once that's on
stage make sure it has its own layer
we'll name it
picture then we'll give it a layer above
it and this is where we'll put our mask
well actually first let's draw let's
create a glint we'll just use a glint
for this demonstration but anything can
be under the mask
okay so above the picture let's put
another layer above the picture layer
and on the top layer let's go ahead and
double click it and name it mask because
that's where our mask is gonna live and
here I'm gonna name this
glint so you double double-click that
layer and rename it glint so you have
mask glint and picture okay so on the
glint layer let's create our glint it's
a shine effect or a shine
graphic and so we just draw out a
rectangle rectangle primitive then we
give it a gradient fill and then we go
to the color palette options of that
symbol and we remove the fill I mean the
stroke we don't want any stroke and we
manipulate the gradient to where the
white is in the center and it's also
white edges so you double click those
colors to make them white if they're
black or any other color and then you
want to make sure come on you want to
make sure that the Alpha is all the way
down to zero on those two colors on the
outside so just the center white is
solid the two whites on the edge or
opaque and that will create the glint
effect see
as it goes over it's gonna make a nice
shine on that thing I like to mine
to the side a little bit sometimes so
I'm going to free transform and just
skew it just a little bit so now when it
goes through there actually I'm gonna
skew it the other way because the
direction the keys are laying there we
go and we can match up the keys that the
angle of the keys yeah that's good
enough okay so now we're going to create
and right-click that symbol while it's
highlighted convert to symbol
movie clip name it whatever you want in
the library it doesn't matter something
you can identify registration top left
movie clip okay now go inside of that
movie clip and when you just animate
this thing now you see how it's set on
frame one highlight frame 60 know 45
highlight frame 45 and press f6 to
create a new keyframe then just in the
center somewhere you right-click and you
create motion tween then we just move it
from where it is in the beginning point
to our ending point where we want it to
animate so we just slide it on over okay
so now that thing's animated now we
don't want it to continuously loop the
light over the keys so we're gonna go
ahead and extend the frames out to maybe
about 140 or 120 and press f5 that
extends the frames out but it doesn't
create a keyframe that's what we want
now let's go back to the scene one the
main timeline now here now we have our
glint now if we publish out by pressing
f12 you'll see that glint don't across
the keys you see that okay so definitely
need the frame rate up higher because
that animation is choppy so let's make
this 26
publish out again any day now holy crap
there we go that's a better animation
for it okay I wouldn't mind it being a
little bit faster so I'm just gonna
raise the you could you could go inside
and make this let's just go ahead and
make this you uh you click this and you
drag it you can drag that keyframe and
that'll make the animation go by faster
okay so there's the glint effect and I'm
gonna bring the Alpha down on that
symbol back in the main timeline so I
don't want it so bright maybe about 70
III that's good okay now let's make the
masks create the mask on top so you can
go and grab the pen tool select the pen
tool and looks like you have let's grab
the white for the stroke on the pen and
you just go ahead and place it on one of
the keys and click let go go to a new
point click let go go to another point
click let go go to another point click
let go and then close it up
now you want to give it oops you want to
give it a fill so let's hit this the
selector tool will go down to fill fill
it with white and make it have no stroke
okay so there's the first part of the
mask and if we go ahead and right-click
the mask layer and select mask it's
gonna it's gonna mask the glint so now
if we publish out you'll see only that
one key gets the glint watch that one
key okay so what will happen is I'm just
gonna no I actually let me show you a
little bit more before I fill these all
in what will happen is if you take if
you try to place another symbol on the
mask layer and have it cover some other
keys and you publish out you'll notice
only that one symbol that's act acting
is mask shows the glint and you're like
hmm it's a big problem a lot of people
don't know how to adjust this so you
what you do is you go inside of this
drawing symbol itself and that's where
you put everything so you can take this
guy and press the ctrl C and you'll know
because it has dots on it once you click
it control C control shift V to paste it
in place and then you make your new keys
you just put it where it needs to go hit
the sub selection tool and that way you
can hit the edges you highlight an edge
and you just use your arrow keys on your
keyboard to put that little edge right
where it needs to go and hit the next
edge do the same thing okay so I'm going
to do this for all of my keys and then I
will resume the video and tell you and
get you up to speed
okay now I've got all my little boxes
placed in and if i zoom in about 400
you'll see that they're laid up on the
top of the keys just covering only the
top of the keys because that's where I
want the glint effect that happened so
let's go back to 100% and back to the
main timeline get this guy back up to a
hundred so we can see them real well
let's make them go a little slower
because I want to see it really good you
can make yours go as fast or as slow as
you want now now we have a mask that is
effectively giving us the results that
we want so let's go ahead and press
control enter and there you see only the
keys specified by the mask only the keys
that we desired to have the glint go on
top of those are the only ones that get
it you can see this middle row here has
no glint that row has no glint and
there's a lot of the keys still that
have no boxes on them so they have no
glint either and that's how it works and
you can make any shape you can put any
shapes in here you can make a glint that
would go along this curved line very
easily and that's pretty much the basics
or the yeah the basics of intermediate
masking when you want more than just a
rectangle to mask something one solid
rectangle you can have many little
rectangles and those can actually be
movie clips that are animated and I'll
show you that technique maybe even right
after this one or I might wait a few
days okay we'll see you guys next lesson
but let's make sure we rent it out one
times you get a look at it before I take
off maybe get a good thumbnail for my
video okay guys
peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
