allows us to add specialized methods and
properties to our custom objects and
classes there may be occasions when you
must specialize the functionality of a
class-based object one time of your
application and the prototype property
allows us to do that
it also enables object inheritance in
JavaScript which we will be
demonstrating in the video that follows
this one
so let's write some code that
demonstrates how the prototype property
works at a basic level first create a
new test HTML page open a script element
and go down a couple of lines and close
that script element first thing we're
going to do is create an example class
again and in this example we're going to
create a class called player so we
established a player class based object
so here's our player class or player
object and you can see we have two
properties the first one is name
property and the second property is
hitpoints and that has a default value
of 100 the name will be assigned to the
player after the object instance is
created in just a moment so each
instance of the player class will be
assigned name and hit points and it will
also have a custom method of attack so
the dynamic argument coming into this
method is opponent and then we're going
to take the opponent's hit points
property and decrease them by 10 during
the attack method so it's a very simple
class-based
object setup for representing a game
player now directly under that will
create two new separate player instances
and we'll name them P one and P two so
that represents player one and player
two now directly under that we're going
to name the players now directly under
that we're going to make player one
attack player two so we say P one we
access the attack method using dot
notation so we say P 1 dot attack P two
so player one is going to attack player
two and then after that line we're just
going to alert to ourselves that P 2
name which is Hercules has however many
hit points left after the attack that's
what we're going to alert to ourselves
and at this point we haven't even used
the prototype property left we're just
setting
an example class and then the
corresponding code to access that class
but right after we test this we're going
to play around with the prototype
property so now let's run this in our
favorite browser and see what we get
Hercules has 90 hit points left okay so
you can see that Hercules has 90 hit
points left because Conan attacked him
and damaged him and made his hit points
decrease by 10 now within this method
for developer purposes so if you want to
see which object is accessing you can
just say this dot name and then
concatenate into a string opponent dot
name and you can write just hit so it'll
say the name of the person hitting the
opponents name press ctrl s and run that
in your favorite browser so Conan just
hit Hercules Hercules has 90 hit points
left so you see how that little
applications running so we can access
Conan which is the instance that is
calling this player class and then you
can also access the other object by
accessing the dynamic argument object
okay now directly under that we're going
to add a heal method to the player
object using the prototype property so
let's target the player object use
notation to access the prototype
property and we say dot heal is equal to
function he'll open closed parentheses
open and curly brace go down a couple of
lines and put in your closing curly
brace and also a semicolon to break that
statement so as a dynamic argument
coming into this method we're going to
scoop up target player and then inside
of the method we simply say target
player dot hit points property which is
established up here in the player class
or in the player object plus equals 5
that way will heal that player for 5
points now let's make player one heal
player two and to do that we just say P
1 dot heal so you can access the
he'll method that we just specialized
for the player object and then we say p2
semicolon so player one
he'll player two we can just copy this
same line again up here and run it down
here to see how many hit points player
two has after he's been healed using
this prototype based method that we
added to specialize the object now if we
run this in our favorite browser we get
Conan just hit Hercules Hercules has 90
hit points left because Conan hit him
for 10 points of damage and then
Hercules has 95 hit points left after
he's been healed
that means the healing for five hit
points worked correctly and it will work
for player one and player two so player
one has not been hit yet so he still has
a hundred hit points player two now has
95 hit points because he got hit once
for ten points of damage but then he got
healed for five points so if I was to
take this line and say P 1 dot name has
P 1 dot hit points so they're both
different instances of this player class
alright so now you know how to use the
prototype property to add specialized
methods to your objects now directly
under that we're going to add an energy
property to the player object using the
prototype property so we just
demonstrated how you can add a new
method to specialize your player object
now let's show you how to add a new
property and it's very simple we just
say player dot prototype energy is equal
to 200 or whatever you want to start it
as any property name any value but I'm
just going to make the new property
named energy and its value 200 by
default and then let's just simply alert
player 1 energy so you can access any
instance of the player class either
player 1 or player 2 and alert its
energy property and you'll see that you
have a 200 so if you run this all in
your favorite browser you have Conan
just hit Hercules Hercules has 90 hit
points left then 95 hit points then
Conan has 100 hit points left because he
never got attacked
player two then you see a energy
property of 200 for player one alright
so using prototype you added an energy
property to your player object here and
using the prototype property you also
added a heal method so now you know how
to add methods and properties to your
specialized classes or objects in
JavaScript and using the prototype
property also enables JavaScript object
inheritance so you can create parent
classes and child classes that will
inherit all the characteristics of the
parent class which I will be
demonstrating in the very next video so
don't miss that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
