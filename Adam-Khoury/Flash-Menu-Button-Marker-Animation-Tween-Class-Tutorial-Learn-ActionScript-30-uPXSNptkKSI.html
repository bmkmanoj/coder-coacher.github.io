we're creating in this tutorial this
flash and actionscript 3 tutorial it's
in easing marker that follows your
buttons here we go again with another
flash and actionscript 3 tutorial
suitable for flash cs3 or flash cs4
whichever you have that'll be fine the
interfaces are slightly different so
you'll have to adapt if you're in cs4
because i'm working in cs3 ok so in this
lesson we're going to be showing you how
to create a menu like the menu i haven't
developed PHP so we have a forum member
scotty boy who was wondering if we can
do a tutorial on our top site navigation
with the following builder he's talking
about that guy with the hard hat on back
there little builder guy and the way he
follows the buttons in an animated
fashion and he thinks it's really cool
and he says and even though it's
probably easy to create he loved not to
do it and you are correct Scotty it is
very easy to create and it doesn't take
much code at all we're going to
introduce you to the tween class and
once you get introduced to it you can do
all kind of nifty stuff and so that's
what we're going to be doing so here we
are in flash move create a action and
actionscript 3 file and set our stage
properties first the size
let's go 680 for me because I'm going to
have that fitted it develop PHP into the
page there and we'll just make it about
100 high and yours can be 950 however
why'd you need it and frame rate i'm
going to change that to 28 so we have
nice animation ok the first thing we
want to do on layer 1 let's just create
another layer call that one action
script to be point oh ok then this one
be buttons or elements that'll be good
maybe your menu would be nested inside
of its own movie clip and this would be
its timeline and that's cool but I'm
just going to be working on the route
timeline for this example and on the
elements layer we're going to create a
button so we'll bring out a rectangle
primitive
see one twelve and twenty one that's
good and we'll give it gradient make it
look halfway decent transform the
gradient by rolling that dot around then
moving the marker there to where it
needs to be and then we go into the
color palette i'm going to this is all
just cosmetic crap you can fast forward
to all this but i'm going to create
these into buttons
or make them into buttons in a second
looks good let's give it a blue outline
a gray outline not be good okay so let's
convert that to symbol button symbol and
call it BTN ok ok now we have a button
and let's go inside the button symbol
it's give it an over state in the
overstate let's turn that edge blue and
the fill where it's a little grey will
turn that to blue as well
ok
and let's give it a little down state
just make a turn white in the Phil okay
and keep the border blue
alright
now we have a button symbol its name
this one BTW and one give it an instance
name BTN one and let's see let's just go
ahead and create some duplicates now
press ctrl c ctrl shift v when you
highlight that button
and you can see mine and develop PHP
have their real tight together like that
but in this example I'm going to leave a
little bit of space because a lot of
menus have some space in them and I
wouldn't want people to think they had
to smash their buttons together like
mine were you can do it either way
doesn't matter
select multiple items by holding shift
and deselect them by holding shift as
well let's just make five buttons
spread them apart real nice
and I'm going to highlight all of them
go up to modify a line distribute widths
now all the widths are distributed
evenly through there ok now I'm going to
create a see I don't like when they're
on decimal positions
that's fine
okay now let's build a marker that goes
on top grab another rectangle make sure
it's the same width 112like that 112 and
give it a height about 10
let's give that edge your gradient the
stroke and transform it
there we go
make sure it's at the same exposition is
the button
18 it's good okay let's drag everything
up a little bit now let's convert that
to a symbol movie clip call it marker in
our library and will also give it an
instance name of marker down in the
properties inspector or the properties
panel now let's double-click inside of
it and this can be animated inside this
timeline if you want it but I'm just
going to ctrl c ctrl shift V paste in
place that I'm going to bring it down
modify transform flip vertically now
I've got nice marker for that button and
it's basically what I developed PHP is
menu the little construction worker
behind the menu system pretty much the
same thing it's just a marker type thing
you can make any type you want okay so
that looks pretty good to me let's get
it up one more there we go okay now
marker has an instance name this button
has to be BTN to this one has to be be
10 3 because they all have to have
different instance names for and BTW and
five
yeah that's it that's it for the stage
elements now we'll get to the few lines
of code we need to make this marker
follow all these buttons so if we
publish out right now or if we render
the file by pressing ctrl enter you can
see my buttons have their over and click
States but nothing's happening with that
marker it's not following so we'll code
it up okay let's hide out our actions
layer and press f9 open our actions
panel the first thing we're going to do
is import the transitions needed FL
transitions tween is the first one just
highlight that line ctrl-c ctrl-v this
one is going to be easing dot all put
the asterisk to claim all bar now we're
going to set up a couple of bars here
and the first one is going to be for the
current marker position remember our
marker here the current market position
we're going to set that up for the
default value
so we'll name it curve marker X polls
their current marker exposition this is
going to be a number equals BTN 1 dot x
so what what we're saying there is the
current market position the number for
the current market position is equal to
the button ones exposition so here we
have BTN one BTN to be teen three BTW
and one right there so now the script
knows that the default value for the
marker position is right on BTN one
alright so next one is going to be the
bar for the duration of the tween so
we'll say number equals one point five
that's a good speed and now we'll just
write the function there's not many
lines of code at all to this will be
done in just a second here's the
function that we're going to create for
actually making the movement of the
marker going back and forth and and
we'll set up event listeners will all
vie buttons and that's it and inside of
this function is going to be between
marker follow that's a good name for it
and this is an event mouseevent
mouseevent function
in the colon notorious void curly brace
go down close up the other closing curly
bracket and now inside the function type
the between right in call it marker
tween and this is between equals new
tween
and the object is the marker the
instance name the axis will be X that it
will travel along and strong for the
tween ease out for the ease method and
now we have to put in the current marker
position here so let's grab that
variable remember that has a number
value and this also has a number value
and it's going to be the event that
target X and I'll explain what that
isn't just a sec when I type it out that
target dot X and let's put in the
duration real quick duration let's claim
true and close it up
okay now what this means here you know
what the current marker exposition is
it's equal to the BTN x BTW n 1x look at
BTN one you highlight it you look at its
exposition it's 18 so that means this
current marker X pose number equals 18
so there's 18 sitting right there as a
default value now the event target dot X
here is always going to be a different
number because we're going to have it
dynamically driven by the event
listeners that we're going to set up
right now and then things will kind of
all come together for you let's see BTW
and one actually we have to make one
more you have to make the current marker
exposition rack dynamic here so each
time a button is rolled over that mark
is going to change position so the
script has to know and record where it
went so that line right there does it so
you make the current marker exposition
equal the event target X so what that
means whatever button is being rolled
over so now let's add the rollover event
listeners that add event listener and
this is
mouse event
and roll over all capitals underscore
over and now we just put in the function
name that we acclaimed here mark or valo
and now we close up the parentheses put
a semicolon now we can simply make five
of these four five rename this btn2 BTW
and three BTN for bt and five and that's
it that's the whole script to make the
marker act the way you need it to for
your your buttons or your movie clip
buttons so now let's press control enter
see what we get that's beautiful I can
see a lot of people who will be using
this one it's easy to code and it works
nice and it looks really slick it'll
make your site's look advanced and like
I said that marker can be animated
inside of its timeline and what's cool
about this is wherever the users mouse
goes the marker is set to have a speed
control depending on the how far it is
away from its destination so if I hit
this button you see it moseys over nice
and slow but if I'm over here soon it
goes really quick all right that's the
end of that one and for the next one he
wanted to know how we get our logo a
little movie clip to follow our logo
when it's rolled over so we'll be
showing you that one next time one is
easy to
so there's the script and the script
will be on the page it developed PHP
with this video is playing along with
this little menu source file alright
we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
