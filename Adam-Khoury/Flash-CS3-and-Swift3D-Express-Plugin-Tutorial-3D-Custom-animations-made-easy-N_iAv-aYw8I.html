just wanted to show you the finished
product of the simple demonstration of
what I'm creating here
hey there in this flash tutorial I'll be
showing you I'll be working in cs3 in
this tutorial and I'm going to show you
how to use the Swift 3d Express plugin
which is a 3d extension for Adobe Flash
and it's $129 from arraign electric
reigns website
Arang calm let's eat our AI n calm and
you can go there and check it all about
the sweat the swift 3d Express plugin
for flash and swift 3d is also a
standalone application that lets you
model nice 3d polygon models polygon
meshes and animate them make movies SWF
files it renders out SWF files and if
you have the plug-in it will render out
movie clips straight into flash which is
really cool so I'm gonna go to flash
which I have an ActionScript 3 file
already opened and you can have
ActionScript 2 file for this so it
doesn't matter and I'm in flash cs3 but
you can be in flash 8 if you like both
will will take the plug-in and so what
I'm gonna do is draw out a shape with
the pen tool and I'm just going to make
a quick shape just for demonstration
purposes and say you have a specialized
logo shape
a logo that you use for your company and
you'd like to make it 3d spin around put
all kind of cool lighting and rendering
effects on it so what we'll do is we'll
get rid of that line the outline so we
just have a fill and now if you have
your plugin connected which they tell
you how to do when you buy the the swift
3d express for flash you'll see in your
commands menu when you have something
highlighted on stage it'll bring it
straight into swift 3d automatically
through the plug-in and your commands
menu you go to Swift 3d Express so I
press the Swift 3d Express and there is
my little logo shape or whatever shape
because this can be text to actually you
can put in flash any text font style you
bring in and just bring it straight into
the plug-in and swift 3d so now I'll go
to materials and there's all kind of
cool things you can do in here and I
suggest you look around in here
and figure out all the things you can do
and I think I'll do two more tutorials
on this as well but if you go down to
materials here you'll see that there's a
reflective all kind of cool stuff so and
reflective I'm gonna pick a good gold
put that gold reflective on it and
actually I'm gonna go to glossy and put
the orange on it match developing HP's
colors okay so let's go to sizing and
let's resize this thing make it a little
bit more narrow they're a little less
deep and a little less high a little
shorter
that looks good so that's our custom
shape and we're gonna put an animation
on it you can do custom animations on
this and if you're gonna do custom
animations with Swift 3d I recommend
doing it in the standalone application
Swift 3d version 5.0 that way you can
render out SWFs
and have a little more control over your
models the way they look the way they
they are render out the way they the way
you can do advanced modeling in the
advance modeler so let's go to animation
tab down here and we'll take a regular
spin horizontal spin and once I drag
that to it now I press the play button
and there's my cool fancy new logo
spinning around and I want to make it a
little bit deeper give it more depth
let's make it a little deeper and now
all we have to do is press render and
export the flash if that's all you want
to do to it and for demonstration
purposes that's all I'm gonna do to it
and over here I'm going to select says
cartoon and average color fill and
that's fine and I'm going to select
include specular highlights include
reflections and includes shadows but
checking all those boxes and then click
raster you can do vector or raster in
this case I'm going to do raster make
sure the bitmap compression is a little
bit on the higher side and that's pretty
much it you render into frames and
you'll see that this thing it'll start
to render out the 3d frames according to
the animation you set and the model
that's there and you can see the
specular highlights shadows lighting
highlights which are the specular
highlights
but this'll just take a second and once
it renders out all the frames we're
gonna bring it into flash as a movie
clip which is really cool and then you
can control it in flash if you want it
to stop when the users mouse goes over
it you can do that so right here when it
renders all the frames out you press
create flash movie clip and there we are
in flash and press f12 to publish voila
I have a movie clip in flash that is 3d
instant awesome my logo you cannot be
deaf workflow that is so quick to do
really nice graphics and everybody's
starting to implement 3d graphics and
websites nowadays so you better hop on
board or you'll be left behind okay
we'll see you guys next listen like I
said this is a movie clip you give it an
instance name and you can control it
just like any other button or movie clip
and flash okay okay and ActionScript 3
or ActionScript 2 or ActionScript 1 ok
we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
