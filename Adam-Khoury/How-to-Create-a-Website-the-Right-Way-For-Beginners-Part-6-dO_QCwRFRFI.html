website the right way for beginners part
6 and you can see I traded out the old
background I had for one that I bored
some awesome sauce on the other one was
really kind of your kept this is much
better and still not too distracting but
it's a lot more creative and I made it
in fireworks here you can see it's red
there let's go down a little bit I guess
some hips malorum sitting on top of it
lorem ipsum which I generated in
fireworks if you go to which one is it
text I think commands maybe text lorem
ipsum right there commands text lorem
ipsum you have a need lorem ipsum for
dreamweaver or fireworks there it is or
you can go online to the lorem ipsum
website grab it over there but i'm going
to use that in just a second actually
let's go ahead and take it grab all that
control see now let's go into
Dreamweaver and I had somebody on
YouTube was asking what I'm going to
show how to push this content off of the
left edge you give all this some
cushioning and make it look nice I'm
gonna do that right now so as you can
see if we go into the code view I'm
using a bunch of break tag stick to add
space add height to show that the body
section auto adjust its height so what
I'm going to do now is take a dip tag
around this content or it says I poured
awesome sauce on my background I'm going
to change that content to what I have in
my clipboard the lorem ipsum and there
we go now I'm going to put a div tag
around that lorem ipsum see how it's all
snug against the side there I'm going to
put it a little bit tag right around
there
and down here after the period close it
off now in the Dib tag i'm going to set
style margins margin left maybe 16
pixels and the margin top maybe eight
pixels
ctrl s to save the file ftp it up to the
web and let's go to the webpage online
live and refreshing look at what we have
here so you'll see it auto adjust to fit
the content now we have the content
pushed off of the edge as much as we
want as many pixels exactly as we want
to set it and exactly often the top so
I'm going to set this to maybe I don't
know 20 get it off that edge some more
and off the top a little bit more maybe
10 if you want to set the height of that
div you can do that too let's do that
ati hd Cullen maybe 500 pixels ctrl s
ftp it and you'll see now that you have
a a div that's going to set a definitive
height to your page you know I have to
use paragraph tags or break tags to put
extra padding and space in the page
there you can set a definitive
definitive height using a div tag
sitting with in that cell and you can
also Pat it you see all those sections
with a multi margin-top and the margin
left is holding that div away from the
edge okay so if you're interested stay
tuned for part 7 where we're going to
set up the site navigation his header
and make sure this big green thing that
people would just instinct lee
instinctively want to click we're going
to make sure that is an active link that
goes to the homepage okie dokie goodbye
