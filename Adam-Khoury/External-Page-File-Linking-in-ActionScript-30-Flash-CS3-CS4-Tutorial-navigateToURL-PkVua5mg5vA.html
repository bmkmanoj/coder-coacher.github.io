3 tutorial in which I will demonstrate
how to link to everything you could
possibly want to set an external link to
well I'm going to show you how to let
somebody download mp3 files you can set
a button or a movie clip to do that you
can set a button movie clip to let
somebody open up external PDF files on
your website you can from within flash
you can let them download zip files set
up buttons to let them read dot docx
files rich text documents txt files all
that good stuff you can link to other
websites you can link to other pages on
your website outside of your Flash site
and I'm going to show you how to do all
that stuff right now in ActionScript 3
and I'm in flash cs3 professional and
I'm going to click you can use cs4 for
this as well and I'm going to click
flash file ActionScript 3 and let's get
started
now and I also just to note I have a
will show you how to do an email link as
well on a button or a movie clip to open
up the users default email program and
on my site it develop PHP comm I also
already have a tutorial on how to use
navigate to URL to create a JavaScript
pop-up button solely in flash you don't
have to put anything in the HTML file
it's all done within the navigate to URL
string all the JavaScript definitions ok
so let's get started on this first thing
we're going to do is on the first on the
only layer sitting there we're going to
grab the rectangle of the shape tool and
grab a rectangle primitive symbol drag
it out and that looks like I have a
curve on mine already so let's make it
put that 2-0 and that looks good
just give it a fill of like a light blue
looks good and an edge of gray yeah we
have a nice button on your little darker
on the edge and bring this down to 0.25
for a nice fine stroke
okay so let's right-click that convert
it to a symbol and this will be our
button that we're going to use it's a
button symbol and you can make it a
movie clip symbol if you want the code
would still work when you put the
instance name on it it could be an
animated movie clip and animation
whatever you want we'll call it my BTN
because we're going to use this button
over and over for all of the examples
here okay so let's go inside and create
an over state and down state you hit the
put your mouse on the over frame and hit
f6 do the same on the down frame hit f6
to create new keyframes now we change
the instance of that symbol on the over
frame and we'll change the fill to white
not white maybe just a little more light
blue there we go and we'll change the
stroke to a dark blue so that's the over
state the button lab and now we can go
ahead duplicate this push ctrl c ctrl
shift B we're going to duplicate it
eight times because I'm going to show
you a text earn allele ink to eight
different things eight different types
of files
zips mp3s
text files PDFs open email whatever you
want to do okay so that's eight buttons
there what I did was I highlight them
all any ones that I want to copy and
paste in place I highlight them I press
ctrl-c and ctrl-v you see it paces them
right in place and I can drag them
around where
okay let's control X get rid of those
right now I render out I should have a
nice little button menu setup that's
ready to have text put on top of it and
we'll label all of these now this is a
send me email BTN BTN is short for a
button
and make sure it's aligned left ctrl c
ctrl shift V oops ctrl c highlight the
text and ctrl C and ctrl shift V paste
in place do it for the next shuttle C
ctrl shift V bring it on down bring it
out down alright now get all four
control C control shift V and slide them
down I'm using the arrow keys on my
keyboard to slide these things down that
looks good okey-dokey now we'll give
these instance names and I'll get to the
code soon enough you guys can just
fast-forward through all this crap if
you already know how to make your
buttons and everything and give them
instance names but giving them instance
names here is very important so if you
don't know about it you better watch
okay so this is going to be called what
should we name this from the email
button send underscore email underscore
BTN send email underscore BTN now the
next one we'll show you how is open
underscore doc underscore BTN these are
the instance name I'm giving to the
buttons so I can refer to them in my
code and they'll they'll be active and
the code will be set on to those buttons
or movie clips PDF underscore BTN open
PDF this one we will show you how to let
people download zip' so we'll call this
one zip BTN and this one will show you
how to let people download mp3 from your
site so we'll say get mp3
underscore BTN and the next one is up
I'll show you how to link to a page on
your site so page on my site underscore
BTN next one will be another site will
show you how to link to another site
underscore BTN and this one just show
you how to go scene go scene one going
to score BTN that'll that one will be a
scene within this flash file in case you
want to know how to manipulate the
timeline with a button and jump to
different places in the timeline with
one of your buttons okay now that we
have these as button symbols and they
each have their own instance name to do
different things in the code let's go
ahead and label them correctly you just
highlight the text double-click it and
rename it and this is going to be doc
see open doc BTN
this one is open PDF will name this open
PDF egn this one is instance named zip
so this is our download zip button this
will be the button to let the user
download a zip file from you this next
one let's get mp3 so name it accordingly
let's say download download mp3 BTN this
one has an instance name of page on my
site this one another site this one
scene so let's name go to
HTML page for open HTML page open my
HTML page
within another site and the way I'm
going to code this button open another
site is going to be and the open my HTML
page is going to open it to where they
don't not navigate it away from your
site page the page sets linking they're
going to stay on the site and it's going
to open in a new window
this one is go to a frame let's just
we'll just make that button go to a
frame all right now we have a mold
labeled let's press control enter see
what we have okay we have a little
button menu there nice little custom
button menu ready to go all the needs is
code so we'll highlight this layer press
insert layer here and then on this layer
we'll rename it actions and highlight
the keyframe press f9 to get into your
actions panel this is where you place
all the code for your projects in flash
and what you do is you put it in the
timeline wherever your symbols are and
it will run the symbols EEMA
you can have movie clip symbols for this
code or button symbols I just happen to
have button symbols okay so we'll open
that back up and we're going to create
some variables now that are going to
hold the URL strings that we want to
open up all the things we want to let
people download and such and all that so
let's go ahead and create a variable for
the first string it's going to be email
address this is going to open up their
default this is URL request it's going
to open up their default the put a colon
nope no colon equals new
this is going to open up their default
email application like Outlook Express
or Thunderbird whatever they use new URL
requests and then we put open
parentheses and put double quote double
quote close parenthesis and semicolon
and then inside the double quotes
between the two double quotes we put
there is where we put the the mail to
link you know how to make those right
male 2 : and just put your email this is
where your email would go at your
website calm and that's how we're going
to add the string to open up the email
to allow them to email us using a button
okay now let's highlight that whole
string and press ctrl C the whole line
and then press Enter
go down one line and press ctrl V to
paste and this next one we're going to
be the document so this will be say you
have a docx file a dot docx file you
want them to be able to open and read or
download and just type in new document
whatever it's named dot docx and that
one's done and we'll change this to say
doc you doc URL the OSI URL now we have
doc you RL let's highlight that one ctrl
C go down on one more and this one is
going to be the PDF just want to let
them open a PDF that you have on your on
your site from within flash so we have
the PDF URL and this one I'll show you
how to let's get that whole your website
thing there your website com ctrl C I'll
show you how to go use the whole entire
URL string and it both works it works
both ways
w dot yourwebsite.com
/ new document so in your root directory
you would have a new document doc and
this is how you link to it or you could
just link straight to it like that these
work the same and you can actually put
this here take this whole thing put it
here as long as that's in the root
directory it'll it'll hit your doc but
this one we want to say my PDF my
underscore PDF dot PDF that way people
can open and read a PDF on your site
that's on your server so I'll leave this
one without and that one with but it
works the same and this one you would
use if it was on a different website but
you can use it on your website as well
but if it's on your website you can just
use that and it works just the same
okay we'll highlight the next slide or
highlight that line to create the next
line and this one is our zip zip URL and
we'll name it archive dot zip or
whatever your zip file on servers named
and that would be in the root directory
as well
and highlight that line and the next one
is the mp3 where we let them download an
mp3 from our server mp3 URL will name
this cool jam dot mp3 make sure that the
dot now highlight that line the next one
was the page linking on the site so
we'll name that one page on my site URL
oops
then the wrong one page on my site URL
and this will be simply services
services HTML this is an HTML page that
will open when they hit the button and
next we have another site linked to
another site URL okay so that's another
site URL we're good to go
okay we have all of our bars ready with
all of our URL strings ready to go so
what it does is this variable here is
claiming this name as the variable it's
a URL request variable and this is the
string for that variable and we have one
two three four five six seven of them
okay now we're going to create the
functions that utilize these variables
and the first one is going to be let's
make a code comment call it send email
and we'll type in function
and what I did there was put two forward
slashes to create a code comment and
that never this will never run it just
gets skipped by the code whenever the
flash player goes to run the code you
can put code comments as many as you
want all over the place
I like code comments okay so function
this is email down name an email down
because it's going to be all based
around this function is all based around
when the email button gets pressed so we
name it email down this is event colon
Mouse event close parentheses colon type
in void and void is used to make a
leaner function it doesn't use as many
resources in the flash player as if you
left the void out you don't even have to
have void there the void is a method of
making leaner meaner functions that use
up less system resources okay or less
flash player resources so inside of that
function actually let's go ahead and
just now we'll duplicate it later so
what I did was I close the bracket open
the bracket for the function the curly
brace and then I close the curly brace
gave it a couple of press ENTER a couple
of times to go down a few lines and then
I close the curly brace so now the
function is opened and closed and inside
of it here is where we place the code
that we want to happen now we're going
to use the navigate to URL method
in flash to navigate to that first URL
so we open parentheses close parentheses
and we'll put a colon and now inside
those parentheses we'll put the email
variable the email address variable so
we just type in an email address then
comma we're going to make sure the
window is self for the email address I
don't think it matters too much what the
window is set to the target window okay
so that's it now we add an event
listener for the for that email and
that's going to be telling the button
that's going to the event listeners are
for when you have an object on stage
that's a button or a movie clip event
listeners are set up to listen to when
the users mouths mouse goes over them
out from them clicks on them drags them
all those things so that's what we set
up event listeners for because this
function would never fire off unless we
set up this event listener now so let's
go ahead and send set it up let's go
send underscore email underscore BTN
because that's the name instance name on
our button let's get the properties back
up here
I can't see them there it is see send
email underscore BTN so that's what I
use in the code dot add event listener
so we add an event listener and then
what it's listening for here is we open
parentheses and we type in Mouse event
it's listening for the mouse event dot
click if you want to roll over or roll
out for listening for those things you
would type that in right there but this
is going to be for the click so we type
in comma and then our function name that
we just created email down then we close
parentheses semi-colon and now the email
function will work if we render out by
pressing f12 to publish and we bring
this now you'll see if I click send
email button it opens Outlook Express
and it will open their default mail
program so they can send your messages
okay so that's that one and that pretty
much shows how to use variable that you
set on top of your script down inside of
your function here so I'm using the
navigate to URL and the URL I'm
navigating to is email address which is
set here and that's that email address
right there it's the mail to function
alright so all you have to do is take
these now let's create listeners for all
of our buttons say 1 2 3 4 5 6 we have
seen I'm not going to do the scene go to
frame button I'm just going to do
external linking on this tutorial so we
have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
so one two three four five six seven all
right now the next one is going to be
the open dock open dot docx file so you
say open the score doc underscore BTN
has an event listener for the dot doc
function we're going to make and that
name will be docked down just like we
have email down we'll have doc down this
next one is going to be PDF down next
one is going to be zip down next one is
going to be kid mp3 down p3 and next one
we'll name next function we'll names
page on my site
page on my site down and then another
site amid their site down so all we need
is those functions now we're going to
make these proper name of the buttons
the instance name on the buttons so you
see how all these buttons have an
instance name down here you have to put
that proper instance name for the event
listener so we have to change all of
these to their proper names so open PDF
PDF and I know it seems monotonous and a
lot of coding but once you set this up
the first time in any of your
applications its reusable you just copy
and paste a change couple of things
around bada-bing bada-boom okay so open
PDF now this one is zip zip button get
mp3 button get mp3 BTN the next one is
another site or another page
what is that instance name
page on my site BTN let's copy that
let's just pop it in page of my site BTN
and then that last one was another site
another site underscore BTN that's it we
have all of our listeners in all we got
to do is finish up the functions now so
once I write out the functions for each
one of these event listeners and these
all these functions are going to be
using these URL variable strings here
then the whole application will be done
so let me go ahead and show you how to
do that okay so let's just finish up
these functions and you'll be good to go
you'll have everything you need to
understand and navigate to URL function
or navigate to URL method okay so we
have email address next one is docked
URL copy that paste it here go to doctor
URL that one's going to navigate to docq
RL we have to put dark down here that's
it that one's ready and we'll name that
duckling
copy that one go down a couple of lines
paste it in PDF link this one is PDF URL
and PDF down and that's it
now we go down a couple more lines paste
again and after PDF we had zip down zip
down and zip URL and we'll call this zip
link and the next one is get mp3 down
I think that's the name of it I get mp3
down yep there's the name the function
we have it names correctly and just type
in mp3 URL here make sure that's the
right URL mp3 URL yep make sure this is
mp3 link and I'm going to have all this
code at develop PHP so where you guys
can get to it if you don't feel like
typing all this out in the video if you
want to just grab all the code and go I
have it available next one is a page on
my site link and the function name just
copy it there page on my site down and
the URL just copy that one from there
and put it where it needs to go and then
we have one more I think
troll C control V and this one is a
different website
link to a different website and that one
is another site down control C and then
control V on that function name now
let's get the right variable string
getting URL request put it in and that's
it I think that's all of them another
site site okay so you can see how I
claim the variables in the very top of
the script then I claim what the
functions for what's going to happen
when those buttons get pressed and then
finally we claim the listeners that
actually listen for the buttons getting
pressed so they can fire off these
functions sitting right up here that's
how it works and inside the functions we
use these URL request strings to
navigate to that particular URL and that
is the basics of navigates URL opening
all types of documents setting downloads
whatever you want to do from within your
Flash documents or web pages okay we'll
see you guys next lesson and like I said
this this code will be in the on the
pages develop PHP I'm going to put a
link in the description at YouTube so
everybody can get to the code if you
don't feel like typing with me as I type
in the video but you can do that as well
whatever you want to do okay we'll see
you guys next lesson I just wanted to
add really quickly that all of my inside
of all of the functions my navigate to
URL methods have the target is self you
want to make that blank to open in a new
window so they don't get navigated away
from your page okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
