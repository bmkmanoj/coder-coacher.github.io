6 tutorial we'll be taking a look at the
program's interface along with toolbar
resizing and docking in tutorials coming
later today and tomorrow we'll discuss
more in depth about many of the things
that we'll just skim over in this
interface tutorial if you happen to be
using previous versions of Swift 3d the
interface is very similar now the
default interface you get when you open
the program is arranged the way the
program creators feel it's best suited
for good workflow but that doesn't mean
you can't change things up to suit your
specific creative needs which I will
show you in just a second now first we
have the main toolbar here and above the
main toolbar you're going to find tabs
which allow us to get to the main scene
editor extrusion editor lathe editor
advanced modeler preview an export
window and the web assistant where you
can find all kind of technical support
and tutorials and things of that nature
the next thing we have is the properties
toolbar which is shown here in the very
left of the program and you open it the
next thing we have is the animation tool
bar which is this sitting right here
which allows you to animate things in
your scene the next thing we have is the
hierarchy toolbar next is the viewports
now the next thing we have is the
rotation trackball so if I was to create
an object and if I want to rotate that
object and free rotate mode you can just
use the rotation trackball makes it very
easy if you want to scale that item real
quick you go up here to scaling mode and
you can just grab it alright so the next
thing we have is the lighting trackball
and all you have to do is grab a light
like this rotate it around that ball
anyway you need it to be and you can see
how it adjusts the reflections and the
lighting
on your objects in the scene and the
next thing we have is the gallery's
toolbar which I'm going to be talking
about all these toolbars a little bit
more in depth in later tutorials and
then finally we have the status bar
which is on the very bottom and it will
give you status and indication of what
operations are being performed if any
errors have occurred in any operations
and things of that nature okay now let's
talk about resizing and docking these
toolbars any of these toolbars can be
resized or docked so let's say if I
wanted to maximize this viewport let's
say if I wanted to move this up you see
what's going to happen all of that's
going to increase in size of that
toolbar and the ones above it will
decrease in size the view pains you see
the view pane decrease and then that one
increases same with left to right you
can slide these bars left and right to
give any toolbar that you're focusing on
more room to play with now you can
undock all these toolbars as well so you
just put your mouse inside of each
toolbar and you'll see it gives you the
move symbol on the mouse if you happen
to have dual screen on your computer
it's really handy you can really
maximize your your your viewport by
undocking these windows so you can take
them right out of there and I'm going to
take this and I'm going to throw it onto
my other screen so now it's on my other
monitor and I can maximize the viewport
here by getting rid of all of these well
not getting rid of them but just by
putting them onto my other monitor and
many many people have dual monitors
nowadays in their computer so it might
be something you're interested in take
this one out and now the last one is the
properties toolbar so you see there
now I have a nice big viewport to work
in that's just about full screen and
we'll be talking about the viewports
later on and then just as easily as you
took them out you can pop them back into
place so that takes care of the
interface and your toolbar resizing and
docking in the next lesson we'll start
discussing more in-depth all of these
toolbars and what they do and how to
play around in the scene to make cool
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
