make these beautiful heart-shaped boxes
gives you sweetheart
first we'll create a new fireworks
document I'll make mine 800 pixels wide
by maybe 550 hi
actually I'll just make it 500 there we
go
now I'm gonna open the auto shapes
library and I think you can get to that
through window Auto shapes and down in
there you'll find a heart now if you're
not using fireworks you just have to
draw one out so I'm going to adjust the
cleft and just the vertex until I have a
nice heart shape the heart shape that I
want and your heart shape doesn't have
to look exactly like mine I'm gonna make
it a little bit bigger now I'm just
going to scale this I'm gonna grab it
scale it down until I have something
like that now I'm gonna make a copy of
that ctrl-c ctrl-v and then bring the
copy down so this will be the top of my
box and this would be the bottom so the
bottom has to be a little bit smaller
than the box top so let's go ahead and
make that an even number as well 4:35
that sounds good or an odd number sorry
4:35 put it into the middle right now
I'm gonna select the top one and zoom in
by holding ctrl and mouse wheeling and
I'm gonna make a copy of that one on top
again ctrl-c ctrl-v now move that new
copy down change the color of it to be a
little gray or something or whatever you
want and then take the one on top again
and move it to front by pressing ctrl
shift and the up arrow key or you can
use the little boxes up here these will
let you move to front send to back
things like that so now you did adjust
the depth that you want your box top to
be by moving this up and down so let me
move back out I want mine right about
there maybe a little higher I'll zoom
back in and I'm gonna grab my pen tool
and I'm just going to connect these
shapes so there's not this little dimple
that goes in here I'm just gonna make a
straight shape going up here so I'm
gonna start right here and click down
let go then I'm gonna hold my shift key
to make sure it stays a straight line
click down right here then I could just
go somewhere here and then I care and
there's my little shape I'll just bring
this heart back to the front now I can
take this ctrl-c ctrl-v flip it and drag
it over to this side to put it in place
and if you don't get it exactly in place
it needs to be 120 Y make sure it's at
120 Y just move it with your arrow keys
okay now we're gonna take these I like
all three of these shapes this grey
heart this shape and the shape all
together by holding shift and then I'm
gonna go to modify combine paths and
union now we're gonna copy this the
black heart control-c control-v now
there's two of them but don't move it
now we're gonna highlight this black
shape and this shape the grey one
underneath the modify combine paths and
punch so now you see what you have I'll
highlight this shape zoom in take the
pen tool start right here hold shift to
make a straight line and go up to about
right there then we'll just go across to
about right there then about right here
and if you don't get that point right
that's okay you can fix it then go down
to right here and then across to here
now what you can do is hit your sub
selection tool and hit this point and
then just move it over with your key
your arrow keys to make sure it's a
straight line back out a little bit now
what we're gonna do is combine these two
shapes so or union them so let's
highlight these two together by holding
shift as we select modify combine paths
and Union now what we'll do is select
this one press ctrl-c ctrl-v to make a
copy then bring that copy to front now
you can select these together this one
and this one then modify combine paths
and punch now you have a nice bottom
shape
that is perfectly shaped up against the
top so I'm gonna give this shape let's
select that one go down here and
gradient radial bring this down a little
bit right there I'm gonna change the
colors let's go to the bright red for
the center and then the outer color the
darker red
we can even darken that up a little bit
more if we like okay this one will make
a little darker as well there we go now
these two shapes I'm gonna give those
gradient of bars I'll adjust the color
and we can select this bright red here
in the center and this can remain a nice
dark color actually what we can do is
add another color here so let's move
this color in a little bit select click
down right here and it'll add a new
color and then that one can be as dark
as you like so let's leave it that color
where it's nice and dark and this one we
can brighten up a little bit something
like that now I want to get a little
black shape that's gonna be the shadow
under the box top so I'll select the box
top press control-c control-v to make a
copy and then I can move it off to the
side and I'll give it a solid black I'm
gonna make it the same width as the box
bottom just scale it so it's the same
width as the box bottom and then you can
put it back up maybe about right there
then select the box top again the edge
of the box hop ctrl-c ctrl-v bring the
new copy to front now we'll use this to
punch this shape out so we can move this
up into place maybe right about there
and select these both together go to
modify combine paths and punch
now you just have a little strip that's
the shadow I'm going to take the sub
selection tool and hit this little point
right here and drag it down a little bit
same with this edge and it's hard to
grab those points so you can zoom in if
you need to it's like a million points
over here there we go and let's just
make sure that this is to the front
bring it to front and then you can
maneuver this anywhere you need to to
make any depth of shadow that you want
for the box top you can also take down
the opacity and it'll look something
like that and if you want you can add
the filter of blur and add some blur to
it if you want now all we have to do is
add some lines for accenting the front
edges so I'll select this shape zoom in
on it and I'm going to go to the line
tool and then I'll just press down right
here try to get it centered the best I
can right here and go up to about right
there and I can adjust the width on it
make it 5 or 3 and then just to hide a
little bit 44 maybe there we go and I'm
gonna make the same line for the box
bottom right here something like that
and then make sure that this line select
this line and the box bottom and bring
two back send to back that way your
shadow comes over that line I'm gonna
make two more lines start right here and
draw up dragging as I draw something
like that and I can make an exact copy
of that control-c control-v flip it and
then just use my arrow keys to move it
over into place now we'll select this
line go up to commands creative Auto
vector mask and then select the way you
want it to mask apply now you can see
this edge kind of fades off the white
color fades off actually let's remove
this one make a copy of this one ctrl-c
ctrl-v flip it then move this one into
place all right now you can back off a
little bit go back to 100% and then
change the opacity on these lines
let's just bring these down to something
like that and then these as well bring
their opacity down what were these 32
let's just make those 32 also okay so
there you have a completed heart-shaped
box and you can make the bottom a darker
color than the box top but I just
decided to make it all the same color
okay now let's have some fun and make a
little Valentine's Day card out of this
this will be part of the graphics that
is on the card I'm gonna highlight
everything press ctrl-g and move it off
to the side but what I want to do is
draw a shape a rectangle right around my
canvas I'm going to change this gradient
to radial
then I'm gonna grab the pen tool I'm
gonna click down right about here
I'm going to go to right about here I
might have to zoom out a little bit but
I'm gonna go to here and click down and
hold and drag so I have a nice curve
then click here here here and there now
you have a shape that you can give any
fill that you want now let's zoom back
into a 100% change the ellipse color
something like that and then we'll get a
darker red but we want to make that much
darker so it has a nice contrast to the
other part of the background will move
this gradient where we want we can size
it make it thinner put it right about
there now let's change that edge from
white to like a golden color bring it up
to maybe 2 or 3 then we'll change that
to unnatural let's see
fluid splatter take it back down to 2
and it looks something like a gold chain
or gold necklace maybe now let's take
our box on a heart shaped box again drag
it here make sure it's bring it to front
by pressing control shift up arrow key
now I'm just gonna make a copy of that
ctrl-c ctrl-v put the copy back over
here and go ahead and modify flatten
this one and scale it down so it's
something about that size right there
put it into place I can drop a little
shadow on it
drop shadow and now that's a great start
to a Valentine's Day card you can move
this gradient around back here if you
want to have if it's too much if it's
too bright right here and it can't it's
not enough contrast you can just move
this somewhere over here or whatever you
want and then you can write words in
there with really pretty text and
another cool effect is to add a sparkle
so you can draw a star and give that
star the colors that you want in the
gradient and make sure it has a radial
gradient make the colors white and on
the outer edge bring the opacity all the
way down then we can adjust the radius
and give it as many points as we want
I'll give it that many then I'll press
control-c control-v to make another copy
and I'll scale the copy down and I'll
rotate it a bit to where it fits right
in there and I'll highlight both of
those together go to modify combine
paths or actually let's just flatten it
and then we can scale it down so we have
a little sparkly let me put the little
sparkles everywhere something like that
now you can just write in some pretty
text and you have a really cool I'm
gonna darken this one a little bit and
bring this gradient over right about
there so that's a nice finished effect
you can make some really really pretty
Valentine's Day cards now in the very
next tutorial we're gonna go from design
to programming so we're gonna use this
exact imagery to make a really cool
custom canvas application that you can
allow other people to use to render
custom holiday greeting cards or
whatever kind of graphics that you want
will you be using the html5 canvas and
some JavaScript and some PHP actually
but it's very easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
