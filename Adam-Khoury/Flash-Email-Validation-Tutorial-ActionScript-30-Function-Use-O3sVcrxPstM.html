today's lesson we're going to show you
how to validate email just using
ActionScript 3 if I type in some
gobbledygook / submit it don't work has
very nice but if i type in your email at
your eye that can press submit sending
to PHP now email is valid that's what
we're learning let's rock and roll
we have a member that's looking to learn
how to validate an email address using
flash and actionscript 3 he followed the
form components tutorial that I have
which I will link to right here in the
video or in the description I'll link to
that form components tutorial so you can
check it out if you want and this one is
going to be all about validating email
addresses that people input into that
form or any platform you have for that
matter this file will be available for
download free just like all the other
flash tutorials we have at develop PHP
com now let's take a look what we have
on stage this is just a static text
field that doesn't need to be there
really is just titling this application
here's a label for your email field this
is the email text field which I grabbed
out of the components library the text
input and I put it on stage here and I
give it an instance name of email
underscore txt then i drugged out or I
dragged out a button component right
here to the stage and I gave it
parameter label of submit and I gave it
an instance name of submit underscore
BTN and then I put a dynamic text field
using the text tool here I put a dynamic
text field on stage made a single line
gave it an instance name of status under
stew or txt so we have really three
elements there on stage email text input
field submit button and the status
that's going to let us know what's going
on status field okay now let's take a
look at the code and the first thing we
do in the code is we set up the event
listener for the button click on that
submit button and when they click that
submit button we run a function called
validate and send and that function is
sitting right here now this might look
similar to your set up already if you
already have a form set up you'll have a
submit button listener the event
listener for the button and then you'll
have a function that fires off when they
click that button so inside of that
function that fires off or that executes
when they click that button I run an if
and else condition
you can see this function opens online
for there and closes on 15 let's get
this out the way for now this function
down here is for validating the email
address we'll get to that in a second
now the function validate and send is
the one that would send to the PHP file
or check for errors so we put an if
condition here that's going to check for
errors and you probably have that set up
already if you have an existing form
you're checking to see if fields are
empty and things like that you can just
add another else if here and what you do
is in this if condition you have the
validate email address function name set
right there which is this function down
here and inside of the parameter or the
arguments you can set an argument to
that function of the email text field
which is this text field here the value
that's inside of it when they press
submit that gets sent to this function
using the argument area here inside of
the function so the function runs sends
an argument of the email text value to
this function here and it runs all and
computes at that point and then sends
back false or true it returns either
false or true so we run this evaluation
here if validate email address when it
runs the function with this argument in
it returns equal to false then we put in
the status text field please enter a
valid email address when this function
runs with this argument inside of it and
it equals true it's going to say sending
to PHP now email is valid now this is
where you would send this area here is
where you would send to your PHP file
like normal and parse things out now
let's take a look at the validate email
address function ok the validate email
address function you'll notice has
bulleen here instead of a void and
that's because it's going to return only
thing this function can return is true
or false that's the only two values this
will return so we set it up as a boolean
function
and in the function argument area we
claim a variable email string which is
equal to this email underscore txt dot
txt whatever's in that input.text the
email text gets sent to this and we
created a variable out of it called
email string right here which we use
inside the function right there now
there's two things two variables that we
set up and one is a regex and one is an
object this reject holds the string
value for the regex that I want to use
here and there's lots of different reg
X's you could use you can probably
search google for actionscript-3 email
validation regex and get a whole bunch
of them and use them here in place of
this one all I'm saying is this is not
the only one you can use as a whole
bunch of them and this one is set up to
look for the for the @ symbol the dot
and make sure things just have enough
values in it now we take that regex and
we use it here with the exact method now
i'm going to show you in the help file
right now in the flash help file you can
type in fraction script retype in exec
open closed parenthesis if you happen to
have flash cs3 or you can just go online
if you have flash cs4 to the online help
guide and you'll see here methods for
using regular expressions with strings
the test method and the exact method and
that's what I used in here inside this
function you can research what about
that I'm not going to sit here for eight
hours explaining everything about
ActionScript this one is just showing
you how to set up a couple of functions
to or really one function that validates
an email address and returns a value of
false or true so if this result my
result that we get here from using this
method is equal to no then we return the
value of false if it's not equal to know
if it's not null then we return a value
of true and then we can evaluate that
see if validate email address
equals false we render this else we
perform this and that's how it works and
you can get this file free at develop
PHP I might put a link to it in the
description or you might just have to go
to develop PHP and click the flash
section and look around there's tons of
free files I mean tons is also free all
kind of other stuff too free sex there
too and boobs ok so I hope you've
enjoyed this lesson and you get some use
out of it and we'll see you next time
goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
