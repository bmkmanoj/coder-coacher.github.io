assemble a details driven drop-down menu
system which may be the easiest way to
create drop-down menu systems when the
new html5 details and summary elements
become standardized the html5 details
and summary tags do not yet work in all
browsers out of the four most popular
browsers it only works in Google Chrome
so far so that is where we will
experiment with it for now and we can
surely use it for website development
when these two elements become
standardized and work in all browsers
and that should happen very soon
this is the finished product of what
you'll be learning to assemble as some
of you know the HTML by details element
is specifically geared to have native
open and closed behavior for the content
that is inside of it this native
behavior removes the need for us to have
CSS or JavaScript code in place to make
that kind of magic happen it happens
natively for this details element the
main menu item is the details element
and the summary element is actually what
makes a label for that details element
so you can write whatever you want in
here
I wrote menu item one within my summary
element and that gives me an ability to
label the details element and then down
here these are just regular links using
the a tag the little link tag it's very
simple to construct and there is no
complicated scripting now since it's not
a very complex type of thing I'm not
going to spend a lot of time explaining
stuff I'm just going to go straight into
my bare-bones html5 web document and in
the body element I'm going to set up a
div element go down a couple of lines
close it off and inside the div element
I'm going to give that an ID that's
equal to left menu and that will help us
target this div with our CSS on side of
Left menu I'll hit space twice just to
properly indent and then I'll put my
details element my first details element
go down a couple of lines make sure I
close that details element now the first
thing I want inside of this details
element is a summary element
now what this summary element does it
allows you to label the details element
otherwise it has a default label so I'm
going to type in menu item one I'm going
to make sure I close my summary element
now right underneath and the this
element is a tag or all of these a tags
will be siblings of the submarine
element so they'll all be children of
the details element you can see that the
a element is not inside of the summary
element it's a sibling of that element
these are both children of the details
element so let's put a href is equal to
pound sign and you can put whatever web
address destination whatever page you
need to navigate to right there
and let's give this a label subcategory
eh
now you just take that go down one line
paste another and another and you make
this one say B this one say C now at
this point you might want to look at
what you have so you can render this to
your favorite browser your in
Dreamweaver you can just press f12 you
see I have the details element here and
if I click on it it shows me the content
that's hidden inside of it which are the
3a elements here you can't see the
summary element because the summary
element is only designed to give a label
to the details element let me show you
what I mean if I remove that let me
comment that summary element out press
f12 it just says the default label for
the details element which is the word
details but if I put the summary element
back into place you can see that it says
whatever I want it to say and I'm going
to show you how to remove that arrow and
design these things to look like buttons
so you can make the summary element
itself look like a button and you can
make the subcategories look like buttons
now at this point let's just grab that
the whole details element with all of
its children and let's go right under
that but another one under that another
one and under that another one now you
can see I have four of them so let's
change this one to say to this one say
three this one to say four and if you
want you can make sure that these have
different lengths so they're not all
exactly the same make this D this E and
then maybe put just two there there you
go and take a peek at what you have now
this menu item one when your item two
three and four I'm going to collapse it
now let's go up into the style element
of our document and the first thing
we're going to do is target the body
element this way we can just set its
margin property to zero pixels because
we don't want any marginal space around
the page that's optional now what we
want to do is target this left menu so
we'll take that control C and put the
pound sign left menu open our curly
brace go down a few lines and close the
curly put the closing curly brace right
there
the two properties I'm going to give my
div left menu here are with a 15% and
min width which is the minimum width
that it could be is 150 pixels and that
shows you how to set up your width
dynamically so it can stretch to any
screen size or viewer device and then
when the user shrinks their screen or if
they resize the browser window whatever
the minimum width the menu can be is 150
pixels and left menu is just the div
that holds all of your detail elements
now in the CSS if you want to target
those detail elements you can do so like
this and this CSS definition or this
rule will target all of the details
elements but for this example I'm not
going to have any properties in that I
just wanted to show you if you have the
need to target each detail element you
can do so with this rule now the next
thing we need in place let me open the
HTML and you can see inside of each
details element we have summary element
so let's go ahead and target that with
our CSS so we'll have left menu go
inside of Left menu and as a child of
Left menu are all the detail elements
and then you can target all of the
summary elements that are child elements
of the detail elements you see and we
want to make those cursor:pointer that
way the little mouse arrow turns into
the little hand signal with the one
finger like the little pointer and
that's what you want if it's going to be
a button let me give it a background
whatever color we want in my case it was
a light blue margin of six pixels all
the way around it that way they're not
all crowded on top of each other and a
padding of eight pixels that way the
words inside of the button have some
space around them all right so since the
summary element is acting as our button
our main category buttons we're going to
use a hover State which is a pseudo
selector in CSS so you can just put
colon hover for any element and that
will change its design on the page when
the users mouse hovers over it so we'll
just change its background
the light blue here - a gray color here
and you can have any colors you want and
actually you can use button graphics if
you want you can have a lead to a URL
but the background property and just
have button graphics if you like use
either gifts or JPEGs but I'm just going
to use colors for this quick example now
let's take a look at what we have so you
see now we haven't even targeted the
little a elements within the details
element and we'll get to those in a
second in the CSS and those will come
out looking like buttons as well now
what we want to do is get rid of this
arrow you can either keep that arrow
there which is a nice feature or I'll
show you how to remove it right now so
we'll target left menu and inside of
Left menu
details elements we're going to target
the details marker and you can see I
have the WebKit prefix here so when this
is all standardized you would just put
details marker and take the WebKit
prefix off and you set that to
display:none now if you go to your page
and you refresh it see those little
arrows went away but maybe let's keep
them there because they're a cool little
feature now what we're going to do is
target all of these little a elements
little links that are inside of the
detail elements so let's go in our CSS
and put in left menu and inside of Left
menu
details inside of all the details each a
element we're going to give it a display
a block that way it goes all the way
across the same length as the the parent
button and let me show you what I'm
talking about we look at it now you see
how it goes all the way across here to
the edge that's a cool little feature
you might want or else they'll stop
wherever the word stops the length of
the button you might want to extend all
the way through the menu let me give a
text decoration of none so they're not
underlined by default if the text color
font size make it 13 and your marginal
space now what I did was I gave it a
left margin of 18 pixels that way it
cuts way in you can see that it's
indented into its parent button which is
something that will help your users stay
focused on which
category therein and the rest of the
marginal space just make sure that
they're not all on top of each other now
what we'll do is give those a hover so
let's see what else is in there
background color that's simple and then
they have a padding so the words inside
of those little buttons aren't so
crammed into the container and your
margin if you're going to use shorthand
like this it's top right bottom left top
right bottom left top right bottom left
don't forget now all we need is a pseudo
selector for the hover state of those
little buttons we change the background
color on them when the users mouse
hovers over them and we can change their
font weight to bold if we choose to so
now let's take a look and see what we
have there we go
color changes and the font changes to a
weight of bold and I'll show you one
more little trick under that if you want
to target the before pseudo selector so
on each of the a elements the little
buttons inside you can put content that
leads that element and all I did was put
an arrow and then a space you really
wouldn't want to use that you would want
to use a URL graphic let me show you
what I mean now if I open the menu you
see that little arrow and the space
right there in front of them so you can
do something like that you can use any
HTML symbol character that you want you
really wouldn't want to put this
character in place there I was just
showing you what it does you can do that
something simple like that or you can
take this and put a Content URL so you
just put URL open closed parenthesis and
within here is where you say my little
marker jpg but I'll just leave mine like
that but you guys know that you can use
an image there in place of that if you
want so that's about it I told you it
was easy and it's just html5 and CSS and
it has nice functionality so you can
have a relatively small menu with your
main categories that lead to all of the
subcategories that are within the main
category and like I said these can be
vertical like mine is or they can be
horizontal going across the page this
way and the menu will still drop
underneath it you just have to make sure
your CSS is set up right so it doesn't
push all of the page content underneath
it down and that's very easy to do by
positioning now there are a million
different ways you can design this thing
make it any kind of button style that
you want and make it behave any way that
you want using different CSS selectors
and different properties and don't feel
limited to using the format that I have
here go crazy with your creativity okay
so I hope you've enjoyed that lesson on
html5 and CSS easy-peasy drop down menus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
