anybody out there has a custom paypal
store or uses custom paypal programming
and the buttons for their items in their
store that paypal has recently upgraded
their security on the buttons so if i
click merchant services and then add to
cart button you'll see that there's a
different interface now for creating
your buttons and it shows the buyers
view as you're creating it and we want
to create an add to cart button here or
you can select create a Buy Now button
there and you show this drop-down you
select what the the button is going to
be four and i'll just hit products add
to cart button and the item name i'll
just name it my item or my item one item
ID will be ID underscore one and then
the price say eight eight dollars so now
when i hit you can add other options as
well like a drop down menu or different
option settings for the button and
shipping tax rate and all that stuff but
for what i'm going to do because i have
no shipping on the software products
that i sell i'll have i'll just have the
top portion here filled out right there
and that's all i need to fill out to
make the add to cart button without
shipping and without options so i press
create button
and now here's the code and i'll show
you now the difference it used to be
that let's open word pad and paste that
code in and now they give you a number
here and this value is is what's used i
just changed my number because ok if you
remember in the old programming there
was a whole lot of hidden fields here
and and so let me separate these there's
the form and that's where the form ends
right there and here's the image and the
input type for the button and here's the
only two hidden fields now it's the the
name of the cmd-click and now we have a
hosted button' ID instead of having all
of the other hidden fields where you
have item name the merchant email ID all
of that stuff is hidden now embedded
into the value of this hosted put an ID
or you can still use the old programming
so whatever you want if you want to go a
little more secure in your buttons and
you have the ability to to manually
create your buttons for your store then
you can use this method and you'll have
a whole lot more security because you're
hiding gear merchant email the item
price everything all of the hidden
fields that are sent to paypal upon the
person clicking then all of those things
are hidden up nice with that new
programming so i just wanted to
demonstrate and show the new button code
and how much more secure it is in the
old button code in paypal ok see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
