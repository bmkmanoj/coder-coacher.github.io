going to rig up a walk cycle animation
and direct you to thousands of sprite
sheets that you can start rigging up for
practice purposes and for gaining
inspiration for your own future sprite
sheet designs first let's take a look at
the finished product we have a character
that is walking east and below it is the
sprite sheet and you can see that the
sprite sheet has one two three four five
six seven eight frames so we're going to
step over eight frames to produce this
animation now we're going to use code
that's very similar to the code we use
to render the bouncing ball so now let's
target that div with CSS we can start
giving it properties we'll set the
background to the URL for the image path
that we want to use the sprite sheet so
this Adam dot PNG is that sprite sheet
with eight frames for the walk cycle and
I'm going to make this file available to
you guys online so you can grab it for
testing purposes now the width of this
sprite sheet is 960 pixels that means
each cell is 120 pixels wide or each
frame is 120 pixels wide and the height
is 180 so we put with 120 and height 180
now if we look at this in any browser we
see the first frame only now all we have
to do is add our animation property
which directs a keyframes animation
called walk East to play and that
keyframes animation is going to be set
at a one-second duration so that's the
speed you want it to be faster this
number goes lower you want it to be
slower this number should be higher so
you can adjust the speed of the walk and
steps is where you assign the frames
since our sprite sheet sequence that
that animation sequence has 8 frames we
have to put 8 in the steps and we put
infinite so it'll loop and this can also
be a number now just like we did for the
panting ball all we need is the walk
east keyframes animation that will
adjust the background position for this
sprite sheet that way it shows the
proper frames in sequence so we have a
keyframes animation called walk east and
it takes the background position from
zero pixels to negative 960 pixels and
somebody asked me yesterday what why I
put negative here and not just the
normal 960 and I put negative here so
that my frames run the exact same way
that I have them laid out a my sprite
sheet forward I mean it might sound
counterintuitive but this makes the the
animation sequence run from left to
right just like you read and you can
test this yourself by numbering all of
the all of the cells all of the frames
just put little numbers in them and
you'll see that it runs in order forward
this way if you take the negative off of
there your frames will run backwards
there's really a lot of different ways
you can set it up your sprite sheet can
be just the design of your sprite sheet
can be laid out backwards and then you
can have remove this negative there but
I wanted my frames laid out in logical
order forward in my sprite sheet okay
now let's preview this in Internet
Explorer and we have character walk
cycle running preview this in Firefox
now in order for
to work in Google Chrome and any
webkit-based browsers you have to put
the WebKit prefix on your animation line
and then add another line for all other
browsers that respect the standardized
syntax like Firefox and Internet
Explorer so for Google Chrome you have
to add this extra line and you also have
to add in a whole other extra keyframes
rule that has the WebKit prefix on it as
well right here if I had my code like
this then I put that there and remove
that here this will work in all browsers
now I'll go file preview in chrome and
there's the animation running in chrome
now you file preview in Internet
Explorer it still works in Internet
Explorer because Internet Explorer is
respecting the standardized syntax for
the key frames and the animation so I'm
just going to remove the WebKit prefix
you guys can add those prefixes on your
own for any old browsers that you want
to support as well okay here's the
homework assignment you go to google and
you can type in walk cycle spritesheet
and then hit images now what you can do
is borrow these sprite sheets you can
download them and use them in your
program just for practice purposes and
for gaining inspiration on how to set up
and design your own sprite sheets and
for just gaining insight about video
game design and all that stuff ok so you
can check out all this and you'll notice
that some of these sprite sheets here if
you if you type in anything sprite sheet
like bird you'll have sprite sheets with
bird wings flapping and all you have to
do is rig up that rig up those frames
and you'll have an animated bird or you
can see how animated birds are created
for video games and things like that or
even for google doodle you ever see the
Google doodle animations on Google's
homepage a lot of that stuff is sprite
work so the type in video game sprite
sheet
and you'll see that you have all kind of
animation sequences on one big image
file and that's traditionally what
sprite sheets are use for you can pretty
much put all the video game graphics on
one sprite sheet so go into Google Image
Search and put anything before the words
sprite sheet like if you put warrior
you'll get warrior sprite sheets
fighters and things like that you know
I'm saying now if you go to Adam Cory
calm and then hit ebooks you'll see the
sprite programming mastery eBook now you
don't even have to buy the book to get
some of the preview information you can
just wait for the preview PDF to load
and scroll down and you'll see some of
the preview information and click the
introduction to dynamic animation and
you'll be able to realize how video game
creators are doing all the work that
they're doing because you're going to
have to know JavaScript if you want to
introduce dynamics into your sprite
programming workflow that way you can
directly control all the sprite sheet
animation sequences dynamically for
instance take a look at this sprite
sheet not with the sprite programming
mastery eBook shows you how to do is
have a sprite sheet like this one then
all of these little frames are on one
image file and you can have one frame
with the character just standing still
looking forward and then when the user
presses a certain key or hits a certain
button then the character can start
walking east then they hit a different
button and the character can start
walking West and all kind of other
things like that all of your graphics
are preloaded when the software first
loads and you can direct any of these
animation sequences on large grid style
sprite sheets alright so I hope our
little discussion about sprite sheet
rigging has proved helpful and maybe
even inspiring to some of you guys to
start digging a little deeper into it
and remember you can get a lot of
inspiration from these
ready-made sprite sheets that are found
on a Google image search just remember
you can't use them in your software but
you can use them for practice and
inspiration</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
