what culture or religion you hail from I
hope you and yours have a safe and happy
holiday season Merry Christmas
happy Diwali happy Hanukkah happy
Kwanzaa happy Muharram and happy Bodi
day in this quick little exercise you
can learn to design and animate holiday
lighting effects we're going to make
them pulse and glow as well as alternate
now we're not finished with the
animation programming guide yet that
series will continue on I just wanted to
make a standalone holiday related
tutorial because I usually do something
around the holidays now here's a demo of
the finished effect and we're going to
render it all dynamically so you won't
have to put a whole lot of HTML elements
in your document and you'll have
complete control over the sizing the
shape the colors and the speed and many
other aspects of it we're going to begin
with the bare bones of an HTML document
and just at first we're going to put in
a div and this div is going to contain
all of the bulbs all of the lights and
give it an ID equal to lights this way
you can move this div around you can
also make this a class if you want you
can move this div around and position it
any way you like and all of the lights
will take on that position so inside of
that div I'm gonna put a div statically
at first but we're gonna render these
divs dynamically I'm gonna give it a
class equal to bulb because eventually
we're gonna have many bulbs in there and
we want them all to adhere to this class
of bulb and up in the CSS we're gonna
change the body background color to
black just so we can see the bulbs and
the lights real well but you can have
any background color you want so in the
next line down we're gonna start the
class bulb and I'm going to start with
the width 20 pixels and the height of 20
pixels and for now I just want to get
the shape right and the glow effect
right so I'm gonna put the background
color directly into this class at first
but then I'm going to alternate it later
we'll just go with this green
and we want the display to be
inline-block that way they sit side by
side we're given a margin of zero pixels
top and bottom and ten pixels left and
right and if we render this we'll see
that we just have one little box or one
little square and you don't even have to
use div elements these can be any
elements that you find to be the most
semantically correct for this use and
list elements are really semantically
used for creating lists and div elements
are just a generic container that you
can use for anything I'm just gonna make
that a little bit bigger at first so we
can see it a little bit better so we'll
make it with 50 and height 50 I'm going
to set the border radius to 100% and
then for pixels and see what that gives
us you can see you have something that
looks like a bulb but it's at a
45-degree angle so what we can do to
straighten that out and really you can
have any angle that you want on it we're
going to use the transform effect or
transform property with the rotate
function and I'm gonna rotate that to
negative 45 degrees and see what that
gives us so now it's going straight up
and down you can also dynamically rotate
them through the script that we're going
to create in just a moment the script
that's going to render a whole lot of
bulbs we're going to render a whole lot
of these bulb elements to the page
through script instead of having them in
the HTML or instead of managing them in
the HTML
we'll manage them through script but you
can just put a whole bunch of bulbs
directly in the HTML using this div I'm
going to put two shadow effects and
they're separated by the comma here the
first shadow effect is going to put a
little green glow off to the right of
the bulb and this one will put a green
glow off to the left of the bulbs
let's see what that gives us
so you see now it's a glowing bulb now
we're going to set out making the class
bulb alternate a little bit by using the
eighth child CSS selector and in between
parentheses we're going to first put odd
so for all of the bulbs that are
positioned at position 1 3 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 7 so on
and so forth we're gonna keep those
background that's blue we're gonna set
the opacity to a full one so it'll have
full visibility at first then we're
gonna set the box shadow to make the
glow effect we're going to make the glow
effect blue in that case so at this
point really what I could do is remove
the background here from the bulb class
and I can remove the box shadow and now
I should have one single blue glowing
bulb okay now I'm gonna put in a
keyframes animation which we've been
learning a whole lot about with all of
our recent tutorials lately and this is
called bulb pulse one we're gonna take
it from box shadow of blue to box shadow
none and the opacity one we're gonna
take that and animate it to opacity 0.3
now all we have to do is add to this
length child odd the animation property
to specify that we want bulb pulse 1 to
run on these elements
let's see what that gives us now we have
a pulsing blue bulb that has a nice glow
effect on it now we're going to put in a
key frames animation for bulb pulse 2
which is going to take care of animating
the green bulbs so you see I have my
green box shadow here for the green glow
effect and then all we have to do is put
in child even CSS rule to effect any
even bulbs which would be 2 4 6 8 etc so
you see this starts with the green
background the opacity by default will
be point 3 the Box shadow by default
will be none and then we're going to
specify bulb pulse two for those and all
I have to do is I'm gonna just
statically put in another div of bulb
into the lights element and see what
that gives us so now we have an
alternating green and blue bulb now if I
put another div in there it's going to
be blue and then if I put a fourth div
in there that one's going to be green so
you can see how they'll alternate now
instead of rendering these bulbs
statically sometimes you might want to
have dozens of them or maybe even a
hundred of them and you wouldn't really
want to manage all of those elements
directly in the HTML so what you can do
is make it a little bit more dynamic
so I'm gonna pop in a stripped element
and I wrote a tiny little for loop
that's basically going to run ten times
and within this loop we're going to
create element of div give it a variable
name of bulb and then the very next line
we save bulb that class name is equal to
bulb so we apply this class of bulb
right here to every one of the bulbs
that's rendered dynamically and then
after that all we have to do is write
document get element by ID lights which
is the main container here and actually
let me go ahead and put this script
outside of the lights container directly
under it it might run inside of it but
you just want to make sure that the
lights div is loaded to the document
before you run this script so we say
document dot get element by ID lights
container appendchild bulb so a pen
child is how you add an element
dynamically to a container now I'm gonna
take the size down just a little bit
maybe 20 pixels each and then let's see
what that generates we should have 10
bulbs that alternate between blue and
green that are all animated and glowy
and there you go
so if I set this on 30 pixels each
you'll see they get a little bit larger
we make this ten pixels each they get
smaller
and you can adjust the spacing by
adjusting the margin and what if I put
this on zero degrees they'll all be at
an angle here let me make these 20 again
I'll just leave that on 45 so they're
all straight up and down now since
you're rendering all of these
dynamically through script you can play
around with some randomization you can
randomize things within this script so
for instance these two lines of code
will create a variable named Rand which
is a random number between 180 and 1 and
then we're going to use that Rand
variable in the rotate CSS for the
transform property for the bulb so it's
gonna randomly rotate the bulbs see what
that does if i refresh it's always
randomized so that's a pretty fun trick
and if you're good you can also
randomize the colors and make almost
every aspect of this CSS dynamic in a
sense so I'll just comment that out and
you can use that if you want but this is
basically the finished effect that I
wanted to show you
and it really wasn't too hard to do so
if I only want five bulbs all I have to
do is adjust the for-loop ceiling just a
little bit and you can also Center this
lights div into the center of the page
so I can give this container style
text-align:center
that should Center all of the bulbs see
now the bulbs are centered in the
document or inside of its container okie
dokie so there you have it you can get a
lot more creative and add other kinds of
effects if you take a little bit more
time with it but I just wanted to really
show you how to render the bulbs
alternate them and get them to have a
nice animated glowing pulsating effect
and once again happy Holidays to you and
yours if you found any of this useful
