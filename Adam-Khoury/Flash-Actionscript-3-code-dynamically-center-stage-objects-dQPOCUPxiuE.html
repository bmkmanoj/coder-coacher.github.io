actionscript 3 lesson which is geared
for flash cs3 or flash cs4 we are going
to show you how to Center auto center
items on your stage any objects or movie
clips that you want that can be given an
instance name you can Auto Center them
with a couple of lines of code and this
is handy for image galleries and I'm
going to draw out a circle and let's get
a blue center there so I'm going to draw
out the circle and I have a rectangle
already on stage behind the circle on my
stuff layer and above the stuff layer i
have an actions layer that's where we
will put the action script and it's just
two lines of code this is really simple
i just wanted to show the code and give
reference to it because i'll be going to
the code myself frequently for different
projects to grab it so i always forget
how to code things out so I like to
house a lot of things that develop PHP
so I can go back there and get to the
code so what we'll do is convert this to
a movie clip symbol convert to symbol
and this will be target object
movie clip registration can be Center
that's fine and then we'll give it the
instance name target object now it has
an instance name target object and now
we go into our actions layer and
highlight that frame and press f9 to
open the actions panel now let's see
what position we're at with this circle
67.5 and 62.5 I'll put it in even
coordinates and now we'll put in the
code so we'll say the target object
which is the instance name on the circle
which is now a movie clip because I
converted it to a movie clip equals
stage that stage with times one-half so
we put a point five to represent one
half and then the next line is going to
be very similar so we'll just copy that
and paste to the next line and will
change width to height and will change
the X to Y so this takes the x
coordinates first line takes the x
coordinates and the second line takes
the Y coordinates and places it center
stage by dividing the stage in half and
then setting the the objects y
coordinates and x coordinates to that
exact position if that makes any sense
if you have any questions about this
code and it's you know mind-boggling to
you you can just head into the forums
and develop PHP and ask a question but
like I said this is let's go ahead and
publish out and Booya there it is center
stage this is really handy for if you're
making video players to center the
the video holder movie clip if you make
custom video players or if you're making
image galleries dynamic and image
galleries that are bringing in different
sized images so you have an image that's
a little bit wider and then another
image that's a little bit more narrow
you want them to have center stage this
is a good code to use for that and I'm
going to put this code up at develop PHP
and I'll just put the whole Fla up there
that way everybody can get to the code
and have a good working example so there
it is you see the objects not in the
center in flash then when we publish out
it arrives in the center stage thanks to
the code that we wrote with these two
lines okay we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
