canvas bootcamp if you are new to canvas
programming this initial exercise is
where you begin your training we use
JavaScript to deliver all control and
assets to our canvas ok we're going to
start with the bare bones of an html5
web document and in the body element I'm
going to go ahead and add my canvas
element so there's the opening tag and
then I put in the closing canvas tag and
the attributes we want to set our ID so
we can refer to it in our JavaScript and
our CSS let's also specify the width and
the height which you can also do through
CSS but sometimes you'll get unexpected
results if you don't specify the width
and the height in the canvas element
itself we'll also give it a height
attribute make that equal to 300 so we
have a canvas with an ID of my canvas
that's 400 wide and 300 high and you can
think of your canvas sort of like you
would a stage now up in the head element
I'm going to put in a style tag that's
going to affect the body element and the
my canvas element so the body I just
gave a margin of 40 pixels just so my
canvas isn't tucked into the top left
corner and a gray background and for the
canvas element I gave it a white
background and a black border now up in
the head element we also need a script
element go down a couple of lines and
make sure you close that script element
now the first thing we want to do is in
the window dot onload event is fire off
a function called draw so naturally
above that would need a function named
draw open close parentheses opening
curly brace and go down a couple of
lines and put in a closing curly brace
now the reason why we put the draw
function in the window dot onload event
is because we want this function to fire
off when all the assets are loaded into
the window including the canvas element
but if you could if you try to program
to this canvas element by its ID before
it's loaded into the window it'll fail
so what we do is we just put it in an
onload event then we can draw to that
canvas after the window is finished
loaded and that's all that means
so if you just alert yourself right here
some kind of message you'll see that
right when you run this page when it's
loaded it gives you the hello message
that's the window dot onload event and
the window dot onload event is where you
would normally initialize complex
applications or complex animations or
games now the first thing we're going to
put within the function is a reference
to our canvas rendering context 2d
object and we acquire that by saying bar
CTX which is short for context is equal
to document get element by ID and you
just put the ID of the canvas that you
wish to target in between single or
double quotes then we say dot get
context 2d so that's how you get access
to the canvas rendering context 2d
object now what that is is a constructor
in Java Script that has a list of
properties and methods that we can
access to achieve certain goals on the
canvas so everything that you do on the
canvas is going to be done through this
CTX object which is an instance of a
canvas rendering context 2d object and
it represents a flat surface whose
origin is 0 0 0 X position 0 Y position
so basically at the top left and the X
values increase as you go right and the
Y values increase as you go down so as
you go to the right your X values
increase and as you go down the Y value
increases and you can work on the x y
and z axis on the canvas now sometimes
you'll see authors making a variable for
the canvas itself and then the next line
down they'll get the context 2d for it
but you can do it all in one line just
like this and if you ever need to back
reference this canvas element it's easy
to do that in your code so say for
instance you want to get the width or
the ID of whatever canvas this CTX
object represents or corresponds to
let's just give ourselves an alert just
for testing purposes you can just go see
TX canvas now canvas is a property that
you can access that will let you back
reference the corresponding canvas that
this CTX object corresponds with so I
can just say canvas Dot ID and that will
give me the ID of the canvas then I can
concatenate to that string a little bar
symbol and then I'll say CTX canvas dot
width and then I'll just do the same
thing to list out the height so now run
this in your favorite modern browser and
you see that we get the ID of my canvas
a width of 400 and a height of 300 so we
get all the values that we need that
correspond to that canvas through its
CTX object so all you do is specify the
CTX object and then you access its
canvas property and then you can access
all of the properties of that particular
canvas element you don't have to
actually make a variable for the canvas
above the CTX variable you really don't
have to do that because you can access
the ID the width and the height of that
canvas element directly through the CTX
object okay now I'm just going to
comment out this alert that we put in
for testing purposes so what we're going
to do in this first lesson is also
discuss the three methods that are
available to the CTX object for creating
immediate rectangles on the canvas so
the first thing we're going to do is say
CTX dot fill rect we're going to access
the fill rect method and the fill
rectangle method gets four parameters or
four arguments X Y width and height so
you got X Y width and height so the
exposition that I want my rectangle to
start at is let's say 20 and then the Y
position is also 20 that way it's not in
the top-left corner at 0-0 coordinates
it'll be pushed off of the corner of the
canvas a little bit 20 pixels and the
width I want that rectangle to be is 100
and the height also 100 so it'll be a
little square
now if we look at this in our favorite
browser we have a little square that's
100 by 100 and it's off of the edges in
the exposition 20 pixels in the y
position 20 pixels also now let's say we
want to draw another little rectangle we
can copy that and let's say we want to
have this one dotted an exposition of
200 and a y-position of 200 but we only
want it to be a 50 wide and a 50 high
little rectangle so check that in your
favorite browser and you can see that
you have both of your rectangles exactly
where you position them so that's how
the fill rect method works now there's
also something called a stroke rect
method so that's what we'll put under
this one will put stroke rect we'll
change this to stroke and whatever
rectangle you want the stroke to be
around if you want to make this stroke
be around one of your rectangles you
just give it the same exact coordinates
as that rectangle so that's what I did
now if you look at this now you won't
even see it because everything is black
you can kind of see a border a gray edge
around that black but what I'll do is
I'll give a fill style to my little
rectangles ball say CTX dot fill style
is equal to and then I can just put a
color and let's put magenta now I'm
going to be talking to you guys more
about fill styles and stroke styles in
later lessons but for now we're just
going to cover the three rectangle
methods in JavaScript so now that my
little rectangles are both going to be a
magenta color I should now see the
stroke a little bit better let's check
that so you can see the stroke around
that box a little bit better now if I
wanted to put another stroke around the
little guy that little box I can stroke
again and have the same coordinates as
that little box and the same dimensions
and that gives you a stroke around both
and there's also something called the
line width property and other properties
like line width and fill style I'm going
to go into a lot more later okay so
that's one two of the methods there's
only one more on this one well
access the CTX object clear rekt method
you can think of this as like an eraser
or something to wipe the canvas within a
specified rectangle so that would also
be X Y width and height all three of
these methods fill rect stroke rect and
clear rect they all have the same
parameter settings you give them the X
the Y the width and the height so where
I want that clear rec to begin is at the
top left corner
I'll just put 0 and 0 so 0 for x and y
we'll put it at the top left corner of
the canvas and I want it to clear or
pretty much erase 100 pixels in now
let's see what that gives us so you can
see we have both our rectangles drawn
again and have the stroke around them
and then there's a clear rect method
being run right here so what that did
was it pretty much erased that part of
the canvas if you want to erase the
entire canvas you can just put the you
can access the CTX canvas dot width you
can put that value here and then put the
height here and what that does is it
clears the entire canvas watch see so
your shapes were drawn initially but
then they got erased so we'll leave that
back on 100/100 that way you can
actually see the effect of the clear
rect but usually this is used to clear
the entire canvas during animations or
for creating interactive erasers alright
so that is the three methods in
JavaScript that you can use on the CTX
object that create immediate rectangles
there's other ways to draw paths and
build paths that will become rectangles
that you can fill but these are the only
three methods for the CTX object that
create immediate rectangles all right so
that shows you how to set up your CTX
object and put all of your drawing
within a draw function that
uses the window dot onload event that
way you can keep all of your JavaScript
up in the head element of your document
and your JavaScript doesn't have to go
underneath your canvas element alright
that completes exercise number one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
