and all members of develop PHP I just
wanted to make a nice special
application for you guys one that you
guys have really been asking for for a
long time it's how to make you know one
of those liquid fluid websites that
repositions menus and certain elements
depending on how the user resizes the
browser you can see I'm an Internet
Explorer right now and I you can use
safari or firefox whatever you're in any
browser to work in and if you wanted
your elements to snap to the very
corners and not have any space there you
can just set the the margins and your
the output HTML file the open
Dreamweaver and set the margins 20 the
left right top and bottom and these
elements won't have any you won't see
any little spaces on the edges there but
they are set and I made them program
them to where they will stick to the
each corner and this little guy up here
is just a little sliver or a little
section and he is set to auto expand to
any width that the screen resolution
might be set to upon resize that's how
it works and I've heard a lot of names
for this like fluid liquid all kind of
crazy names but i think i'm going to
rename it right now and call it truefitt
truefitt flash website this is a true
fit any browser size any window size
website truefitt that's what we're going
to call it from now on truefitt flash
website hope you enjoy it and thanks for
subscribing and thanks for coming to the
site develop PHP and come and active in
the forums and all that stuff it's
really cool we're all a bunch of big
dorks i right
okay let's get right to it I'm working
in flash cs3 but you can be in flash cs4
I'm going to create new actionscript-3
project and now let's go down to the
size click that and make it to what I
think about the smallest monitors people
would be using on old systems that would
be viewing my site so I'm setting it to
8 x 6 and I've you at oops I've you at
14 x 9 1400 x 900 and there's some
monitors out there that are up to
sixteen sixteen hundred wide but this
will accommodate for all monitor sizes
but you really just want to set it to
the smallest that you think that people
would be accessing your site with and
don't worry about the large ones because
those will be those will be accounted
for with our the code that we use and
set the frame rate to 24 or something
that'll give good animations and press
ok and now go into your publish settings
and this is the most important part of
this that nobody ever tells anybody and
you go to match movie change it to
percent on the dimensions setting make
sure it's 100 by 100 press ok now in the
help file light I looked around for a
while and I didn't see where Adobe told
anybody about they show you the code for
for scaling your objects but they don't
show you how to to set your browser when
you press control enter it would work
when you export that way but when you
would set your when you resize the
browser it would never work because you
have to set that setting inside the
publish settings okay so now we have
let's create another layer and its name
one on top actionscript 3.0 the one on
the bottom
site elements and yours can be on
different layers you can put your
different elements on different layers
whatever you want to do i'm just going
to lump them all together in that one
layer for this example and already so i
have an 800 x 600 rectangle is my stage
size so first thing i'm going to do is
create a movie clip create all the
elements now that would be in my sight
my simulated site let's make this
rectangle just draw out a rectangle and
make it for 20 x 300 and maybe that's a
picture gallery or maybe that's a video
or maybe that's just your whole site
convert to a symbol movie clip and we'll
call it frame good Universal name but
whatever you want in it it's okay down
in the movie clip instance name we're
going to put frame now it has an
instance name on it we connect to it
with the code here that we're going to
put on the ActionScript 3 layer there
alrighty let's go inside make it look
kind of decent first let's give it a
gradient
give it a gradient fill and then
transform the gradient around
there we go that looks good and now just
to note this movie clip can be anywhere
you want and the mathematics the
equations will be placing it on stage so
you don't have to worry about where it
is really but I'm going to set it up to
where I would want it to look like when
it's rendered out in the browser but
realistically or for all practical
matters it could they could all be
lumped together in a corner but they
will all be placed in the correct place
when it comes render time
ok now I'm going to what I'm going in my
example I'm going to show you a few
really cool things that nobody ever
really goes into when they do this type
of tutorial for flash and scaling and
pull screen and all that and
accommodating for all monitor sizes and
all screen resolutions they failed to go
in-depth enough to show you really what
you need to know and I'm going to try to
and I'm also going to do a part 2 if you
guys want to see a part two just comment
rate the video hi comment say good
things about it you know give me give me
the will to go on and then I'll put out
a part to that will go more in depth if
you want show animations and all kind of
cool things when these things are being
repositioned on screen you can put tween
effects on them okay so let's call this
little rectangle let's put some text on
it it's called the say we had an mp3
player sitting there now yours would be
an actual mp3 player or whatever you
wanted there now I'm going to highlight
bolt right click them convert the symbol
just call it mp3 player in the library
movie clip ok now let's give it an
instance name of mp3 player now we can
connect to that in our code
put it right in the corner where we'd
want it to be but like I said these can
be all jumbled up in a corner together
or even way off of the black area there
but they'll they will land in the
correct places when it comes render time
alrighty now let's a couple more things
so we can really get maximize this
demonstration so you guys can get really
good understanding out of it because
I've seen I just went looked yesterday
online for these kind of tutorials about
full screen flash and scaling the
elements on your stage not scaling them
but moving them and positioning them
when you are let's transform this one or
user is resizing his window or if you
just want to have it to where any size
website or any size monitor your
elements reposition themselves to fit
nicely ok so let's make one more just
copy this one ctrl-c ctrl-v put this guy
up here
just put them at zero and
not so wide maybe it can be really slim
like 20 say 25 40 and let's say this you
want it to be a menu bar we're going to
make this thing through code expand the
whole width of the monitor resolution
the screen display size so let's right
click that one convert that to symbol
and let's name that say that was a menu
barb menu bar BG menu bar background and
it's given its name of menu bar BG now
we connected that in the code and you
see how I'm positioning my elements I'm
going to show you how to stick all of
these in these corners no matter how big
the browser window no matter how much
the user resizes the window while they
resize it these these items are going to
stick to each of their respective
corners and not flinch ok so let's this
is the last one convert to symbol movie
clip and let's name this one let's say
this was just a menu a menu bar so we'll
call it menu too ok and give this an
instance name and youtube now we can
connect to that one in the code they all
have instance names that's it now we can
code this puppy out let's see make sure
real quick before we do that and I go
into these movie clips and just put some
text in there with the rectangle I mean
more identifiable and let's call this
main section of this application it
sounds good
and let me get a little bigger
let's go ahead and put one in here to
text line saying just call this other
little menu may be yet another little
menu down there with buttons or
something make that little smaller a
little white hair right there beautimous
ok now we're ready to go let's do some
codeine press the highlight the actions
a passion script three-layer keyframe
one press f9 open the actions panel and
this is where we type our code in to
connect to the items on stage all right
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to have to set the variable for
the stage and they show you this in the
in the help file so if you look at your
help file you can find examples on how
to do some of this stuff say this dot
stage that's how we put the stage into a
variable and in the ActionScript help
file they they show a different method
they they refer to one of your state
stage objects right here instead of
claiming this and I don't know if I
agree with that or not I don't think I
do agree with that I think that's
not very necessary and might screw
things up for you say scale mode equals
and this is scale stage scale mode see
if it all turns green I'm good that's
all caps and yep okay this is dot no
scale if you have your code help on
you'll see these things come in and
you'll see all the little options you
can use in place of the ones that I'm
using here so it's good to have the code
syntax help on now we'll save my dots or
my stage that align will set the
alignment like I said all of this these
three lines are or similar lines it's in
the help file stage a line top top left
and there's other options you can pick
here too but I'm just going to say top
lip semicolon ok now the variable for
the stage is all set now all we need is
a function that's going to fire off
every time the user makes any resize of
the browser they can just drag it up and
down resize the browser and this all
these elements are going to stick I'm
going to make them stick to where they
are in each corner no matter how big the
resolution of the monitor accessing the
file is ok so let's set that function
and then old need is a listener and in
the function we're going to have lots of
mathematical equations let's save
function
let's just name it resize display
because that's what it's going to be
doing sort of and this is zip in colon
event
and it's going to be the resize event
that's what event that's going to be
referring to the listener we set up down
below you'll see in a little while okay
so now we have a nice nest set up i open
my curly brace and close my curly brace
here and now inside of the function is
where we code all of these things we
want to happen when the user resizes the
their browser window whether they're an
Internet Explorer Firefox Safari should
work in every single browser okay so
let's claim well first we're going to
claim a couple of variables and then
we're going to use those variables in
our mathematical equations to make the
things happen that we want so the first
one will be we want to find out this the
stages sighs upon when the user resizes
we have to find that number so we'll say
we'll call that swf width and this is
going to be an integer number equals
grab this here the stage object or the
stage variable
and say my stage that stage with now
this claim is that number into this
variable so this variable is actually
that number we're going to be using this
word in our mathematical equations but
it's actually a number k bar next one is
going to be swf height so actually we
can just take this whole line since this
one's going to be very similar and just
change this here the height h e IG HT HT
e IG HT now we have this w have height
and width we're going to need those
numbers inside of our equation let's go
down two lines now and type in bar and
this will be the variable the number of
the offset of the menu to this little
menu here we got to offset this we got
to offset this and the way we're going
to set up the code it won't matter how
big these objects are any object you
have sitting it that you want in this
corner no matter if it's this toll you
know 200 pixels high or as to all that's
what I have here it'll snap to the very
corner the way we're going to set up the
code same goes for this no matter how
big it is and the same goes for this and
that so we got to do some smart variable
set up in the beginning here so we can
have some mean awesome code so we'll
call this menu tools y position menu 2 y
position colon this is just number and
we'll say equals move that cursor swf
height so we gotta have the height here
let's grab that number or that value swf
height-
that menu to that little other menu menu
2 minus its height and that's how we do
the offset so no matter what the height
is on that little menu too it'll snap to
the corner bottom where it should be
it's beautiful thing now the next one is
going to be similar and this is going to
be for the MP our mp3 players y position
and this one will be just change the
name here to the mp3 players instance
name and this should say mp3 player or Y
position mp3 player y pose is equal to
the stage is height no matter what size
the user resized their window to minus
then be three players hide itself and
that's the offset for that one now we'll
need an offset for a couple more things
so we'll just take this and we're going
to get the x position now for the mp3
player and we didn't have to do a net x
position for the menu to this little guy
because it's exposition is just going to
be snapped to the left all the way to
the left over here so we don't have to
make its X move anywhere it's always
going to be in the right exposition we
just have to make it move up and down
correctly this one we have to make it
move up and down correctly and left and
right correctly so that's why we're
going to claim the x position here so we
say expose and this will be
width instead of height so we just
grabbed swf width up here replace it for
that one and this will be with and I
think that's correct it's good to me we
publish out we'll see if we have ever
seen okay now we're going to set a
variable it's going to be for the the
frame the main body section of our
application the main section at movie
clip so this will be frames why pose the
frames y position is a number and that's
going to be equal to similar to this one
here we'll set it up like that swf
height it should be frame there we go
now the next one is going to be very
similar and for this one we also have to
have the x and y because if i move it up
and down and back and forth side to side
so expose and this will be with and this
would also say with so we'll grab that
one put it here and I grab other ones by
double clicking them press ctrl-c and
double-click the target where I want to
replace press ctrl-v very easy okay so
frame accident I'm gonna start with
frame is pretty good
all right now we just need a few more
things almost done so frame dot why okay
so really now we're going to start
setting up making the frame first I'm
going to set up to make this frame be in
the correct position then we'll do the
mathematical equations for all these
other items and this one remember I said
we're going to make this stretch its
width it's going to stretch to be to
fill the whole area you'll see what I
mean okay so let's work on the frame
first we'll say frame stop y position is
going to be equal to this frame dot y
pose and then we're going to say / 2 and
this is the centering code when you say
/ to there it's going to Center it and
it already has its offset the frame why
pose here made it our offset so we know
is right in the center now let's just
take that go one more down and say frame
the x
this will be the Expos and that's that
very easy now I'm going to take the menu
bar and move it to where it needs to go
every time the window is resized so menu
bar BG is our instance name for the the
object we want to stretch on top to span
the whole width of the user's screen so
we'll say menu bar BG width almost
forgot that equals the swf with it's
very simple equation there now the next
one is going to be the menu to the
little other menu the little guy at the
left corner bottom so menu 2 dot y
position and all we gotta do is move
this little guy up and down remember so
we just say menu y pose right there take
that one put it here and just a couple
more left for the mp3 player mp3 player
that will do the y position x position
for that one dot y equals y position and
remember we already have our offsets
made up here and the next one very
similar
p 3 player exposition so we make this
expose I think that's it that's all that
needs to be inside of your resized
displayed function so every time the
window hey let's go ahead and put it in
our event listener now very important
part here so we'll grab the the my stage
variable here will say my stage that add
event listener this is event dot resize
a lot of times when you make it
listeners there four buttons but this is
for the resize event sometimes you make
you know click roll over and roll out
this is very similar but it's for the
resize event put a function name in
their clothes off the parentheses and
the semicolon now I do believe we have a
working application folks event that
resize resides display resize display
let's see if we have an ever free code
now let's press f12 to render it in the
browser and not control enter and it
looks like let's see what happens
there it is
so the bar on top stretches I don't like
the way it's acting though let's see if
we can change
let's make this thing wider maybe about
200 now let's press f12 see what it
looks like hot it's better now it looks
like a bar it's like I wanted okay so
let's get this thing here where it fits
in you can see it okay so that's my
screen let's say that was maxed out and
I grabbed the corners let's see i'd say
i resize up you can see everything
staying where it should snap to the
edges and if you wanted to have this in
the very very edge you just go into your
HTML file after its rendered out you set
the CSS the margins 20 it's very easy to
do and like i said i'm going to be doing
a part two to this if you want to see a
part two you can just write this comment
real good and give me the enthusiasm i
need to set up the part two and i'll do
it for you show you how to animate all
these things as you resize them look how
nice that is huh so as you resize as the
user resizes or no matter what monitor
size the user is using to view your
application it's always going to be set
up right so somebody on eight 800 x 600
might see it like like we set it up on
stage and then somebody with a larger
monitor like mine which would see it
like that and it's really cool
everything just stays where it should
and so with these examples which is
further than I've seen anybody else go
with this kind of stage tutorial in
flash you can have all the elements you
want stay exactly where you want them to
stay and if you wanted things to get
bigger on resize that's easy to do as
well okay so like I said if you want a
part two to see how it's between these
things on resize instead of just making
it snap to it'll tween it make it fly to
that
new coordinates okay see you guys next
