tutorial we learn how to program the UI
loader component bring in a dynamic
image and monitor its load progress
percentage let me show you what I mean
let's press control enter export the
file see the load percentage BAM okay
let's click create new ActionScript 3
file and I'm in cs4 but you can be
working in flash cs3 and all of this
will be exactly the same so the first
thing we want to do is grab a text tool
make sure in the properties panel its
dynamic text and it's set the way we
like so let's slap it on stage there
drag it out to make it a little longer
let's check the properties and give it a
status underscore txt instance name so
now we give it an instance name of
status underscored txt now we can refer
to this text field in our code to give
us status of what's going on or to show
the status of what's going on ok now I'm
gonna set the properties of the size of
my file to about 680 by 500 okay now I'm
gonna drag out the from the components
library the UI loader component so now
we have an instance of the UI loader
component and in our library you can see
now we have component assets and that UI
loader now let's just give this an
instance name of UI loader
okay now we can save this file it's
gonna file save as
I'm gonna make a new folder on my
desktop for it let's call it a s3 UI
loader component
now inside of that actually let's grab
that name that's what we'll name the
file this flash cs4 document which you
can also save as a cs3 document if you
needed to are saved
okay now in that folder let's make sure
we put an image so right here on my
desktop I have my image it's a JPEG so
it's my underscore image JPEG let's take
a look at it that's it right there
that's what I want to load in
dynamically into the UI loader so I'm
gonna put that in my new project folder
that I created here UI loader component
see there's my file let's pop that image
right in there okay so now we have the
image sitting right next to the file
okay so we want to load that into our
flash file dynamically so let's show you
the code for that now now I'll just keep
things organized I'm going to create a
new layer and a name layer one stage
elements things that are on stage
layer 2 I'm going to name a s3 short for
ActionScript 3
now let's highlight that ActionScript 3
keyframe there and press f9 now we're in
our actions panel flash cs4 we're going
to type in verse the variable that's
going to be the string variable for the
image coming in so you say my image
colon string equals
in between double quotes we're gonna put
my image that was the image we put in
that folder dot jpg okay so the next
line is going to be a URL request and
we're gonna use this string in the URL
request line it's making a variable of
request : URL request equals new URL
request
and now let's put this image string
right here right into the URL request
line now we're gonna set some properties
for the UI loader and we give an
instance name of UI loader
this property is scale content and I'm
going to talk to you more about this
animal experiment with it when we get
done with the code I'll show you what
this does this will say false
now you I'll order it's gonna need an
event listener or our complete handler
and our progress handler because we're
going to be able to monitor the progress
as the picture loads in give you a nice
little loading percentage indication so
let's say add event listener
and this is event dot complete comma and
let's name the function that's gonna
fire off complete handler okay
so when the image is loaded in all the
data for the image is loaded in and
ready for display that runs the complete
handler when it's all the progress is
loaded in now we're going to say UI
loader that add event listener let's
just grab that whole line we'll just
change it up for our needs here
this is gonna be progress event and
we're going to call this progress
Handler now what's going to happen is
we're going to be able to monitor the
progress
this has to be progress event here we're
going to monitor the progress of the
image the external image that's on our
server when to monitor the progress of
it loading into the UI loader so now we
just say UI loader dot load the request
the URL request right there
so that will effectively load the URL
requested image into the loader and now
let's see
we're going to create two functions we
need complete handler function and the
progress handler function so let's get
those in here on line 9
ok let's type in function you can grab
this function name here the progress
handler this is going to be event :
progress event
close the semi or close the parentheses
void open curly-brace and go down a
couple of lines and close the curly
brace now let's create another function
mist right below it this is going to be
for the complete handler so let's just
change the name of that function and
this is not gonna be a progress event
it's just gonna be a regular event let's
claim it as a regular event now here we
can add some things to the status text
field so when it's completely loaded in
it will say image is finished loading or
something like that equals let's say
image is loaded so when it's completely
loaded in and the progress has finished
listening and it knows it's all loaded
in it's going to snap to this complete
Handler and fire that off and it will
say image is loaded and at that point
you can do anything you want inside of
this function you don't have to write
something to a text field so I'm just
putting into text be able to show you a
good example of when things are happy or
what's happening when so here in this
line we're gonna type in or make the
status text field show the percentage
loaded
Colon's put a space now let's go beyond
this double quote here and let's type in
a plus sign now what we're gonna do is
we want to put the event dot target dot
percent loaded VT lowercase that's
uppercase there we go so what we're
doing is saying is putting into the
status text field so we can see what's
going on the words percent percentage
loaded and it's going to be monitoring
the percent loaded progress so you'll
see the text field rolling along in an
animated fashion showing the numbers
changing okay so what we have to do here
is round the math off so let's put this
we have to round the math off because
that would be some crazy decimal number
if we don't so let's claim math dot
round and that will effectively make a
large number or a decimal number rounded
it will round any number point okay so I
think that is it it looks good to me
everything is instance name alright
let's test let's press control enter and
there it is image is loaded and the
reason why we didn't see any load
percentage is because we're loading an
image that's on our local machine here
sitting in the same folder on my desktop
doesn't need to load it's already in my
system if I was loading from the web
which I'm gonna show you guys just a few
things that are handy to know about this
before we call it quits here but pretty
much the application is done and we're
loading in an image from our server into
our main flash file and load and
monitoring its load percentage
okay let's take a look at one of these
properties let's go back into our
actions panel see this property of false
let's turn that to true and see what
happens so scale content is now set to
true and you see a UI loader it's 100 by
100 now let's press control enter or f12
you can see the size our scroller is
physically on the stage will determine
oh that's not what I wanted to do we'll
determine the size of the let's just
change the properties here there we go
make it that wide and that high and now
you'll see it'll be just a little bit
larger now and it also centers it that
might be handy for some of you guys if
you want to let's go to the properties
again and make it almost as wide as the
whole file now you'll see my little
image will be centered okay it's
centered on stage as long as this is
about centered it's going to throw it
right in the middle of that so that
shows you how to access the the scale
mode true property of it that way you
can scale your images down if they're
too big when you're loading them into
your file no matter what size they are
they'll fit nice okay so now let's go
ahead and change that well actually no
let's just show you if you really must
or if you really want to see the load
percentage progress on your local
machine there's a way to do that you can
just go to Google type in flour
flowers whatever go to images and now
let's go to large extra-large and you
just click the image and then press stop
don't let it load all the way in well
first you got to get to the image going
so you don't let it load all the way in
and then you just grab that URL copy it
close the browser down go back into
flash cs4 change your string for the
where the image is refer referenced to
that image online now let's press
control enter and we'll actually see
some animated progress control enter
there it is beautiful huh bada bing bada
boom that's how it's done we'll see you
guys next lesson this flash source file
will be available at develop PHP com
and actually I'm going to turn it into a
flash cs3 file so the cs3 and cs4 users
can both get to it because it works in
cs3 and cs4 exactly the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
