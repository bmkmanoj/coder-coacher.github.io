actionscript 3 lesson that's suitable
for cs3 cs4 or cs5 will demonstrate
managing depth using the set child index
function in ActionScript 3 will also
demonstrate simplified tab interface at
the same time so this is what we end up
with very simple tab interface that
shows you how to manage your depth okay
the first thing I'm going to do is set
up three little sections here and each
one is going to be contained in its own
little movie clip so what I have a three
different colored rectangles these three
up top have a roundness set to them and
then there's three regular rectangles
here with no roundness that are going to
go attached to the respective colors
that match so let's take section three
let's put that text right in the middle
there somewhere and then let's take this
label and put it up top here okay so we
have section 3 this box is all set up
and ready to go so let's just move that
one into place make it line up right
there that looks good there we go
we can even give it an edge that will
match that let's just make that point 25
very skinny now I'm going to convert
this tab up top here to a button symbol
ok now send it back to the back since it
brought it to the front when I created
the symbol so I'm going to press ctrl
shift down arrow key it'll put it back
in the back now i'm going to highlight
all four of these items this one this
one and you can put any kind of
information or movie clips inside of
this section that you like and then any
kind of code can go within the movie
clip I'll show you what I mean click
that hold shift click that and while
holding shift still let's click all four
of those items that are going to get
contained in to that movie clip now i'm
going to right click convert to symbol
movie clip library i'll just name this
section three okay okay so section 3 is
all set up now if I double-click inside
of this movie clip let's give it an
instance name before we dig inside of it
instance name is section 3 underscore MC
since it's a movie clip now i'll
double-click inside of it you'll see
that it's just those four items in there
on layer 1 and i can make as many layers
in here as I like I can put any code
that I like in here say I wanted to
refer some dynamic external content I
can put all the code I need in here to
do that so let's go ahead and send this
one to the back back in the main scene
control shift down and I'm going to do
the same thing for these other two the
orange and the blue all right so now as
you can see I have section 1 which is
instance named section 1 underscore m
see in the properties panel here if I
click section 2 you see it says section
to underscore MC and then section 3
underscore MC all right now let's put in
some code let's rename this layer
sections and then this place a new layer
above it and the new layer let's call
that actionscript-3 the ActionScript 3
layer we're going to press f9 to open
the actions panel where we can type in
some code that's going to talk to these
three sections using the instance names
right now the first thing we want to do
is set a number variable for the top
position of the hierarchy so let's type
in VAR top position and this is going to
be you int because it's a round number
not decimal this dot num children and
using this you can get the number of
children that are on the stage which in
this case we have three we have a number
variable that's always going to be set
to read the number of children so in our
case this is saying 3-1 so this is
always going to be making a 2 but if you
happen to have 10 items on stage or
however many items you have that's the
number you want to put here but if you
want to keep it a little more universal
you can just use this num children and
that'll always get the exact number of
how many items you're dealing with in
the depth management ok so the next line
it's very simple we're just going to say
section 1 which is the instance name
section one MC dot adamant listener and
this is going to be a mouse event for
the mouse down when the user clicks
their mouths down
so this is mouse down actually this has
to be mouse event mousedown comma and
then the name of the function that you
want to fire up when that section is
mouse down close it all up we'll call
this section one up so let's grab that
control C let's make the function for
that really quick function section up
this is event colon mouse event type in
our void open the curly brace go down a
couple lines close the curly brace to
shut the function shut up shut the
function up now I all we have to do
inside of this is one little line will
say this that set child index inside of
the parentheses here we're going to have
two parameters the first one is the
object so that would be section one MC
and our second parameter is going to be
top position which in our case is always
the number two let's put a space there
okay now all we have to do is make two
more for the other two objects two more
listeners so let's make this say 3 and
then say to this says three this says
two and two more little functions
says section 2 section 2 section 3 and
section 3 now let's press ctrl enter so
you'll see what it gives us it's kind of
like a tabbed interface to where you can
really present a lot of data in a very
simple way and it also shows you how to
manage your depth okay so if you want to
get at this file its going to be
available free at develop PHP calm in
the flash tutorial section along with
all the other files you can download
free and dig around okay we'll see you
in the next lesson pi PI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
