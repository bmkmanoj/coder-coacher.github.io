ActionScript 3 lesson that's suitable
for cs3 cs4 or cs5 will demonstrate
managing depth using the set child index
function in ActionScript 3 and we'll
also demonstrate a simplified tab
interface at the same time so this is
what we end up with very simple tab
interface that shows you how to manage
your depth ok the first thing I'm going
to do is set up three little sections
here and each one is going to be
contained in its own little movie clip
so what I have are three different
colored rectangles these three up top I
have a roundness set to them and then
there's three regular rectangles here
with no roundness that are going to go
attached to the respective colors that
match so let's take section three let's
put that text right in the middle there
somewhere and then let's take this label
and put it up top here okay so we have
section three this box is all set up and
ready to go so let's just move that one
into place make it line up or right
there that looks good there we go
we can even give it an edge that'll
match that let's just make that 0.25
very skinny now I'm gonna convert this
tab up top here to a button symbol okay
now send it back to the back since it
brought it to the front when I created
the symbol so I'm gonna press control
shift down arrow key it'll put it back
in the back now I'm gonna highlight all
four of these items this one this one
and you can put any kind of information
or movie clips inside of this section
that you like and then any kind of code
can go within the movie clip I'll show
you what I mean let's click that hold
shift click that and while holding shift
still let's click all four of those
items that are going to get contained
into that movie clip now I'm going to
right click convert to symbol
movie clip library I'll just name this
section 3 okay okay so section 3 is all
set up now if I double click inside of
this movie clip let's give it an
instance name before we dig inside of it
instance name is section 3 underscore MC
since it's a movie clip now I'll double
click inside of it and you'll see that
it's just those four items in there on
layer 1 and I can make as many layers in
here as I like I can put any code that I
like in here say I wanted to refer some
dynamic external content I can put all
the code I need in here to do that so
let's go ahead and send this one to the
back back in the main scene control
shift down and I'm going to do the same
thing for these other two the orange and
the blue all right so now as you can see
I have section 1 which is instance named
section 1 underscore
see in the properties panel here if I
click section two you see it says
section to underscore MC and then
section three underscore MC all right
now let's put in some code let's rename
this layer sections and then let's place
a new layer above it and the new layer
let's call that ActionScript 3 the
ActionScript 3 layer we're going to
press f9 to open the actions panel where
we can type in some code it's going to
talk to these three sections using the
instance names right now the first thing
we want to do is set a number variable
for the top position of the hierarchy so
let's type in var top position and this
is going to be you int because it's a
round number not decimal this dot num
children and using this you can get the
number of children that are on the stage
which in this case we have 3 we have a
number variable that's always going to
be set to read the number of children so
in our case this is saying 3 minus 1 so
this is always going to be making a 2
but if you happen to have 10 items on
stage or however many items you have
that's the number you want to put here
but if you want to keep it a little more
universal you can just use this dot num
children and that'll always get the
exact number of how many items you're
dealing with in the depth management
okay so the next line it's very simple
we're just going to say section 1 which
is the instance name section 1 MC dot
add eventlistener and this is going to
be a mouse event for the mouse down when
the user clicks their mouse down so this
is mouse
down actually this has to be Mouse event
mouse down comma and then the name of
the function that you want to fire up
when that section is Mouse down close it
all up and we'll call this section one
up so let's grab that control C let's
make the function for that really quick
function section up this is event :
Mouse event type in our void open the
curly brace go down a couple of lines
close the curly brace to shut the
function shut up shut the function up
now I all we have to do inside of this
is one little line they'll say this that
set child index inside of the
parentheses here we're going to have two
parameters the first one is the object
so that would be section one MC and our
second parameter is going to be top
position which in our case is always a
number two let's put a space there okay
now all we have to do is make two more
for the other two objects two more
listeners so let's make this say three
and this a to this says three this says
two and two more little functions
it says section 2 section 2 section 3
and section 3 now let's press control
enter so you'll see what it gives us
it's kind of like a tab interface to
where you can really present a lot of
data in a very simple way and it also
shows you how to manage your depth ok so
if you want to get at this file it's
gonna be available free at develop PHP
calm in the flash tutorial section along
with all the other files you can
download free and dig around ok we'll
see you in the next lesson bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
