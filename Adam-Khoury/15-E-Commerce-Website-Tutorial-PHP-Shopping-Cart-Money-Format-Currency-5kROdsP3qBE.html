lesson we'll learn how to format
currency and numbers which are used in
many e-commerce type applications where
currency or decimal number formatting is
called for this is going to be a very
short video this came about because of a
forum thread that chain UK started to
develop PHP and he has a very good point
when you have zeros past the decimal
point in your numbers when you do
equations using PHP sometimes you lose
the visible display of those decimal
values so let me show you what I'm
talking about first in my database I'll
show you that I changed all of my prices
you can see exactly what my prices look
like in my database now now they around
the dollar numbers but they still hold a
decimal value with the two zeros but you
if you look at my cart you'll notice
where the problem comes in the unit
price looks just fine
so you don't even have to worry about
that but anytime PHP performs a math
equation on numbers you're going to lose
the decimal and whatever zeros you have
past the decimal unless you format it
correctly and the reason why I didn't
even notice it is because all of my
prices had were $4.99 but what you can
do to fix this because here in the total
you want to have 30 dollars look
correctly where it has a decimal and two
zeros behind it and same with the cart
total so here's how you take care of
that kind of problem you go into your
cart PHP and right here above the
dynamic table row assembly you pop in
these two lines of code just make sure
you set your currency type of your
country whatever your currency type is
there for your locale and then price
total gets run through the money format
function here and the first argument is
the type of formatting you want the
second argument is the actual number
that you want to run through it and you
can read more about this money format
function at php.net slash forward slash
manual I think it is php.net forward
slash manual and you'll find the PHP
manual there where they have all the
functions you can search for this one
money format and it'll show you all
about it so let's see what that does so
now let's remove the dollar
sign because we don't need that because
the money format function is going to
add it for us so right down here in
price total you can remove that dollar
sign all right so you see how it formats
correctly now and it adds our zeros
where it needs to now let's take care of
this cart total because we also need the
zeros there so you simply go back into
your file and right here outside of the
for each loop right down here where
we're formatting the cart total variable
right above that you can pop in these
two lines and we're pretty much just
running the same type thing on that cart
total variable make sure you remove that
dollar sign because the money format
function is going to add the dollar sign
for you and your zeros okay so there it
is so that'll help you keep a nicer
formatting for your numbers there now we
also have another function called number
format that we can use he went with a
number format function which is right
here actually let's go look at it here
at develop PHP and here's the URL to
this page especially with this second
example here this one right there that's
the one you'd want to use if you want to
retain your zeros but you want to have
more custom control over the way the
number is format so you have options
there you can use the money format or
the number format function to retain
your decimal and any zeros that trail it
alright so I hope that helps any of you
guys that happen to run into that
problem we'll see you in part 16</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
