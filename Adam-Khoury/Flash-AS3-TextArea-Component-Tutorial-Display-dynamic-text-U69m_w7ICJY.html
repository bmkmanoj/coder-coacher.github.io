we demonstrate how to use your text area
component from within your components
library here in two scenarios the first
scenario is gathering it in a form type
application or wherever you want to make
the text editable you can see if they
put a whole lot of text in it
automatically gives them that scroll bar
which is nice so they can see all the
content they're entering and the second
scenario is showing you if you happen to
be bringing text in from external
sources like XML or MySQL and PHP how to
render your HTML based text within a
text area or any text field for that
matter click create new flash
ActionScript 3 file and once inside
we're going to drag to text area
component instances out to the stage I'm
going to name give this one an instance
name of text area 1 this one text area 2
okay now they have instance names let's
resize these let's make them about 250
each 250 by 140
51:40 okay now they're both the same
size just get them right there next to
each other
all right now what we're going to do is
drag out move them up a little drag out
a dynamic sex field put that on stage as
well right about down it looks like we
can resize our stage a little bit this
demonstration doesn't need to be so high
maybe 300 perfect okay
now let's make sure this dynamic sex
field has an instance name to status on
the score txt now we have instance name
there there and there
now text field one we want to make an
editable text field like you would see
in a flash form or something like that
this one we're going to use as a display
field or a display area so what we can
do is name this first layer stage
elements and then the second layer that
we're going to create right now above it
we're going to rename that as3 for
ActionScript 3 okay so now let's
highlight our ActionScript 3 layer that
keyframe right there and press f9 open
the actions panel and the first thing is
we're going to create a string with HTML
text so let's name it that string with
HTML colon string is equal to let's put
this in between single quotes to have it
ranked render correctly let's pop in
that string and take a look at it you
can see it's a really long string there
and it has HTML inside of it
so you see the HTML text all mingled in
to that string now we're going to set
the text area number one that's editable
so people can type into it text area 1.8
a table and this is a property of the
text area equals true and now for the
content in that text area let's just
grab that instance name put it here and
let's put content in it dot text is
equal to
I can be edited spell it right edited
and sent in a form type application
period okay now this next section we're
going to deal with the text area too so
let's just grab that instance name
change it to two and let's just grab
that whole line actually text area one
editable false so now let's change this
the text area tool so now we've made
text area to editable false which means
no one will be able to type in it and
change the text that we're going to
display in it which is this string so
now we can display HTML text by claiming
text area two dot HTML text is equal to
our string here so let's just grab that
string bar pop it right in so that's
going to pop that string with HTML
mingled into it into this HTML defined
text area because we set the HTML text
property okay now the next line just two
or three more lines here we're going to
add an event listener so you guys can
know when someone is changing your text
or when they're entering into it field
maybe you want to do something and
there's a whole lot of events you can
listen for in the text area
you can research those in the help file
or online and this is going to be event
that change event so when somebody types
into that text area one we want to know
about it and maybe do something display
event now let's just write out that
function real quick and that's it and we
can see what we have function display
event and this is event : an event open
curly brace
and close the curly brace got my void
put in void
okay now within the function we're just
going to update that status text field
that we have sitting on stage status
underscore txt dot text is equal to this
event so we don't need that event
and let's make it display as a string
there
event to string that way it will display
as a string within that tank filled now
see what we get let's press control
enter
okay says I can be edited and sent in a
form type of application so let's see if
we type C we start typing it shows us
the event which is the change event and
what's cool about the this field is that
if they get many many lines down through
there they're putting in a whole lot of
text let's say it will just keep giving
them it will give them a scroll so they
can type in as much text as they like
and they can get to all of it and let's
see and then this one they cannot edit
which is using it as display of HTML
text and if you click these so it takes
you to the website
so that's how you can set HTML text
within your text area components and
also use the text area component in a
form input gathering type situation okay
we'll see you guys next lesson bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
