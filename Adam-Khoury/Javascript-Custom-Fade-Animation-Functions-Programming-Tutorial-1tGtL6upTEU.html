programming lesson and many that are
going to follow it you're going to learn
real animation programming in JavaScript
animations for HTML element fading and
sliding as well as html5 canvas tag
animation programming for the complex
stuff so all of this is to come and you
know the everybody just kind of booted
Flash out of the scene out of the
picture and I hate it I hate it just as
much as you guys do but I'm not going to
sit here and just do flash tutorials
forever when it's a dying technology and
you're you know happy you guys are to
blame because happy you guys you Apple
loving freaks who are like you're just
flash flash ducks but now you know you
know what now you have no replacement
tool and now you've got some douchebag
like me having to teach you raw
animation in JavaScript because you guys
keep using frameworks none of you want
to learn how to do raw animation it's a
simple time loop imma punch you people
in the face if you don't understand for
real what's going on man I'm getting
pissed off okay before we get started
with the programming let's take a look
at the finished product of what we're
going to be learning how to build within
this video tutorial you can see I titled
it fade in and out without rainworks
remove your training wheels and ride
your bike pilgrims
so if I click fade out you'll see what
happens I made the Box fade out and fade
in so you see and it works nice it
doesn't even get hung up even if it's in
mid fade so when you fade out I made it
I programmed it in such a way to where
and it fades out the box will disappear
and the space that the box was occupying
is removed from the page so you can
program it like that but I'll also show
you a way to alter your script in a very
easy way to make those boxes stay there
for instance if I wanted that space that
height to stay on the page but the box
are just fade out you can do that too
but I think it makes more sense when you
bait out to remove the box completely
okay that's rock and roll and for those
of you guys who are very new to
JavaScript I'm also going to show you
how to take your functions and put them
into an external javascript file and
link to it in the head tag that way you
can keep your HTML page nice and neat
and you'll have your external javascript
powering the page
and you'll have a very lean and
lightweight fade in and fade out
function set that you can use in all of
your projects in all of your pages by
simply applying that external javascript
file now before we apply those three
boxes to the page we're going to put in
a style element here into the head of
the document type text/css and then go
down a couple of lines and make sure you
close off that style tag you can see I'm
just starting with the bare bones of the
validating html5 document okay so before
we apply those three boxes actually I'm
going to not indent my tags that are in
my head element because in my head
element I don't like to indent my tags
but in my body I do indent my tags okay
so for the style what we're going to do
is we're going to target any dibs in the
page that have a class of content box so
if the div says class content box it's
going to be affected by all of the CSS
the CSS is very simple gives it a
background color of baby blue a width
300 pixels height 100 padding 12 so each
one of the boxes that I apply to my page
you're going to have that class content
box so they'll get that style okay so in
the body element I'm going to change
this h2 content to save a didn't fade
out without frameworks then I'm going to
apply a div I'll go down a couple of
lines and I'll open up a div element
give it an ID that's equal to div 1 then
we're going to give it that class of
content box so you can just copy that
class equals content box then we'll just
write in the content area for that div
content box and make sure we close that
div element we're going to want three of
those so let's just copy that while
we're at it and put one two three and
change this to say div to this to say
div three and the unique IDs are what
we're going to use to communicate to
these divs with JavaScript the class
that you see content box that's simply
for the CSS and the CSS has very little
to do with the programming that we're
going to be doing in JavaScript it's
really just the style the way the box
looks but the real guts of this
programming lesson is going to be these
JavaScript functions that we set up now
to make div one fade in and fade out we
got to put a couple of buttons up there
and really before I put this button
place these functions that are firing
off called fade in and fade out they can
happen anytime within your JavaScript it
doesn't have to be initiated by a button
it could be onload event of the page
when the page first loads you can fade
something in at any time in your
JavaScript you can do this but we're
just setting it up using buttons so you
guys have a nice example this we're
going to say on click so target the on
click event of this button when the user
presses it when a viral function called
fade-out open closed parenthesis and
then put single quote single quote in
there and in between your single quotes
you're going to target this div div 1
and then put the content section of that
button you can just type in fade out
make sure you close that button tag
alright so you can take that button and
duplicate it and you want to say fade in
for this button and you want to target
div 1 change this to say fade in and
you're all set with that now you can
just grab those two and you're going to
do the same thing for div 2 and 3 so
right above div 2 let's just target div
2 with the fade in and fade out
functions now you don't have to change
anything else then you paste it in
another time right here
OOP this has to say div 2 this F say tip
3 3 and that's uh that's the way you can
do it dynamically for all of your boxes
on the page and we'll set up the
function to be really smart so you can
make any boxes at any time even multiple
boxes simultaneously you can make fade
in and fade out using these function
sets now just to separate these boxes
with some other random HTML content I'll
go under the div 1 and I'm gonna put in
a little paragraph tag that's his
content that lives under my box and I'll
do that for all of those right under
each div
put it in the paragraph says content
under my box and I'll press ctrl s to
save my file and now all we have to do
is go up into the head and put a
JavaScript function
so first we'll open up the JavaScript
scripting element script type
text/javascript go down a couple of
lines make sure we close off this script
element so we need two functions here we
need function fade in open closed
parenthesis open curly brace and go down
a couple of lines and put
the closing curly brace so there's your
function nest all set up and ready to go
now down in the HTML we're sending in
one parameter each time any of these
buttons or one argument each time any of
these buttons are clicked and the
argument is going to be which is the div
that you want to target for fading in or
fading out so you have to relay that to
this function in the parentheses here
and we're just going to call it element
so that'll be a variable name that
refers to either div 1 dev 2 or jib 3 on
the page depending on which one is being
commanded or fade in or fade out now
before those functions actually execute
when the page loads we want the page to
have two variables in JavaScript ready
to go the first one is going to be
called bar fade in from and the second
one is variable fade out from you can
see fade in from has a value of zero and
fade out from has a value of 10 and I'm
going to be explaining to you the
opacity settings in CSS that we're going
to be targeting and how the numeric
values work for the opacity okay in the
fade in function the first thing we want
to do is target the element so we're
going to make a variable called target
which is equal to document I'd get
element by ID element so if it's the div
1 or div 2 or div 3 being commanded to
fade in or fade out that will be loaded
into this variable called target so we
can easily refer to it within the rest
of our code here now you want to make
sure every time the box is faded in that
you set its style to display equals
block and that will make sure that the
element is showing because it might have
been faded out or it might not be
showing by default when the page loads
and you want to make sure that you set
it to block so it does show we're also
going to animate it and it'll have it
it'll have an opacity setting of 0 and
it'll go all the way up to its highest
okay next we're going to create a
variable called new setting and that's
going to be new opacity setting in your
animation it's going to keep changing as
this function runs so we can access this
fade in from variable which is 0 by
default I'm going to say divided by 10
but keep in mind that this fade in from
value is going to change because we're
going to increment it each time that the
fade in function runs and this fade in
function runs as
long as it needs to to accomplish the
task and it all happens very very
quickly we're going to use a time loop
so really the base before I program
anymore
I want to convey to you that the the
basics for animating HTML elements
really is to take it from one CSS
property value to another so say if your
box had a width of 100 you want to
animate its width from 100 to 300 you
can animate it growing over those 200
pixels in the person watching the page
would see the box actually growing in
real time from 100 to 300 pixels if you
use a little time loop and that's what
I'm going to be showing you how to do so
you don't want to snap from opacity 0 to
full opacity right away when the button
is pressed you want to gradually fade it
in very quickly but using a little bit
of time duration so it doesn't happen
right away and you go through all the
values of the opacity from 0 to 1 so is
that making any sense so instead of
going from one value to another abruptly
you want to animate those properties
from one value to the next over a time
loop now after we get the new setting
because fade in from is going to be
constantly changing so we're constantly
going to have a new setting then we're
going to apply that to our target
element so we say target style dot
opacity is equal to new setting and
what's really cool about setting your
opacity in the JavaScript rather than
the CSS is that it works universally the
same this 1 line will work universally
the same in Internet Explorer Firefox
Chrome Safari and all the big-name
browsers that you want to test it in so
we don't need any work around it any
crap like that within this lesson now to
make fade in from constantly change each
time this loop runs we're going to say
fade in from plus plus and what that
means is basically fade in from is equal
to fade in from plus 1 so if you add a
little equation here that said fade in
from equal to fade in from plus 1 it
would equal the same thing as saying
fade in from plus plus
adds one to its current value and this
function fade in is going to be looped
on itself it's going to run over and
over and over we're going to set up our
loop timer so that's a variable called
loop timer and that represents the set
timeout method the settimeout method
gets two arguments the first argument is
the function that you want to run at
this time interval and this time
interval is the second parameter so this
time interval is actually this would be
50 milliseconds so every 50 milliseconds
which is much less than a second you're
going to run this fade in function it's
going to loop on itself and we just make
sure since fade in is requiring one
argument being passed to it which is the
target element you can just feed that
right back into itself basically you're
doing the same thing as you're doing
here but you're doing it up here and
you're doing it dynamically with the
element variable
okay so opacity for HTML elements ranges
from zero to one so if the element is at
opacity setting of zero it's invisible
nobody can see it if it has opacity of
one that means it's fully visible that
might not make sense to a lot of people
because you're used to 0 to 100 scale
maybe but this is zero to one scale and
you have values such as point one point
two point three and point four if you
wanted half opacity you can make it
point five that would make your element
half opaque or half transparent all
right so instead of 0 to 100 for opacity
settings in CSS we use zero to one and
some of you might be saying why are you
taking this fade in from value and
dividing it by ten here and that's
because when you apply the setting to
the target this new setting has to be
from zero to one it can only be really
in that range so it has to be zero or
point one point two all the way to one
it can't be higher than a one so you
have to divide that fade in from
variable by ten and that'll give you a
decimal number and I did that so you can
just normally increment things without
worrying about the decimals so you're
really using a zero to ten scale if it's
zero that means it's invisible if it's
ten that means it's fully visible and
we're using those variables to do the
incrementing each time the loop runs but
we're making a new setting by dividing
that variable by ten and applying that
new setting to the opacity all right so
I've explained everything that's going
on here in depth now let's just take
that whole function fade in and right
under it let's put fade out so I'm going
to collapse all the code invade in that
way we don't get confused
make this one fade out and everything is
going to be pretty much the same but
we're going to target this fade out from
variable instead of the fade in from
variable so we got to grab that one and
anywhere where it says fade in from you
want to change that to fade out from so
right here and right here and right
there
so those three places and then you
simply want to say fade out - - because
instead of going up we want to be going
down in the opacity settings on this one
to fade it out now this one's going to
be a little different with the styling
of the block we're going to take the
styling block out there because when
you're fading out your elements already
going to be on the page so you don't
have to specify display block in the
fade out function at that point
but what you do have to specify is you
have to change target style opacity
equals zero here to make sure it's fully
invisible when it gets down to the end
of its little animation and then you're
going to put that line here but change
this to none that way the element
actually goes away when it reaches zero
when the animation reaches zero and it
fades out you want the box to go away
you can apply this line of code if you
want the box area that it was occupying
on the page to remain you just comment
that line out and the real estate the
space will remain where the element was
but it'll still disappear but if you
want the actual space to collapse as
well you just leave that line active so
let's see fade in from that needs to be
fade out from okay so I said three times
it needs to be changed four times in
here fade out from there fade out from
there fade out from there and fade out
from there
to not say fade in from anymore okay and
you can remove that comment because it's
in the function above and I might have
to change something else it's very
possible that I need to change something
else here and actually yep I see right
there I need to change that to a zero
because you have to evaluate if fade out
from is equal to zero you know it's at
the end of the animation so that is when
you clear time out and you kill the
function all right now let's render this
in your favorite browser so I'm just
going to test it in chrome here and see
if I got the results that I wanted so I
click fade out that should go away okay
see I need to change something else here
ah right here it says fade out from
equals zero
oh that should be 10 that should be
reset to 10 so I think that was my issue
let's see press f12 laid out notice
something else
ah-ha-ha-ha this has fade in in the loop
timer that should say fade out now let's
see what we got and I'm going to leave
those mistakes in there
just to show you guys we screw up even a
little bit you know we got to go back
and say oh my code is not doing this I
got to make it do that you got to do
that a lot when you're programming
things alright so fade out and fade in
is working fine for that one let's see
if this one here you can see our boxes
are not collapsing they're keeping the
real estate so we got to fix that
sometimes I am a friggin idiot display
not dis leh I had that dis leh that
should say display now if you run it in
your browser fade out and it goes away
there you go that's the functionality
you want and it's very possible that
this one up here has display
now fade out fade in fade out fade in
and you can even do it in mid fade and
it will snap to the other function okay
so that's how it works it's all done and
you can test it in different browsers so
let's go ahead and do that so people
don't give me a hard time
previewing browser Internet Explorer
allow blocked content fade out fade in
fade out fade in fade out fade out fade
out okay and let's check it in Firefox
real quick fade out fade in fade out
fade out fade in fade in everything's
good
sorry about that I bet you guys when you
saw me say put the word dis lay there
you're probably laughing right I bet you
laughed at me it's not funny man
everybody makes mistakes I'm gonna laugh
at you next time you mess up but I got
my working application it was just
something that threw me off for about
three seconds so now let's teach you how
to externalize all of this code so let's
take all of the code
in the JavaScript only within the
JavaScript tag and press control X to
remove it and you can actually you can
take this closing part of the script tag
and collapse it up there next to the
opening part of the script tag and then
just add source equals and put the name
of the JavaScript file that we're going
to create right now so let's name it
fade effects dot J yes I'll press ctrl s
to save this file then you're going to
create a new document and depending on
which code editor that you use I use
Dreamweaver usually but depending on
which code editor you use is a different
process to creating files and you should
be very familiar with the processes for
your code editor I'm going to create a
JavaScript file I'm going to remove that
default data and put in all of my
JavaScript that I cut out of the other
file then I can press ctrl s to save
this file I'm going to save it in the
same folder that my webpage is in fade
effects press save and there you have
your fade effects jes file which is an
external file that houses your fade in
and fade out functions that you can then
just put this one line in and you can
apply it to all of your web pages so if
you have this one web page where you
have these three boxes you want to fade
in fade out you just apply this one line
but say you have a contact page with a
form on it when they press a button you
want something to fade in you can use
this same line and these functions will
be available to you within that page as
well make sure you link to your fade
effects j/s fundamentals are very much
the same for any CSS attributes that you
want to target so if we look in fade
effects right here we happen to be
targeting the opacity but you really you
could target anything you can target in
elements with its height you can target
its left top right and bottom properties
to make it slide around and move on the
page so you can move it from location 1
to location 2 over a time loop and it'll
actually animate to that position so
JavaScript animation is very simple and
it's not something we should all be
running two frameworks for just simple
basic animations I mean going to
frameworks for something that is ultra
ultra complex is sometimes needed but if
it says something as simple as fade in
or fade out animations you can really
set that up yourself as an external slim
lightweight file that will accomplish
those tasks for you and since you code
it yourself you can tweak all of these
numbers you can actually send in new
arguments if you wanted these functions
to take in a variable to whatever you
want to send in so a lot can be done
this can all be tweaked to perform
exactly the way you want it to and
actually it could be set up to perform
very dynamically all right so I'll have
this code available to develop PHP comm
where all of my tutorials are the code
will be right under the video where it
plays and I'll put the link to the
develop PHP page in the YouTube video
description all right so I just let's
see you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
