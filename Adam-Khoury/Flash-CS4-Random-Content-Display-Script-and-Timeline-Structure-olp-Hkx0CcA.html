cs4 tutorial brought to you by out of a
flash building this one I'm going to
show you how to make randomized dynamic
content display on your homepage or any
page on your flash website or in your
flash applications banners what have you
it's that way it doesn't seem stale and
so is changing for the visitors if they
happen to frequent your content then it
won't be so stale looking all the time
it will always be ever-changing and that
will be nice make you look more
intelligent ok so we showed in right
before this upload I uploaded a tutorial
for develop PHP not develop HP but PHP
and it is at developed PHP but it's PHP
and HTML based randomized dynamic
content tutorial just right before this
and I mentioned that I would show it for
flash actionscript 3 so here we are in
adobe flash cs4 professional let's
create new actionscript-3 file vot boys
ok so now what we'll do is go to now
let's just bring in a rectangle
rectangle primitive let's draw it right
there it's going to be our little handle
handles are handy i'm going to show you
why and a lot of you guys probably have
this problem you haven't figured out how
to make yourself handles yet for your
empty on frame 1 movie clips ok so let's
go ahead and right click that convert to
symbol movie clip let's call it my
random content and this can be anywhere
in your flash file let's make it
registration top left ok
now that little thing can be dragged
copied and pasted whatever into any
flash files that are ActionScript 3 so
let's double-click inside of that now
and let's build its timeline here let's
create a new layer
and this new layer we're going to name
by double-clicking that name it as3 for
actionscript-3 you create new layers by
hitting the little new layer thing thing
there now on that layer let's highlight
that frame and press f9 open the actions
panel and I'm going to pop in a little
code it's going to make it this happen
and there it is i'll explain that in a
moment sit tight and that's all it is
what is the four lines beautiful okay so
now what we'll do is this layer we're
going to double-click that name here and
name it handle now let me explain the
handle to you it's very handy thing when
you have a file like we're going to have
here that has no content on frame one
maybe your content starts on frame 2 or
somewhere down in the timeline other
than frame 1 maybe there's no content on
frame 1 and that's a common thing in
flash movie clips is to have no content
on frame 1 due to animations what you do
is create yourself a little handle just
a little rectangle give it its own
little layer and then once you're back
in the main timeline you'll see that
little handle is always there for you to
move grab identify where it is
double-click to get inside of it yada
yada yada it's very handy and a lot of
the times you have to go searching for a
little dot you know you can't even see
it until you highlight the dot or
highlight the layer it's very
frustrating sometimes so you make
yourself a little handle I just wanted
to take time to explain that because
it's a very handy thing when you work in
flash all right now we have our handle
we have our actionscript-3 let's make a
new layer above handle and let's call it
content this is my content layer and on
my content layer I'm going to have a
keyframe on frame too so let's make a
key frame frame too by pressing f6
highlight frame to f6 and we have a new
keyframe alright let's leave handle
frame one that's all we needed therefore
actionscript-3 can be just that one
frame that's fine too so our content
will build through here so on frame one
let's add some content and then we'll
show you how to change it up with that
random number script so it will always
be randomized when people every time
people refresh it or access the file it
will always have a different appearance
okay so let's start placing different
contents highlight that brain let's lock
the ActionScript layer and the handle
layer so we don't accidentally put
anything on those layers let's click
text tool and let's type in let's call
it flash as3
okie dokie make it not so big a little
bit smaller okay so let's pop it right
there center a line that's great static
text and it's important to note that on
each one of these layers you can run any
scripts that you like to bring in
dynamic content if you like but I'm just
going to show you how to place the
content in that will be randomized for
display but each keyframe here can have
different scripts brought in or call
content from different dynamic external
content if you want you can call that in
using scripts on each keyframe if you
like okay so those are text and let's
bring in a little picture here I have in
fireworks little icons and i'm going to
set up right here on the same layer ctrl
V so I press ctrl-c to copy from
fireworks ctrl v place it here in flash
cs4 it's going to import it as a movie
clip straight into the stage area any
day now I don't know man flash cs3 flies
flash cs4 is like slow very slow okay so
sometimes it is sometimes it flies too
all right so as movie clip in current
let's get all righty there we go
so this makes this thing not so big I'm
going to change the size of my file to
15 5402 maybe only 200 100 that's a
little too small maybe 300 150 okie
dokie alright so there's the image
there's the text now i'm going to create
a new keyframe on frame 3 by pressing f6
i'm going to change this content up
let's call this one dreamweaver and then
let's control x get that off of there
highlight it press ctrl x go in to grab
the dreamweaver icon control v that same
layer so now you can see your content
will be and you can make sure it's in
the same position if you like i'm not
going to worry too much about it so you
can see the content can be changing and
this little script is going to make it
pop around and jump around from
different key frames here that we assign
so i'm going to place more content in
there and then we'll wrap this thing up
okay so I have all of my content in
there and let's take a look at the
script first let's count the frames we
have all the way up to eight so that
means we have seven frames up content we
have fireworks after effects photoshop
soundbooth illustrator dreamweaver and
flash so seven frames is what we need to
randomize between so let's place that
right here there we go and now let's
press control enter see what happens
alright let's press ctrl enter again
it's dif e sound booth fireworks
Photoshop each time your file is opened
or accessed in a browser or somebody
refreshes it it'll show new content
never stale always new and it can be all
different types of content not themed
like- all themed out in the adobe
products here and if you want to have a
content layer that goes all the way
through like say you just go down to the
handle layer and press new layer here
put one above that and on that layer you
put your content let's call it my tools
a little bit smaller a little blacker
and bring it down there
my tools randomized
now let's press control enter control
enter you see my tools randomized stays
the whole time you can even get it off
of that frame one it doesn't need to be
there really or you can keep it there
okie dokie now let's take a look at the
script it's very easy first we put a
stop action because we don't want the
this movie clip to just play its
timeline or else it'll just keep
flipping through all that spastically so
we make it stop on frame 1 and then we
set a random number variable and this is
from I have a tutorial on creating a
random number generator with this one
line of code and that's what this does
so it'll go from one through say you
want it to be 50 this would make a
random number between 1 and 15 we want
between one and seven so what we do is
we attain a random number between one
and seven using this line of code and
then we fix the frame offset because
there's nothing on frame one so we don't
really want it snapping
and just a little FYI here I wanted to
pop in that you can not use this fixed
frame variable and just make this a two
works the same but I just wanted to lay
all the lines out so you see the logic
of what was happening behind what was
happening and instead of fixed frame we
go to random number so that way you can
have it working off with two lines a
little more slim saying it still works
just fine control enter control enter
it's going to be between two and eight
still
it make a new variable with this random
number that was attained here in this
line we make a new variable bite just
using addition on it and saying plus one
and that will make sure it is only
frames two through eight make sense good
because that's how it works so we have
seven frames of content we claim here in
this line and we make sure it's only two
through eight by adjusting and fixing
the frame offset so we say last line
very simply go to and stop fixed frame
and that will make it snap to whatever
random number frame and it won't be
outside of these bounds from frame to to
frame 8 it will never be frame nine and
on and will never be frame one okie
dokie press control enter control enter
always different sometimes it might be
the same if the same random number
happens to come up toys that's no biggie
and I'm actually running this a
developed PHP on my home page that
develop PHP here you can see it
performing right before your eyes right
here with this little guy every time you
refresh see says something new so I just
figured i would share and this file will
be free available for download okay
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
