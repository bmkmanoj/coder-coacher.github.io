JavaScript application programming video
lesson in this lesson you can learn some
really cool aspects of how JavaScript
can manipulate the attributes and
properties of your HTML elements and
you'll get a cool little application for
your website forms to make you look more
elite now working with javascript is a
really big part of making your HTML and
html5 a lot more dynamic and bring it to
life all right so here's the finished
product of what you'll be learning how
to create you'll have a password field
in your form just like normal and
somebody goes to type in their password
and then what we created was a show
password characters button you'll see
this in like some high-end software that
you'll use on your Windows or Mac
machine sometimes they'll let you see
the characters and then when you see the
characters the button changes and says
hide characters so you hide them and you
show up hide them and show them because
the person might be alone and they want
to see exactly what the password
characters they are typing in because
this might be confusing to some people
who knows ok you can just open a new
HTML file and we'll start with our HTML
so let's pop in the first line in the
first line you can see we just have the
word password Col in there and then we
have an input element that is set to
type password and it has an ID of you
pass and the name is user pass so this
ID you pass is how we're going to talk
to it through JavaScript we press ctrl s
and f12 we'll see that we have a
password field there that gives us the
normal little black dots now the goal is
to have a little button on the side so
let's put a little button now and then
we'll put in the JavaScript to make it
all tie together okay let's put the
button right under it so it's right off
to the right of it let's put this up
here where it belongs
okay this is another input and you can
see that this renders out a button so if
I press f12 you can see there's a button
there if I type in my characters it
doesn't do anything yet because I
haven't put any JavaScript on the page
this function call toggle password so
I'm going to put that function call
toggle password now so when this button
is clicked
there's functionality that happens that
affects both
these elements through JavaScript I'll
go right on top this first line and I'll
pop in my JavaScript opening and closing
tag now we need this function toggle
password to be created so let's go up
top here and type in function toggle
password open close parenthesis open
curly brace go down a couple lines close
off your curly brace you have a nice
function nest to code within now the
first thing inside of the function is we
want to target this ID of you pass and
this ID of toggle button that way we can
access those elements through their ID
so that's what these two lines do this
first line creates a variable called you
pass and that's equal to document I
could element by ID user pass or you
pass that's the ID of this element then
the same thing for the toggle button we
target this toggle button ID so now we
can effect those elements through
JavaScript more easily just by using
these little words here instead of this
whole line of document I get element by
ID
every time that we want to effect
something now under these two lines you
want to set up an else condition
statement so we'll type in if open close
parentheses open curly brace go down a
couple of lines close curly brace type
in else open curly brace and then go
down a couple lines close curly brace so
there you have an if-else condition
statement set up and ready to go what I
want to do is see if the user past so
I'm going to grab that user pass dot
type I can access the type attribute and
evaluate to see if it's equal to text
and then I can just put it a little note
here for myself to be sure that and by
default when it loads up it's going to
be type of password and you can do it
either way you want you can say if you
passed our type is equal to password
then you run code here if type is
password I'm just going to do it the
other way around it really doesn't even
matter all right now let's put a similar
line in here and we're ready to go let's
just change this to password so this
code will run here if the type is
password so really the first time around
this part of the if and else condition
statement will execute and then the
second time this part will
and then so on and so forth you'll see
what I mean actually I'll just change
that evaluation around so nobody gets
confused about what we're doing so if
you pass that type is equal to password
then we'll run that code here for that
evaluation and then the else will do the
opposite so the first thing we want to
do is type in you pass dot type and
we're going to change the type of that
field is equal to and we can just type
in between double quotes or single
quotes you can type in text so you're
going to change it from a password type
to a text type field and that way all of
the characters will show that we're all
little dots and the next line down you
also want to be sure that you target the
toggle buttons value property or the
value attribute right here so instead of
saying show password characters you want
it to say hide password characters to
make them security again the little
black dots so you have to have the
button change a little bit too if you
can have the field change up the button
has to change and you'll see why now we
can just take those two lines press ctrl
C and go down to the else condition
press control V and paste them in and
then change this to password and then
let's change this to the words show
again all right so this is the
evaluation if the user password type is
password when they click that little
button we're going to change the type to
text so they can see all the characters
that they're typing in and then we're
going to change the little toggle button
and say hide the characters again to
become little black dots again so while
its text and they can see all of their
characters clearly if they were to hit
hide password characters then this else
condition will run and then we'll have
user pass that type is going back to
password to secure it again and make the
little black dots okay so let's see if
we have a working application let's
press f12 and I'm going to type in my
password let that air show password
characters and there it goes so if I
type in Adam is door key today I can
hide and show those text characters so
by default when the user comes to your
form and they're filling in their
password they happen to be by themselves
somewhere they want to actually see the
characters that the typing in they can
just
Press show and then it shows the
characters and you see the button it
says hide it so when I press hide the
button turns to show again so the
buttons dynamic it feels dynamic and
everything is cool ok I hope you have
enjoyed that one and I'll have this
little script apoo available at develop
