part of the flash truefitt
actionscript-3 website where we
reposition elements according to the
sizes of the browser that the particular
user happens to be using to access the
file and even if they resize the browser
so look for part one and two of this
video so you can see it develop from
scratch and follow along okay so in part
three I told you we were going to add
buttery effects and it's exactly what
we're going to do so instead let's go
ahead and publish out and look at it so
instead of the items just kind of
snapping to and staying put in the
corners we're going to make it make the
items kind of float and have a more
buttery movements okay more fluid
movement alright so the first thing we
want to do is we want to replace how
this mp3 players will start with this
mp3 player here and what we're going to
do is in the code on frame to the resize
event inside the resize event function
we're going to make it instead of going
to the expositions and why positions
immediately will tween it so we won't be
using these two lines but we're using
some of these values so will comment
those out in just a second after we type
in our new line so here we're going to
set up the tween for the mp3 players
exposition and then we'll set it between
for the y position and then the other
ones for the the other little menu and
the main section of the app of this
application would be would have their
own tweens and I'll show you how to set
those up too but first we'll set up this
first one we'll take a look at it and
see if we like the the results so we'll
say this is a tween mp3 X because that's
what it's going to be doing it's going
to tween the mp3's exposition
and this is a tween and you can see up
top here I already put in the two lines
I added the two lines right here
whenever you want to use the between
events the basic between animations you
can put these two lines in to activate
them otherwise it'll throw whenever okay
so let's see now this is going to be a
new tween a tween and we'll open Brent
this is closed parenthesis put the
semicolon now in between these two
parentheses here we're going to set up
all the values that we need to put in
this place so first thing we have to put
there is the name of the mp3 player the
instance name so let's grab that put
that first in line so this this line is
looking this tween is looking for an
object then up plane which is going to
be the x-plane the exposition and then
it's also looking for these tight
elastic will use elastic see how it
looks and the elastic method would be
let's just try ease out see how that
looks and then you don't want that and
then after ease out we just put another
comma and then we have to claim the
mp3's current mp3 players current
exposition so we just grab this mp3
player X and that's the value that holds
the mp3's current exposition and then
next put another comma and now we want
to put the mp3 players new exposition so
we put this one here because remember we
gathered that where the new exposition
is supposed to be so we can just pop
that right in and then comma
and the duration which is kind of like
speed and i'm going to set mine to 1.2
if you set yours to say five it would go
a lot slower than mine that's how that
works and true to make it actually
happen if you put false there the the
elastic between wouldn't happen okay so
but the x positioning would still happen
so now we can go ahead and comment these
out and just set up the mp3 players new
Y position really quick by just going
place that with a small Y place this
with the small why replace this with a
big y and just with a big y and that's
and that's you have now if we test we
can see oh I got a comment out those two
lines and I already did okay so let's
test and you can see it has a nice
springy elastic II feel to it now rather
than you see the menu on the Left
snapped to the corner this one kind of
floats it has a little bit more life to
it a little more buttery so we'll set
them all like that now and see how it
looks
okay now we have those two lines in then
replace the original two lines we had
for the mp3 players movement we're just
going to cut those out and replace them
right here so we're not even adding any
loot new lines to make these transition
effects except really two up here we're
replacing those lines between effects
that we had originally okay so now let's
move the frame so we can comment this
out because we're not going to be moving
it with that method highlight these two
lines press enter here now we have two
lines ready for that and we're going to
call these truly a tween frame X and
this one is going to be tween frame y
and this one's going to be for the x and
y that's good we just have to have this
frame instance name here so we can copy
that put it there put it there put it
there put it there and now we need the
the frame expose / to that we had here
replaced it here and now the frame no
that's supposed to be expose let's grab
this one
expose and now put the Y pose / to hear
okay so I think that's everything frame
frame frame frame between frame yes yes
and see how it looks
I'll see that's buttery I told you it
was going to be buttery I promise butter
I deliver butter okay now all we need is
this little other menu to do it as well
and that wraps it up so that one's going
to be even easier because all we need is
one line to replace this one line so
let's take one of these y-position lines
because the exposition will not be
affected at all because that never moves
it's an exposition as always at one so
let's go to say menu to actually let's
grab this one instead grab this why
we'll just change it up a little too and
we can get rid of these frame lines that
we commented out okay so their menu bar
is still doing its stretched width
across the top we're not going to make
that one tween and let's see what do we
have here between menu to this is going
to be its grab menu to its instance name
put it right here it's going to be the Y
also put the instance name here to
access current y position and let's set
the new position which will be menu to Y
pose let's see what happens
everything is buttery yay better you
gotta like that so that's a little more
smooth so the frame the main section of
this application the mp3 player that
would be on the bottom the other little
menu all have nice transition effects
now so it's not cut a bounce it's so
cool you can't say it's not cool if you
do I'll come to your town and slap you
All Right see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
