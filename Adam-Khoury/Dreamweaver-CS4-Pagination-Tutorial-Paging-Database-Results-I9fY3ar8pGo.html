Adobe cs4 makes PHP and MySQL recordset
programming childsplay
and in the first tutorial that I gave
for Dreamweaver I showed you how to
connect to your site and your FTP that
way we can access all the built-in
database mechanisms and objects that
Dreamweaver cs4 can offer us so let's
see the first thing we'll do is click on
PHP and we're going to create a new PHP
file and save it into our site defined
folder so let's save as
here's that defined folder we made in
the last tutorial for our site that's
connected to the web and our server and
its name this tutorial list
simple
Cemil
tutorial this sample will save it there
now once it's saved there we can go to
see where are we
okay so once it's saved there we can go
to let's just stay in code view so we
can see what's gonna happen on the page
and if we're in design view it's nothing
right now okay so first thing we'll do
is click on record set and establish
what the record said is let's just name
it what it is the tutorial list my
tutorial list the connection is none and
there's nothing in the drop-down so
let's define one let's go to new and
connection name my tutorial list thing
now here you put your MySQL server your
username password and the database name
for connecting to your MySQL database if
you've connected to your MySQL database
before you'll have all this information
readily available if not your hosting
company can give it to you if at trial
if you have trouble finding it on your
own but usually it's it's easy to get to
once you create your database on the
server you can then get to this
information very easily so I'm going to
put mine in and then I'm going to test
ok I've got all my information in there
and before I test I'm going to take the
spaces that I put in out of the
connection name the very top field there
you take the spaces out of it in case it
causes any problems so now I'm going to
test
and there's the testing by elective 'ti
window there it is connection was made
successfully
that means Dreamweaver is connected to
my MySQL database and now I can use PHP
to interact with it so let's go ahead
and press ok and this one press done now
we have something in the drop down here
my tutorial listing it's gonna load it
in it's gonna grab all the tables that
are happen to be in that database and I
want this info table for the one that
has all of my tutorials listing and I'm
just gonna I'm gonna go where it says
columns I'm gonna hit the selected radio
button and I'm gonna select certain ones
like the ID category tutorial name and
other things do other things creation
date and
how many times it was viewed that's good
now let's go to filter let's leave that
as none and you can set up filters if
you like and sort I want to sort it by
ID ascending so they'll be listed in a
specific order this is how you can list
them by creation date or whatever you
want let's listen by ID that way we can
see what's going on exactly when we
check it out
now we press ok since all invalid
records set name no spaces see it
doesn't like that get rid of those
spaces for this record set name ok a
record set has been added to the page to
access the fields of the record set
please use the bindings panel okay now
you see this PHP and MySQL interactions
on your page now if you put this up on
the server you won't see anything
because look here in the body section
nothing is displaying on the page there
is no content in the body section there
so you go up to dynamic dynamic table
and here it is my tutorial list is
already fed into that show 10 at a time
that's great
and all it would do if we said ok right
now it's gonna make a table with a
border of 1 and cell padding for spacing
of 4 cell spacing a 4 so we press ok now
we have a table in there but there's not
going to be page a nation so in order to
get pagination or record set paging
results like google lists out 1 2 3 4 5
you know for all their page out results
and you go after you get your dynamic
table displaying in the page which is
sitting right here you can see it now
and then all of the data echoes in
dynamically so what we do is go to
record set
recordset my tutorial list now we're
adding page a nation which is record set
listings page doubt we're going to use
text you can choose images and I'm just
going to use text with example press ok
now I'm going to control and save it now
I'm gonna load it up to the web and
we'll see what happened and before I do
that let's just look at this code for a
second and discuss that I didn't code
not a stitch of this but I could very
well learn from it if I took the time to
try and understand what it's doing I
could learn from this and the way it's
structured out I looked at it already is
it's pretty clean PHP and MySQL it's not
the the best I've ever seen or the most
secure but it's clean and you can you
can go further with securing it and
making it cleaner but for paging out
results and making pagination on the fly
with your with your actual database
results using a tool like Dreamweaver a
five-year-old could do it you saw I
didn't code anything so now I'm gonna
FTP using FileZilla you could use
Dreamweaver to FTP but I'm gonna use
FileZilla because I like the manual
control of the FTP here and I'm going to
put the tutorial list sample page dot
PHP up and you have to make sure that
you put your connections folder up which
was just created when we made this
record set functionality so now you have
a couple of PHP scripts inside of the
connections folder which need to be
present for this new file we just
created to run ok so now let's grab the
name of that new file so we can open it
in the web browser and take a look
I'm using Internet Explorer 8 yes I like
Internet Explorer always have okay so
let's go to flash building and let's put
the name of that page right there
tutorial list sample dot PHP
look at that isn't that beautiful so all
my tutorials coming out of the database
and what's cool is since we put in the
we use the record set paging option here
which is a little more options in there
if you want a toy around with them but
this gives you the general paged out
results and then if I click Next you see
it goes to the next page shows you all
new tutorials and then it gives you a
different pagination navigation here or
record set navigation you can go to the
very last page the very first page next
next next it's not the best pagination
I've ever seen and actually I custom
code as my own pagination which i think
is the smartest pagination in the world
because it gives you a little input box
to say which page you want to go to it
tells you how many pages there are and
then it says jump to page and it's a
little input box if you want to jump to
page 72 you type in 72 and jump boom I
don't know why Google doesn't do it like
that's kind of retarded that they don't
but hey you want to get to page 342 you
got to keep going to be but if it's
being clicked cook until you all get all
the way it's retarded okay so that
pretty much shows you how a
five-year-old a ten-year-old
realistically a ten-year-old can page
out their database results from data
that's in their live
MySQL databases on the web and that is
so true because you saw I didn't code a
single thing I hit a couple of buttons
and if you know how to read you got it
okay we'll see you next lesson
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
