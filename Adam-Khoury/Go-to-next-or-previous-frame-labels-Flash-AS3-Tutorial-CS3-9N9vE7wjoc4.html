another Flash cs3 professional tutorial
and I'm working in ActionScript 3 so
that means you can be working in
ActionScript 3 in flash cs4 and use
these same methods and everything ok so
this lesson shows a nifty custom method
for going to next and previous frame
labels I don't know if you know what
frame labels are let me show you it's
the little flags we can make our file
snap to certain sections or play certain
sections that we want to by giving them
frame labels that's what a frame label
is so this lesson shows a nifty method
for going to next and previous frame
labels automatically it's more advanced
than simply going from frame to frame in
succession which we all know how to do
using these methods here but these
methods won't suffice if our movie clips
timeline has the frame labels spaced
apart differently ok so what I did was I
used buttons to show you the programming
but yours doesn't have to be button
initiated maybe you need to do it during
some certain time or some certain
function if you have a timer event or
maybe you have a non interframe event
that you make this code fire off on you
can do it through there doesn't have to
be button initiated that's my whole
point there so what we have are a
previous button and the next button and
a pages movie clip and that's the only
three items on stage that are connected
to the ActionScript and really matter
the rest of this stuff is just for
reference for people who see the demo on
the page of develop PHP and I'm gonna
have these source files available free
you can download the whole source
package and also reference the code on
the page of develop PHP in the flash
section there okay so now let's explain
the code that ties everything together
and makes it as possible so if you have
no desire to know to want to know how to
make your file programmatically go to
next and previous frame labels
then this lesson would not be for you
just move along and go learn something
you want to learn how to do but more
some advanced people might be at the at
the point to where they need to know how
to do this so I wanted to lay it out now
inside the code we connect to these
three objects so let's look at the
instance name that has an instance name
of pages and that's the item with the
time line that we want to control and
here is a next button it has a pretty
instance name of next BTN and the
previous button has an instance name of
previs BTN now let's look at the code
okay so the first thing I did is I added
event listeners for those two buttons on
top so we can go from next to previous
frames and we add event listeners so
that way we can run a function when that
event fires off and what it is is a
click event so when the person clicks we
fire off this function and they click
this button we fire up this function so
let's talk about the first function that
gets fired off which is the go to next
frame label function so and this is the
go to previous frame label function so
inside of this function when it fires
off we claim a variable this variable is
the string which is the frame label that
we're currently on so if we're inside of
this pages movie clip say we're on
section 3 that variable is going to be
it's going to say SC t3 so we take that
that variable that we get to string
variable and then we create a string out
of it that is just the number we take
the SCT off and I cut it right out by
using the replace method here so you can
just take the SCT letters right off and
you're left with a number so that would
be the number that we're left with it
would say b3 for instance so say we're
left with the number 3 then we take that
number and we convert it into an actual
number because it's a string here so in
order to do mathematical equations on it
has to be an actual number so we convert
that string variable into a number so
say that number three if it happens to
be a three would be converted to an
actual number three in this line and
then we can run mathematical equations
on it now in this next section function
we have an if conditional you can see
that's not present in the previous
section function because it's not needed
and I'll tell you why in a second it is
needed in the next section function
because if we didn't have it it would
snap back to frame 1 and if you wanted
that kind of functionality you can just
remove this conditional and just run
these two lines default all the time but
what I did since we only have five
sections see there's only five sections
so in the code we don't want it to go
past section five so I say if the
current number that we attained here
happens to be less than five then we can
go to the next frame label if it's if
this condition is not met then it won't
run these two lines and that's exactly
what we want let me show you if I go all
the way and get to page five it doesn't
go back to page one or try to go to page
six or anything crazy like that but if
you wanted to go back Graham one or page
one frame label one then you would just
run these two lines by default every
time and it would it would loop and so I
put this function in so it doesn't loop
and inside or I put this conditional in
so it doesn't look and inside of that
conditional we say we get that current
number that we attained here and we add
one to it and we store that in a
variable number named next number then
we can just say pages which is our pages
movie clip d'argo to and stop or go to
and play section whatever it needs to be
so if that was a 3 that we attained here
this would be
made into a four right there and then
this would say pages that go to and stop
section four and that's how it works and
it's back into a string here they were
or seen as a string and it goes to that
frame label so that takes care of that
next sunk next section function right
there it's all done right here so in the
previous section function when that
fires off anytime we needed to or when
the user presses the previous section
button or the previous frame label they
want to get to the previous frame label
or we want to take them to the previous
frame label we run this code here and
there's no conditional here because you
can see by default when we go to say
we're on section five we go all the way
back to section one by default it
doesn't loop it just stops on one
because that's as far back as it can go
so what we do is we do the same logic
through these lines here with the only
difference is we say current number
instead of current number plus 1 we say
current number minus one that'll take us
to the previous frame label and that's
pretty much the only difference between
these five lines and these one two three
four five those five well exactly the
same except for this
plus and minus differentiating them and
then the previous num that has a
different name than the next number Abel
here but pretty much they do the same
exact thing one goes backwards one goes
forwards and that's how it works
and I've never seen this
method laid out kind of like it is I've
never seen it I you I've seen people
using the the the next frame method by
adding some ActionScript so they can
they I think they use an array and then
iterate through the array to go to the
frame labels but I think this method is
a lot easier actually a whole lot easier
ok so if you want to use it there you go
I know a lot of people wouldn't even
need to understand how to do this until
they get really deep into ActionScript
programming and making custom
applications ok I'll have all of these
source files available like I said at
the pages developed PHP in the flash
section and we'll see you guys next
