tutorial you're going to learn a better
way to add event listeners to your HTML
events HTML events are things like on
click or onmouseover on Mouse out
there's a whole giant list of form
events and now html5 introduces things
like drag events and events for the
audio and video tag for when videos and
audio are playing and things like that
and a lot of people know how to add
event listeners to their HTML tags or
rather add event attributes to their
HTML tags but this video will show you a
better way to do that we'll use
JavaScript ok first before we get
started let's check out the featured
dorky facts about this add event
listener method of setting up your event
handling on your HTML pages now the
first fact is it keeps your HTML slimmer
by completely separating the script part
and event handling and even applying the
event attribute to the tag it keeps that
separate from the actual HTML in in very
much the same way that CSS keeps your
styling separate so we'll show you how
to keep your scripting completely
separate now add event listener method
is the optimum way to add event
listeners to HTML elements in the Dom
the document object model as described
by the w3c it works on any Dom element
not just HTML elements and it allows
adding more than one handler for a
particular event and it also has finer
tuned control over the phase when the
listener becomes activated before we
show you how to do with the new way it's
only appropriate that we show you the
old ways that you're used to doing it in
case maybe you use that method you might
want to drop that method for a better
method a more recommended method by the
people who create these methods now the
first and simplest way to do it let's
say let's create a button element so
let's give the button an ID that's equal
to value of my BTN let's close that tag
off and as the value will same I beat my
button so if we press f12 that gives us
this in the browser
you'll notice that nothing at all
happens when I click it put my mouse
over it or anything like that except for
the visual change on the you know how it
lights up blue but nothing else happens
there's no script that's executing all
right so one of the old ways in the
easiest way was just go straight into
the tag and say on click so you can take
the on click event or any of these other
events that you can place on it let's
say on click is equal to let's just put
a quick piece of JavaScript in here and
alert and we'll put between single
quotes hello world now if I run that in
the browser you'll see when I click the
button the script runs JavaScript and I
could make it do anything I wanted to do
okay so this what you see here is old
way number one you'll also see it
written out sometimes like this it'll
say JavaScript colon and then the
JavaScript functionality that you want
to happen but you don't even need that
JavaScript colon part but anyways this
is the old way to do it and there's also
another way to do it where you can
remove this on click here add the click
event through JavaScript so the first
part is window dot onload equals add
listeners so we need a function called
add listeners so let's write that right
now add listeners open curly brace go
down a couple of lines and close your
curly brace off you're going to make
sure we have open closed parentheses
there so when the page load when the Dom
is ready or when the window onload
function fires off here it's going to
execute a function called add listeners
that's going to happen right here you
see function add listeners now what I'm
showing you right here is old way number
two this isn't the new way yet but this
is leading up to the new way to do it
okay so this is another old way that
you'll see people doing it will say
document dot get element by ID then
they'll put the ID name of the element
there between single quotes or double
quotes we can grab it right there and
put it in and then dot on click
they're accessing the on-click property
for that element in the page and that
property is equal to a function open
closed parentheses open and close curly
brace and in between here is where you
can put whatever JavaScript that you
want to occur for that on click function
and I'll just type in alert and I'll
press ctrl s and run that in the browser
and now you can see that I tied the
event to the button without having to go
into the HTML and add the on click
attribute here of on click you see we
did it through JavaScript but still this
isn't the newer functionality where
you're using the add event listener okay
so that's that's like the old method
number two now we're going to show you
the new method of doing it which uses a
method called add event listeners okay
now here all I have to do is backtrack
just a little bit because I'm not going
to use that method we're going to use
the actual add event listener method
which is the more recommended method by
the people at w3c and everybody who's a
big giant dork online so just as before
when the window is loaded when the page
is loaded into the browser fully this
function called add listeners is going
to fire off and it's going to add the
event listeners for all the elements on
the page that you want to add listeners
for okay so the first thing you'll do is
you'll start off with an if and else
condition statement and that condition
will read if the window that add event
listener method is available for use
then we're going to execute code right
here in this line else if window dot
attach event is the only available
method for attaching an event for any
browsers that are older than Internet
Explorer 9 so for any versions of
Internet Explorer that are before
Internet Explorer 9 so previous to
Internet Explorer 9 you'll have to use
this other attach event method so that's
why I included it but for any browsers
Firefox Chrome Safari all the new
versions of the all the new browsers
even Internet Explorer 9 will use the
add event listener method and you
wouldn't have to use two different
methods but if you want to script this
to work for any
browsers like Internet Explorer 8 or any
before that you'll have to put this else
if condition statement but if you didn't
want to worry about those you could just
have that right there
actually you wouldn't need even need
that if condition either because the add
eventlistener method would work for all
browsers but by the meantime we're going
to leave that in because a lot of people
still use Internet Explorer 8 okay we're
going to use the document dot get
element by ID method again single quote
single quote close the parentheses and
break that statement with a semicolon
and that was my button instead of adding
the dot on click property like we did
before like that we're going to dot add
event listener and you can see that
there's three parameters or arguments
that you can supply to this method the
first is type and that is the type of
event you want to listen for like on
click on mouse over on Mouse out things
like that that's your type the listener
is going to be the name of the function
that you want to fire off the function
that you're going to write that's going
to execute when that event is triggered
and use capture it indicates whether the
user wishes to initiate capture or not
and that is usually set to false so
let's click that and then we'll add our
3c first it's asking for type so between
double quotes here I'm going to type in
and click I want the click event then
I'm going to put a comma and now it's
asking me for listener you can see there
I'm going to call it BTN one func
short for button one function and then
I'm going to put another comment you can
see it's asking me for the use capture
value now you can set that to true or
false now all we have to do is go under
the else condition here and let's type
in a comment say add your functions this
is where we're going to add our
functions I'll pop this one and it's
called button one function you can see
it matches that name here and what this
is going to do is just alert it's going
to fire off a JavaScript alert to show
you what the name of the button is and I
also showed you guys
to access the object using this syntax
so you can use this syntax to access the
object and you'll see that the name
what's the name of that button my BTN
it'll say my BTN colon mouse click make
script run ok so let's press ctrl s f12
to run it in the browser click it so you
see my button : mouse click make script
run so you see that this dot ID my
button ID is my BTN and that's how we
got that value to show up when we click
that of my BTN you see by accessing the
this syntax because this function knows
what object initiated it or triggered it
to execute because it's tied to it here
through this add event listener method
now if it happens to be a user who's
visiting your application using Internet
Explorer 8 anything before Internet
Explorer 9 you're going to want to run
this code right here let's change that
to my BTN there so use document I get
element by ID my BTN the attach event
method instead of the add event listener
method and that only gets two parameters
and you can see here that you have to
target on click instead of just click if
you're going to use attach event and you
can fire off that same function that
here that we wrote ok so let's try that
now yep everything's good
now adding more is very simple so say I
had another button right here next to
this button
that was my BTN too I can just go right
up here copy this line ctrl-c ctrl-v my
BTN to my BTN function to change that
name and then we'll make a new function
scrap that function call it
BTN to function and we're going to
change this one from click - let's try
mouse over so when we hover over it and
this one will say
hover event f12 so you can see when I
hovered over it I didn't even click the
hover event fired off and everything
triggered my JavaScript run this one I
have to actually click to fire off that
event now if I want to go in here and
add to the original button that we had
another event listener for the mouse
over or mouse out when the mouse leaves
the button and all of the other events
and I'll show you all of the events real
quick but pretty much that's it it's
just a more optimum method of adding
event listeners to your HTML and you can
see that it really Slim's down the HTML
you don't have all that on click in
JavaScript going on down in the HTML so
it's kind of like what CSS does by
separating the style and presentation
from the HTML markup this separates the
scripting the JavaScript from and the
event handling from the HTML markup so
it's a really helpful thing here and
let's make this a mouse-over which is
the hover mode instead of the mouse
click event for that button to function
because that is set for a mouse-over
event now if you go to develop PHP calm
you'll notice I'm working on an html5
training course I'm going to try and get
as complete as possible a training
course for html5 which I'm in the middle
of writing and I'm very busy I do a lot
of different types of things so it'll
take me a little while to get it all
assembled but you'll see I have a good
bit going on so far and if you click on
any one you'll notice that on the left
all of the other corresponding lessons
for the html5 course are on the left
here you can click on those directly but
the one I want to target right now is
html5 events you click on that one and
you can go down on that page and see all
the events you see on clickers right
there we use that one already but look
at all the other ones you have at your
disposal and you can see if I put new
html5 event attribute next to it you'll
know that's new for html5 and it won't
be ready until 2014 for full
standardized use but you can make use of
all
these other ones that don't have green
next to them today you can make use of
those in all browsers but as I mentioned
in the html5 introduction that 2014 is
the official release date that w3c is
claiming at this point they might push
that forward a little bit but we have to
wait until 2014 before we can expect
this to be a standard that's cross
browser compliant alright so there's
your html5 attributes list and you know
how to use the add event listener method
to add event listening to your HTML
elements and the script will be
available at develop PHP comm and I'll
just put a link to it right in the
description of the video underneath the
video there if you want to happen to
copy and paste the script that we built
during this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
