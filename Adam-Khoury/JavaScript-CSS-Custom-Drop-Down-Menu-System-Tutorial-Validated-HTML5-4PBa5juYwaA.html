explain a menu system and then share the
code with you guys first let's take a
look at the script in action so you can
see what it is before listening to me
ramble on for 42 hours it's the world of
web craft menu systems that spawned this
tutorial request from a good friend of
mine named Brendan who is teaching me
how to get hot chicks in return for me
teaching him web development stuff you
can see this is the forum topic right
here I'll show you he says he wants to
understand how to create the world of
web crafts menu system which is this one
right here so you can see as I go over
the menu items they fade out and fade in
and they're all kind of drop-down menus
that the show sub menu items under the
main link when you click it so it sounds
like he's getting a little confused in
his own experiment so we're going to
help them out with this little video in
script now let's take a quick look at
what the exact code that you will be
getting today produces this is the page
here you can see as I go over the menu
items they each fade in and out and they
give me a nice sub menu under the menu
item and this one is programmed to not
be a sub menu item that just goes to
direct to a page but these won't go
anywhere they won't navigate anywhere
when the user clicks them they'll just
open up a menu and actually they open
and close the menu so you can see the
user can just toggle it right there and
at the end of the video I'll show you
how to put some enhancements in to where
you can customize the way it X for
instance if you want to roll down into
the page and you want that menu to go
away right when you leave its boundaries
we're going to add some code for that so
I'll show you how to do that as well
that way you can tweak it out to your
liking and I'll also show you how to
Center those if you want to Center those
or maybe push them a little more this
way to the left so they're not so much
on the edge of their corresponding link
that opens them see what I'm saying and
I also threw in a little bonus of
showing how to blend the background of
that drop menu into the background of
your header that way things look a
little more blended for you if you want
and it's just simple JavaScript CSS and
HTML
okay here's the script that I produced
as the standalone example that you saw
right here now the first thing you're
going to need is if you want your menu
to have these nice little faded kinda in
and out fade effects you're going to
have to use either jQuery or you can use
my script that I use right here fade
effects jas which is just a more
efficient way to fade in and out you can
fade objects on your page in and out
using this lightweight script here which
works externally just like jQuery does
so if you look inside of your jQuery
file you'll see that it's much much much
much bigger than this so this is just a
slim lightweight way to fade things in
and out if you don't already apply
jQuery to your pages but if you already
applied jQuery to your pages it would
make sense if you want to keep jQuery
and play to just use your jQuery fade
methods if you're familiar with calling
jquery's fade methods and you can just
use jQuery instead of my file here but
if you'd like to do it exactly the way
I'm doing it you can just grab this fade
effects that j/s file and this right
here shows you how to apply it to the
script actually this code in the script
already shows you you're going to be
getting all of this code here okay so
basically the code from fade effects Jas
is going to be in your file here in this
document and we can use those functions
we can call fade in and fade out anytime
we need or like I said you can link to
jQuery right here you link to the jQuery
file and you can call its fade in and
fade out methods now you're going to see
in the script that there's extra things
in the page that I put in place that are
really not necessary to drive this menu
system but the other things are in place
to show you how to lay this menu system
anywhere you need to be so for instance
if you have a header so I put a header
in place I also put a logo div and my
logo div is this dashed blue line that
you see that's a div that holds the
company logo then right under it is
where I have the menu system div so to
understand this script fully you're
going to have to have basic knowledge of
CSS HTML and some JavaScript skills not
much
explain the JavaScript more than I'll
explain everything else but I'll start
with explaining the HTML then we'll
touch on the CSS and then I will explain
this JavaScript here let's take a look
inside the body element of the page all
of this content here that I have
highlighted first thing is I have a
comment that says start header then I
have another comment where the header
ends says end header that way you can
keep track of where things are in case
you have a lot of menu items within your
header and then under that we just have
a div that holds everything else on the
page so I just called it rest of page so
it has an ID of rest of page and let's
open that you can look at the HTML it's
just an h2 heading and a paragraph
element you can have all kind of crap in
there that would be like the rest your
page wrapper for the rest of the page
that div okay so let's close that up now
let's take a quick look at the HTML
within the header div you can see the
first thing we have that logo div
sitting in place right here above
everything else and it opens and closes
right there in that line then we have
another comment for ourselves it says
start the menu system and then when the
menu system ends you put a comment in
this's end menu system you can see that
div that contains all the things within
the menu system is called header menu
system and it has a nice long name just
because I wanted to make it clearly
identifiable to you you can shorten that
up after you figure things out and
within the header menu system which is
sitting under the company logo I'll show
you again here's the company logo div
that has the blue dashed line around it
and then under that is the four items
within the navigation menu so you have
your header menu system which is that
navigation menu and here's your four
items that are within it now the first
three have IVs of container 1 container
2 and container 3 the last one doesn't
need an ID because it's not going to
render a drop-down that just goes
directly to you can make that go
directly to contact PHP or HTML whatever
you working with so that's just a direct
link you see my contact link that would
just go straight to the contact page and
render no drop down like these do now
I'll show you the in
now I'll just show you what's going on
inside of container one here and
container two and container three its
content is exactly the same pretty much
except it has different IDs so it has an
ID of drop menu one if we open up
container two you can see that has ID of
drop menu two but it's all pretty much
the same exact code and the same HTML
structure within each of those
containers so let's look what is exactly
in container 1 the first thing we have
in container 1 here is that link that
says services let's take a look
that's this blue link right here and
remember these containers container 1 2
3 and even this one here are all set to
float we're using CSS to do that we're
floating them left that way they sit
right next to each other because if you
didn't float them left they would sit
underneath one another they would layer
down the page like a normal block
element div would but using float left
we can make them like inline elements so
they'll sit together horizontally up top
there okay so after that blue link
you'll have a div called drop menu one
and that is actually this drop menu here
and these three items within it you can
see my three little link items within it
just three simple links we give each one
of these little drop menus that you see
here an ID that way we can correctly
communicate to these drop menus through
the JavaScript and we can also style
them up using CSS and we can just use a
class to style them all the same or you
can style them independently with the
CSS as well because they also have
unique IDs so we're putting that to use
in our CSS so the way the drop menu
comes into play is that this services
link has an on Mouse down event which is
like similar to on click but I just made
the on click event be equal to return
false that way it does nothing and we're
giving it a pound sign as the href that
way it doesn't navigate anywhere we give
it the on click so it doesn't show the
little pound sign in their address bar
when they click this link what would
happen is a little pound sign
will show up in their address bar when
they click that link if you don't put on
click return false then all you have to
do is onmousedown you run the drop menu
function for this drop menu 1 right here
and this is a javascript function that
is up in the javascript code here in the
head of the document and i'm going to
explain that drop menu function and
that's really the magic behind
everything is that drop menu function
okay so you see the inner workings of
each div ID container one two and three
like i said they all have the same
structure within them but they just have
different IDs for their corresponding
place in the menu and that's all of the
HTML in the document now i'm going to
skim over the CSS very quickly because
if you don't know CSS you really should
learn some CSS before trying to adapt a
menu system like this into your pages if
you want it to be two hat if you want it
to look any different than mine you're
going to want to know some CSS okay
that's all I'm saying but I'm going to
explain the CSS I have in place a little
bit this div my header that targets the
div ID of my header right here that's in
the HTML so anything that's within this
affects that div these properties affect
the div ID of logo which is this dashed
box up top inside of the header you can
see there's its dashed border right
there and its height its height is
really what determines where this menu
is going to be placed vertically on the
page so you can see our four menu items
are just really stacked right underneath
that logo div now the next thing is the
header menu system div and that's the
div that contains these four items
altogether so that's the parent element
for those four links you can see it's
just set to margin left 16 so it's not
so much next to the end of the page here
on the left then you target the header
menu system div that contains all four
of the menu items target div within that
means you're targeting the child divs
within
that main div and each one is set to
float:left and have a margin of 20
pixels on the right and left and zero
pixels on the top and bottom so that's
how we're getting a little bit of
spacing here you can see there's 40
pixels between each one of these because
they have a margin left and right of 20
pixels each now the next thing is the
drop menus this is the styling for the
drop menus drop menus are these actual
little guides that pop out here on the
page the little magic menus so you can
clearly see all of the display settings
and all the different various CSS
properties that I have it play within
that if you don't understand these
properties fully as you skim through
them here and look at them then you
would want to research them in-depth at
that point and then that's how you learn
everything now these have a top position
of 100 that affects exactly where it is
on the page in its vertical position all
three of these little menus I'll show
you what I mean let's just change that
to 120 and you'll see what it does let's
go back to the page refresh it and then
hit one of those items you see it pushed
it down 20 pixels so you just leave that
at the exact pixel placement that you
want it and then you get a seamless look
now I'm not even going to bother
explaining the rest of those you can go
ahead and research them if you fail to
understand what they do now the drop
menus child a tags so that means all of
the little links within each one of
these drop menus you see the three links
in this menu there's three links in this
menu and there's three links in this
menu each one of those links are a tags
those little buttons are a elements link
HTML elements and you can see they're
set to block that way they take up a
whole display block within the little
div and it's not just a little word that
has only the clickable length of the
word you have the whole clickable length
of the block okay so you know what this
rule applies to all of these lines they
apply to those little links now this
just applies to the hover state of those
links you can see when I hover over
those they change white white
background they change to a blue border
instead of the black you can also
actually change the color of the links
to be blue if you want when you hover
over it let's do that let's go ahead and
change the color of the actual words to
be a bright blue like that now when we
refresh the page you see now when we
hover over them they're still black four
little words in there let's refresh the
page now you see we have nice blue words
when we hover over now I put these three
rules in place that way we can specify a
left position for these menu items to
get them off of the edge of the little
clickable item that initiates them you
might not want them straight on to the
left edge of those you might want them
pushed in a little bit this way you can
actually send to them and this is the
styling for the day of rest of page
which we're going to make the rest of
page we're going to show you some
additions to this script to where when
you hover off of this little menu item
right when my mouse leaves that little
div that holds those three links will
make that div go away if you want to
have that kind of functionality on your
page and you can make it to where when
you hover off it goes away or you can
make it stay there and then when
somebody clicks so tries to interact
with something down in your page then
you can make it go away so there's a lot
of different things you can target and
you can make it behave in a lot of
different ways okay finally we're going
to take a quick look at the JavaScript
that's in place and then we'll tweak the
menu out to add the different
functionality that I was talking about
let's open that up and you can see is
not much at all at play the first line
is we set up a little menu array and I
just named it MA for short it stands for
menu array and that holds the three
values that correspond to the IDS of
your menu items your little drop menus
those three names correspond to those
three drop menus if you have five drop
menus you just put them all in there
separated by commas now we're doing this
so we have an easier way of handling the
fade in and fade away when you click on
certain ones you want to make sure
that if this menu is open for staff when
you click services then that one goes
away and service is open so that's why I
packed it into an array like that so we
can use a for-loop to take care of that
logic for us in just a few lines of code
and I'll explain that for loop right now
so here we have the drop menu function
that's the one that these links call
like right when I click locations here
boom that function fires off in
JavaScript that one too and that one
this one doesn't call that function so
it won't initiate it but this one and
this one and this one do and that's this
function right here drop menu and you
can see each drop down menu is
dynamically represented by this X
variable so this X argument is a
variable that we can use within our
little script here that will target each
respective div that is being called so
when this is clicked it's this little
drop down menu that is the target object
when this one's clicked it turns into
this being the target object so that's
what the X represents so when each one
of those main menu links are click to
open up a drop menu first thing we do is
run this for loop here which will run
over this menu array it will iterate
through each of the items within it so
you drop menu one two and three alright
so here's the logic of the for loop for
var menus in menu array and you can see
we have three menus in our menu array so
that establishes that this loop is going
to run three times then to access each
one of these menus as they run through
the loop all you have to do is this code
right here so you target the menu array
and then the respective menu inside of
it that's passing through the loop you
put that within your square brackets so
that holds the value of whichever one of
these menus is passing through that loop
this code right here so you can evaluate
it and say if that value is not equal to
X
then you're going to hide it you want to
make it display:none and you can also
run the fade-out so what that means is
when I click one of these links I don't
want the menu item that I'm clicking for
to not show I just want the other ones
to disappear so if any other ones are
open they disappear when I click on the
one that I want so that's how you get
that functionality is you just say if
the menu item passing through the loop
is not equal to the target menu item
that the person is clicking and you hide
it and that's what this code right here
does documents I get element by ID
whichever menu is passing through the
loop style display equals none if it's
not equal to the target menu item that
the person is clicking on you want to
make it display:none and you can do that
through this for loop for as many menu
items as you want
now the last little bit of logic that we
have to explain is this simple if and
else condition statement and that's the
end of the script right there so we say
if document that get element by ID and
the dynamic drop menu either drop menu
one two or three style display is equal
to block then we're going to fade it out
else we're going to fade it in
now this little if condition gives you
the toggle functionality for instance
let's say we first come to the page and
the user opens this link here for this
submenu you can just click it again and
it goes away so that's how you get that
toggle functionality within each one of
the individual links okay so if the
little submenu being requested if it's
style is already block and it's
displaying already then you want to fade
it out because the user has clicked this
link again to toggle it away
see that's how you get that
functionality else if it's not already
showing you want to fade it in so for
instance services drop down is not
already showing so we're going to fade
it in okay so that's the best I can
really explain the script okay now let's
go down into the HTML and I'll show you
a little something you can do to change
the behavior of things we're going to
add an on mouse-over event to this
rest of the page did and that's going to
be equal to a JavaScript function that
we can fire up when the mouse when the
users Mouse goes over that div anytime
it goes over that div what we're going
to do is we're going to run drop menu so
we already have the functionality in
place so let's utilize it one more time
right there run drop menu don't pass any
arguments through it now let's watch
what happens you can even put a style
here is my page doesn't have much
content your page would be much taller
much higher vertically because you would
have a lot of content on your page mine
just has two sentences so I'm going to
give it a height 500 pixels that's fair
now let's run the file let's refresh
this and it gives us that functionality
that I was talking about now watch when
I leave this menu system with my mouse
see it goes away you can set it up to
have animated effects if you want so
that gives you the functionality of when
your users Mouse leaves that menu system
you can make it go away
very easily and you can change this to
on Mouse down so if they happen to click
anything so what I'm talking about is if
you refresh you'll see if I leave the
menu system now the little drop down it
won't go away until like click and try
to interact with something on the page
you might want that kind of
functionality see it stays in place
until I try to interact with something
else okay so I'm going to leave it just
like it is here and this is the code
that you will get that corresponds with
this video tutorial and I'll have this
code under the video develop PHP just
like always with the rest okay guys that
about wraps it up and I don't want you
guys to think that having JavaScript as
opposed to CSS of pure CSS drop-down
menus is better but I'm just saying that
you can apply JavaScript if you want to
make make magic happen through
JavaScript if you want to use that
instead of all CSS it's fun to explore
the things that JavaScript can do
because javascript is going to become
more and more
necessary a tool view within all of your
applications</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
