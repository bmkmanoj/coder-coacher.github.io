building a basic membership system into
your website using PHP Mis QL here's the
files that you're going to have in the
download and since we covered in part
two we covered how to make a HTML header
as opposed to the flash header that we
had in member system advanced so a lot
of people wanted to know how to make a
HTML header for their communities or
their social networks part two showed
you how to do that it's going to be in
this source package so you'll be able to
get to every bit of the code and files
and these are all the files that you'll
see in the package now one thing I have
to mention that's really important is
this member files folder you have to
create a member files folder and that's
where each members folder gets placed
when they join you can see inside of
that folder there's the first joiners
pic number one but on this member files
folder you'll see my permissions are set
to zero seven seven five and inside each
folder is set to zero seven seven five
as well that will allow uploads into
that folder so when you download the
package all you have to do is open up
each one of these files and inspect them
I put code comments where I think that
it would be important to have code
comments within all the scripts so
you'll have a very basic membership
system that does not involve flash and
then what you can do is take this system
and expand it further by going through
the the web intersect the advanced
membership system that I created has
about thirty parts to it the only
difference between the two systems is
this one has a an HTML header and
another reason why I made this system is
because a lot of people were having
trouble with the create table and
getting connected so in part two I
basically went over all the things that
were the most troublesome to people and
we changed them up a little bit to make
it a lot easier to understand so when
people have to
with those things they'll know why so
this system will just allow you to get
flash out of the mix in the header I
know lots and lots of people like the
flash editor and they use it for their
communities and their social networks
but some people request it to me that
they wanted an all HTML header and so
that's what we have here so you see I
can go to log in here it is live on the
server here's the login script I'm going
to log into my account that I created a
little dummy account and there's my
profile page now I have I have different
links up here because the HTML header is
sensing whether I'm logged in or not so
I can view my profile I can go to my
account see here's my account page where
I can change my settings I go to edit
information and there's an edit page so
my bio says hello world so now I say
goodbye world change it up you change
all those things submit changes your
account has been updated visitors will
now see the new info click here and see
it says goodbye and there you go you can
edit the picture so people will be able
to edit their picture and I left lots of
code comments in there for you guys you
have any questions before you ask
questions rather check out the code
comments because they might give a lot
of insight into what's going on and I
just wanted to mention real quick inside
of the member account page which is the
page where they edit their account right
here within that page I have I don't
have anything outputting on the page
that shows the differences but I did put
it in code
to where you say if the account type
from the database is a then you get
options for normal user if the account
type is B you get options for expert
user else the account type is C so they
get options for super user and all you
have to do is output whatever user
options you want down in the HTML
they're all kind of different elements
forms whatever kind of different
Edge's you want to give to people
according to what their user type is
their account type pretty much that's
the only differences between this and
the other system so if you want to take
this further all you have to do is go
into the next series which is the web
intersect or the advanced membership
system tutorial series and in that one
you can get code snippets out of that to
expand on this if you'd like but like I
said this one was mainly to get rid of
the flash header show how to do an all
HTML header and also get rid of all
those connection problems people were
having and create table script and all
that stuff that's all squished so we
shouldn't get too many more questions
about all that stuff and that's a good
thing a develop PHP we get lots of
questions about people not being able to
work with that flash header file lots of
questions about people having trouble
with creating the table through the
script so I showed in PHP myadmin how to
just go in there manually make the table
and in part two we fully tested
connecting to the script and I explained
it real in-depth okay so
meet me in part four if you'd like to
hear about security for your membership
website or your community or social
network if you want to hear a couple of
security tips and I'm going to mention a
few things that malicious users might
use to ruin your site if you give them
the chance too okay so we'll see you in
part four bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
