this exercise I want to inform everyone
that I've begun working on this server
sent event and I'm gonna make a whole
series of videos about server sent
events I just wanted to thank you guys
for all the feedback you gave me on that
first video so a server sent events
series is coming up next now in this
exercise you will learn to program
interactive keyframe animations meaning
that you allow the user to control the
animation in specific ways which can be
done through JavaScript event handling
we'll begin with the code that we had
from the ball bounce keyframe animation
tutorial let's go ahead and file preview
in Firefox so this animation just plays
by default when the page loads and it
never stops
now you're gonna slap your sister when
you see how easy this is to do we'll
just put a script element underneath the
ball or you can call this script in a
window onload event but if you want to
keep it simple at first just put the
script after the ball now there are tons
of events that you can access in
JavaScript for the document I'm just
going to access the click event for the
ball on this ball element and here's our
little function nest that's all set up
to handle the click event of the ball
now what I'm gonna do is just highlight
all of this syntax for the keyframe
animation and press control X then I'm
going to remove that property altogether
from the CSS that way this ball bounce
keyframe animation is not tied to this
ball element anymore through CSS we will
now tie it to the ball through
JavaScript in its click event so we'll
simply type in ball dot style dot
animation is equal to and in between
double quotes or single quotes we'll put
the string that's needed to make the
animation start now let's go to file
preview in browser Firefox and now I'm
going to click the ball you can see that
is what initial
the animation it starts the animation up
now let's say instead of the user
clicking the ball itself you want to
have some controls so let's just go
ahead and put in a button button but
done well they give the button an ID
equal to whatever we want let's say
start BTN and while we're at it let's go
ahead and put a stop
BTN anyway I'll show you guys how to
stop the animation with another control
now let's just go down here to our
JavaScript just take a start button ID
put it right there instead of the ball
so now this click event is added to this
start button and that will control the
animation now let's just type in the
word start and for this one stop now
let's go ahead and file preview in
browser Firefox start and you can see
that starts up the animation now let's
make this stop button work let's just go
ahead and take this whole add event
listener and function take the stop
button put it right here now the stop
button has a click event listener and
what you're going to do is just remove
the animation so you say ball dot style
that animation equals nothing so let's
go to file preview in browser Firefox
start the animation stop the animation
start the animation stop the animation
very very simple now it's very important
to keep in mind that JavaScript can
access all type of events in the
document not just click events there's
drag events and some mouse over events
Mouse out events there's progress events
there's Ajax events and there's all kind
of stuff so you don't have to limit
yourself to just clicking buttons you
know there's all types of events that
can initiate animations to run now as
you guys remember we've been saying it
all along that you have to use WebKit
prefix for keyframe animation still for
Google Chrome and Safari so let's just
type in
get and down here we'll put another line
in for the WebKit and we just
capitalized the a so that's what it
looks like in JavaScript and we'll do
the same thing for the stop now let's
check this in Google Chrome start stop
start stop okay
now in the future you won't have to add
these extra lines for the WebKit prefix
and honestly I don't know what's taking
Google Chrome so long it really
surprises me that they're the only
really popular browser that doesn't
respect the standardized syntax yet for
the animations it's weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
