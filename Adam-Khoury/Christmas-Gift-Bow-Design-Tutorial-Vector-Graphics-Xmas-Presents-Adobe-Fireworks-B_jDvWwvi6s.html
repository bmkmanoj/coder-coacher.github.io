finished product of which you'll be
learning how to create in this adobe
fireworks video tutorial okay I'm gonna
change my canvas from transparent to
white and then the first shape that I'm
gonna create it's gonna be with the pen
tool so I'm gonna grab my pen tool and
you can see my fill is this dark red
color right there I'm gonna start the
center I'm going to click down let go
I'm gonna go right across the screen and
if you want you can hold shift to make
it go straight across and then click
down let go and then make it go straight
down and on this one you're gonna bring
that little circle up to about the
middle of the line and then let go of
your ship that way you can make just a
little tiny bolt on that side then click
down on this dot hold your shift again
and you'll make a straight line across
then click down here let go and then
meet up right there click down and if
you didn't get a perfect meet up right
there maybe yours is like this that's
fine you can just hit your sub selection
tool and hit any of those that you want
okay now once you have that press ctrl-c
ctrl-v and horizontally flip it and we
can even actually let's bulge this out a
little bit more I'm gonna hit this edge
here with my sub selection tool and I'm
gonna bulge this out just a little bit
more right about there ctrl-c ctrl-v
flip it then I'm gonna join those two so
I can grab both of them but making a box
around them or I can highlight them and
hold shift as I select them to get them
together go to modify combine adds and
union okay with the regular pointer tool
let's go ahead and select this piece I'm
gonna change this solid fill to a
gradient of linear now let's just adjust
the linear gradient to add more lines in
there so what we'll do is let's make
this one dark red on top now let's go
right about here and we'll make this one
a little bit lighter
and then we'll just click down anywhere
in this area here and you'll get another
dark one you can move that this way then
click down here get another light one
and move it over this way so you see
what you get okay let's grab our pen
tool once again and I'll go into the
shape maybe about right here and I'll
click down and I'll let go and then I
want to be about at the middle of this
piece of ribbon so I'm gonna go right
about there with my mouse and then bring
it out to about this area here and then
click down hold and drag you can hold
your shift to make it a straight 90
degree line when you drag that way you
can get any kind of shape that you want
for your bow right there it looks good
to me so I'll let go and then I'll click
down on this point so it'll make a sharp
corner and then I'll hold shift as I go
across click down let go and then go up
to meet that point there and this will
give a fill of gradient linear as well
and we're gonna change the linear to go
this way like that and we'll just make
it both sides red for now we're gonna
change that gradient in a second to give
it some effects now let's take any line
or a border or edge that you have on it
and then highlight it press ctrl-c
ctrl-v and then flip the new copy
vertically so once you flip it
vertically then you bring it down to
meet the other half right in the middle
so you can highlight both of those
together and go to modify combine paths
and union so now it's just one piece
okay now you can take this piece press
control shift up arrow key to bring it
to front and then you just fit it in
there to make it look like it everything
is fit well now let's highlight this and
we're gonna give this gradient let you
change the gradient and somewhere near
the center maybe off to this side we're
gonna make this color will add a new
color just by clicking down in the gray
area here and then we'll
click the inside of that color and we'll
change it to this lighter red right here
and we should actually move this over
here something like that and you can
really have that anywhere you want it at
this point you might want to save your
work save your file whatever so you
don't lose your work
now let's highlight this shape press
ctrl-c ctrl-v to where you have place
another copy of it right on top of
itself and you can tell that by moving
it around but you really don't want to
move it around leave it in the exact
location that is now let's grab our pen
tool because we're gonna grab a shape
but we're gonna draw a shape that's
gonna punch out that new shape that we
just put on top to where there's just a
little bit of a join so let's click down
right about here and then let's go right
about here with our mouse click and hold
and drag until you get something that
looks like that you don't really want it
to on the left edge you don't really
want it to bulge out like that you
wanted to meet up kinda like that
but still have a little bit of curve on
that end okay so over here you can just
click down somewhere and click click
click click click and then meetup that
point right there then make sure you
give this a solid fill you can take off
that edge now what we're gonna do is
take this and that new shape modify
combine paths and punch so now you have
another shape sitting here so what we're
gonna do is adjust its linear gradient
so you grab its gradient let's move
these like that
let's adjust it like that and then we'll
move this to where there's only two and
then this one is light like this color
and the rest will make it even darker
than it is a little bit darker okay now
what you can do is adjust that
these points for instance I'm going to
move these points just those and I zoom
by hitting ctrl and mouse wheeling
that's how you can zoom in on those
points so I can take these two points
and move them down a little if I want
like that it's where it all meets up
better I can take this point move it in
a little bit like that and zoom in even
further and curve it better you see that
so you can play with all those points to
get it exactly the way you want it to
look and you can even move this thing up
a little bit and it'll expose like a
little bit of let me zoom in see when I
move it up from where it was it exposes
like a little lip which could look like
ribbon so you might want to have that
I'm gonna highlight this piece and hit
the sub selection tool and I want to
let's zoom in a little by holding ctrl
and mouse wheel and I want to make this
curve up a little bit more so I'll grab
this little pivot point right there or
that little stick and just make that
come up a little bit more maybe like
that
then I'll highlight those two items
press control-c control-v and flip them
horrible flip the new versions or the
new copies horizontally and this will
save you some work especially if you
have a symmetrical design that'll save
you some work now highlight these two
items by holding shift as you select
both of them together go to filters
shadow and glow and put an inner shadow
on them and let's make it come directly
from the top so 270 make that B 270 and
then make it go in further than 7 maybe
like that or whatever you feel is a good
amount and then take the opacity way
down not so much maybe right about there
I'm gonna highlight everything and I'll
move it around till it hits the center
line there when that dotted line shows
up I know I'm in the center and then I'm
gonna move it up a little bit that way I
have room to draw down in my canvas here
and we're gonna draw two ribbon ends and
they're gonna be symmetrical as well so
really all we have to draw is one and
then we'll flip it okay so grab your pen
tool and I have the solid dark red on my
fill and on my edge I'm gonna get that
dark red as well so that way I can see a
line as I'm drawing I'm gonna start
right about here I'm gonna click down
and bring my mouse to right about here
and Bend in just a little bit right
about like that then let go and then
bring my mouse down so right about there
where it looks like a taper is nice
click down let go and then bring my
mouse up to right about here click down
hold and drag just a little bit to bend
it just a little bit then once that's
bent just a little bit that line right
there and you click down on this point
to make a sharp corner point then you
come way down here click down and hold
just a little bit to drag and Bend that
line a little bit then click down at
that point to make a sharp corner point
then we want to go up to about right
here with our mouse when it clicked and
hold and drag and go way up to where we
get a taper at the bottom a little bit
and then we can just go all the way back
up like that then make those two edges
meet or close the shape and you'll get
your fill then we can take our edge away
remove the edge now I'm gonna get a
rectangle draw it out and I'm gonna cut
that so where it has a flat line on top
so I'll select both of those this one
and this one together modify combine
paths and punch I'll take this one and
put it right about there and then press
control shift down arrow key to send it
to the back now let's highlight it and
go to solid bill and change it to
gradient linear and let's move this dot
here and let's move this to there then
you play with your bars your linear bars
on the very top where is white right now
we want it to be very dark like this and
then we want more red to come in so
let's just grab let's just put a dot
right here by clicking down and then
let's get this bright red right there
and I want to taper this a little bit
more at the top so I'm gonna hit the sub
selection tool up here grab that point
right there and use my keyboard to move
it in a little bit
actually I should before I do that
highlight this one as well and move it
with it sort of like that and then grab
this one by itself here and move that
one in a little bit there we go now I'll
grab my regular pointer tool and I'm
gonna turn the whole thing so I'll grab
my scale tool and just turn it just a
little bit cause I wanted to lay right
about like that then once I have the
desired position I want I'll press
control C control V and then I have a
copy of it right on top of itself and
move it over a little and I'll flip it
horizontally keep moving it over with my
arrow keys on my keyboard now I like
both of these together go down to
filters and let's go to shadow and glow
inner glow and we'll take this down too
to bring this up to about 8 and then
bring the opacity way down you don't
want it to be so strong but what that
will do is give them a little bit of
depth and it separates them up here
visibly a little bit better now what
we'll do is highlight this shape and by
holding shift we can highlight them all
together so let's hit 1 2 3 4 5 press
ctrl-g make a group out of them now
highlight this shape this shape and now
this group so you have three objects
selected fireworks tells you right here
and you go to filters shadow and glow
now let's drop shadow we're going to
drop our shadow straight down to 70 so
we need an angle of 270 on that shadow
and we want to blur it a little bit more
and we don't want it to be so dark maybe
something like that now the red colors
on these are starting to bug me I'm
gonna have to change them to match these
better
try and make it match that bring this
down a little I wanted to lay the
shadows separately on these two items
and this item just because I wanted more
separation visibly between these two
pieces of ribbon at the top you see
right there where it meets you can see
it a little better if there's a little
bit of drop shadow there actually I'm
gonna make the drop shadow on all of
those just a little bit darker and maybe
not so spread something like that okay
now you can highlight everything and you
can group it now it's all one piece you
can set it to the side save that one
press ctrl-c ctrl-v now you can go ahead
and modify flatten as bitmap now once
it's a bitmap then you can resize it to
whatever size you're gonna display it as
in a greeting card or on the web or
whatever so no matter what size that
thing is it should look pretty good even
when it's really tiny like that alright
that about wraps it up and I'll see you
in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
