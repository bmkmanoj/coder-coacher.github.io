page P here and here we have the third
and final part of discover the magic of
dynamic XML PHP files which are PHP
extension type files that render out and
spit out perfect XML for all of your XML
driven applications and in this final
part part 3 we're going to create MySQL
database information XML files and if
you go to develop PHP you'll see I
already have a tutorial on how to do
this for RSS feeds which are XML based
and I have I've had this one here for a
long long time since 2008 since December
2008 I've been showing how to create
magic XML files but nobody's really
catching on yet so I'm gonna go way
in-depth here in this three-part series
which I've already done so far if you
check out part 1 &amp;amp; 2 you'll see what I'm
talking about now we have the last file
which is called dynamic MySQL XML dot
PHP and the only difference is from this
RSS dynamic XML tutorial I show I'm
taking out all of this RSS channel at
Tom crap from the code so nobody gets
over confused about what's going on here
and we're just going to simplify it for
database results so let's see what we
have here and you'll see that we started
off with the content type being listed
as text XML again that way the browser
or whatever application that's reading
this file knows that it's going to be an
XML file or XML structure then we start
the XML body variable we initialize that
with the aversion and encoding type then
we start the XML opening tag here so the
XML opening tag compounds into the XML
variable so this value won't overwrite
what's already here it will basically
just take this and put it on the tail
end of this it'll kind of append and
keep adding to this XML body variable if
you put the dot equal sign there that's
what the dot equal sign does if you have
just an equal sign right here it would
have
were written well you were already
established that was in the XML body so
you don't want to do that you want to
make sure it says dot equals so it
appends to that variable then we connect
to our MySQL database here you use your
database host name your database
username your database password and then
the actual database name right there so
you put in those four pieces of data
regarding your MySQL database and the
script will run for you then you make a
query that says SQL variable is equal to
MySQL query select all from my table you
put your table name here order by date
time that would be your date time field
listed here
descending limit 0 20 so it's limiting
it by 20 results so you'll only get 20
results from this query if you wanted
100 results you change that 20 to a
hundred it's very simple then we have a
while loop which if you're used to
working in MySQL and rendering out data
results you know how a while loop works
and all the data from those results all
20 results can be looped out of the
database and rendered or stacked into
other data display methods or whatever
here we're gonna stack it into a data
display method of the XML body variable
so before we set up that variable and
add these nodes and child nodes to it
we're gonna set local PHP variables for
the row data coming out of the database
so the ID the title the date time and
the description of that entry will all
come out into these variables here then
we can use them within our XML body so
the parent node is data and the child
nodes inside of that data node is data
ID data title data date and then data
description so this tag will be rendered
out 20 times to the XML file in a nice
magical sort of way then you simply
close your MySQL well you end the while
loop and then you close the MySQL
connection and then the XML body finally
gets one more piece appended to it which
is the closing XML to
after you render out all the nodes you
want to close up that XM the main XML
tag and then you just echo out XML body
when needed and that's pretty much how
it works and do it on fear I'm gonna
have each one of these scripts for
lessons 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 available for you guys
to just copy and paste I'm gonna have
the link to where you can go and grab
these all this scripting from develop
PHP I'm gonna put links in the YouTube
video description area I think the new
description area is right under the
videos now so under the videos you
expand the description and you'll see
there's a link there you click that link
and you go to develop PHP snatch up this
code and test it out on your server and
that completes discovering the magic of
dynamic XML PHP files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
