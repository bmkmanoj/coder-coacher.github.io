the global compositing properties
available for the canvas element through
JavaScript compositing deals with
setting global transparency asset
stacking and controlling how your assets
will interact with one another when they
overlap each other on your canvas okay
the first thing I'm going to do with my
canvas is add two rectangles one is
magenta ones blue ones at 20:20 the
others at 4040
X&amp;amp;Y positions and they're both 50 wide
by 50 high that renders this to the
canvas now the first property we're
going to look at is the global alpha so
say I go right in between those two
rectangles so I've drew the first
rectangle and now I'm going to set the
global alpha using the global alpha
property I'm going to set it to 0.5
which is 50% transparency
save that refresh you can see that the
blue one is now 50% transparent if I
want both of them to be 50% transparent
I just go up to the top before I draw
any rectangles and I set the global
transparency now they're both
transparent 50 percent so let's pop in a
little note to ourselves it says global
alpha is equal to 0.02 1.0 that's the
spectrum you can go between 0 and 1
using fractions so I'll put this on
point 7 refresh now we're going to
quickly discuss the global composite
operation so I'll go in between those
two rectangles and I'm going to set
global composite operation before I do
that let me put a note up top here and
this note shows all of the available
values that you can use for global
composite operation and you can see what
they are here source the top source in
source out source over which is the
default destination a top destination in
destination out destination over lighter
copy and soar now we'll quickly
visually inspect how all of those work
ok so I made my rectangles a little
bigger there now each 100 by 100 and I
put this one at a 50 X and 50 Y position
to move it down and over a little bit
now I'll put the global alpha back to a
full one that way it's full alpha now in
between those two rectangles you see how
we drew the first
tangle here to the canvas and then the
second one is drawn here in between
those two I'm going to set a global
composite operation so let's start with
source atop save and refresh now let's
do source in now source out now we'll do
source over which is the default so we
won't really see any effect
now destination the top now destination
in destination out destination over
which pretty much just puts the first
one on top of the second one so you can
see how the magenta rectangle is on top
of the blue one when it really should be
on the bottom as you can see if I
comment this out now it goes back to the
bottom where it should be and we have
lighter copy and soar and then you can
just play with your global transparency
either by putting it at the top or
putting it in between your assets like
we did for the global composite
operation so if you manipulate the
global alpha while you're going through
all of these different settings so these
values that you can use you'll see
different kinds of effects because the
two assets that are interacting with
each other would be opaque and that
completes compositing on the canvas
element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
