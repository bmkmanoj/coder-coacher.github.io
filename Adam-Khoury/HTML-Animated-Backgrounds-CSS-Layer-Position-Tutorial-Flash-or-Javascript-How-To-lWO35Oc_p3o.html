will demonstrate how to put animated
layers underneath your rich HTML content
on any of your web pages let's first
take a look at the finished product of
what you'll be able to create after
viewing this lesson we'll preview it in
Chrome and I checked in all the major
browsers and it works just fine
what we have is rich HTML content
sitting nicely on top of a nice animated
background as opposed to the normal CSS
background still images that you can
place underneath your content so what
you can do is replace the still
background for a nice animated one using
the simple method that I've developed
you can also use it for the whole
background of your web page if you
wanted your whole background to have
animated graphics you can easily do that
now it's very important to note that you
can use flash or you can use JavaScript
based animations in your animated layer
either one you choose is entirely up to
you another important thing I want to
point out is that HTML and flash can
communicate seamlessly using the
external interface class of actionscript
3.0 which enables two-way flash to
JavaScript communication so that if you
wanted to make HTML elements control or
instruct the animated flash layer that
sort of thing is also possible using
ActionScript re2 javascript
communication okay let's get this lesson
underway now before I explain this
animated box div have here I have an
identifier of anama box that's short for
animated box or animated container you
can see that div is all wrapped up right
here and that's the only thing I have in
the body tag just to keep the lesson
nice and simple
you know how to position your divs so
I'm going to let people know that if
you're new to web design this might
overwhelm you just a little bit but if
you're somebody that worked with the CSS
a little bit in HTML you feel right at
home it's not a big deal so first let's
closely inspect these HTML elements that
we have on the page these three divs so
I have the main div that really it wraps
all of the things that are within the
animated box so we have a div called
animal box and that's the identifier
right
year for it then we have another div
right here with an ID of bottom layer
and then we have another div right here
with an ID of top layer it's pretty
simple and inside I have the content all
collapsed up but this content in in both
of those boxes this one is the Flash
content which like I said you can have
JavaScript animated content within the
html5 canvas tag if you like okay so we
have the main div that's simply holding
these two divs now all we have to do is
explain the CSS to you now the first
little bit of CSS is for the animated
box container so we give that a
background color of black a width of 550
and a height of 200 now the reason why I
have those dimensions set because my
flash animation has a size of 550 by 200
so I just wanted to make my flash
animation the size that I needed for my
box so if this was a webpage background
a whole big giant web page background I
would probably make this 1600 wide or
maybe even 2,400 pixels wide but you
have to be careful a lot of people don't
have really high end computers and their
graphics card won't be able to handle
the processing of all the animation so
keep it nice and light and lean be
elegant and subtle and another very
important aspect if you're going to use
a flash animation is in your publish
settings in flash you want to make sure
in your HTML tab of your publish
settings that you have this set to
window mode transparent okay so that's a
pretty important aspect of the whole
thing but don't worry your HTML is going
to be on top of these animations but
it's still important to set your
background to transparent for your Flash
graphics okay so that explains to you
why I have a width of 550 and 200 set of
my animated box and a background of
black that background of black is what
supplies the black background to the
imagery because the flash background is
transparent now the bottom layer box has
a position of absolute and this one the
top layer box the div also has a
position of absolute and that way they
can both rest right on top of each other
and you just give the LM
that you want to be on the bottom layer
a z-index of one or you can give it a
z-index of a thousand but you just make
sure that this Z index for the top layer
is a higher value than this one so I
just made mine one for the bottom layer
and Z index of two for the top layer and
they both have a absolute position set
now the bottom layer you really don't
even need this width and height setting
if you're using flash because the flash
container is only it's only going to be
five fifty by two hundred won't be any
larger than that but I just put the
width and height in there too to show
you what's going on this is the bottom
layer which holds the flash animation
now let's move on to the top layer the
top layer has a padding set as well
inside of it and that's so all of my
content we go and look at it in the
browser my contents not all squeezed up
against the side of the box it's got
some room to breathe and then I just set
a color for my text with it with a nice
light blue that matched the animation a
little bit and then I set the width to
520 and the height to 170 and you'll
notice that the width they're not the
same as these guys because I have to
subtract 30 pixels from the width and
height since I set this padding of 15 if
you didn't set the width and height to
subtract the padding then your content
will extend out of the box or hit the
sides and you don't want that so you
just have to compensate for the padding
by subtracting the number of the padding
times 2 from the width and the height
because it's going to pad on all sides
left to right top and bottom so you want
it take 15 times 2 and subtract it from
these and that's it my friends I told
you it was very simple right let me wrap
this back up so that's the style that's
all the style that I have in play that's
all the CSS and you saw all of the HTML
right here I just have my object tag and
I got that from this file that flash
renders out you guys know that flash
renders out a file after you make an
animation or whatever it renders out a
file you can just go into that HTML file
it renders and grab the object tags and
it will also have the embed tag right
here within it okay let me call
up step back so you can see we have a
simple div that holds everything and you
can position that div anywhere on your
web page and then inside of it are the
important divs that hold the bottom and
top layer which bottom layer is your
animation your animated background top
layer is your rich HTML content which
you can see right there okay that's
everything guys I'll have all of this
code available at develop PHP comm and
I'll put a link for it in the
description of this video
just in case you couldn't read it in the
video or type it out you want to just
grab my code and just replicate the
application for yourself you'll like it
is pretty cool and like I said you can
use JavaScript animations with the html5
canvas tag or you can choose to use
flash whichever is your forte whichever
is your thing to have a more web
standardized animation it's JavaScript
but javascript is not so easy I don't
think it's going to be so easy to make
really cool smooth JavaScript animations
like anything that we can envision in
our mind we can just put down to
animation I don't think JavaScript is
going to be that easy for us until they
make Adobe edge a little bit better and
make it like a an authoring tool like
flashes to where you can easily make
JavaScript based animation so you know
you take a pick whatever you want I'm
not saying you have to use flash like I
did here use JavaScript if that's your
if that's your thing buddy all right now
let's just take a look and I'm going to
prove on video that it works in Safari
let's bring that over here so that's it
running in Safari and then we have it in
Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer
is going to ask you to allow the block
content if this is on your local machine
on the web it won't ask that it'll just
run nice and smooth for all your users
in Internet Explorer and then we can
file preview it in Firefox and you
already saw it in chrome so I won't do
that one again it looks smooth and all
of them and actually my video frame rate
will probably chop up that animation and
mangle it a little bit I'm telling you
it looks really really slick and smooth
buttery all right I'll see you guys in
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
