today that I could definitely handle
covering on video so I'm going to cater
to those requests today as i get time to
and in this first lesson we're going to
show how to customize the new YouTube
channel layout sort of like I have here
and there's a couple of key factors that
I'm gonna have to discuss before we do
that because you'll see here on a normal
channel you only get so much space so if
I go to edit channel on this channel you
see there's no extras here like the
partner channels but if I'm on my
partner channel and I go to edit channel
you'll see that I have a channel banner
setting and a couple of added perks
because I'm a partner but I think a lot
of you guys are YouTube partners as well
so you might have these options if
you're new to youtube or you don't have
the partnership yet then you're going to
have options like this which won't give
you more space up top and things like
that but you can still choose your
background and graphically customize
this whole thing out okay so that's what
we're going to show you how to do today
let's go okay so what we'll do is focus
on this type of channel that doesn't
give you the extra space on top because
that's probably the most common type of
YouTube channel so this video can
encompass a greater group you guys with
the partner channels like I have you
would just have to understand it's very
simple to graphically to understand that
you have 150 possible pixels that you
can push the whole layout down and put
your custom graphics up top you can also
put in an image map if you want to know
how to do the image map I think I
already made a video tutorial for that
let me check yep I found it here it is
this is the title of it and i made this
in 2009 so it's pretty old but it still
stands you can use the same kind of
procedure to create your image map for
your partner channel ok but like i said
we're going to focus on this type of
channel that way we can encompass the
greater group here on youtube and show
them how to do things but if you guys
are partners all you have to do is
understand that you have that 150 extra
pixels and you can put in the image map
all right let me just hit cancel and
actually to get a better contrast i'm
going to change my background to white
so change your background to white first
and then once that's chain
changed then you can press done editing
it will change your background to white
and then what we're going to do is we're
going to press print screen on our
keyboard it's the key that's next to
your f12 so just hit print screen and
open up fireworks and if you guys are
working in photoshop or illustrator or
gimp or any kind of graphics editing
tool the logic is going to be just about
the same but what we're going to show it
just won't be the same exact steps
because i'm working in but they'll be
fireworks okay but if you're working in
adobe fireworks you can do the same
exact steps I do but if you're in
another tool you can you can still
follow the logic okay so let's go with
maybe 1500 actually maybe not that much
1200 x 600 okay now i'm going to press
ctrl-v to paste in my print screen
clipboard item and then what i'm going
to do is grab or cut this part of the
graphics out so while this is selected
I'm going to go to the marquee what I
want to do is take just about like that
and i think the layout is 970 pixels
wide let's see if that's right to move
that over a bit and I think it's 970 so
I'm going to make sure I got a little
bit of the browser up top that top bar
at YouTube and then I want to make sure
I get this curved edge of the layout in
my cutting so I'm going to press ctrl C
now to copy that you can just press ctrl
D to deselect and then press ctrl V and
then hit your pointer tool and you'll
have your item there sorry ok now let's
control x on the main clipping that we
had now we can widen this out if you
want to have more horizontal space so
you can go to your canvas size let's
make that about 1600 because some of you
guys might really want to have flared
out graphics off to the side or whatever
you can see on mine that I have my
graphics pretty much straight up and
none off to the side but I can choose to
have graphics all over the sides if I
want as well as far and as wide as I
want it to be as long as the file size
is still small enough for the Youtube
upload mechanism
now what you want to do is make sure you
Center this thing so let's get it
centered just by dragging it around when
it hits the center mark you'll see a
dotted line letting you know you are
dead center in there so you can let it
go at that point and then drag it up and
if it's not 970 maybe it's 972 or
whatever will compensate for that but we
just want to get the general feel of the
area that we have to work around so
let's go ahead and see this gray bar for
the YouTube a logo in the top bar make
sure that's out of you just a little bit
actually make sure it's completely out
of view perfectly you don't even want a
little bit of that gray to be showing so
make sure you pixel hop it using your
arrow keys to where it's just out of
view you see what I did just out of view
right there okay now what I'm going to
do is zoom out a little bit by holding
ctrl and mouse wheeling and I'm going to
cut the part of the top off that I don't
want so i can just put a marquee a
rectangular marquee right there zoom in
to make sure it's in the right spot so
it 100% that looks all right to me so
i'm going to press ctrl x then now
you'll notice if i change my background
a black or any color you can't really
see that white area up there and that's
nice and you can even erase those little
tips so if you zoom in move this over
see those little tips you can get rid of
those by grabbing your eraser but let me
select this item first to grab my eraser
and then it all looks good to me I'm
going to go like that just erase it a
little bit so I can sense the curvature
of what I need to create to really sink
my graphics into the new layout I'm
gonna do the same to this site okay
that's good enough and then I'm going to
zoom out back to a hundred percent I'm
going to highlight that and go into my
layers and actually you can even know
it's a good thing to keep that fully
visible so let's go into the layers lock
that layer now you can't grab it you
can't mess with it at all it's locked in
stone you'll just want to delete it
after you get done doing your graphics
so
I'm going to direct you guys to wear a
lot of graphic tutorials graphics
editing and creation tutorials are for
fireworks the exact tool that I'm
working in here and I'm not going to sit
here on video doing a tedious process of
designing my whole channel because
actually people will just mimic the
design i create and that's no good you
want to make your own unique thing so
what I'm going to do is lead you right
now to hole God a whole mess a whole
bunch of fireworks tutorials for
creating all kinds of cool graphics you
go to develop PHP calm and you hit the
graphic design button here in the video
tutorials and look at all the fireworks
lessons I'm not going to waste my time
doing another design lesson when this
really isn't focused around design this
is focused around how to set up your
layout and get things looking to sink
right into your layout that's what this
tutorial is about I also have some
illustrator one photoshop tutorial I'm
not really big on using Photoshop that's
why I only have one but fireworks I
cover that probably better than most
anybody online working today ok that's
all I'm going to do to mine you can see
exactly what it looks like on both sides
and mine fades to black on all the edges
so you can see my bottom edge is all
black this edge is solid black and
there's a gradient set in the back see
if I move this gradient around you can
see what's going on ok now you don't
want your gradient to bleed off of the
sides or else it'll look funny if people
have really wide monitors ok so if
you're using ingredients like that make
sure everything fades to black on the
edges on the top it can be nice and
bright so now what I'm going to do is go
into the layers and I'm going to grab
that blocked layer and I'm going to
remove it so highlight that control x
and then the rest of the graphics is
what I'm going to explore it now so I'm
going to go to file export wizard
continue the web continued exit
i'm going to use JPEG i'm going to set
the quality up to about 85 and that
gives me a file at 66 kilobytes I want
to up the quality a little more it up
Stu kilobytes so I'm going to go about
85 I'm an export and on my desktop I'm
just going to name it youtube demo you
name it whatever you want and then press
save and then you go and look at your
desktop make sure it's there make sure
it's a JPEG and you'll be all ready to
go so we can preview this and that's
what it looks like and that's what I'm
gonna load up to YouTube right now all
right here i am i'm going to go to edit
channel and i'm going to change my
background to black because that's what
i have set for my design and then i'm
going to go to choose file also and i'm
going to go find that file youtube demo
and then the background options i'm
going to set no-repeat and it will
Center it for me automatically and then
I'll press done editing and there I am
you ate my soul with their basic youtube
account type with a nice custom
background whatever kind of graphics you
want to put back there and I don't know
who this person is I just ask somebody
if I could use their YouTube channel for
this demo and this guy is an idiot don't
subscribe to them okay so like I said on
the partner channels you'll have extra
space up top like I do you see this
extra space it'll let you put extra
graphics and it gives you the extra
added perk of abbot adding an image map
and what an image map does is lets you
set all kind of buttons you can put tons
of buttons up here to different pages
online or different websites or a lot of
different pages from your one website
you can put all bunch of buttons up
there that will lead people to different
things or you can make it clickable to
one thing mine just goes to the website
if you click anywhere up top there it'll
take you to develop PHP com that's the
way i have my image map set and my
background image that I have set here is
this graphics that you see here and the
image map is really
just click ability so if I wanted to add
a bunch of different little independent
buttons that's what the image map is war
and that other tutorial that i mentioned
earlier in the video is where you can
learn how to make all the little buttons
or whatever if you happen to have a
partner channel if you have a normal
youtube account or a new youtube account
you'll probably have this account type
so you'll be able to customize the way i
did here alright I hope some of you guys
found this helpful and we'll see you in
the very next tutorial where we're going
to be covering another user request</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
