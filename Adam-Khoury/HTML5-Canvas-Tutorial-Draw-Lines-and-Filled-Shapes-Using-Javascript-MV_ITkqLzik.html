canvas tag training series in this video
we will cover line drawing to accomplish
a real word task did I say that right
real-world tasks don't ruin it for
people don't put the homework assignment
completed code into the comment area at
YouTube and just so you guys have a good
visual reference in your mind I'm going
to show the logic of drawing custom
shapes custom filled shapes using lines
that we can plot and show the logic
first and give you a good visual in your
mind before we get into the code so you
really grasp what's going on so here I'm
in fireworks I'm just going to grab my
pen tool and these are the four methods
that we're going to be using these are
line methods we're going to be using
these within this tutorial and we use
begin path to start a new path we use
move to to plot the first point of that
path so we plot an x and y coordinate on
our canvas to start that path so to
simulate that I'm going to click here
with my pen tool then I use the line two
method and give it an x and y coordinate
to plot my next line point so let's say
I put it right here then I use line two
once again to put a point and a line
drawn here then I use line two once
again to put a line here then I can use
line two once again to put a line here
and you're just adding out the points as
you go now when you want to fill that
shape you don't really have to draw the
last line in to meet these two points
together to illustrate what would happen
when you use the fill method down here
and then that's what you get after you
start with move two you use line two to
plot out your lines of your shape and
then once you get to the last line you
don't really have to close the shape off
or anything you just use fill and that
will close the shape off for you okay
now that you understand what we're going
to be doing you get a good visual in
your mind let's translate all of this
logic into code okay now let's discuss
your assignment you're going to have to
draw the world of web crafts logo by
plotting lines and filled shapes into
your canvas tag now I'm going to be
teaching you how to get this far but I
want you on your own to get this far
okay we're continuing in the same file
we left off with in part 1 of this
series the only thing I did different
was I added the doctype tag that way it
runs in
going to explore as well ie 9 right
where it says begin drawing here is
where we had a rectangle that we drew in
yesterday just as an example so now
let's start plotting these lines first
I'm going to use the begin path method
on the CTX object now I'm going to plot
my first point of my custom shape so I
use the Move to method and I set an
x-coordinate of 100 and a y-coordinate
of 50 so my first point will be plotted
at 100 X 50 Y now I'm going to use the
line 2 method in order to create my
first line by plotting my second point
which is going to be at 130 X and 100 Y
now we're going to use line 2 again to
start off where that last line ended and
we're going to make this one have an
x-coordinate of 70 and a y-coordinate of
100 now since we're not signifying or
claiming a stroke with this path you
won't see anything if you run this right
now until you put in the fill method now
if I was to save this file and run it in
Chrome I see a nice triangle there
that's the beginning of the logo now
where we set the fill let's go down a
couple of lines and I'm going to begin a
new path and I'm going to use move two
and line two again to make another shape
and you can see that this shape is using
line two method more because it has more
points than just three points this shape
is going to have 5 points 1 2 3 4 5 and
then it fills itself and all I did was I
set my coordinates correctly to make it
create this am i running in chrome you
see so you can plot out any shapes that
you need using pixel perfect placement
on all of your plotted points for your
line now let me put in some code
comments here for you this one says draw
filled shape 1 the center triangle of
logo this comment says draw filled shape
to the left flap of the logo and here
underneath those two I'm going to put
another comment in this is your homework
is to draw filled shape number 3
it's the right flap of the logo and that
will complete the shape of the world of
web crafts comm logo and you doing that
having to plot out these points and fill
your shape will give you a nice little
hands-on exercise just so you get good
with plotting out your lines now you see
where I put in CTX fill what if I was to
change that to stroke I use the stroke
method instead of the fill method let's
run that you see what happens
it made my triangle but only with a
stroke and that really lets you see that
there was only two lines drawn even
though we plotted out three points but
the fact that we used the fill method
instead of stroke what it did was it
just closed our shape and filled it in
but we didn't have to draw a last line
but if you want to show that last line
and you want to have only a stroke which
you can do is use the CTX dot close path
method now let's run it so you can see
what that does that closed my path for
me and it plotted all three lines like I
wanted okay so now you know how to draw
your lines to move them to any
coordinates and plot out each line to
where it's going to lay you know how to
fill them and we just demonstrated how
to only make it a stroke if you want it
to be a stroke or outline okay so now it
is on you to make me proud and complete
this very basic assignment well all you
have to do is make the right side flap
of that world of web craft logo and I
want to throw this in just so some I
know somebody's going to ask but we
covered it in yesterday's tutorial part
1 of this series where we showed you how
to color the rectangle that we created
you can use that same method here right
before you run CTX fill just put a fill
style using rgba like we did yesterday
red green blue and alpha and those are
the parameters so if I run this now
you'll see that everything would change
too I think that's green is so that's
how you can color things let's say you
wanted the other one to be blue right
before you fill it just assign it with
let's make it red
so let's make
one two hundred and run that you see
what happens if I make all three of
those zero let's run that it is black
again so I'll just leave those lines in
you can make them any color you want
I'll leave them black there you go okay
now make me proud and draw this logo
buddy that's your homework assignment
and if you can't do it you fail son</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
