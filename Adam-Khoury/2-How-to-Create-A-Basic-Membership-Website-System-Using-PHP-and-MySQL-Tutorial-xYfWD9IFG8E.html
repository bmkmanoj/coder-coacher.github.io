here with part two of creating a
membership system for your website using
PHP and MySQL in part one we created the
database at a hosting control panel and
then we also created a table inside of
that database that's going to be used to
store all the member data when they join
or when they edit their data the next
step in the process is we have to be a
hundred percent sure that we are
connecting to that database because
we're going to have various scripts that
are going to have to communicate to that
database if we knock this out at this
point in the series we won't ever have
to worry about connection issues again
because we won't have any connection
issues if we test fully right now we're
going to use this MySQL connect quick
test and this connect to MySQL file and
these if in case anybody is wondering
all of this code and all of these files
all the various files I might show are
going to be in a free downloadable zip
package that you guys can get and I'm
not going to take very long to bang out
this series I think I'm going to do it
all tonight and I know it's not proper
etiquette to just throw up a bunch of
videos on YouTube at one shot but that's
what's going to happen I'm just going to
as I make them I'm going to throw them
up and if that upsets a lot of people
sorry okay first let's take a look at
this connect to MySQL file which is
going to be the file that we reference
any time in any script that we have on
our site that needs to communicate to
that database we're just going to simply
use one little line in those various
scripts to reference this connection
file that way you don't have to have
this sitting or any of this sitting in
your various scripts we can just do an
include which is a better more modular
way to code I think okay so the first
thing in this script is we set up some
variables and these variables really
this information could be put right into
these spots but I set it up into
variables just to make it a little more
easier to for you to identify what needs
to get put where okay so here we have
localhost for most situations and for
most people that's going to remain
localhost but maybe you're a GoDaddy and
you have a different string of
characters that is the address for your
MySQL host you just want to make sure
that you get the proper host name in
there if it's not localhost and you fail
trying to use localhost you fail in
connection then you know that you have a
specific host address that you need to
reference in that in that spot right
there but for most folks
it will remain localhost and I'd also
like to mention right now that I'm going
to be working on a live server on the
internet and not on a lamp lamp
zamp or any crap like that because I
like to test where I'm actually going to
launch and run these systems from
because a lot of people they might test
on wamp lamp and zamp
and then when they go to put their files
on a live server on their website
there's complications there's things
they have to go back and change which I
like to avoid all that stuff by just
throwing up and testing right on the
actual server okay now these other three
variables are pretty much
self-explanatory you put the value of
your database username here you put the
value that is your database password
here and you put the value that is your
database name right there so once you
have your database name the password
your username and localhost all set up
or whatever your hosting addresses for
your MySQL database then this file is
complete all you have to do is put in
the proper values for these three things
and then make sure your host string is
correct then we'll take a look at MySQL
connect quick test now this is a very
simple file that is just made for quick
testing once you run the test once you
can just pretty much delete the file off
your server or you could leave it there
or whatever but it's not going to be
used within the website system it's just
going to be used for testing early on to
make sure we're connecting that way we
can move on with the system so the first
line in that script is include once or
you can have this say require once which
is a more strict way to bring
violin but I'm going to use include once
and my server my PHP any file is set up
to show warnings so if the file is not
found when I try to include it a warning
is going to pop up on the page and say
up we couldn't you know the warning we
couldn't find that include file you were
trying to include so it has to be in the
correct folder on your server with all
your other scripts to reference it
correctly okay so we include once
connect to MySQL dot PHP which was this
file here and what happens is if we get
a successful connection using these four
variables then this is going to output
or it's going to print or echo to the
page you are successfully connected to
your database otherwise you would see an
include warning or MySQL connection
error happy coding if you see this data
on the page then you're all set now I'm
going to take these two files I'm going
to FTP them up to my server and I'm
going to test oh by the way if any of
this data happens to be wrong say you
have you put the wrong database username
in or the wrong host name wrong password
or wrong database name you're going to
get say you have the wrong connection
data for the host username or password
this MySQL error function right here is
going to display on the page to you and
it's going to show you exactly what the
error is and what's causing the problem
now if you happen to put the wrong name
for the database here then this die
function will fire off and just tell you
no database by that name exists
okay so I've FTP those two files and now
I'm going to navigate to them using my
browser I happen to be an internet
explorer right now which no it's not my
favorite browser and yes I use all four
the most popular ones you can use any
one you want and it'll still work the
same so I'm going to go to that file you
see right there develop PHP tests in the
PHP scripts here's the members system
I'm setting up and there's the MySQL
connect quick test that PHP I'm going to
navigate directly to that file and see
what happens booyah baby yours
successfully connected to your database
otherwise you would see an include
warning now when you look at this file
you'll say how is Adam connecting when
he's just got this generic random crap
in there I actually own the server I
have my real string data in there now
since we see this message we know that
we can now include once this one line
here all we have to do is put that on
any one of the scripts that might have
to connect to our database and
communicate with it so all we have to do
is sync in this one line and make sure
this connect to my SQL file is living in
the directory there now we can move
along okay the next part of the process
is getting the home page ready to have
different links on top depending on
whether the users logged in or not so if
they're a logged in user then we're
going to have special links up top to
show their username when they click that
username we want that to go to their
profile we also want to have a link to
where they can go and edit their account
features and then we also want to have a
link to where they can log out so if
they're logged in there's going to be
three links up there their name will be
a link they'll have a word like account
or account settings whatever and then
after that there'll be a logout link now
if they happen to be not logged in and
we'll have a link that says register and
then next to that login so it's really
simple to setup the the logic that you
need to make that happen using the
session variables so before we can even
make the join form or set up the the
login form or anything like that you
want to have the home page where people
would come to initially you want to have
that ready to sense whether the users
logged in or not so that's what we're
going to cover here so let's go into the
code view first let's look in the design
view here you'll see I have a div setup
as the body and then the head is a table
and I opted to use a table here so I can
more easily just put a column over here
to shove those links over to the the
right side of the page and the
is the kind of layout where it will be
Auto expanding this will be an auto
expanding layout so it's set to be 100%
for the div and the header so if
somebody's got a little tiny browser
resolution they'll see it like that
somebody's got a nice big one they'll
see it like that okay now let's look at
the code that makes this logic happen
that will output these links the way we
need it to so here we have all of the
regular HTML data like your page would
normally be without all of the PHP and
MySQL stuff going on and you can see
what we're doing is we're echoing out a
variable called top links if we go into
the split view in Dreamweaver and by the
way I'm working in Dreamweaver cs4 if we
go into the split boot view you'll see
this yellow block here is that top links
variable that we're outputting right
there okay so let's go back into code
view and there's your normal doctype
starts right there that would normally
be line 1 so in order to make this
happen all you have to do is put some
PHP on top of all of that and the first
thing you want to do is start session so
you run the session start function and
that will allow you to access all of the
session variables that might happen to
be active for any given user so what we
do is first thing is we set the top
links variable we just kind of
initialize it and I'm setting it as
empty to initialize it there and then we
run an if in else condition which is
evaluation type logic so you can do
things according to whether certain
conditions are met or not and in this
condition you can see I'm saying if is
set this is the PHP is set function and
if you want to check out any of these
functions I might be using in depth you
can go to PHP net and research any of
these functions so we say if is set the
session ID for this user
and this gets set when they use the
login form on our site which we haven't
covered yet
we'll be getting to that so when the
user logs in the session ID gets set so
if the user is not logged in this else
condition comes into play so let's
discuss that one first so if the session
ID is not set and they're not a logged
in user we're going to give them the top
links of register and then a bullet
symbol and then the login page so they
can either register to the site if they
happen to not have registered yet and
they want to or they can log in if they
happen to register it already and they
just want to simply log in so those are
the links you give them if they are not
logged in if they are logged in that
means the session ID variable would be
set so we give them a different set of
links all we have to do is gather the
session ID variable and the session
username variable into local PHP
variables just for easier use in this
output here so the top links variable
becomes three different links the first
one goes to the member profile so they
can view their own profile if they click
their username see we output the
username as that link display and the
the the URL variable is going to be ID
of that user ID so that way when they
click their name they go to their
profile and then the next link that's
sitting right next to that is going to
be their account and this we have to
change to let's just change that to
account that way when they click that
they'll go to their account and we don't
have to put a URL variable in here for
this functionality we don't have to have
a URL variable you know how we set URL
variables by putting the question mark
and then we put the variables identifier
and then the value here so it's kind of
like key value pairs but there's only
one in this case here
and this one for they're going to their
account to edit their account data you
don't have to have any and I'll show you
why once we check out that member
account page and finally the last link
we want to have is the logout link which
will take them to the logout page and
that doesn't have to have anything
special in it either they can just go to
the logout page will destroy their
session they'll be logged out so
basically that's how it works and you
have to have session start function
first thing in the script and that will
allow you to access their session
variables so that's how the home page is
going to be able to sense whether users
logged in or not
ok so we'll continue on in part 3 we'll
probably discuss the join form and the
login form so sit tight these will be
coming up pretty quickly just going to
go ahead and bang it all out is
basically all the scripts are done I
just have to tweak them a little bit but
I really want to discuss it in depth for
people who are just starting out with
the PHP and MySQL and trying to
understand how to set up simple
membership systems in their websites to
give people certain content if they
happen to be a member or show them
certain things and other people would
see different things and all kind of
happy stuff like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
