new fat arrow functions in JavaScript
also known as simply arrow functions
they are introduced in ECMAScript
edition six to provide a new approach to
writing anonymous functions they are
anonymous functions anonymous functions
and functions that have no name like
normal functions do we see anonymous
functions used as parameters in methods
that expect executable code as an
argument anonymous functions are used in
object-oriented programming or there
sometimes supplied as the value of a
named variable basically anonymous
functions are not named so we're going
to compare traditional anonymous
function syntax with Aero function
syntax side-by-side using several simple
examples in order to demonstrate where
when and how to use the new Aero
functions where you normally use
anonymous functions
arrow functions have two major
advantages over traditional anonymous
functions a they reduce the amount of
code you need to write so that advantage
by itself makes them worth investigating
and B in object-oriented programming the
this keyword th is keyword always refers
to the object no matter how many
anonymous functions are nested in the
class we will demonstrate these concepts
through code right now starting with the
most basic we'll begin with the most
basic example with a variable named X
we're going to make that equal to an
anonymous function I'm going to make
this function take in one argument when
it's called we'll just name that
argument a then we'll simply return a to
the calling code now if you were to run
this you would see nothing because the
function is not called so to call that
function all we have to do is call upon
X like that and then we supply the one
argument remember the argument is going
to be named a when it runs through the
function so the argument will just make
it any value we want ub5 it could be a
word like Hello it can be an object
whatever you want
just make it a number or I'll just here
let me make it a word or a string now
all I have to do is alert that or output
that somehow and I'll just use an alert
just to test it to see what it outputs
run in the browser and I get the alert
hi
so you can see that we have an anonymous
function that's in the variable X and
then we're calling X to run here and
we're passing the argument the string hi
and it's picked up that arguments picked
up as a in the function so that's a
traditional anonymous function syntax
now we'll compare it to anonymous arrow
function syntax so you can see how much
it reduces the code so let's go ahead
and put this all on one line the
function itself and let's copy that line
and I'm going to go ahead and change
that to fat arrow syntax so in this
specific case since we're only passing
one argument through the function we can
remove all of this we can remove all of
this and we don't need the return
statement either and we put equal sign
and directly next to that we put the
right-facing arrow remove this curly
brace and one of these semicolons so you
can see between this and this the code
is greatly reduced but it still
functions exactly the same so I'll
comment out the first one we'll see if
we get the same result run favorite
browser alert hi so it works exactly the
same you can see the amount of code
reduction you have it's about half the
code that's because you don't have to
write the function statement you don't
have to write the return statement
because a is automatically returned this
a-here is automatically returned and
this a is your parameter the argument
going into the function now let's say
you have an anonymous function that
doesn't take in any parameters no
arguments are being passed through that
means all you have to do is remove the a
here and put opening closing parenthesis
and then for the return portion you can
put that in a block statement and then
do whatever you want here's
where you put your executive or code and
we can just Alert so now when we call X
to run we're not passing any parameters
through it but the function X will still
process in any executive or code that we
put between the curly brackets will run
now all we have to do is call X just
like that and it's going to process
without taking in any parameters or
passing arguments through it launched in
chrome see we get the alert executive
all code you'll have to test in Chrome
or Firefox or some other browser that
supports the fat arrow syntax because
it's not standardized yet so it might
not work in Internet Explorer Safari or
maybe some other older browsers so you
have to wait for it to standardize
before you can apply to all of your
projects that are running live so really
this is the most basic example when we
were taking in an argument before that
would be one step up so now we're back
at the code where we're taking in an
argument now we want to see if we can
take in multiple parameters into the
function as arguments so in order to do
that all we have to do is send the new
arguments in so I'll just send three
numbers I'll send a two a five and a one
there's three arguments being passed
into the function so we have to scoop
those up somehow so we're going to open
closed parentheses
that way we can scoop up arguments and
we'll just name them a B and C separated
by commas and then on the return side
the return data will just a plus B plus
C so we should get a two plus five plus
one is eight so we should get an eight
as an alert run in one of the browser's
where arrow syntax works and we get an
eight so that successfully takes in
multiple parameters or passes multiple
parameters that can be taken in his
arguments through the function and if I
was to write this in traditional syntax
for an anonymous function it would be
that long so you have this much syntax
as opposed
- this much syntax to do the same exact
thing so you can see that's quite a nice
reduction it might not look as intuitive
and at first it might be a little bit
confusing might take your eyes a little
while to get used to this combination of
characters and realize that that's a
natural function because it looks a lot
just like a normal operator but in fact
it's the syntax for an arrow function
alright now we're going to set up an
example that might be something that
you're more familiar with set timeout or
set interval they both have a parameter
that expects executable code so that
means you have to put code that's going
to run as the first parameter to set
timeout or set interval so in that case
you use an anonymous function you can
see this anonymous function is set up to
just simply alert to seconds passed
after two seconds go by in the script so
this is traditional anonymous function
syntax that you see every day let's save
our file run in Chrome and after two
seconds passed we get the alert now
let's see that same exact anonymous
function using arrow syntax you can see
we have a little reduction in code which
is nice and we'll still get the same
functionality let's go ahead and comment
that first one out will run in our
favorite browser and after two seconds
passed we get the exit executable code
this can also be put into curly brackets
or if you want to have more than one
expression you can put semicolon there
you can put multiple expressions in
there so let's run yep so you put
gets around that or not now there's a
lot of other methods in JavaScript such
as the add eventlistener method a whole
bunch of array methods that expect
executable code to be supplied as one of
their parameters of that of that method
that's why knowing how to use anonymous
functions is important and now knowing
arrow syntax in the future is going to
be equally important now we're going to
quickly take a look at how it's applied
to object-oriented programming and class
object creation so here I'm creating a
class named car and it has a property of
speed which I set equal to zero by
default this dot speed is a property now
this is using traditional anonymous
function syntax now what we had to do in
the past is set a variable either named
self or that usually this variable is
named self or that and it's equal to
this now we had to do that in the past
because it wouldn't refer to this object
once it's inside of another function so
once you wrap it in a function basically
this code out here would not be able to
reference this dot speed we have to
reference self dot speed so it was kind
of a annoying workaround that developers
have been doing for years in JavaScript
you have to make a new variable called
self make that equal to this and blah
blah blah so what happens with new arrow
function syntax is it cures that problem
first let's go ahead and run this code
in the browser you can see the speed is
incrementing the cars speed is just
keeps incrementing it's just a basic
example that we wrote ok now I'm going
to replace this code for the new fat
arrow syntax for the anonymous function
so you can see it reduces the code a
good deal because we don't have to
create a variable to reference this
inside of the sent set interval method
we can just use this because there's no
function statement there that's going to
overwrite this
inside of the function where it's
running so every time a function is
called in JavaScript inside of that
function this refers to that function
that's why traditionally this was always
not available inside of functions inside
of your class so our car class can now
have functions inside of it that are
anonymous that we can still reference
this in no problem we don't have to swap
this for a new variable called self or
that or none of that silliness so let's
see if this runs the same run in Chrome
beautiful
so that syntax to me makes a lot more
sense ok so that about wraps up the
crash course so we demonstrated how to
use fat arrow syntax inside of named
variables for anonymous functions in
named variables we showed how to use fat
arrow syntax as anonymous functions in
method parameters like set interval add
eventlistener all those different kind
of methods that take in functions as a
parameter you can use these anonymous
functions with the fat arrow syntax and
we also demonstrated how to set it up in
your classes make in your
object-oriented programming
ok I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial
ok I hope you've enjoyed this crash
course into fat arrow functions in
JavaScript and watch out because they'll
be coming to a script near you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
