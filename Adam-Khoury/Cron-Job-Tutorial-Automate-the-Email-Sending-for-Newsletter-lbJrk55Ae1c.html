here we have a lesson that's geared for
people who are not yet acquainted with
Quran Jobs what a cron job is is an
automated time-based script execution
command that you set up at your server
and it fires off to enable scripts to
run automatically so you don't have to
go to your browser to make a script
execute or you don't have to run it it
can be run behind the scenes and all the
little tasks that that script has to
accomplish can be run behind the scenes
without anybody having to enable it
manually and the best thing about it
it's time or date based so let's say on
the date January 20th I want to send out
an email like a blast email to a whole
lot of people at exactly this time you
can set it for just the date or you
could set it for the time and the date
so at 12:20 on January 20th 12:20 p.m.
it's going to shoot off this script and
then you can set another one you can set
multiple cron jobs that you server so
let's say you wanted another one to be
write it here at 12:30 then it will fire
off this script at that time and this
script won't fire up again unless you
have it set to fire off every day you
could do things like have it set to fire
off every day at 2:00 o'clock p.m. this
script will fire off if you want to set
it like that or you can set it for only
every Christmas or just one date and
then when that date comes that's the
only time that the script will fire up
but if you wanted you could set it for
every Christmas and have a whole bunch
of people in your database to email a
Christmas card - that way you can go
ahead and die and then 50 years after
you die people still be getting
Christmas cards from you like what the
hell
ah okay now this directly ties to the
series that I just got finished the
tutorial series all about creating a
bulk blast email sending newsletter
application for a website this is the
part of the whole lesson that will
really automate the whole script process
for you
you set up a cron job that you server
and it fires off and keeps firing off at
a time interval that you set until the
email campaign is done once everybody
gets the email then the cron job is
finished
you can set new ones remove that one or
whatever and the two most popular things
I think but I use cron jobs to automate
mass email sending and automate site
maintenance so there's anything for
instance site maintenance what I do is I
have a database driven site so I use a
cron job to back up my database
automatically every single day that way
if some hacker wants to come to my site
and take down all of the data
I won't lose very much at all I won't
lose anything because right when he does
that and he goes along his way whatever
I just put it all right back up close up
a little hole that I mistakenly left
open in my site security and everything
is fine so that's one thing I use Ron
job for and like I said you can send
people messages automated many people at
once send one send yourself an email
once a day if with a certain type of
information that this script or this
script will gather and these scripts can
be little PHP scripts that will do just
about anything all right now I'm going
to show you at GoDaddy how to set up a
cron job because a lot of people are
registered at GoDaddy they use GoDaddy
for their hosting and so I'm going to
show you I go Daddy how to set up a cron
job and it would be pretty much the same
at all Linux based servers if you have a
Linux based server Unix you can set up
cron jobs usually through cPanel
I'm going to show you a GoDaddy
ok Here I am a GoDaddy calm and I'm
going to place my username and password
my account and login now once logged in
I'm going to go here on the left and I'm
going to click hosting once that
information comes up I'm going to click
manage account right there for the
hosting control panel manage account a
new window will come up and this is
going to be your hosting control panel
I like GoDaddy's hosting control panel
it's really unique custom-made for them
and it's just really nice cPanel is
really nice too a lot of other hosting
companies use but I give props to
GoDaddy for being ballsy and having
their own custom control panel for their
customers air Rorty now what you want to
do is go to content cron manager once
you click that this is where you get
into the area where you can set up cron
commands this is the kind of the easy
automatic way to do it through the
hosting provider there's also ways you
can create cron jobs straight through
script let's say create cron job so you
can see I have no cron jobs here I'm
going to put one in create cron job cron
job title email newsletter blast
now the command is the file that you
want to fire off so if you go to browse
it's going to open up your server but
I'm going to go on my server here and
find the file that I want to fire off
right over here I'm inside the
newsletter folder you see blast script
PHP I'm going to double click that or
highlight it and press select you can
see it loaded it in right there using
the file on my server actually I'm going
to go to custom so you can see the
Advanced Options day of the month all
you can target a certain day of the
month I'm going to set all so it fires
off every day for my newsletter blast
until everybody in my database gets that
newsletter email and then my script
won't blast any more out and then I'll
know my actually my script is set up and
yours is too if you downloaded the
source file is set up to email you when
the campaign is over and everybody's
received the email then you know your
cron job can be removed or re-enabled
for a different time okay now you can
have it set to run twice an hour at on
the hour and on the half hour that's
what I'm going to do and it's going to
email out to 20 people every half an
hour using that selection their hours
all you can set certain hours that you
want month all and day of the week all
so you're using these settings I'm going
to select save using these settings now
what's going to happen is this cron job
is going to interact with my blast
script dot PHP and it's going to make it
fire off instead of me having to go to
my server and manually fire it off this
is just going to do it so with this you
can set up cron jobs which are little
scripts custom scripts that you can
write that will do anything you want
them to do for your website or personal
life that will automatically make things
happen
at time-based intervals okey-dokey
that's what cron job is all about and if
this subject really piques your interest
and you'd like to know more about it
just leave a comment rated hi let me
know you're interested in this sort of
thing and give me the will to go on and
I'll do more about it but if not if
everybody thinks it's kind of lame we'll
just leave it at this and you let you'd
have to get to a certain level in your
webmaster ring before you'll need this
but you will need it trust me if you get
that far you will need this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
