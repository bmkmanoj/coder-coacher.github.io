number two hope you guys don't mind but
I've decided to extend this lesson
series just a little bit so you'll get
more information from me regarding JSON
server side programming client-side
programming and finally making JSON
dynamic by using PHP to send JSON
encoded data into your web applications
so in this lesson you'll learn how to
create and place JSON files on your live
web server and we'll make an AJAX
request that returns the JSON file data
will parse the data from the JSON file
back in JavaScript and we'll make sure
we loop over all the incoming objects to
make slim efficient code that way if you
have two objects or maybe if you have 50
objects just a few lines of code will
bring all of those in and allow you to
parse it into your web page or into your
web application and for our Ajax request
we'll be scratched coding that there's
no frameworks required it's just a few
lines of code and the three-year-old can
do it okay here's the file that we
scripted in tutorial number one and what
I want you to do is on your desktop just
create a new folder and let's call that
JSON underscore test because we're going
to have multiple files now so we want to
make sure we organize things into a
folder so just take the file that we
coded in the first lesson and pop it
into that folder you go into that folder
now we can just open that with
Dreamweaver this is the file that we
made in the first lesson now with that
file open let's just save as JSON
tutorial to that way you can save the
first example that you were writing out
just in case you need to reference those
later
so in JSON tutorial 2 you can go ahead
and remove all the JavaScript now you
want to create a new dot JSON file so
you can go to file new and you can just
choose HTML I'm in Dreamweaver but if
you're in some kind of different text
editor you can create the extension you
need the way that you know how within
that editor that you're comfortable with
if you're in Dreamweaver you can follow
my exact steps so I'm going to click a
page type HTML I'm just going to remove
all of that data and I'm going to go to
file save as you see I'm in that same
folder with my JSON tutorial files these
are HTML documents but I'm going to make
sure I type in as the file name my list
dot JSON save and then I have a file
called my list JSON next to my HTML
files here now if you've ever worked
with XML before this dot JSON file is
going to work pretty much just like your
dot XML file would to store and
structure information in a logical way
since this is using JavaScript syntax we
can just open our curly brace and close
the curly brace so there you have your
object where your list of objects will
be stored since we're going to have a
list we can bring this down a couple of
lines but remember in the first tutorial
how we put user colon and then on the
other side we put the user's name that
was John see remember in tutorial 1 user
John that was the first piece of data in
there actually we could take all of that
let's just take all of the data within
that and put it right here and I'm going
to show you how you need to change the
syntax just a little bit so let's go
ahead and put double quotes around all
of our properties all of the keys I'm
going to make sure we encapsulate those
in double quotes or else you'll have
syntax problems when you try to load
this back into your JavaScript so that's
just a very basic example and let's
press ctrl s to save that and back in
our HTML file we're going to now create
an ajax request that's going to call
this data back into our application now
since I need a simple Ajax request I'm
just going to go to develop PHP and grab
the raw Ajax example in the JavaScript
video tutorial section so if you go to
the Ajax post a PHP file xmlhttprequest
object tutorial you'll see a stripped
down below grab the function see it says
function Ajax post grab that whole
function make sure you get the whole
thing down to the closing curly brace
press control C take that and paste it
right here into the JavaScript element
in your HTML document now remove all of
the comments if you need understanding
on how all of this works
in this video tutorial I explain every
line in depth so don't tell me you don't
understand how Ajax works you just be
able to watch the video take time and
watch this video right here you'll
understand every single line but we're
not going to need all this crap so we
can get rid of the comments I'm going to
show you how much it slims down just get
rid of all those comments because
they're not needed for the application
to run they're just there for
understanding but like I said you want
to understand how all this works go
ahead and watch that video buddy
alright so this URL variable we can just
take that and actually put it in place
where the open method is set here see
that URL variable let's just put that in
place there and remove this line we
don't need that we can change that to my
list JSON
okay my list JSON and you're going to
change post to get so we're going to use
the get method instead of post now here
where we have variables we don't need
this first name variable that last name
variable or the VARs variable we can
just get rid of those now here where it
says bars in the send method of the Ajax
request we're going to put null because
we're not sending any variables now
let's change this where it says content
type from form URL encoded change that
to say JSON simply so content type is
application JSON and let's just make the
async roni is true that's the third
parameter that you need with an ajax
request
i mean it's not necessary it's an
optional parameter but we're going to
use it in this case and set it to true
now the last thing we need to do is
change this to results because that's
the name of the div that i'm going to
have in the page so to change status to
results and now in the body let's put a
div and make sure the ID is equal to
results and while we're at it let's go
ahead and comment this HR response text
variable because we're going to need
that we're going to use the JSON dot
parse method upon that data so actually
we can get rid
this line too and we'll put something
else in there in a minute so really
that's the slimmed down version of the
Ajax request and we changed it up a
little bit from what it was but the post
mechanism that it was serving at develop
PHP when we're sending data to PHP here
and getting it back so this is a post
request and then we're getting our JSON
data we're going to use a get ajax
request and we just change the content
type URL encoded to application JSON now
anytime that you want to fire off this
ajax post actually let's change that to
say ajax to get json because that makes
more sense
so the function ajax get json whenever
that is called to run it will fire off
this ajax request and bring your json
data back in you can parse it so what
I'm going to do is just grab this
starting script element I'm going to go
into my body under my div results I'm
going to put in that script element make
sure I close it and then I can just copy
this right here and what this will do is
fire off that function it'll make this
function run okay so as you guys know
when you if ready state equals 4 and a
char status equals 200 that means the
information has come back from your
server-side data through the Ajax
request so here you have actual access
to that information from the external
file so what we'll do is create a
variable called data and that's going to
be equal to the HTTP requests response
text but before we just pack that into
the data variable we want to use the
json.parse method upon it so type in
json dot parse and what this does is it
helps get it ready for JavaScript
parsing so once we have the information
from the external file packed into a
variable called data the next line we
want to create a variable that
represents this results div here so we
can actually take this
we'll put it up here bar results is
equal to document that get element by ID
results that way anytime we want to talk
to that div through JavaScript all we
have to do is reference the results
variable name let's change this to say
requesting remember this is just going
to be what the div says while the data
is loading on the server and it'll be
just a split second
the user will see the words requesting
dot and then all the server-side data
will come pouring into your application
in just a split second and actually this
is where you can put an image tag to
have maybe a little fan loader or any
kind of animated gif animated gif loader
you can replace those words with an
actual animated gif to make things
cooler and the animated gif will display
to people while that is being requested
server-side ok now the things that we
learned in lesson 1 are going to come in
handy now so let's look at my list JSON
you can see we have one object and it
has its different key value pairs or its
properties and their values so we have
property user age and country and
respective values for all of those
things so I'm going to do is attempt to
pull in the user's name their age and
their country back in my web document
through this data object that has run
through the JSON dot parse method so
let's say results dot inner HTML is
equal to data and remember the dot
notation that we learned in the first
lesson let's say user right there so
what should happen when we run this
application on our server is we execute
the ajax request and when the data is
back from the ajax request to the server
side file of my list json then it will
throw into the results div some
information and we can evaluate that and
we got to make sure that we get the user
which is named
on so when we test this we should see in
this div results div the word John be
put in if you see the word John then you
have a successful little test but we'll
show you how to go a little more
in-depth but we got to test this first
on our actual live server online ok so
I'm using my actual Adam Cory comm
website for this test and you got to
make sure that you're online on your
live web server you can't test this
locally and expect it to work for most
of you it's not going to work locally so
you guys have to load these files onto
your web server I'm going to type in the
name of the folder that they're in mine
was in demo JSON in the name of the file
was JSON tutorial to HTML and I have my
list JSON in the same folder with it
online so I'm going to press ENTER now
and I should see the word John C for
split second instead requesting dot then
John I'll refresh it and look really
close you'll see the word requesting
just for a split second you see the word
requesting that's how fast that online
live data transmission is so split
second but it takes a little longer the
more data that you load in so we look at
my list I JSON we can get all of that
data out there using the same dot
notation that we learned in the first
video so you can write a sentence like
this says data that user is that at that
age and lives in data that country we
load that up to our live web server and
test so if we refresh your page now see
John is 22 and lives in United States
now you're using JSON as it is intended
to grab server-side data now remember in
the first lesson where we had three
different users in my list JSON we only
have really one user it's only really
one object worth of data so what you can
do is set up multiple data objects
within here so let's go ahead and type
in double quote double quote let's call
it u1 and then we're going to put in our
colon remember and the value for u1 goes
the right of the colon and what that's
going to be is its own object so you put
curly braces around those as well and if
you're in Dreamweaver and it says
there's a syntax error on line one
blablabla don't worry about that syntax
error warning because I don't think
Dreamweaver is even equipped and set up
to check the validity of a dot JSON file
so let's go ahead and bring this down
one line with a couple of spaces there
and let's bring this down so about right
there now
to put the second user in place remember
in the first lesson we had user or
object one two and three to represent
John will and IBL we're going to use u1
u2 u3 just like we used in tutorial 1
when we packed all of them into object
or right here u1 u2 u3 so we'll just
copy this line and we'll make sure we
put a comma after this one put another
one there comma another one there and on
the last one don't put a comma so
basically inside of your main object you
have three objects nested within it so
you change this one to you two and this
one to you 3 this user was will this
user was IBL over their ages twenty
seven and nineteen so let's just put
those there
27:19 and we'll was from united kingdom
IBL was from mexico and that's it my
friends now you understand how to set up
a larger list and this can be fifty
items it can be a hundred items and it
doesn't have to be people or users like
I'm using it could be any kind of items
you want you can make a list the source
for image files
it could be a gallery you can pretty
much load in a whole image gallery using
a dot JSON file just like you would use
an XML file to load an image gallery or
a gallery full of images now back in our
application to make this read that same
sentence again actually let's look at my
list let's try to get will who's twenty
seven from United Kingdom let's pull all
of his data out
and what we'll have to do is say data
dot you too dot user data dot YouTube
dot H and data dot YouTube country you
can see the setup in our JSON file the
reason why we have to signify u1 u2 and
u3
is because we have more of a deeply
nested object that we're parsing okay so
press save and then put that on your
server and make sure you also FTP your
my list JSON so you get a FTP your JSON
tutorial dot HTML and your my list that
JSON make sure you replace both of those
in your live server when we refresh and
we got will is 27 lives in United
Kingdom great now let's say I have a
list that looks something like this
where there's a lot more users and a lot
more items in it you can see I have you
one through you 12 and inside this John
will la vieille Rick Susan Amy P Chris
Lu all kind of the people and their ages
and their countries as well so in the
file if I have 12 people
I'd have to load it in this line 12
times once for each user and what if my
list had 100 items in it 100 users that
means I'd have to write this line a
hundred times to throw the data into my
web application so in order to make it
smarter we're going to show you a loop
and what the loop will allow you to do
is run through all of these objects and
parse them into your application using
just a few lines let's just comment that
out for now and right under that line
let's create a forward loop open closed
parentheses open the curly brace and go
down a couple of lines and close curly
brace now in the for loop you want to
type in bar obj in data so for each
variable object in data we're going to
run this loop for each of those items
that's so that's what that means for
each one of the objects within that's
how many times this loop is going to run
and it's going to pass over each one so
if we get the results that inner HTML
variable here well
we'll do is we'll just say plus equals
right there and that will allow us to
compound many many things a lot of HTML
into that container if you just put it
equal there each one each item or each
object will overwrite but when you put
in before so you put plus equals and
that will compound it and the value
would go there now to get the username
for each one of those objects let's type
in data open the square bracket close
the square bracket and in between your
square brackets type in the obj variable
which was created right here through the
loop for each object that comes passing
through dot user and that will pull the
user name dynamically is in my list and
then you can just put in a jar or a
break we'll just put a br so actually if
you're using a plus equal there the
requesting word will stay in so let's go
ahead and uncomment this line and just
make it blank that way this will just
effectively empty out this word
requesting dot before the for loop is
able to populate with real data okay so
make sure you save that I'm going to FTP
it up to the server and see what we get
so here I am on my test page online and
I'm going to refresh oh you see I only
got three because I didn't FTP my list
like I should okay now I'll refresh with
the new list up up in the list
I have syntax errors because I didn't
put a comma behind these when I pasted
them in you just got to make sure that
there's a comma behind each of these
except the last one so each of these
little independent objects put a comma
behind each one make sure you save that
then FTP that okay
refresh and there we go there's
everybody in the list so John all the
way to Gregg is in the list and then
back in here you can basically set up
this HTML any way you want we'll make it
just like the first sentence user is
right here we'll put double quote double
quote between double quotes two plus
and we'll put data object age right here
make sure this is age we're going to do
a similar thing here and lives in space
plus dot country and then pass that
we'll put another plus sign and we'll
just put a horizontal rule to separate
each person so save this FTP it up to
your website go to your live testing
page and refresh and there you go that's
a good bit of data that came in very
lightning fast look how lightning fast
that is
you can't even almost see the word
requesting it happens so fast but that
is data that's not within your
application that you're calling in from
the server okay now what we're going to
do is probably get into the PHP side of
things and show you the real powerful
dynamics of using something like this
just like in some previous tutorials
where I showed you guys how to use XML
dynamically through PHP we're going to
show you how to use JSON data
dynamically through PHP so this static
list that you see here will be rendered
dynamically through database results and
things like that making it really ultra
powerful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
