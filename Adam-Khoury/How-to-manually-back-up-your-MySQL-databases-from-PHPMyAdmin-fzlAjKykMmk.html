demonstrate how you can go into PHP my
admin which is the the online interface
for manipulating your database adding to
it and all kind of manipulation and
things you can do inside the PHP myadmin
concerning your mysql database what i'm
going to show you is how to make a
backup of your database in case you have
a site that might have a lot of users or
a lot of information that's stored in
the database and it's sensitive data
that you want to hang onto in case of
some kind of crash or a hacker or
whatever whatever comes your way you
want to have a backup of your database
that way you can plug it right back in
whenever you need to so and you might
want to you know backup maybe once a
week or once a month whenever you get
time just to so what I'm going to do is
go over here what I just logged in I'm
going to select the database the one
that's for the site or for a site this
is just an example this isn't my actual
database but if it'll have a load up
okay well it's loading the database up
and it's going to show me all the tables
inside of that database that I selected
and I only have one table inside of it
but you may have 10 tables 20 tables
however many tables you might have
inside of this database it'll list them
out right here on the left and you can
select separate ones separate tables and
when you click it it will load the table
in here and then you can press export
but I'm just going to press export let's
say there was a list of seven here it
would export all of them so let's press
export up top it's the fifth button from
the left and when you press export
they'll give you some options there and
I usually export to an SQL format file
and up here you'll see that there's
selections for tables and if you want
all of them you just select all of them
if you want one of them you can just
select one of them and leave the others
and select it and then there's other
options here for SQL the structure
options and the data options and what
type of export you want update replace
or insert and normally you would want
insert because this is a full backup so
you press save file as down here and
this is the filename template name and
then you press go and I in the radio
button I have SQL but you can save it to
any type of file you want and you press
go and then it gives you a dialog
download dialogue to save it to your
computer you just find a place to to
save your backup file in your documents
and and you're good to go and then once
you let's go back here
so say somebody hacks your site and they
wipe out your database or whatever
they're able to do or you you dump your
database accidentally or there's some
kind of crash on your system what you do
is you create a new database on your
server and then once you're inside of it
before you created in your new tables
here you just go to SQL or import either
one you go to import I guess imports the
easier option and then location of the
text file right there and character set
and the data all that information and it
says the format of imported file it says
SQL right here and because that's what
type of file we saved out as then you
press go and it it'll load all that data
right back in like it never got lost so
that's a little demo on how you can go
in to PHP myadmin and on your server say
your server is a godaddy all you do is
you go into godaddy and you go into your
hosting account options and you select
databases you create a MySQL database
name it and then you can work right
inside of PHP myadmin in all of your
databases that's how that works and even
if you're not on godaddy say you're on
host monster blue host or host gator or
something like that they have cpanel
where you can just go to cpanel and
create mysql databases so i hope this
one proves useful and you guys pack up
your stuff so you don't lose anything
okay peace out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
