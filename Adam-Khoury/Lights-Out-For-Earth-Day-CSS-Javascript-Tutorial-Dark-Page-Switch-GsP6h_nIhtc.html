page darkening series of videos to a
beautiful crescendo of dorkiness by
demonstrating how to build an
application like YouTube's lights-out
for Earth Day
where the whole page stays active but it
gets dark it goes into multimedia
entertainment mode but it gets dark but
everybody can still click on everything
on a page you know everything stays
active most of the fundamentals being
used in this application were discussed
in our last three videos so this simply
combines the logic of those somewhat to
make a different kind of application so
being as such I'm not going to waste my
time or any of your time I'm going to
throw the logic upon you very hastily
okay and after watching the video you
might even say a damn man what the hell
was that
I want my friggin money back that wasn't
a tutorial you just drew code at us and
ran away
okay here's all the code and let's
render this in our favorite browser
whatever browser we like best and now
let's pause the video and this one is
different from the overlay in the
respect that everything in the page will
stay active when I go into theater mode
or entertainment mode and all it does is
we're using the same light switch
mechanism here the light switch goes up
and down and if the page is light when
it which is by default it'll change the
page to use a dark stylesheet which we
discussed switching style sheets with
JavaScript instantly on a page in the
last video tutorial so I'm just
combining a couple of things like the
light switch and the switching of style
sheets so basically that's pretty much
all it is now the code for the light
switch see how we are targeting this
image tag here with the ID of light
switch that's down here in our HTML so
we have image tag here ID light switch
and in the theater mode tutorial we did
the one that has the thumbnail with the
little red curtains the theater mode
tutorial is where we establish this
little light switch we discussed how all
of this is working but there's a little
bit of different JavaScript in here and
that's what I'm going to explain to you
guys so I'm not going to explain
anything else because all of this that
you see in front of you right now and by
the way you can get to this code by
clicking on the link under the video go
to develop PHP
snatch the code if you want to
experiment with the code that I have
here so everything else is the same from
what we did in the other videos so and
the only little difference is this
little bit of JavaScript it's just a tad
bit different so I'm going to explain it
first thing we do is create a variable
that references the page style element
which is this guy up here which is the
link for the style sheet that's how
we're swapping out our style sheet we
target that element and then we swap it
out by targeting its href attribute then
we make a variable for light switch that
allows us to easily reference the light
switch ID which is this guy right here
this image tag so that's all those two
variables doing is referencing those two
HTML elements now we have an if
condition that says if the mode is equal
to default which you can see var mode is
a variable I put outside of the function
up top so right when the page loads it
knows that it's in default mode so when
the user clicks on the light switch
we're evaluating see if mode is equal to
default then we're going to change the
page dock by switching to the dark style
sheet which we already showed how to do
in the previous video then we make sure
the light switch is in the down position
which we discussed in the theater mode
video then we switch the title attribute
of that image tag which is the light
switch to say something else let me show
you what I mean so we're looking at it
and we first come to the page by default
it's going to say turn the lights off
you see now if I turn the lights off and
then my mouse is over the light switch
it says turn the lights back on so
that's just a little bit of logic you
can throw in there if you want and then
the last thing we do in this if
condition to turn the page dark is we
say mode equals dark that way the next
time they hit that light switch we know
it's going to go into the lit page again
the bright page the default page so
basically when they hit the light switch
if the mode is default you run these two
four lines of code else if the mode is
dark which it will be every other time
the light switch is hit then you run
these four lines of code and that's
pretty much all there is to it all right
so I'll talk to you guys next time later
on and I'm gonna make a video like
tomorrow or something I'm sorry I took
so long to make this one but you know
life gets crazy in the summer around
here in the woods we got to do a lot of
things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
