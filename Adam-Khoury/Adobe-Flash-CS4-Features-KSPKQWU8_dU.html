on flash cs4 and I just wanted to put
together a little video of what i
thought was cool about it what was knew
about it and its really an animated
dream they've done a whole lot as far as
making it nicer for people who like to
make things move on a web page or in an
application and and see the first thing
I like about it is and it's different
from older versions of flash so if you
put a rectangle on stage there and you
have it selected you hit the properties
tab or you open the properties menu the
the X and the y position and the width
and the height are all sliders now that
a whole lot more easy to use and their
state for the most part they stay at a
decimal point of zero the whole time I
used to hate the way the old flash
versions had it would say one sixteen
point to point for this one it sticks on
zero it's really nice and you can see
the width and the X&amp;amp;Y slider is really
nice it's just so much more easy to use
and it stays on zero for the most part
like I said and that is pretty cool and
the way the properties panel is
displayed is a whole lot different and
they just made things look different
here there there's a few more things in
the in the main menu here on the Tools
menu
but I thought that was really cool i'm
going to go ahead and convert this to a
movie clip symbol and then this 3d
rotation tool is really cool as well and
what this will do is allow you to move
move this thing in in the 3d space see
that that's nice huh so you can between
animate all these things any movie clip
you have in a 3d space and make it do
all kind of neat things but I thought
that was pretty cool also and then
there's something let's go here okay the
motion
this default motion presets here that
weren't in the last one and it sets up a
nice so if you want it to bounce it in
bounced out bounce smoosh all kind of
neat things fly in left and i'm going to
apply let's see that wave thing that
looks cool okay so you select that you
have your movie clip selected you go
into the library the motion library
there press apply and you can see on the
stage it applied it to the timeline so
you know if we press enter here or we
can just publish out you see sets it up
nice going back and forth and all these
motion guides are really cool because
you can move this then after you set
that up and then publish out again
and you can see how it changes it so all
of those motion presets are really cool
there's a whole bunch of them and you
can manipulate them after you put them
on stage for all your movie clips what
else was cool the bones thing is really
cool so if you take see a little shape
Oval tool if I set so we don't want any
line yeah
take another oval make a forearm and a
little hand and then you put your bones
in press the little bowling symbol there
you start drawing into bones
and then once you get them drawn in you
can then animate this thing wherever you
move it it follows you can move any
piece of it and the rest stays connected
it's just really cool stuff and I look
forward to learning a lot more about how
bones works and see if I can get some
movie clips connected and that would be
really cool so far I played with it for
only a few minutes and I've noticed that
I can only get drawing symbols to work
like this and I would like to have three
separate movie clips and maybe it's
possible but I haven't figured it out
yet but I'm sure somebody out there has
and maybe you'll tell me or I'll get it
by the end of the day maybe but I
thought bones is really cool and what
else was there that I wanted to mention
all the sound library if you go up here
to window common libraries sounds this
is all kind of sounds Internet
which was it this was not in the last
versions of flash what else was there Oh
in the images leave a ghost behind which
i think is cool every time you move
something not that thing but this thing
you can see how it leaves a ghost image
behind from the origin point that way
you can see where it was and that is a
new feature and so far that's all I've
been able to see that's new I'll be
digging through it some more and if I
see anything else really really cool
I'll uh I'll make some comments about it
but if you're working with cs4 already
you'll notice that it is a nice animated
and animators dream as has a lot of
features rich for animation tweening and
motion and sound and video so that's it
talk to you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
