programming lesson you can learn to
allow users to print specific parts of
your documents instead of printing the
entire webpage we're going to add little
print buttons near each printable
portion of the document so let's inspect
our default HTML what we have is two
divs and a paragraph element each has
their own separate content and each has
their own ID we're going to use that ID
to access the elements in JavaScript and
print just its content so let's create a
button we're going to create a button
after each of these elements and inside
of the button we're going to add a click
event and make that equal to a function
that we're going to fire off that will
allow us to print just the content
inside of div 1 we'll name it
print content and we're going to pass 1
argument through that function the
string that is the div ID in this case
div 1 which is this div right here and
then you can type print content for the
button label now let's just take that
and copy it and let's put one underneath
div 2 let's put one underneath paragraph
1 let's change this to p1 change this to
div 2 and it's that simple now when the
user clicks each of these buttons a
print content function is going to fire
off and that's going to be up here in
our JavaScript portion of the document
so let's put in a script element to make
sure we go down a couple of lines and
close that script element and we need
this function so let's just highlight
that go up in our JavaScript type in
function print content open curly brace
and closing curly brace now up here in
the argument we can just type in a l so
if the user hits this first button PL is
going to represent this string div 1 if
they hit the second button this e L
variable is going to represent div 2 now
the first thing we're going to do inside
of this function is we're going to get a
restore page variable so type in VAR
restore page and
make that equal to document.body dot
innerhtml and that will allow you to
pack all of the whole documents body
innerhtml
into this restore page variable so
basically everything that's within your
body tag on the page all of this stuff
right here is going to be packed into
the restore page variable first thing in
the function then the second thing we do
is create another variable we're going
to call that print content I'm going to
make that equal to document dot get
element by ID and we're going to pass
the e l string the ID string and we'll
get its dot inner HTML as well so we
haven't manipulated anything in the page
what we've done is created two variables
one that holds everything on the page
and one that holds just the specific
content to be printed now the next thing
we do is we change the document dot
bodies that inner HTML to be only the
print content so you can just take this
variable here and put it right there
then we simply run the window dot print
method and that's what actually prints
the page so if you were to run the print
method without doing this little
swapping of the inner HTML for the body
it would just print the entire document
the whole web page but since we've taken
the document body in your HTML and made
it equal to only the print content that
means the page is inner HTML is only
equal to the print content and that's
how when you run the window dot print
method it only prints just a specific
part of the page then directly after
that you have to restore the documents
inner HTML directly after that you just
put the restore page variable right here
so you're making the inner HTML of the
document equal to only the print content
for a split second then the print method
runs and directly after that you restore
the documents regular the original HTML
and that's how you can allow users to
print just a specific part of the page
now let's run a test I'm going to test
in Chrome and I'll hit the first one
print
content and it should print only div one
so you see there let me zoom in on that
it's only div one content that's going
to be printed then let me hit the second
one it's only div two content that's
going to be printed this time and then
finally the paragraph it's only
paragraph one content that's going to be
printed so like I said if you wanted to
print the whole document you just run
the window dot print method without all
this other stuff but if you want to
print just a specific portion of the
document or just specific text within
the document you can do that using this
approach here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
