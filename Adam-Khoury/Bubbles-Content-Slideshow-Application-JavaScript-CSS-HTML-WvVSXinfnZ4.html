you would like to see bubble content
slide show where they bubble you kick
the bubbles and the content goes in the
bubble changes to the next mode and goes
back to the first bubble and all that
junk alright I don't have a lot of time
this morning too
I won't have a lot of time in the next
few days either to record an in-depth
tutorial so what I'm just going to do is
give you guys the whole application and
you can get in there and adapt it and
change it change the style the way it
behaves and everything to your specific
needs this is the example application
running you'll see it goes starts to the
first bubble and it automatically
animates to the second bubble animates
to the third bubble you can have as many
bubbles as you want in there when it
gets to the fourth bubble we'll go back
to the first bubble so it kind of loops
and it also allows the users to click
any bubble they want so if I click the
fourth bubble I now have control over
the bubble interface now you can make
these bubbles any size that you want any
shape that you want any color that you
want you can even put stuff inside the
bubbles like numbers maybe one two three
four or ABCD but I like them empty
because it has more of that bubble feel
when you have just a nice little tiny
empty bubble so I'm just going to give
you the application for you to learn
from and dissect and alter as you see
fit now if you have any questions
regarding how to change its
functionality in any way feel free to
ask in the comments area for this video
now myself and other viewers can answer
your questions if we know what you're
talking about
so don't be afraid to ask a question in
the comments area if you fail to
understand a certain thing that you want
to change about it and then we'll tell
you how to go about changing it now all
of the code that I used in building this
application our concepts that we've
already covered in past tutorials about
JavaScript and CSS 3
animation and timing and looping and
arrays we've covered all this
information I didn't put any new mystery
things in it that I haven't done
tutorials for already but if any of it
confuses you all you have to do is ask a
question someone will help you
understand it if not myself then
somebody else that's viewing the video
that happens to know JavaScript real
well or CSS or whatever they'll tell you
to answer so here you can see there's
the HTML and here's the CSS and don't
worry all of this code is going to be
available under the video at develop PHP
comm and I'm going to put a link to that
the source code in the video's
description
so if you don't know where to get the
source code from just look in the video
description under or next to the video
and you'll see that there's a link to my
site where you can just snatch all the
code up and here is the JavaScript so
you can inspect the JavaScript and
inspect the CSS you can alter any aspect
of this application you can also take
this CSS and externalize it into a dot
CSS file so that way your main document
isn't cluttered with extra CSS and you
can also take all of this JavaScript and
put it into an externalized JS file that
way it won't reside directly in your
main document you can just call it in
okay so I'm going to leave you guys with
it to dissect it and do whatever you
want with it oh yeah if you want to put
in single quotes within these content
this content array you can put in the
single quote but you'll see that it
breaks your string it will break the
syntax so if you want to put it single
quotes in that content you just
backslash the single quotes and they'll
go in no problem and let's see we also
have the timing is set to 4 seconds but
you can change that to a 10 it'll be 10
seconds for each bubble I'll just put it
on 5 and there was one of you in
particular yesterday that asked Adam I
just went to Adam core calm and saw the
new design
for the new design you had three bubbles
on the center page in the old design I'd
appreciate a video on how to make such
so here's your video and here's the
application that shows you how to make
such you have any questions about it you
can just ask we'll let you know
okay everybody bye bye enjoy making your
bubbles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
