welcome to part 7 of the e-commerce
website building lesson series I'm sorry
for the pause in the series but the
holidays got the best of me it was very
clear to everyone who's with ears that
the code would not be available to thee
till the end of the lesson series I said
that and I made sure throughout each
video that I showed the code real clear
on the screen so that way you would just
full screen and go to HD maybe pause
here and there where you need to type
some things in where you can see it real
clear then that's what you got to do if
you can't wait until the end okay we
have nothing else holding us back now so
in part 7 here we will focus on getting
the home page to show and always
up-to-date dynamic listing of the latest
items the store manager has placed in
using the backend system the backend CMS
system that we created for the store so
all we have to do is go and open our
index dot PHP page so I'm here in
Dreamweaver and there's my index dot PHP
page you can see there's not much to it
and that's every bit of the code there
and I bet you if you guys were to full
screen right now and put it on HD you
would see every bit of the code I have
experimented I've looked now right here
in my home page you can see in my body
section there I have a div that's the
main wrapper for everything then I have
my template header coming in and under
that the very bottom is my template
footer so in between the template header
in the footer we have our page content
div ID and inside of that div I'm going
to put a table I know a lot of people
don't like using tables so you can go
ahead and make your three column div
layout now that would be similar to my
table layout that's going to be three
columns in one row and look how easy
that is it's so easy nice huh then you
go to design view and there's your three
column layout you hit enter a few times
right there you can just easily very
easily adjust the sizing so you just
slide it grab and slide you those things
around till it looks real nice to you
he's so easy or
you can be a give CSS nut and make your
three column div layout it's very simple
for you to float things you know yours
in a CSS Zen master who are we to tell
you how to do things with just lowly
table users that like to do things easy
and still have everything validate at
the w3c tables validate just fine
they run just fine they load just fine
they index SEO just fine too
hahaha okay so I'm going to get this to
be thin on that side a little bit more
narrow on that side as well and then in
the middle I'm going to have my featured
items so all three of these columns I'm
going to highlight make sure they're
vertically aligned to the top that way
my text is always on top so if you have
something big in this column and you
only have one sentence in this column it
won't be aligned to the middle it'll be
aligned to the top like you want it now
here I'm just going to put some crap
noticed items added to the store over
here more crap and you can imagine what
that would be anything that your
imagination can think of so right here I
know I want my dynamic list to render so
I'm going to hit enter there I'm just
going to type in the money symbol
dynamic list would be the variable name
I'm going to assemble this variable now
by doing a simple select query on the
database
okay so first let's go into the code
view and make that output correctly as a
PHP variable go to PHP and echo when you
have the whole thing highlighted you can
throw a semicolon on the end there you
don't even have to put the semicolon but
I just like to break all my statements
with the semicolon now all we have to do
in the top of the index dot PHP page
above the doctype here press ENTER push
that down one line of your PHP tab in
Dreamweaver and go to add a PHP code
block or if you're not in Dreamweaver in
your notepad plus plus or something like
that just type in your PHP block make
ourselves a comment run a select
query to get my latest six items and you
can get as many items as you want to
dynamically render on your home page but
I'm just going to keep it simple at six
now we can go into files that we already
have some scripting in like store or
admin I think and we can go to inventory
list and I believe we can grab one of
these queries to make life easy for
ourselves this block grabs the whole
list of reviewing that's perfect that's
what we want I don't need the PHP block
I just want the code inside of it that's
on inventory list PHP the block that
grabs the whole list for viewing back on
the index page right underneath my
comment I'm going to pop in that code
remove that comment because I already
have my comment and instead of product
list I want this to be dynamic list so
everywhere where it says product lists
change it to dynamic list so the SQL
reads well first we have to connect to
the database if we don't do that we're
screwed
let's see what's here right there
connect to the MySQL database grab that
code and let's do that first thing we
don't have to go up one level because
we're in the root directory so we can go
straight into the store scripts folder
and grab that connect to MySQL PHP file
which will open the MySQL connection for
us we can query the database now all we
have to do is go through here and change
a couple of things like the query says
select all from products ordered by date
added descending which is fine but we
need to limit so I'm going to type in
limit 6 I only want 6 items returned
from this query product count we'll keep
that in there and if it there is no
products in the dynamic listing we want
to say we have no products we have no
products listed in our store yet but
once a product is added to the back-end
this will never display it will be this
will display make sure we get that to
say dynamic list and so basically you're
appending into the dynamic list variable
each of the six products in any way you
want to display them so right now we're
gathering out the product ID the product
name the product price the date added
and if you want to get the description
and all that that's just fine you can
query the description out with these
other things and display it on the
homepage but I'm not going to I'm going
to keep it nice and simple I'm going to
go to design view and what I'm going to
do right here go down a couple of lines
by hitting shift enter to put line
breaks and right here I'm just going to
simulate how I would want this to look
for each new item and since I want to
have the product picture now displaying
with the information I'm going to make
use make use of tables again I'm going
to hit table one row two columns very
simple small table that will hold an
image on the left side right here in
this little box and then in this cell
we're going to have the product
information what the name of it is the
price click to buy or click to view more
information and then the image will also
have a link on it so let's grab one of
those images now this is just static
just to set up how things are going to
look in the dynamic display so let's go
to inventory images and since we don't
have any here I'm going to have to FTP
some of the ones that are already there
into that spot let me do that real quick
okay so I FTP the first items image just
to help me make things look the way they
do should I'm going to put here dynamic
dynamic title all right so let's make
that have so there we can see the hat in
that first cell and we don't want it so
big so what you can do is adjust the
size by holding shift
and dragging their click down and drag I
want it to be about that big for each
one and then you can move this in or you
can also give this table some padding
just to make it look a little better and
your products can have a border let's
put a border of one on that and it's
going to also have a link to the product
page so they can see the product and
grand display so right now let's just
put a pound sign right there for the
link and that was given a blue border
now but you can change the color of your
borders for all your images you can
simply give this a style style border
color that gray whatever color you want
one pixel solid save and now you'll have
the color borders that you want around
your images and it also has a link on it
let's see we can open the product page
make sure that's the name let's go back
to our index page we can make this link
to product dot PHP and it's going to
have some variable attached to it so
let's just put the question mark to
ready ourselves for the URL variable
that we're going to add to that link in
a second now here I'm going to want the
product title so I'm going to be aligned
both of these to the top right here I'm
just going to put product title for the
line break product price you can you can
design this any way you want I'm just
doing it real simple
to save time and then view just put a
view product link make that a link to
the same page product PHP with the
question mark like I said you can pull
the description out if you want to have
the description in there too any kind of
information you're storing about you
your inventory items now for my
particular needs I don't need this
so wide in the center now and I can take
this code right here that table let's go
into code view pretty much it will be
highlighted for you and you just control
X or control C you can leave it there
for now and even comment it out so press
control C and copy it before you comment
it out and then comment it out so it
won't render on the page now you put it
up here dynamic list whatever is going
to output in that list and let's make
use of single quotes here so we'll put
in single quote single quote and that
will be the content with the variable
will be in between those two single
quotes so let's paste it in right now
control V the dynamic table so in my
case this table will be rendered out six
times with six of the latest products
that I've added to the system and a lot
of people will disagree with me on using
tables but really you don't have to
listen to them because tables are still
widely used and the day the tables are
not accepted as a standard and they're
not w3c validated when you validate your
markup since tables are all valid still
and they still work nice and you're easy
to work with I say use it the day that
they cancel out tables is the day we
turn to divs for to do what we need to
do but until that day comes make use of
tables they're easy and fun and if you
want to get down to the Nitty Gritty of
things this is really tabular data if
you want to talk about what's right to
use tables for what this is tabular data
the way we have it laid out and you can
use one table that just spits out rows
this table tag can be set above the loop
that way it renders out just once and
then the closing table tag can be set
below the loop that way it only renders
out once and that way you're just
spitting out table rows and not hole
tables each for each item in my case
here I'm going to keep it easy and just
spit out a whole table a whole little
table with two cells for each item I'm
just letting you know how if you want to
be more efficient you can make this
table
starting tag rendered just once by
putting it above this while loop and
then spitting out in the while loop in
the dynamic list variable each row just
the row and make sure you have this
closing table tag outside of your while
loop to close the table off but if you
want to be super geek like the div CSS
then guys you can make the two column
layout here one for your product image
and one for the information right next
to it by floating divs you don't have to
use tables there now nobody can yell at
me about nothing okay now very simply
here at the top in that while loop we
just render out the variables price
that's going to go here product price so
let's put a dollar sign let's put a
single quote space period space the
variable name space period space single
quote that's how you render in a
variable using single quotes within a
section of code that is encapsulated
with single quotes if I didn't put those
single quotes there all the people would
see on the page is the dollar sign and
the word price so you have to put the so
the single quote breaks the string and
then the dot appends to it so basically
you're breaking string appending this
variable inside of it the way it's
supposed to render out then you append
again and you're adding the rest of the
string information so we can just do the
same for product name which would go
right here product title just change
that for product name so the product
name will render in for each one of the
items their product price there now all
we have to do is make sure the ID is
output here so let's take that set up
again put it right there where it says 1
because that one must be made dynamic
now for each item ID so instead of
product name is going to say ID so
inventory images
I D the JPEG simple and dynamic title
right there we'll just put product name
grab that right there which is dynamic
title in the alt put product name and
you'll be doing fine now right here we
have a link now we have two links
actually one on the image and one where
it says view product in the design well
we don't have it there anymore remember
where we typed in view product we want
to have that link be dynamic so on the
product page I don't think we're
establishing yet anything it's still
blank so we can close that off so we can
make this variable be whatever we want
let's just make it ID equals this items
ID so let's just grab these these
characters there and place it right
after the equal sign product out PHP the
URL variable will be named ID and its
value will be each dynamic variable in
this list as it comes out let's just
take that same setup ID equals and let's
put it right here on this one as well
now way your picture will have the link
the product image and also the view
product or the view product details link
will also be active and shoot the person
to the product a PHP page for that
product and at any time after you
scripting is done at the top you can
throw this mysql close function with no
arguments and it will close any open
connections I'm pretty sure using this
with no arguments here between the
parentheses will close any open
connections to your MySQL database okay
let's run it so I'm going to FTP it up
to my live online server at Adam Cory
calm okay so check out my home page now
and this is live if you want to go see
it actually online it's Adam Cory calm
this is where I'm just playing around
with this tutorial lesson getting things
built you can see I have six items
coming out dynamically each uses a table
with column on the left here to fit the
the product image in a column on the
right to fit the product information and
the view product details
so if I was to press this it would go to
product PHP ID one this one you can see
has ID of three ID of four so they all
have a unique ID
you notice that I deleted my item number
two when doing a tutorial I think it was
part four or five where I deleted one of
my product items and that was item
number two so all I have is item one and
then it skips to item three and that is
no big deal I don't need an item number
two as long as each item has a unique ID
in the database okay so we accomplished
that task you know you just make it
design the page to look the way you want
bring the information out and any way
you want or if you want to have a grid
layout of all your products say you
don't like this linear layout you want a
grid layout that develop PHP I just did
a grid output script lesson here that
shows you how to do this kind of grid
layout type thing in PHP and MySQL and
there's even a video on it if you click
that link where I explain all the code
all right so that's going to wrap up
part seven and in part eight we're going
to get the product PHP page to display
the item in all this grand detail and
that will be the page that has the Buy
Now button on it so that will be part
eight
