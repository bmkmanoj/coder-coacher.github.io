and click flash ActionScript 3 file
create new and this is gonna be very
quick and simple so we'll go into the
text field or on the main timeline and
the first on the only layer there in the
first keyframe we'll highlight the text
tool and we'll drag out a dynamic text
field and we want it black that's good
let's put it into place let's just give
it an instance name of my text to keep
it simple okay so that's where our
information will render and let's make
the height about 100 here okay perfect
okay so now let's put this on the bottom
now that has an instance name let's make
a an actions layer
and we'll just name this one text and on
the actions layer just go ahead and
write herself a little comment here and
we're going to set the variable name for
the class path definition so claim bar
external file colon and let's use the
name that's going to be our class name
inside of the external file so let's
just make it my sample and that's what
we'll make it in the in the external
ActionScript file and the reason why
cools and we'll just put Adam in there
for now and then one last line and
that's it for for this side of things
but for the SWF side of things here or
inside the Fla so we'll say my text
which is what we gave that dynamic text
field we created on stage an instance
name dot text equals external file so we
can just grab this we're going to
communicate with the external file here
dot and whatever function we want to run
on the my name variable so we'll type in
the function name will be combined text
and we haven't created it yet but that's
the name we'll give it you'll see that
in a second
my in so that's then my name variable
it's gonna go right in there it's gonna
get sent in to the external file and so
that's it basically for your for this
example is those three lines so now
we're going to create well let's go
ahead and file save as save this main
flash file on the desktop as my as3
dynamic
external classes
save it on the desktop okay now all I
have to do is create a simple
ActionScript file to communicate with
this main file okay let's go to file new
ActionScript file and let's type in the
word package
now let's nest it bring it down close
the nest now inside of the package go
down to lines type in public class this
is going to be the main class here my
sample because in our flash file right
here we named it my sample so this
script we're also going to name this
whole file my sample now let's go ahead
and nest this one off close it this one
up a little bit and inside of the the
class we're going to need that function
that we defined here
it's called combined text and it's going
to have that dynamic variable going into
it so let's go ahead and copy this let's
go down a couple of lines here type in
public function give it a name and now
here we're going to access the my name
variable and by default we're going to
give it a value of nothing by claiming
to double by typing into double quotes
there so there's nothing in between them
and then colon string curly brace and
then let's go down and close this nest
off for the function that curly brace
there and let's just type in close
function so we can see what we're doing
real nice closed class and right here
just close package okay now I'm going to
claim some variables inside the class
for some some text remember I told you
we're going to dynamically render a
sentence so text line one will be our
first variable this is a string and it's
going to equal space knows how to make
now the next one's going to be very
similar you'll see go down this is text
line two
control C and V control C and control V
or copy and paste you guys know that and
then this one will be a different part
of the sentence this will be reusable
dynamic code files
in flash
so
let's see we're gonna need one more var
here save our text combined let's make
it a string variable and don't claim
anything on it yet
just we'll just claim the variable but
we won't give it a value just yet I'm
gonna give it a value down here now we
say text combined this is gonna be so
simple types combined equals my name so
it's going to say atom plus text line 1
plus text line 2
close it off with a semicolon and now
the next line will just return text
combined to the flash stage the main
file now we can access that variable
text combined and that's what we placed
okay yep so when the external file come
to that text string this value of this
combined sentence so we return combined
text and that is the value that gets
placed inside where we're rendering out
this Texas dynamic text field here it's
placed right there so we just claimed
external file and then the function name
and the function runs right here at this
point and that's why we get that
returned value and let's go ahead and
save this as my sample so we'll go to
file save as the desktop my sample save
and let's see if this thing works and
maybe
we'll talk about it some more if it
doesn't we'll see what we did wrong okay
works fine this is in the browser when I
pressed f12 to publish says Adam knows
how to make reusable dynamic code in
flash files</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
