we'll be showing you how to set the
world on fire using a simple over lake
this technique can be used on any
equally shaped items of equal sizes
we're simply going to overlay mask and
then fine tune the blending in fireworks
just open a new document make your
canvas nice and big and find yourself an
image of the earth this is an actual
photo of the earth from NASA and this is
a son so you can get any image of a Sun
any image of an earth and if the Sun
image that you acquire has flares on it
it makes things even cooler okay now
while working with your two images you
can zoom in and out by holding down your
control key on your keyboard and mouse
wheeling I'm going to zoom out a little
bit i'm going to change my canvas to
black and what I've done already is made
sure that both are the same diameter so
both of my heavenly bodies of the same
diameter so if I fade this one down and
I put it on top of this one you'll see
that they're about the same exact size
so I'll position the Sun on top of the
earth the best i can to where it looks
like it's in place actually i'm going to
grab both of these i'm going to
highlight both of them and move them
more to the center there right there i'm
going to highlight the Sun on top bring
its opacity all the way back up to 100
then I'm going to go to commands
creative auto vector mask I'm going to
make any order vector mask that I wish
to and I'll just use this linear here
and i'll apply it and i can manipulate
it now so what i'm going to do is grab
this and i'm going to put it to the
center of the earth then i'm going to
grab this bar here or the block i'm
going to drag it in so you can see when
I do that it sets the planet on fire now
what I'll do is flip the Sun because i
want the dark spot on the other side so
it looks like i have to grab it and move
it now so let me put it over here and
then double click this blue spot in the
center that blue symbol
and then you can just wheel around that
little block to set any angle of the
planet that you want on fire so if I
wanted it to say look like that and you
can also bring this in to make your seem
tight which it doesn't look very
realistic if you make you seem the seem
very tight the blend between the two so
you want to make sure that has a
gradient enough to where it looks more
realistic and something like that okay
so that's how it's done i'll let you
guys continue getting creative with that
if you want to put the comets and
asteroids meteors slamming into the
earth maybe chunks missing out of it but
this is a good way to get your base
planet with fire engulfing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
