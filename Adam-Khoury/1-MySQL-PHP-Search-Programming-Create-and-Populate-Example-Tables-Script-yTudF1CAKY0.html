series we are going to cover basic and
advanced ways a PHP programmer can
search a MySQL database throughout the
series we will show examples discuss the
programming logic offer some free code
and then nearing the end of the series
we're going to put it all together and
build the search page for the world of
web craft comm so people can see how it
is applied to a real-world situation
where we create an advanced site search
page that allows filtering and things
like that so you can have a smarter
search engine on your site and all of
the code examples that we might be using
in the various videos in this series are
going to be housed at develop PHP comm
and this whole series is going to be
housed in the PHP and MySQL video
section there at develop PHP com okay
before we get started let's briefly
discuss what you will be learning and
also what you will need in order to
follow this series so what you'll be
learning in the series is HTML search
forms and advanced search filter methods
using HTML forms you're going to learn
various MySQL search query methods join
table queries targeting multiple tables
natural language full-text search
queries boolean full text search queries
and before you can begin with this
series there's three things you're going
to need 1 MySQL database created on your
web server successful connection to that
MySQL database so you have to create the
database on your server and successfully
connect to it using a MySQL connect
script you have to make sure your server
processes PHP ok just to make sure that
we're all doing things exactly the same
and nobody can cry about the scripts not
working for them we're going to supply
you with a script that creates two
tables and we're creating two tables
that way we can show and demonstrate the
joined table queries for searching now
the script is going to be stored at
develop PHP comm where this video is
rendering so right under the video you
will find this script where you copy and
paste but what happens is it first it
creates one table called pages and
that's for storing site pages just an
example table and we're going to put
dummy data within that table
and the second table is called blog and
that's going to be for storing blog
entries which is similar to the pages
table but it's just a little bit
different and it's made for storing
something else and so you can see after
we successfully create each table that
we're going to insert dummy data into
the pages table here with this SQL query
and then we're going to insert dummy
data into the blog table here with this
SQL query right here using these SQL
commands and you can see that my SQL
commands are wrapped up in a little
block here and I'm going to expand those
out and explain those to you in just a
second but first I'm going to show it
working make sure it works on my live
server okay so now I've run that page
and everything worked out right I
connected successfully and it created my
pages table created my blog table and it
successfully populated dummy data into
those tables on the top of this file I
went ahead and put the database version
MySQL database version that I'm using on
my live web server which is five point
one point five eight and my PHP version
that I'm using on my live web server
which is five point two point one seven
and the first thing that's happening in
the script is we're forcing script
errors and warnings to show during
production only and we're putting in
these lines just in case your PHP dot
ini' file or your PHP configuration is
set to suppress errors and not show them
this will force them to show then the
next line is connect to your database
here and what I'm using is a connect to
MySQL dot PHP file which is an
independent file that I can call on
anytime within my website or application
that I need to connect to that database
but you can put your connection lines
right in here if you're having problems
including a connection script then you
can just put your MySQL connect script
your lines however many lines it takes
to connect to your MySQL database
usually it's two lines you put them
right there all I'm saying is just
connect to your database right here no
matter anyway you want to do it and I
have lessons that develop PHP let's show
how to connect to a MySQL database using
the method that I'm using here
I'm not going to be showing you guys my
MySQL database connection strings
because their personal and private to me
now that we have successful connection
to our database we're going to create
table one for storing the pages and
let's go ahead and expand this out I
highlight that block and show it to you
now you can see the syntax and you'll be
able to get your hands on this code and
copy and paste all of it if you don't if
you don't want to sit here and pause the
video and type all of this you can just
copy and paste it from the page at
develop PHP which I will link to in this
video in the description on the under
the video so the syntax reads which is
all packed into a variable called SQL
command the SQL syntax reads create
table called pages and in that table
we're going to have the first field this
ID type is integer it's unsigned auto
increment not no and it has the primary
key then the next field going in is page
title and that's going to store the
pages titles that's going to be varchar'
255 so the field type is varchar' 255 is
the max 255 is the max charge that can
be in page body that's going to be the
next field and that's going to be text
type and I can hold up to I think 10,000
characters or something like that and
then page views that's going to be in
type not null and we're going to stick a
default value of 0 or any items that may
be put into this database table and
finally we're setting a full text index
on the page title field and the page
body fields so those two columns in the
database table are going to have the
full text index set upon them and this
is really only going to be necessary for
when we go to demonstrate the full text
type searches for basic searching it's
not really necessary and actually if you
have a whole lot of data in your
database for very large result sets
MySQL recommends that you don't set your
tables as full text before you put your
data in it they say you should put all
your data in your database and then
after all the data is inserted into the
database then set your full text indexes
on the page title and the page body
whatever rows or whichever fields that
you
set full text index upon they say you
should set it afterwards
for tables that would have very large
result sets a lot of information in them
and you can do that using alter table
syntax instead of create table you can
use alter table and you can target the
table that you want to alter and add
full text indexes to anything for an
existing table and then the last little
bit is as you set in the engine for the
MySQL database table to my iam and more
than likely your databases are already
my iam type all right now let's close
that one back up like it was and let's
take a look at creating table too so I
like that one open it up you'll see it's
identical to the first one it's just the
table called blog now but it's creating
that table in the same way it's creating
the first one giving it an ID instead of
page title this one's called blog title
but it's the same kind of field
this one's called blog body instead of
page body same kind of field this is
called blog views instead of page views
and it's the same kind of field as the
other one and we're setting the full
text index upon blog title and blog body
and making sure the engine type is my I
am okay so now you see the syntax needed
for creating tables through script and
that's what these do now after that code
successfully runs you'll see two h3 tags
the first one will run if there's any
errors that occur you'll see that
through this MySQL error function so the
script will die and this MySQL error
function will fire off telling you
exactly what you did wrong you can see
in mine when I ran mine on the browser
live
I had nothing go wrong because I had no
MySQL error output all mine show with
these h3 tags saying success creating
pages table success creating blog table
yadda yadda I still have it up there it
is right there see so you can see I only
I got these success echoes here to
render because all of my queries happen
successfully if there was any errors in
any of these queries and anything went
wrong these MySQL error functions would
have fired off
and the script will die at that point
now we need the two queries and SQL
commands to run to insert the dummy data
so let's highlight this one and I'll
show you how I'm inserting dummy data
into the pages table so I'm inserting
into pages into the pages title and
pages body the values of all of these
lines you can see there comma separated
lines that throw in the title and they
throw in the page body but this is how
you can set it up for exercise purposes
and really you can take away the blah
blah blah you can title these any way
you want but I recommend you leave it
exactly how it is because throughout the
series I'm going to be targeting this
data so once that query runs
successfully then you get the h3 echo
here that says success populating the
pages table and then you do the exact
same thing so in insert into the blog
table it's the same kind of deal okay so
once you run this script you're going to
have two tables in your database and
they're going to have dummy data
inserted into them that we can work with
throughout this series now so I'll see
you in part two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
