with another video lesson in this one
we're going to demonstrate how to bind
the new html5 progress bar to an actual
JavaScript progressive event lots of
people know how to place the progress
bar on their page maybe any small child
with a keyboard could do that but very
few people know how to tie that new
html5 progress bar to an actual
JavaScript progressive event so we're
going to try and change all that right
now to where everybody knows how to tie
these new html5 things to JavaScript
events that take place down the rabbit
hole we go before we begin building
let's take a look at the finished
product so you see exactly what you'll
be learning and like always I will have
the complete script view guys to snatch
up if needed at develop PHP calm and the
link will be in the video's description
so let's go to file preview in browser
now keep in mind you have to choose the
correct browser here because 2014 is the
standardized release date for html5 so
it might not work in some of the
browsers that you try it and I'm going
to try it in Google Chrome I already
tried it in Firefox and worked in that
one too but I'll run it in Google Chrome
okay so when the task progress gets to
100% we update some element that we want
on the page letting the user know that
the process is complete and this is all
done with the new html5 progress element
and JavaScript tied to that element
let's start with the good old HTML and
body tags and we'll go down one line and
we're going to open up a new progress
tag
new html5 progress tag and let's go
ahead and close it off now within the
opening tag of the progress element
we're going to type in space ID and
we'll put equals whatever you want to
name it let's name it progress bar now
let's put in another space and this
attribute we're going to place in this
time is called value and that's equal to
zero that's what it's going to start at
that's its low end and upon completion
it will hit its max which we will set at
100 now these are user defined values so
you can set any values you want in there
but for most general purposes and for
like uploading images or media files you
would have this at a max of 100 all
right so let's press
roll s and preview it in the browser
okay so you see what that gives me is a
nice bar now if I change this value to
fifty you'll see that the bar gets
halfway filled and that's lovely
okay so let's go back to zero with that
now what I want to do is make my bar a
little bit longer because I don't like
the default length of it you see how
long it is the width I don't like the
default width so I'm going to put a
style attribute style equal to and let's
set the width the width colon the number
for what we want the width to be we can
set it at 300 px for pixels all right
now let's see what we get that gives us
a longer bar so you can see you can set
it to be any size you want you can also
set the height if you want so let's make
that maybe forty four pixels it'll be a
big beefy bar press ctrl s run it in the
browser and you have a big giant beefy
bar let's put a value in edges you can
see it real good fifty trow s f12 there
you go
that gives you a big giant beefy bar
really the default size is nice I'll
just leave mine default
okay now the progress tag the progress
element is all ready to go
the next line we're going to type in
span this is going to be a span element
with an ID of status because this is the
element that I'm going to use to hold
the number to show visually on the page
to the person next to the bar it's going
to hold the number and I'll just name
this status so the ID attribute has a
value of status so not only will I have
a bar I'm going to have a number right
next to the bar that also represents the
progressive event now let's make sure we
close off that span tag we don't have to
put anything in it and the last thing
we're going to do is a simple h1 tag and
inside of that h1 let's close that off
now in the opening tag I'm going to type
in a space and put ID a final message so
it makes good sense there you go
you don't have to put anything in that
either our JavaScript is going to put
things in that for us all right so let's
go right under the h1 tag and let's pop
in some JavaScript I'm not putting my
JavaScript in the head tag just for the
simple demonstration because I don't
want to have to program an onload event
and all kind of things like that
usually when you're doing a progressive
event like this it would be user
initiated so your whole page would be
loaded before they do anything anyway
the only reason I'm putting my
JavaScript underneath these elements is
so I don't have to run a window dot
onload it's just you know it skips that
step for me but it's important to
remember that in a normal situation it
would be a user initiated JavaScript
function I mean your progress bar
wouldn't be like mine and just start
going when the page loads up when the
person comes to your page is not going
to be a progress bar just going on it is
there no it's a user initiated event now
I'm going to pop in the JavaScript that
I custom coded for this example now all
I did was basically let me close this up
before I start explaining the way the
function is closed there's not too much
complicated stuff to look at right now
before I explain it so what I did was I
took JavaScript ability to animate
things and for this simple example I
wanted to just tie JavaScript
progressive event to that progress bar
so this function that I'm about to
explain and the one method set timeout
that's inside of it is really all about
animation now your functionality of your
progressive event would probably be when
somebody uploads something
okay now that being said let me show you
what's going on in this function the
first thing we do is before this
function runs actually that function is
just sitting there laying waiting and
it's not going to run right when your
page loads unless you tell it to which
this line right here tells it to the
right before I tell that function to run
I create a variable called amount loaded
and that's set to zero okay so basically
all I've done in JavaScript so far is
I've made an amount loaded variable with
a value of zero and then I run my
progress bar simulator function with
that amount loaded zero value load it
into it and that you see that function
progress bar simulator is right here so
progress bar sim has one argument coming
into it which is amount loaded so I just
made it short to Al that way within the
function you have access to that number
so now let's look at all the
load the meat inside of the function the
first thing we're going to do is create
two variables the first variable name is
bar next one is status then you know
what they represent this one represents
the status element we put on the page
here this one represents the progress
bar element and we get those by saying
document dot get element by ID and you
designate the element that you want to
target on the page so we get those
wrapped up into nice little variables
for easier use within our script because
you see how I'm using status right here
and bar right here I don't have to put
all this junk on each one of these lines
where I'm using those I can just put the
little word that's why we create
variables okay so status innerhtml
property is being affected and we're
making it equal to the number al which
at burst is going to be zero and we put
a percent symbol right next to it so
this status span right here will have
zero and a percent symbol placed into it
as the first action because amount
loaded is set to zero down here so that
will be the first action and will be
such a split second thing you probably
won't even see it and actually when this
function loops this al number keeps
changing so that's how you get to see a
progressive event and this number goes
from 1 all the way to 100 now the bar we
are targeting document dot get element
by ID progress bar here we're giving
that a value we're setting its value
attribute to that number al so remember
how we put the number 50 here actually
this needs to be set back to zero but
this is the value attribute right here
and you can set that in JavaScript it
doesn't have to be just a static thing
when you code your pages you can use
JavaScript to change that at any moment
you want
so we're saying bar dot value is equal
to al whatever al happens to be at that
particular pass through this function
now the next thing we do is we increment
the AL number so the number that al
represents gets incremented right here
by signifying plus plus on it so if it's
a 1 it becomes a 2 when this line runs
if it's a 97 it becomes a 98 when this
line runs now this next line here is
the magic of my little animated script
so this variable called sim and I just
named it sim short for simulator is
equal to the set timeout method in
JavaScript
actually let me run this press f12 now
you'll see it's running now but what I
want to do is show you that this number
is milliseconds so if I had and I'm
running into 300 milliseconds that's how
fast my thing is going to loop my little
animation so if I set this to 1000 that
becomes every second once every second
that progressive event is going to
increment and make my bar get bigger and
change that number yada yada yada so if
you wanted to move fast
you put that sucker on like 20 and watch
it fly
see now the way this animates is set
timeout calls a function called progress
bar sim to run every 300 milliseconds
and guess what that progress bar SIM
function is is the one we're in right
now so it's just looping on itself
this one this progress bar SIM function
and we're looping it on himself by using
set timeout here now here's the last
thing it's a little if condition this is
the if condition that we set up to
listen for the ending or the completion
of the progressive event okay so now
that we know that al is going to start
at 0 here and work its way all the way
up to 100 we can listen for and put an
evaluation in place to say if al is
equal to 100 then we know everything's
finished and we can update that status
span here and put in 100% and then the
bar value we can finalize to a setting
of 100 and then we simply clear time out
for our sim set timeout method that way
that won't run anymore
and this just pertains to my animation
so if you want to know how to animate in
JavaScript there you go
it animates my little thing until it
gets to a point when I don't want it to
animate anymore and I chose to use this
value getting to 100 to make this little
simulation for you now this last thing
is very simply just say
I get element by ID target the final
message-id element here which is an h1
tag and you affect its innerhtml
property you make it to a value that's
equal to process is complete and that's
it guys that's how it works it's very
simple now let me explain once again
that my function here is just a simple
animating function what it does is it
uses set timeout and it loops on itself
then I have this if condition in place
if it gets to a certain point then I
just simply stop my animation now let me
reiterate that yours would more likely
and in most common situations you would
be using this to show how much of a file
has been uploaded to the user you
wouldn't have just some animation like I
have but that's how you tie it to
JavaScript and that was the whole point
of this video lesson was to show you
guys how to tap in and tie javascript
progressive events whatever they may be
to that progress bar that new html5
progress bar element</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
