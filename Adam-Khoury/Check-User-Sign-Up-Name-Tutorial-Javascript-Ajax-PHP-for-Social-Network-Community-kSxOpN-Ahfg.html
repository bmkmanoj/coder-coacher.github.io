get a free script example to copy and
paste plus a video guide on the
programming logic involved to accomplish
this task and the task is checking a
user's name in your signup form as
they're filling the form out in real
time so if I type in the name Derrick or
something like that and I move my mouse
away to go and maybe fill out another
field or interact with anything else on
the page it says Derrick is OK in real
time and nothing has to refresh but
since the name Adam is already in the
database and if I tried to use that name
it'll say Adam is taken or any other
name that's already taken in your
database and I also threw in a couple of
extras for you guys in this tutorial
we're going to be also learning how to
check and see if the username starts
with a number so say something like that
first character must be a letter so you
can let them know that you're not going
to accept their username if it starts
with the number a lot of sites don't let
their user's name start with a number so
if they do something like that it's fine
as long as it doesn't start with a
number and I'm also going to show you
how if it's too short
say something like four to twenty
characters please or four to however
many characters you want it to be in
between you know what I'm saying just
put those two numbers here and I'll show
you in PHP how we're checking for that
and you can also limit this field so
they can only put in like 15 16
characters or whatever you want so
you're going to learn all that stuff
okay that's called ok since we already
discussed how it works and you already
saw that it works and actually that was
live on my server world of web crafts
comm where I was tapping into the actual
database there and checking user names
and this is the exact script I was using
and I'm going to give this script to you
guys so you can copy and paste it what
there is is some PHP on top is some
JavaScript here in the head tag section
and then in the body section we have an
input text field here which I'll explain
to you and then a span tag that has an
ID of username status so what I'll do is
explain the HTML very quickly first
because there's not much going on there
then I'll explain the JavaScript that's
sitting here and then we'll finally
discuss the PHP that's up top because
really that's how the application will
flow the user interacts with your HTML
here javascript picks up the event which
is on blur and then javascript then
posts to PHP which is up top here so
we'll tackle it in that order because it
makes good sense to okay let's take a
close look at these HTML lines which is
only to HTML lines in my body tag here
the first one is an input type text
field for gathering the user name which
you would have in your form now we've
given this input field a name attribute
and an ID attribute with the value of
you name and the ID attribute is how we
will be getting the value of what they
typed into the field in JavaScript will
be attaining the value using this ID
now the onblur event what happens on the
onblur event is that's when the user's
mouse after their typing in the cursors
flashing in the field and they typed in
whatever when their mouse leaves that
field and interacts with something else
on the page that's when the onblur event
will fire off and what we have it set to
do here is execute a function called
check user name which is a javascript
function sitting in this javascript area
here i'm going to show you that function
in just a second and then the last
attribute is the max length so they can
only type in 15 characters into my field
now this span tag has an ID of username
status and what this is just sitting
here waiting it kind of waits right next
to the form field like you saw in the
example and the demo in the beginning it
waits right next to the born field and
it gets updated with text when your
JavaScript is running and it happens
real time without the page refreshing
while javascript is doing certain things
it can update to this span tag any kind
of text u1 or HTML so it can be a gif
and animated gif loader whatever you
want but different HTML or text can be
popped into this span tag at any given
point that we want now let's move along
to quickly discussing this Java
which the JavaScript's going to have a
function called check username that's
going to execute the onblur event of
this text field so let's look at that
code now what we have here is in Ajax
post to PHP if you want to understand
how this is working I don't want to
waste anybody's time by doing redundant
material so a develop PHP com two months
ago which I'm working on updating
develop PHP calm if anybody's curious
I've got new design changes I'm updating
all of the data there and I'm going to
start adding a lot more material to
develop PHP calm in about two weeks
you're going to see a new design new
navigation system when you start getting
into the lessons here there's going to
be a new navigation system on the left
but back to the point right here Ajax
post a PHP file with HTTP request
let's Ajax so I explained it fully in
this tutorial this is a video tutorial
that you can watch and what that will do
is tell you exactly how this code is
working right here because that's the
exact code I'm using all right so now
you know the JavaScript now let's
discuss the PHP and I will explain that
because that's not in any other lessons
yet the first thing we're doing in the
PHP is we set an if condition which you
can see it nests at the top and the
bottom of the script so everything here
all this highlighted code right here is
within that if condition nest and the if
condition states if is set the posted
variable name to check and that's the
posted variables coming from your
JavaScript Ajax post remember right here
you see the little variable called name
to check it's sending the username to
that to the PHP it's posting name to
check right there and there's a second
condition here that says and we want to
make sure the posted variable name to
check is not equal to nothing because if
there's nothing in the field or if they
type nothing in then we really don't
want this script to even execute okay so
if those
two conditions meet okay and everything
is hunky-dory then we move along to all
the code within that if conditions nest
first thing you want to do is include
once you're or require once you are
connect to MySQL dot PHP file or if you
just want to sync your MySQL connection
lines directly in here you can do that
but I like using a connect to MySQL file
for anytime that I need to connect to my
database in any my scripts so basically
you just connect to your database here
whichever way you prefer to do it then
we gather up the user name that they're
trying to type in that we want to check
that you can acquire the posted variable
right there and we run it through a
progression filtering out unwanted
character so we're filtering out
everything but lower case and upper case
a through Z and numbers 0 through 9
so we're filtering out spaces anything
that's not a letter or a number is
getting filtered out of this variable by
using preg replace on the posted
variable then that gets stored in a
local PHP variable called username then
we run a MySQL query which is going to
be sunk into this SQL you name check
variable the MySQL query reads select ID
from user table whatever your members
tables names you put right there where
user name field within that table is
equal to the username that this guy is
trying to type in limit 1 so if you're
selecting and you find that user name is
already in there then you know that you
can tell them it's already taken and how
you do that is you can check the MySQL
num rows on that query and that number
is placed into this you name check
variable and we do the you name check on
that variable right down here but first
before we check that variable we want to
check if the string length to see if
it's greater than or less than 4 rather
so if it's less than 4 characters we
want to tell them 4 to 20 characters
please or 4 to 15 characters please and
you can also check if the string length
is greater than 15 you
also exit the script if you want but
JavaScript and the HTML should be taking
care of that for you by limiting the
text field
now the next condition is the one where
remember in the demo I was showing you
that it won't allow them to put a number
as their first character of their
username that's how we're doing this
right here we're using the is numeric
function of PHP to check the user names
first letter the method I use to get the
first letter was very simple each string
is really just an array of characters
it's an array of text you can take that
first character out of that string of
text just by claiming the zero index of
that array now finally the last little
bit and then we're done is if the
username check variable which is a
number here that's being created by the
MySQL num rows function if that number
is less than one that means the user
name is okay for them to have because it
wasn't found in the database else if
that number is 1 that means that it was
found and they can't have it so you tell
them that name is there taken till you
got to try something else and that is
the whole script my friends there's your
PHP there is your JavaScript and there's
your simple HTML and this can be used
for all kind of other things not just
checking username you know you can check
all kinds of different stuff and use
many different events you don't have to
use the event method of onblur you can
use on change onmouseover onmouseout all
of those different events exist and they
can fire off JavaScript functions at any
time you want I'm gonna have a link to
where you can get this script copy and
paste this script in the video's
description area and it might be on
world of web crafts temporarily while I
fix up develop PHP com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
