SEC 2.0 social network training series
is going to work with JSON objects in
certain aspects of it and will be
completely reprogrammed using more
modern approaches so before the new web
intersects series begins this winter I
want to deliver a couple of quick
lessons on JSON before that time comes
JSON stands for JavaScript object
notation it is a lightweight format for
creating objects that is part of and
built into JavaScript JSON is part of
JavaScript and not a separate entity it
is built into the raw JavaScript
programming language so you can just use
it JSON is becoming a very popular data
interchange format so much that is
beginning to battle XML in popularity
and usage in tutorial number two we will
retrieve database information and return
it to your JavaScript application in the
JSON encoded format but first we must
learn to parse JSON data and create JSON
objects in the JavaScript side of our
applications so that's what we're going
to do now okay you can see I'm starting
with the bare bones of an html5 web
document and I have my script element in
place so you would just want to get to
the point to where I am now but let's
create a new variable that's going to
represent the first JSON object we'll
call it object 1 obj one for short and
that's equal to the opening curly brace
and then you put a space and close the
curly brace and then put a semicolon and
that's your first object but it's empty
now so object one is ready and
initialize but it has no value in it yet
there's no data and JSON data works like
key value pairs so the first thing I'm
going to put in is the key my first key
for my first piece of data within my
object is going to be user and the value
for user is going to be John so you can
see I put the key of user and then I put
the colon and then within double quotes
I put the string John now to put the
next piece of data within that JSON
object I'm going to put a comma a space
let's type in age colon
and then if you want to put a number or
a boolean value in here a true or false
or a number you don't have to wrap it in
double quotes or single quotes you can
just put the number in like that then
let's go on to the next piece of data
within this JSON object comma space
country : and in between double quotes
let's just put United States so you can
see we have three pieces of data one is
a number and two are strings so remember
the key is always on the left side of
your colon the value goes on the right
side of the colon and you can see it's
sort of like an array but it it opens up
more possibilities of data indexing and
data handling then arrays could offer
you okay so now let you understand the
structure of that one let's make two
more that are sort of identical this
one's going to be named object two and
this one will be named object three this
object represents John this object
represents the user will and this object
represents the user a BL and you can
even name that object a BL if you wanted
to or uppercase like that but for
demonstration purposes we're just going
to name them object one two and three
okay now here's where the beauty of JSON
really comes into play I'm going to
create object 4 that's going to be equal
to three new different data objects
first one is going to be called u one
that represents user one that's my key
and then colon and the value for u one
is going to be equal to obj one which is
object one which represents the user
John and you can use your objects for
any kind of data handling it doesn't
have to handle users you can be handling
a list a shopping card that somebody is
using to shop on your site you can
handle all kind of things okay so all we
got to do is put a comma here and then
we put u2 which represents user to : obj
- comma space u3 :
obj 3 so do you see what we've done
we've created three objects here that
each have multiple pieces of data within
them
and they can be numbers they can be
arrays they can be boolean values they
can be strings whatever you want to
place in them and then for object four
we've deeply nested those first three
objects that we've made so we have
objects within objects so you can really
do deep data nesting within json by
placing objects within objects within
objects and you can go really as many
levels as as it will handle okay now
we'll demonstrate how to work with all
of that data so we'll type in document
right which will render some output to
the page when we run it in the browser
and we can use dot notation to get into
each of the properties within all of
these data objects so data object one
here has three properties user age and
country I know I called them key value
pairs before because that's really what
they are but this is really a property
user is a property of object two and it
has a value of we'll age is a property
of object 2 as well and it has a value
of 27 so you see how that works so each
of these properties can be accessed
using dot notation so you just go obj
one dot user so you know what that will
give you if you look at obj one user
we're going to get a value of John
written to the page so now let's render
this file in the browser press ctrl s
make sure you save it and then render it
in your favorite browser see John now if
I want to access the third one obj three
dot user that'll give me a BL from
Mexico and then you can write a string
just put the plus sign a couple of
double quotes another plus sign and type
in obj three dot H and then plus sign
again double quote double quote plus
sign and then obj three country and then
here in between your double quotes you
can type in so this would say a BL is
the age number will show up there you
can type in years old and lives in
Mexico so now ctrl s to save it and
browser IBL is 19 years old and lives in
Mexico so you see how that works you can
just use dot notation to get to all of
those properties for the data object
which pulls the value but once you
reference the property the value is
pulled now the value can also be changed
so let's take that same line ctrl C
let's go down to lines control V just
paste the same exact line now in between
those two lines let's update a be LS age
or we can change this country let's move
him to another place in the world about
Italy so let's just say obj 3 dot
country is equal to Italy so before that
document.write happens again let's put a
horizontal rule just to separate them in
between double quotes just put a
horizontal rule HR right there now run
that in your browser see our BL is 19
years old and lives in Mexico then then
after we updated it the country property
in object 3 right here this line did
that it updated it from Mexico to Italy
so that object is forever change now
object 3 one of its properties and that
is evident in our output here in the
browser the IBL was first from Mexico
and all of a sudden E's from Italy
okay let's take that document write a
char line and let's put it under that
line there actually let's put two of
those in place and remove the HR from
the last one now I'm going to show you
how to work with object for remember
object for was the one that had deeply
nested objects within objects so what
you can do is use dot notation to go
deep within all of the object levels so
let's say document write obj for dot u 2
dot country so what that should give us
is we go into object for which is this
one now inside object for it has three
properties u1 u2 u3 so we use dot
notation to go into u2 right here u2
holds a value of object to which object
2 is sitting right there so if we go
into the country
property it'll pull United Kingdom so
that's what we should get as a result
from that document right see United
Kingdom and you can make a string out of
that similarly by saying just copy all
that put user here plus double-quote
double-quote plus put that one back
there is from and then you run that in
your favorite browser so it says will is
from United Kingdom okay so using dot
notation you can go deep into all of
your object levels no matter how deeply
you have them nested and actually this
code that you see right here or really
this code that you see right here can be
written the same way it can be expressed
the same way like this so instead of
that alert
let's do document right again let's just
put in another a char will just separate
all of these so you can see all the
results so really this and this will
give you the same output and you can see
this looks more like how we go into
arrays and dig data out of array indexes
so let's press f12 or whatever way that
you render in browser and you see we get
the same output so you can use the dot
notation like we use here or you can use
the brackets okay now I'm just going to
comment all of these out we're going to
go on with a another example that is a
little more complex because it deals
with arrays nested inside of your
objects okay I'm going to pop in two
arrays that I previously created and
they're very simple JavaScript arrays
this array has three items within it and
its name its variable name is meats this
next one is variable name fruit and it
has four items within it now let's
create a JSON object to hold those so
where we up to object four let's make
this next one bar object five obj 5 is
equal to
opening curly brace close your curly
brace semicolon now we can put ARR one
that stands for array one so that's the
property : on the right side of the
colon we put the value we want so let's
just put meats and that represents
that's the variable name for this first
array that we created for that holds
beef pork and lamb now we'll just put a
comma space ARR two colon fruit alright
so now we have object five that has two
arrays within it and its properties are
array 1 and array 2 so under that let's
type in document right open and close
parentheses semicolon and in between
your parentheses let's type in obj v dot
arr1 go into array 1 and let's get the
first value which is 0 since all arrays
have an index starting index of 0 so
beef is that 0 if I wanted pork or the
second element in that array I would put
a 1 here so let's just leave it 1 and
you'll see it will select pork it will
write pork render that to the browser
see it wrote pork cuz I went in and got
and grabbed that out so knowing that we
can write a string sort of like this
that goes into object 5 twice but it
digs into array 1 here and it digs into
array 2 here so let's see what we get F
12 pork with Apple for dinner that
sounds lovely so you can see if picked
the meat and it picked one of the fruits
let me just uncomment all of these now
and you have a whole bunch of examples
that show you how to dig into those data
objects even update those data objects
right here remember we changed Mexico to
Italy within object 3 country property
so it's very simple to update the data
within those objects and it'll be
changed from that point on once you
update now we'll be showing you guys
more in-depth lessons regarding JSON
data handling and the next one actually
will show you how
to use PHP to echo JSON encoded data
back to your JavaScript applications
that way you can use like an ajax
request to that PHP file the PHP file
instantly spit back some JSON encoded
data that was dug out of your database
you can dig data out of your MySQL
database using PHP and JSON encode it
get it ready to be json encoded and send
it echo it back so that will be in
tutorial number two so let's see what we
have here let's and make sure
everything's good okay that's fine
actually will is displaying twice there
so let's just comment this one out
because that was just showing you the
alternative method instead of using the
dot notation like we did here that was
the alternative method with the brackets
to dig that information out of the
object so now you know how to create
simple JSON objects and these this is
how you would get your information back
from your database something like object
four here and then within your
JavaScript you just go picking things
out and getting what you need updating
things whatever send it back boom bubble
home and I don't know how deeply data
can be nested within JSON but it seems
like you can just keep putting objects
within objects within objects within
objects and you'll have almost all
database ways of information within one
JSON object is crazy I know that's not a
reality but that's not something you
would want to do realistically but I
think it has that kind of potential to
nest that deeply alright so you know how
to create your basic objects and you
know how to deeply nest objects within
objects you know how to output the data
that you want to get within those
objects you know how to update data put
arrays and multi-dimensional arrays you
can if you want to learn about
multi-dimensional JavaScript arrays you
can go to develop PHP and it's in the
new JavaScript section they're all about
multi-dimensional arrays and associative
arrays and really an object is very
similar this basic objects are very
similar to any of the objects that you
see here are similar to an associative
for a because an associative array has
key and values a regular array like you
see down here it just holds values an
associative array has keys and values
just like a JSON object so I'll see you
lovely people in part 2 if you're
interested in and will show you how to
get some data back from the server and
parse it in your JavaScript applications
by creating an ajax request for that
data and it will come back json encoded
and we can use the methods that we
learned in this lesson to parse it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
