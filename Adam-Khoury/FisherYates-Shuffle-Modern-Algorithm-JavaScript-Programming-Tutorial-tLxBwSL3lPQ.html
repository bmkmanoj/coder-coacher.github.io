exercise we'll demonstrate the concepts
behind the fishery eight modern shuffle
algorithm using this physical example on
the table we're going to convey the
logic behind the algorithm and discuss
the concept then we're going to write
the logic in JavaScript programming to
add an array shuffle method to
JavaScript array object but having this
visual aid first will help you in
understanding exactly how the algorithm
is going to run according to the fishery
aids modern shuffle algorithm we should
loop from back to front over this array
by passing index position zero so we
have eight items in our array or eight
elements in our array that means this
array according to the fishery age
modern shuffle logic is only supposed to
run seven times so you bypass index
position zero within your loop so what
happens is the first pass of the loop
we're going to affect index position
seven because as most of you guys know
all arrays start with an index position
of 0 so we have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so we're
starting with index position 7 so what
we have to do in the first pass of the
loop is generate a random number between
0 &amp;amp; 7 now let's say that random number
happens to be a 3 so we go to index
position 0 1 2 3 and we swamp this value
for value at index position 7 then what
happens in the next pass of the loop is
we generate a random number this time
that's only between 0 &amp;amp; 6 so let's say
that random number happens to turn out
to be a 2 or a 1 then we go to index
position 1 0 1 we swap that value for
the index position 6 so basically each
time you're switching the value found at
the index position of the loop for the
random value in the next pass of the
loop we're going to be affecting index
position 5 so in that pass of the loop
we generate a random number that's only
between 0 &amp;amp; 5 and let's say that happens
to land on 5 that means you don't do
anything that
gee but if it happens to land on let's
say zero then you go to index position
zero if your random number happens to be
0 you go to index position zero and swap
that value out but the value at index
position 5 so if your random number
happens to be the same number that
you're on and your index position of the
loop then you don't do anything now the
next pass of the loop
we go to index position four inside of
this pass of the loop we only generate a
random number between zero and four
let's say that happens to be a three we
go to zero one two three and we swap the
value at index position three for index
position four then the next pass of the
loop we affect index position three we
generate a random number between zero
and three let's say that happens to be a
1 we go to 0 1 we take the value at
index position 1 and we swap it for
index position 3 in the next pass of our
loop we're going to be affecting index
position 2 of the array let me generate
a random number between 0 &amp;amp; 2 let's say
that happens to be a 0 and we take index
position 0 and we swap it for index
position 2 and in the final pass of the
loop we're going to affect index
position 1 and we generate a random
number in between 0 &amp;amp; 1 so let's say it
happens to be a 0 then we take the value
found at index position 0 when we swap
it for the value found at index position
1 and that's how it works each time that
you do it it will be different because
different random numbers would be
generated each time and that's the logic
behind the Fisher gates modern shuffle
algorithm now what we'll do is open up
our favorite code editor and we'll
program this in JavaScript and I'll show
you how it looks in JavaScript
first establish a new example that HTML
file and in it we're going to open up a
script element make sure we close it
let's establish our array and this array
is going to have eight elements within
it first element is an a that's at index
position zero index position one we're
going to have a B all the way through H
now the next thing we do is create some
variables that our loop is going to
require the first one is going to be
named I and that's going to be equal to
our array length then we can put a comma
and the next variable we want to
establish is J and that's going to
represent our random number that we
generate through the loop each time the
loop passes the next variable is temp
and that variable is going to hold the
temporary value so we can do some
swapping between the two indexes in the
array that we need to swap now the next
thing we'll need is a while loop open
closed parenthesis open curly brace go
down a couple of lines and put in your
closing curly brace now after this loop
runs we're just going to simply write
ourselves the array so we can see
exactly what it looks like after it's
all shuffled so in the while loops
condition the expression we want to put
in place is while - minus I is greater
than zero we're putting that condition
because we don't ever want it to get to
the zero index in the array now what
happens when you put minus minus I is
it's going to decrement the index the
array is length each time so when the
array starts it's going to have a length
of eight because there's eight elements
in this array so the first time the loop
runs the eye is going to equal seven in
the loops code the second time it runs
it'll equal six until it gets to zero
and then it stops but it won't run the
zero index now the first thing we do
inside of the loop is we establish the
value for the J which is going to be the
random number that we generate each time
the loop passes and this code right here
is how we get a random number generated
between zero and I each time the loop
passes so the first time the loop passes
it'll generate a random number between
zero and seven second time the loop
passes it'll generate a random number
between zero and six and so on then the
next value we want to
up is the temp we want to get the the
random index positions value so we put
array and we target the J index position
the random index position we make sure
we grab that value in the temp variable
then the next line is we take the array
at the random index and we swap it for
the value at the index position of the
loop so the first time the loop passes I
is going to be equal to seven so
whatever's in the seventh index position
within the array is going to get swapped
with whatever's in the random index
position in the array so the last line
we need to complete that we target the
index position in the loop passing and
we put the temp value within that so
basically what these three lines do it
just it does the swapping of the two
values into the two index position they
need to go in if we take that and we run
this in our favorite browser software
you can see we get a shuffled array and
each time we refresh each time that
little application runs it gets a
different shuffle and the fishery eights
modern shuffle algorithm is supposed to
result in an unbiased efficient shuffle
because you're mixing the array the
original array into itself now we want
to have something that's a little more
reusable and useful so what we'll do is
we'll add this to the array object as a
method so we'll type in array dot
prototype dot the name of the method
that you want will name this shuffle is
equal to function open close parenthesis
opening curly brace go down a clever
blinds and put in your closing curly
brace and what we can do is take this
code that we need and put it inside this
these variables here and this while loop
control X and put it up inside there
let's make sure we indent this correctly
now inside of it all we have to do is
change where we are referencing our
array to this so anywhere you see a our
our you're going to change that to this
and then the last thing to return this
we put return this so that will return
the shuffled array and then under the
array itself when we establish the array
in our code we can then refer to that
shuffle method on the array so we can
save our result is equal to arr
whatever your array is and then you
target the shuffle method run the
shuffle method on that array and then
you can write the result to yourself to
inspect it we run that in our favorite
browser software you can see we get the
shuffled array shuffled according to the
fishery eights modern algorithm okay so
on the page where this video is going to
live a develop PHP calm I'm probably
going to have three different examples
the last example I'm going to give you
guys is just like the first example we
wrote but I put a few comments in place
at the top and this is running
procedurally this isn't the adding it as
a method but I just wanted to put this
version up for developer reasons so if
you run this in your favorite browser it
shows you every loop pass and exactly
what's happening within each loop passed
so for instance the first loop password
set we're affecting index position 7 of
the array we generate a random number
ranging between 0 and 7 the generated
number happened to be a 6 so we swap
values found that index position 7 and 6
and it goes all that way all the way
down and do you get to index position 1
in the array now the little messages I
wrote up top was the loop should iterate
over the array from back to front
bypassing index 0 the loop should run
array dot length minus 1 times now each
loop pass generate a random number
ranging between 0 and I and each loop
pass you swap the index I value with the
value found at index J J being the
random index this version of the code
will just help you as a developer really
wrap your head around what's happening
in the script ok so I hope you guys have
found all of this helpful and remember
the three different examples
we wrote three different scripts will
all be available under the video in
little different code sections and I'll
put a link to the page where you guys
can see all that code under the video if
you are at YouTube watching this video
just check in the description area and
I'll have a little link to the page
where you can get at all the code so
that's how you can program shuffle
methods into your favorite programming
language according to the fishery Yeates
modern shuffle algorithm and it could be
any programming language that you're
good at scripting in for instance PHP
Java whatever but a lot of programming
languages already have their own shuffle
function ready to go for instance PHP it
has a built-in shuffle function my
JavaScript has no shuffle methods for
its array objects that's something you
have to put in place okay talk to you
