lesson will be taking the xml magic menu
the ActionScript 3 XML magic menu
tutorial that I created and expanding it
into an XML magic pages tutorial and
basically this is really cool because
it's what this is going to show you is
how to export the file okay so here's
the file when it's rendered out you can
see on stage the there's no menu sitting
there the menus created through the for
each loop in the code and what i have on
stage is a dynamic text field an image
folder and just a regular background
rectangle there and this is what's
inside of the page window movie clip and
the page window movie clip is on the
main scene all by itself on this layer
and then there's background layer and
then there's a code layer and what
happens is when the files rendered out
the magic menu pops up with all the
numbers and then using this XM file
which is in this download package by the
way you can get this source file the
whole package source file for everything
the Fla file the flash source file the
xml file everything you need to see how
this works and to get to the code and
all the comments in my code you can go
to develop PHP calm and download all the
source files you need for this tutorial
and all the others so so when we hit the
buttons in the magic menu it goes into
this movie clip this page window movie
clip and instructs what the dynamic text
field should have populated in it and it
instructs the little image holder well
what dynamic image to throw into that
spot so let's look at this thing again
you know
okay so if I click one you'll see it
brings in an image and it says page one
text is blah blah blah blah blah page 2
text is blah blah blah blah new image
press 3 it's a new image and page three
texts blah blah blah so on and so forth
and there can be 50 of those if you need
them and here's the xml file and each
menu item that you put into this xml
file it will automatically magically
make a number in flash and a page and
you just put the page text here and you
put your thumb your thumbnail right now
and i have the thumbnails or in a folder
called page thumbs you can see them
right the thumbnail view and here's all
my thumbnails and so that's how it's all
render out magically and dynamically and
this one is really you know for the
advanced flashers who are putting
together Flash content management
systems possibly for clients or for
software applications you know you can
make a nice content management system
using this XML structure and run it all
into flash using the for each loop to
make these magic pages and they are one
last time will show you you can see this
demo on the page that develop PHP can go
and play with it and i'll put a link to
the xml file so you can even look at the
xml file before you download the package
all right we'll see you guys next lesson
hope you enjoy this one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
