intersect where we're learning how to
create a community or social networking
type website using PHP MySQL flash and a
couple of other fun tools and in this
part of the series we're going to be
creating the account settings page which
is the page that will allow your members
to edit their account settings like
change password delete my account and
other things like that like if you go to
the YouTube account settings and you're
used to account you'll see the type of
things I'm talking about we won't give
you all that stuff but will show you the
the basics of creating a page like that
and a couple of the basic functions that
you might want to give your members okay
so let's just go into our source files
and let's grab the edit profile page
it's going to be very similar in
programming let's just open it up I'm in
Dreamweaver cs4 save this as
edit settings
save it
and then we'll have to go through here
and put in the proper forms we need so
let's say this would say well first
let's go into the code and change up our
meta name tags and everything actually
on this page I'm going to remove the
keywords and description tags altogether
this is not the kind of page that I
would even want to be spidering at all
in the search engines or anything so
there's no need for that to be there or
any of this or that or that edit
settings this will be the title that
they see in their browser window in that
little tab you know and down in the
bottom and then everything else looks
good okay so now we go into design view
and we're going to change a few things
here make this say the right thing so
I'll change with that text says this is
the account settings page so we don't
need that edit your account settings
and then the first item up for bid will
be I guess change password so I'm going
to pop in a little form here and then
we'll work on the parsing mechanism for
that so let's just get rid of all these
other ones for now we're going to have
different forms in air all together get
that out of there so right in between
those two horizontal rules right there
I'll put maybe the change password form
okay so I've created a little form here
and popped it into the page in very much
the same way I did in these the section
of this series that deals with creating
the edit profile page for the user and
let's go ahead and look at the split
view Dreamweaver and let's discuss with
that form is made up of you need to know
how to make the forms you can go and
visit that earlier lesson ok so the form
itself is inside of a table you can see
here and the table set sixty percent
align center with the cell padding of
three just to get some space around all
the elements in there so they're not all
crunched together on the cell edges so
on the in the first cell or in the first
row we have a little title says change
your password and then we'll have the
members name right there so we'll just
dynamically render out member here right
now I'm not doing that yet but I will in
a moment and then the next row in the
table is where they put their current
password and this is an input text field
that has a an ID of current pass and the
name is current path so when its parts
to the PHP script that's the variable
we're going to be looking for for that
one the variable for the next one which
is create new password is going to be
new pass one so the PHP script the
parser will be looking for that variable
for this field and for this next field
new past two will be what the script is
looking for and then I put a hidden
field here with the value of past change
that way our parser file knows which
element of the or which part of the
person's account settings we want to
parse out and change in the database and
then we just have our input button here
that says change password and that's
pretty much all there is to that and so
in part 23 i'm going to show you the
parsing which will be coming up very
soon the parsing of this form and
creation of the edit settings parse that
PHP page because you'll see the form
action here is edit settings parsed at
PHP which is not even created yet and
the method is post so we're posting all
these four variables to this page which
I'm going to create in part 23 stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
