demonstrate how to work with the border
image property introduced in css3 since
it is css3 authors should view it as an
experimental feature for now now I made
just a very simple border frame for this
experiment but yours can be as fancy as
you like and let's take a look at the
finished product before we get into the
code so you can see as I resize my
window or no matter what the users
screen sizes the border can be any width
or height and still maintain its nice
appearance because what actually happens
is the image gets sliced up into nine
parts and that's what allows it to be
any size or scale and just so you can
see it before we begin this is my frame
dot PNG image sitting on my desktop and
here's a preview of it this is the
actual size okay our example HTML file
just has two ordinarily styled divs and
I gave them an a red outline it's a red
dashed outline that way we can see the
outline of the divs as we're working so
let's see what that renders now each one
I just put a style inline attribute to
give them a height but in a real-world
situation the content within them would
determine their height so this really
doesn't even have to be there and before
we apply the boarder image I want to
take you into my graphics editing
software and show you something real
quick so I'm going to zoom in on the
image that is my frame and let me just
pull out a shape and I'm going to draw
the shape in at the corner and I want to
grab the whole corner of my design of my
frame so you can see I have a width of
28 and the height of 28 so if I bring
the opacity down you can see that the
number that I'm going to have to target
for the width of my frame is 28 pixels
or 28 all right so what's going to
happen when we apply the code is this
image is going to get sliced up into
nine sections now this is one section
this is going to be another section each
corner is a section so you have one two
three four
and then five six seven eight nine so
this image is sliced up into nine
sections when we apply the code that
we're about to apply so let me remove
these and get back to the normal image
now to make the magic happen for our
containers let's just go into our style
rule and we're going to set a border of
twenty eight pixels remember that number
28 we're going to set that as the border
width and under that let's apply the
border image property now the border
image property is shorthand that authors
can use to specify all of these
properties all at once in a single line
so in one single declaration you can
assign the values for all of these
properties and we'll take a look at
those properties in just a moment
alright let's get rid of this and let's
see what we have now okay so now you can
see exactly what's going on all right
now let's take this border down to maybe
five pixels refresh you see what's
happening it's scaling the border 15
pixels and it won't be its actual size
until I get up to 28 because that is the
actual width of that the border frame or
the frame border so when I go to 28 it's
the actual size of my graphics now what
if I reduce this number down to 15 down
to 7 so you see what's happening so if I
go up instead of 28 let's go 36 it
should all be smaller all right let's
get that back on 28 now we can remove
our outline but you might want to keep
the outline in place while you're
experimenting now we'll quickly show you
how to change this back to the longhand
version of the properties that way if
you ever want to fine tune anything in
specific by itself first we have the
border image source property and that's
just the URL so we can get rid of these
two parameters because this only accepts
the one parameter or the one value now I
add the border
image slice and border image repeat
there's also a border image width
property and a border image outset
property I'll show you all the
properties at the end of the video and
I'll lead you to pages where the they're
all referenced so let's see what we get
we should get the same exact rendering
and we do so this is the you can call it
the longhand approach to the shorthand
version that you saw just a moment ago
but shorthand is so much easier now
let's go under the border image repeat
and let's put in the border image with
property I'm going to set that to 28 and
then remove the border property that I
had up top let's see what we get so you
can see we get a similar rendering but
our content will have to add more
padding and stuff like that
in order for our content to be within
the little frame so that's why I just
chose to have the border property as
well let's see what we get we have the
border and border image width now let's
change this to something like 10 and see
how that alters the appearance of
everything
alright let's leave it back on 28 now
we're going to take a look at border and
this is the last border image property
order image outset so you can specify a
number here or a pixel length so I'm
just going to put the 28 pixels now it's
going to move the whole thing outside of
the element it's going to set the frame
outside of the element so let's refresh
so you see how the frame has moved
outside its outset now let's change that
number just to maybe 5 and you'll see
that the outline is now inside of that
frame and it'll keep being pushed
outside the amount that you set it here
and this can also be a number like if I
put that on 5 and render you'll see it's
a totally different effect it's huge
because this number is relative if you
don't put the pixel on it it's relative
but I don't want any outside so I'll
just leave this on 0 pixels now the last
thing we have to talk about is repeat
because the rest of these are just no
that you can alter this is the only one
that really takes key words that you
might want to understand okay here we
are at the dock for border image repeat
property now let's take a look at the
values we can stretch repeat round or
space the repeat effect so these are the
key words that we can use in place where
I have repeat we can change that for
stretch round or space and don't worry
I'm going to lead you to all of these
docks for all these properties and the
links under the video all of the
properties we were working with will be
linked so you can get to them now I'll
actually have to change the graphics for
you guys to see the effect of the repeat
alteration so I'll just put a little dot
and I'll make it Orange and I'll put it
right dere and I'll also put one on the
other side right there I'll bring them
down a little bit actually I'll just put
them in the center as best I can
now I'm going to save this then go back
to my code and render this and now you
can see I have little dots repeating to
there now let's change this to stretch
render it now the little dot gets
stretched according to how tall this
slice becomes so repeat might be an
effect that you want
instead of stretch but sometimes you
might want to use stretch now all we
have left is round keyword so let's see
what that renders it's going to repeat
them evenly then space okay so that's
really all of the options now remember
your lengths like the pixel lengths
these can be different units like e/m
you're gonna have a.m. or you don't even
have to have a unit it could just be a
number or percentages these slices could
be percentages alright so now that we're
done we can remove the outline and enjoy
our finished effects now mine isn't very
attractive and I made it I designed mine
in such a way so you guys could really
see what was going on but you can really
make some remarkable looking boxes nice
custom boxes that nobody else is going
to have with your own custom graphics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
