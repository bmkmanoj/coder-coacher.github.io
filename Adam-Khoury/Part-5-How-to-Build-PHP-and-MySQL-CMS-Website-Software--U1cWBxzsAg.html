building a customs content management
system using PHP and MySQL now we have
everything we need on the front end of
the site things are coming in dynamic
page bodies are being displayed
according to what's clicked in the
dynamic menu our little custom modules
show up that we placed and now we want
to create an admin Center a back-end
system for the people who are going to
be responsible for managing the site
content the pages and all we need is
little sign-in form I'm just going to
put it in the very bottom I might add a
break tag right after this table here in
Dreamweaver and don't worry all this
code is going to be available for
download free so if you don't have
Dreamweaver you'll still be able to get
to the code and see what was done using
WordPad and notepad
ok voiced all we need down here where I
made the break tag I just put a little
break tag after my page body down and
I'm gonna type in the word admin and
then put a link on it to a new directory
called admin how about admin a straight
door keep it official administrate order
that'll be the directory
and let's just leave it just like that
that way it'll open the index page of
the directory all by itself all right
Rico let's Center that bad boy go into
the code view give a line equals center
there that's not deprecated now you can
not have to yell at me at all
we can be friends me and all the big
geeks alrighty now we've got admin link
there at the bottom it's going to go to
a new directory called administrator so
all we have to do is create that
directory and have an index page in that
directory now here I already have an
index page set up and going we're going
to use session variables to allow the
site administrator to manage the site
from this back-end system okay so I'm
going to create a folder now and here I
have one called
admin but we need one called
administrator and that one I was just
messing around with don't even don't
even look at that it's not here let's
call this administrator and inside of
that we want an index file this index
file
so let's file save as put this in
administrator folder index update links
no so now we have an index page in our
administrator folder and that's what
we're going to give navigation to not
linked very simple and this index file
is going to have a header that checks to
see whether the person who's visiting
this index is logged in or not if
they're not logged in how to go buddy
you can't stay though what we'll do is
go into the code view
so this index page in the admin Center
right above the doctype let's place a
PHP code block
and right here will type in session
underscore start open close parenthesis
semicolon here we're going to include
the file I'm sorry I had to think about
that for a second
include once in between parentheses or
in between double quotes we're going to
type in admin check and that's the name
of the file and we're going to write
here in a second it's going to do
checking to see if the admins logged in
or not you want to do that first thing
when this page runs or any page in the
admin Center runs and there you could
set it up in a header type situation but
for this example I'm just going to set
it up like this it's simple to do and
everything is understandable the way
it's laid out really good for beginners
getting in there and understanding it
okay so now and we're including admin
checked out PHP at this point when this
is included the code from within that
file is going to execute it's going to
do all the checking and if it doesn't
make it it won't make it past another
line of this code of this script it's
going to give any output that we decide
if it fails that the admin is not logged
in we can just give a link we can send
them back to the home page automatically
do whatever we want okay let's go to the
file new PHP and get rid of that code
and let's pop in the code that we need
to do the checking so let's go to the
PHP tab put a PHP block right there in
line two
I'm going to paste in the code and I'm
going to explain it to you right now
okay so what we have here is an if
condition that's just checking to see if
the session admin is equal or does not
equal the terminator because when they
when we make the login form for them in
part 6 the next part of this series
we're going to assign a session named
admin a session variable named admin and
its value is going to be the Terminator
give me whatever you want and if it
doesn't equal up here then we just say
actually I've got one too many brackets
or parentheses there there we go then
we're going to give them some output
it's going to say only the administrator
can view this directory and that's going
to be in between h3 tags make it a
little big then there'll be a line break
and a link and this link we just use the
dot dot forward slash to bring them up
one parent directory back to the front
end of the site this this page the main
part of the site now let's just save
this file save as admin check and that's
it so in the next part
let's just put admin check because it
already has a PHP extension so there we
have admin check that PHP and now every
time this index page runs in the admin
center first thing we saw that we start
session and then we run the check file
if the check file doesn't work out then
we just include the link and exit we got
to make sure we put exit here in the if
statement exit so that way it will exit
or stop and stop executing the script
here this script here it won't run any
of this none of that will be seen and
we'll all they'll get is a link to the
home page that's it so we'll see you in
part 6 where we'll continue on and
create the form needed that's going to
be shown to them here we'll probably put
it in right here
a little login form will say would you
like to login you're not you may be the
administrator but it seems as though
you're not logged in and maybe you want
to give them a form right there that
makes sense to me so maybe we'll do that
I'll chew on it but in part 6 we'll get
it to where
the administrator can log-in and then
we'll start we'll get that session
variable created</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
