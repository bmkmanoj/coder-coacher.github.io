started in creating apps for the iPhone
and Apple mobile devices that run the
iphone OS now you might ask how does
flash allow me to produce and publish
iphone apps so one easy way to get
started is create new iphone OS
application and you'll see that it gives
you the proper size and layout for
creating iphone OS apps now what you put
in the file is sort of irrelevant the
only thing you have to keep in mind is
that Apple mobile devices to not
currently have the rendering power of
the desktop PC so the less intense your
applications are the better the CPU and
GPU processing abilities of the Apple
mobile devices is not yet really up to
par with what somebody might have on
their desktop machine so things might
run a little slower and look a little
choppy and groggy if you have an intense
application with intense animations like
I said what you have in the file is
really irrelevant so I'm not even going
to be putting anything in here what I'm
going to be showing you is the publish
settings so let's go into file publish
settings you'll see in the formats tab
everything is pretty much the same as it
always been in the flash tab you'll see
you have a new selection under the
player so when you click iphone OS
you'll have let's see let's go to flash
player 9 or flash player 10 you can see
we can change the ActionScript version
if we go to iphone OS it's only
actionscript-3 now if you hit the
Settings tab here this is the packager
that flash cs5 comes equipped with that
has all the options and settings needed
for the iPhone app deployment and you
would build it like any other regular
flash app and it just requires this new
packager when publishing so what happens
here is you'll put in all your settings
that you get from
the Apple documentation once you become
a certified apple iphone application
developer so here you can set your icons
here is the deployment tab where you put
in your certificate and provisioning
file and how you want it deployed it's
all pretty much self-explanatory let's
go back to the general tab when you
become an applications and iPhone
applications developer apple will give
you all the documentation needed and the
certificates needed to deploy your app
for the Apple App Store so in the flash
cs5 end of things that's pretty much all
you need to know now the more
complicated bit would be when you have
to go to apple which a certificate is
needed which you can get through apple
and if you need to ask Apple any
questions directly you can go to visit
apples discussion support forums so they
have a forum set up at Apple and it's to
support discussion forums where you can
ask questions to see how you can get
started with obtaining the developer
certificate and there's two ways you can
make money creating these applications
one is to sell the app in the Apple
iPhone App Store and two is you can
integrate ads into your application
there's a company called Graystripe who
focuses on mobile ads and that company
has partnered with Adobe and those ads
can be laid right into your application
and they can help you make money now the
the applications themselves will only
run on the iPhone or the iphone OS
devices so people who are on the web
with their iphone they won't be able to
use your application that you create on
a web page per se it would have to be an
executive file that they would install
onto their iPhone and then they can use
the application so that's pretty much
all you need to know to get started in
creating apple iphone OS applications
that you can sell at the app store at
Apple good luck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
