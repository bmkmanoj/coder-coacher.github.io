demonstrate and give an example file on
how you can bring an external data into
flash from a text file that's a file
with a dot txt extension and you can see
the code is right here that's the only
code in the file and there's one dynamic
text field with the name my text
underscore txt there and that's all
that's in this file you see in the
library there's nothing and when we
publish out I've been a window over here
okay when we publish out you'll see that
it brings a text string in it says hi I
am a texturing an external text file and
I'll show you that file right now and
the folder system the file would be
sitting in the same directory or the
same folder as your SWF an HTML file
that holds the SWF and let's take a look
at the contents it says hi I'm just
extra and the same content that we saw
in flash so that shows you that it's
working and I'll have this Fla for
download at develop PHP and in the help
file they kind of hint on how to bring
in external data from a dynamic page or
a dot txt file or an XML file but they
don't show you real real well on the
same page where they tell you the code
and how to access the data from those
external files they don't tell you in
the help file how to display it real
well on that page or anywhere near that
other code which they really should have
but this is the code that'll get it all
working and if you have any questions
about what the code is doing just join
up at the forums develop PHP and we'll
get you some answers but basically it
loads the the file you refer to your
file right here and I believe you can
substitute that with a dot PHP or
whatever you want it and well you really
wouldn't parse out an XML parts if you
want to use an XML file here the xml
parser would be coded slightly
differently but not much and actually
i'm gonna put out two more tutorials
along the same lines one's gonna be for
bringing in external data from a PHP
file and parsing it out multiple
variables and the next one's gonna be
bringing in multiple xml notes and
parsing out an XML file using its
individual nodes to render out
information and content in flash but
this one is just using an example as Fla
will be for download for free download
at develop PHP where this tutorial is
playing and yeah you can look forward to
getting PHP parsing and XML parsing in
flash from external dynamic files ok
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
