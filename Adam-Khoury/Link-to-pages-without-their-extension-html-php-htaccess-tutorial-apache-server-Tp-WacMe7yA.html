thought it would benefit everybody to
see it the question is in some URLs I
see without an extension I was trying to
do that renaming the page without the
HTML or dot PHP extension but I can't
because I create a broken link for
example I want to create so he wants to
create a link that doesn't have the
extension on it
so to see this you can go to your
website and let's say you go to one of
your files see I'm at source while zhp
now what if I try and remove that dot
PHP extension let's see how my server
treats that it says this page does not
exist but if I put the dot PHP extension
there it works so what he wants to know
how to do is how to remove that dot PHP
extension and still have that link to
the source files page work and the
easiest way to achieve that is htaccess
so open up the htaccess file that's in
your root directory on your server you
can just take it from your server and
open it in some kind of text editor and
if you don't have an HT access file yet
this video right here on my channel you
can go down to establish your htaccess
file or if it's not right here on my
channel you can just search it on my
channel right here or you can search it
in YouTube and it should come up this
video shows you how to actually
establish your htaccess file but your
server if you don't have one on there
yet
but if you already have one in your root
directory of your server in your public
HTML directory if you already have one
you want to download it and adjust it
you don't want to overwrite it with it a
new clean one so all you have to do is
open up your htaccess file and throw
this directive in you see this is just a
comment and the comment is make pages
render without their extension and you
can see the rule right there so when you
set multi views what happens is your
server will look for the closest match
for that page so if you have index you
can basically just go to example.com
forward slash index without the
extension and the index page will load
up same for your contact page and
everything like that you don't have to
put the dot PHP or the dot HTM
mell when you're linking so let's press
ctrl s and now let's RESP reload this to
the web server now if you go to your
site you go to one of your pages you
should be able to take that extension
right off of there now without getting a
broken page C so you can refresh you can
go to these files all day long without
their extension all you have to do is
link to the word and you don't have to
put the dot PHP or the dot HTML you can
just link to the name of the file and
you would want to make sure that's
uniform all throughout your menu systems
so once you start using this you don't
want to give people links to the dot PHP
anymore just to the the name of the file
that way you're indexing is more uniform
for your search engine optimization and
all those factors but it will have no
adverse effects to your search engine
optimization or anything just as long as
you serve it that way from the beginning
ok so I hope that helps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
