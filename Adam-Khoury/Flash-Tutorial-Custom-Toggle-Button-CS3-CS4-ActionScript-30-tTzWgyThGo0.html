i'll be showing you to create and flash
actionscript 3 it's toggle functionality
creating a toggle button to where it
just doesn't keep popping that window
open every time you press it it has
brains to tell you the the button
whether or not the window is open fully
or not and it'll close it or open it
accordingly toggle functionality flash
and actionscript 3 hello and welcome to
another flash building tutorial today's
lesson will be covering simple toggle
functionality within flash actionscript
3 and I'll be working in cs3 but you can
be in cs4 for your project and it's all
the same logic and the same code would
work so we'll hit flash actionscript 3
and we'll get right to it now what I'm
going to do is make sure that my stage
is set to the size I wanted two down
here and let's say we had some content
on the stage this was our you know maybe
you had pages or just an application
whatever whatever the application may be
and it was a movie clip or whatever it
may be we're not going to focus on that
will focus on well on that same layer
I'm just going to add some visual items
maybe like a button menu or something
some nice colors huh so with toggle
functionality you might want to give
your users toggle functionality for some
of your buttons or some of the
interactivity on your flash website and
because it's easy and it's possible and
sometimes it's it's cool in the example
I'll show you here it's a something that
would be pretty handy okay so let's say
that's your content and let's put it on
layer 1 so on layer 2 i'm going to make
our little toggle button and let's call
it toggle help or something and let's
give it a little grey fill convert it to
a symbol button toggle button it'll be
named toggle button in the library press
ok give it an instance name of toggle
underscore BTN
let's put some text inside of that
say toggle help and that would be a good
common thing to use a toggle for or any
kind of data you want to display with
the Watauga functionality okay
so let's give it an over state press f6
up here on down press f6 make keyframes
there then you can manipulate the
keyframes in this one make this turn
that color and then okay so we're done
with the setup and now it has an
instance name now we can code it out to
show you the oh no I have to make my
little toggle window first okay so let's
say we want this button we want to make
it to where our users when they press
that button a little magic window flies
open in an animated fashion from that
button to cover the screen or whatever
area we want to cover however big we
want to make it when it's fully grown
and then we want to make it to where
they would hit that same button again to
retract it and if you tried to code that
in to where it was just one single
function without conditionals it
wouldn't work so i'll show you the
simple conditionals you can use to
create toggle functionality and so we
have an instance name now let's make the
little movie clip and you can put it on
three separate layers maybe this button
will call this layer toggle BTN and on
the new layer i just created call that
screen or toggle screen the toggle
screen
and I'm going to place it right here
that looks good to me
get it the color I want it
okay let's convert that to actually
let's put some text on it my content
window and put whatever you want in here
whatever you want
and then take those two items and just
grab those two and convert them to a
movie clip while they're both selected
convert to symbol movie clip call it
toggle screen in the library and let's
use that for instance name as well down
here in the instance name the properties
inspector put toggle screen right there
okay so that has an instance name its
own its own layer this has an instance
name and that's on its own layer above
it and all of that is above our site
content or whatever is there and so now
all we have to do is code the
functionality in for the so the button
will open the window and then retract
the window when it should or shouldn't
now let me go in here and finish this
sorry double-click on inside that movie
clip again let's convert this both to a
movement in another movie clip call it
enter toggle button okay and it doesn't
need an instance name it's just going to
be so you put a stop action here by
pressing f9 type in STO p open
parenthesis close parenthesis semicolon
it's a stop action and put a stop action
there so this doesn't loop because I'm
going to make a keyframe here by
pressing f6 and then a keyframe on 10 by
pressing f6 and also a keyframe on 20 by
pressing f6 we can create motion tweens
here
and then we'll give it another stop
action right here but first let's get
this thing to be the size we want so
let's just resize it
oops make sure we move that registration
that
because we want to coming out of the top
corner when it grows now it's just
resize it
right about there
something like that let's make the alpha
0 so that way lies into view first we're
going to put this registration down here
and you'll see now we'll fly interview
correctly bridges see my content went
really this one just needs its
registration down up there to away all
the animations will play right so now do
the same thing to this last one the last
keyframe move made their drag it up
get to about their negative and give an
output of 0 okay so that's the animation
so this one we won't put a stop action
here on 20 but we do need to stop action
on 10 so we'll hit f6 f9 type in our
stop action that way when they press the
toggle button here here is how it is by
default and this shouldn't be here so
let's control x of that keyframe here
okay so here it is by default there
would be no window showing when the user
pressed oggle help this is the window
flies in now we want to code it to wear
when they toggle help again it does this
action and flies back and then it will
loop back to frame 1 where it stops and
is gone from the scene okay so that's
the logic of that you can press f5 here
to extend these keyframes and so now all
we have to do back in the meet in the
main timeline we're going to put the
code in for that toggle functionality to
control that little movie clip window we
just made that content window ok let's
code this thing out above the toggle
button layer put a new layer let's call
this a s3 short for actionscript-3 press
f9 on that keyframe and first let's grab
our instance name for that button see we
have to remember what the instance name
is for that other one it was toggle
screen for that window ok so the first
thing we'll do is just add an event
listener for the button so toggle
underscore BTN dot add event listener
mouse event
got roll over now we want to have a
regular click event here and then we'll
put the function name that we're going
to create which will be toggle content
that'll be the name of the function let
me just close our parentheses semicolon
and the event listeners ready so now we
can bring that down a little let's grab
that function name control C let's make
this function called toggle content so
type in front of it function toggle
content and this is a pent
colon mouse event which is the same as
this one so we can just pop that right
there close the parentheses
close off our brackets open and close
the curly brackets with a curly brace
and inside of this function is where we
want to have our conditionals so we want
to say if you put your conditional
between these parentheses open curly
brace close curly brace and we want an
else also else
now you have a good structure there for
if and else conditional so if some
condition is met right here and let's
say that toggle will screen movie clip
inside of it if toggle screen that
current frame is an easy way to do this
functionality would be just to say if
it's greater than let's just say if it's
equal to 1 then we want to open the
window by saying or make it play its
animation toggle screen dot go to and
play key frame to
or if you want to make a frame label in
the internet that'll work too so if
toggle screen current frame equals one
that I did that go to and play two else
go to and play let me see let me lock
this layer I'm going to make sure inside
of this movie clip we're going to play
the right label would be ten so we're
going to play ten when we want it to
close that's all we got to do go to and
play 10 so if the toggle that current
frame equals 1 toggle screen will go to
and play 2 which will be that window
flying open else it'll go to and play 10
which is that window retracting and
going back up into the button now let's
see if we coded it right
let me get my browser over here step 12
okay you shrink this a little
see
now it just doesn't keep flying open
every time you hit the button it has
actually has brains the button has
toggle brains we just programmed in
toggle brains okay so that pretty much
shows you everything you need to know
about creating toggle functionality if
you wanted it to look better you put
this on 30 frames per second publish out
and juju toggle me toggle me you know
toggle help beep you can even put a
close button in that movie clip that
would tell the parent but that would
tell the movie clip to go to and play 10
itself a button inside of this movie
clip that would fly out then there would
be a button in the corner you know what
I mean like any other X button or close
button and it would just tell it's it's
own in a timeline to go to and play
friend 10 and then it would fly away
like that it not really cool I think
it's cool okay I hope you guys get some
use out of that and that's flash and
actionscript 3 in flash cs3 or flash cs4
professional ok we'll see you guys next
