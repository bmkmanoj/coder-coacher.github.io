once again and we're continuing on
creating our magic dynamic XML PHP files
which is having PHP render out perfect
XML for all of your XML driven
applications whether they be flash
whatever so in the first one we did
creating dynamic photo gallery XML files
I covered that pretty in-depth and I'm
gonna show you now creating dynamic mp3
player XML files which is very very
similar but I wanted to put the script
out just in case some people maybe had a
little bit of trouble manipulating that
first file I put out for galleries to
echo out the right data for mp3 players
so basically all I did was I went in and
I changed a directory and if you didn't
see the first lesson on this I suggest
you go and see that now if you have in
any troubles but I changed the directory
file all I did was change the directory
to mp3 folder so this file is going to
have PHP look inside of a folder called
mp3 to see all of the mp3 files that are
within that folder and what we have to
do is change this JPEG into mp3 and so
it's all doing the same things except
it's looking for an mp3 files this time
and I changed the picture nodes to
render as song nodes and the child nodes
within our song num and song URL and an
important thing to mention right now is
that flash can grab the id3 data the
metadata for the songs so all you have
to do really is send the file into flash
and flash can figure out what the track
title is who the artist is all of that
stuff just using the id3 data that you
can access within flash for any file
that's playing any music file that's
playing any mp3 file it can access the
id3 data so really if you're using this
for flash you don't have to send in the
artist and the title the id3 data can be
accessed automatically within flash
ActionScript or PHP can also access I
three data and it's a little more
complicated but it's possible to do and
you can have PHP access to ID three data
and have your XML rendered with ID three
data all set up and ready to go but if
you're using this for a flash mp3 player
there's no need because flash and
ActionScript can render out id3 data a
song title the song artists and all of
that stuff is embedded within each song
and there's also ways maybe you have
songs that don't have ID three data
there's a whole multitude of programs
that will let you put it in file
information metadata and ID three data
for that particular song if it happens
to be missing if it's missing its artist
if it's missing the title and all of the
little pieces of information that are in
ID three so that's it that was all I had
to do to change this to render out for a
flash mp3 player so this one's all ready
to go and in the next one we're gonna
cover and the only reason I wanted to do
this one on video is for and get this
file at develop PHP so people could
snatch it up is in case anybody had
trouble manipulating the first one to
now do mp3 files a lot of you guys might
have seen the first one and said well I
could change that easily to do for my
mp3 file but then there's some people
who can't just do those things
intuitively on their own because they're
not advanced yet that's why this lesson
has come about now the next one is
definitely going to be necessary because
even some of you advanced guys I mean I
know some of you guys are advanced
enough to render out your MySQL database
results and list it all in XML but I'm
gonna show it anyway so lesson three I'm
gonna show you how to access your MySQL
database render out within a loop all
the XML notes from that from the result
set of your SQL query so hang tight
that'll be the last one it'll call this
series quits</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
