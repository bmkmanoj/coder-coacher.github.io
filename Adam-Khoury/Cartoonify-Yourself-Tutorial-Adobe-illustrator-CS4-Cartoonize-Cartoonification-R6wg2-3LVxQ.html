Adam it flash building here and in this
very short Adobe Illustrator cs4
tutorial I'll be showing you how to
cartoon about yourself because I see the
add more and more online about cartoon
applying yourself click here to make a
cartoon avatar of yourself cartoon me
all of this and all that and I just
wanted to show a few ways you can do
that in Adobe Illustrator whether you're
in cs4 cs3 or any previous versions
they'll have these effects available so
I just want to show you how it might be
done easily and for free and you can
also get Adobe Illustrator cs4 3 for 30
days if you go to the Adobe site and get
the 30 day trial version
you can get all the programs for you
play with them for 30 days delete it and
in that time you can make thousands of
cartoon applied images ok so I'm just
gonna remove this edited image the
cartoon defied one control X then in
press ctrl-c ctrl-v yes put it right
next to the original okay so that's how
you would kind of start out you can go
to file place or open any files you want
you press place if you want to import a
file to the stage or if you want to open
a file independently you just press open
so what I did was I place this file on
stage and then I just made a copy of it
now I'm gonna highlight that copy I'm
gonna go to effect go to artistic and
just click any one of those and it will
open the effects gallery for you so you
can see what options you can apply first
thing I'm going to apply is the poster
edge and you can change the
posterization I'm gonna put mine right
about there the edge intensity I want
mine all the way on 0 and the edge
thickness I want mine all the way up
press ok and here let's look in the
appearance tab on that you can see it
added poster edges right there now let's
go ahead and add another effect with
that still highlighted just go back into
the gallery
apply new effect it says it already has
an effect applied so we want to apply a
new on top of it so let's go to cut out
and here's where you can you know get as
abstract as you need to to make it look
really cartoon fight I want mine right
about there its fidelity right about
that looks good
let's try that one okay and there you go
you have a cartoon of ID version of
yourself you could do all your friends
for Christmas describe their picture
snatch it up quick tuna Fayette send it
back to them if they might not happen to
have illustrator but can't do it quickly
and easily you can do it for them and
make it a little Christmas present for
them whatever Hank oops I almost forgot
to mention for beginners in adobe
illustrator if you want to save the file
you've manipulated press ctrl X on
everything else there normally you would
just have that and then you go to file
save as or export let's go to export
export it as a JPEG and let's call it
cartoon me let's override this cartoon
me one so I'm gonna name a cartoon me
one jpg save says do you want to replace
it yes normally you wouldn't have one
there already so it wouldn't ask you to
replace it or not and then you just mess
with the quality in the settings of the
file you can leave a default if you want
it to look normal
and that's it and you can upload it to
the web wherever you have profiles or
whatever okay have fun bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
