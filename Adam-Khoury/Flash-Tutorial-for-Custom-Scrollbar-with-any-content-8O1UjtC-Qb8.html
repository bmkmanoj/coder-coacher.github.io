which is suitable for cs3 and cs4 we
will demonstrate how to scroll any of
your content that you like and actually
them publish it out to the browser and
here it is in the browser and when the
users mouse goes over the scroll dragger
it lights up a different color or it
moves to the next button State and you
can see if I hold down on the dragger
and I move my mouse into the content
it still Scrolls the content when I let
go it stops scrolling the content and
it'll scroll it really nice cleanly and
efficiently and what's really cool is
you can put whatever you want inside of
this content movie clip that's being
scrolled pictures you can load external
SWF s-- in there as long as you make
room for it let's take a look at the Fla
files so you can see how cool this is
the way I set it up if you like math
you're gonna love this one okay so the
code is comments it pretty good there if
you need any more explanation on what
it's doing get into the forms that
develop PHP and first let me mention you
can download this Fla file free from
develop PHP if you go to the page where
the tutorials playing you there's a link
about midway down where you can download
the Fla file that way you can get to it
and take the lesson and and the Fla file
itself is the lesson so once you get in
it you'll see that in the code there's
comments above certain sections of
importance there and it's all done with
35 lines of code
and what happens is there's a and like I
said if you need help with the code you
can go into the forums with develop PHP
and ask a question and somebody might
get you an answer ok so first thing we
have is the scroll bar background
instance name scroll bar BG and we have
the scroll dragger instance name scroll
dragger and then we have the mask for
the content that way you can't see
things that are scrolling outside of
that area and then we have here is the
content to be scrolled under the
instance name of content underscore MC
and here we have just background
cosmetics just to have your background
look any way you want and so what
happens is this movie clip which is
content underscore MC can be as long as
you need it to and inside of it there's
a little bottom placeholder and it's a
little rectangle primitive sitting there
and you'd want to put it about an inch
below where your content ends and that's
it and then what else do we have to tell
you but yeah you could put whatever you
like inside of that not just text not
just pictures you can put SWFs
animations whatever you like and another
really cool thing is if you look in the
browser you'll see it it's at a certain
size I think it's 200 pixels let me see
it is 263 pixels high is the whole thing
and what I'm gonna do is resize this to
150 pixels high so you can see now my
dragger now if I publish out watch this
it still works just fine and it's still
within its bounds and it won't drag
outside of the bounds and it Scrolls the
whole entire
content movie clip there still but you
wouldn't really want to do that what you
would want to do is to resize this thing
is then resize the mask for content you
just try get up or you can make it
bigger I'm gonna make it smaller and
then you take the background cosmetics
size them up too and that's pretty much
it and you publish out and then lookie
there
who's the man a dam is the man that's
right and if you guys so this could be
as tall or as as short as you need it to
be and you can also do the same thing
with the content move it all in this way
so it can be a little more narrow so say
you wanted it to only be about half as
wide as it is you just move that mask
move that background cosmetics in get
your text all lined up to where it's a
little thinner in there your content
movie clip and you're good to go
let's see in the code like I said
there's a lot of math going on we find
out some values for the properties of
the positions of certain things here and
here and also with the mask is also
involved there and let's see see your
mask has the instance name of content
mask that's pretty much it if there's
anything you can't figure out about it
just head into the forums and we'll let
you know okay we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
