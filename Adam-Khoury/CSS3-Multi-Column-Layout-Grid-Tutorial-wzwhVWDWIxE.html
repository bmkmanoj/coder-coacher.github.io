exercise we demonstrated how to program
multi-column layouts for divs of
different heights using core JavaScript
in this lesson we're going to use the
css3 multi-column layout module and some
of its properties to create multi-column
layouts with automatic content spillover
feature now both the JavaScript and the
CSS approaches have different behavior
and different benefits first let's take
a look at the finished product what
happens is each div can have different
dynamic Heights but it still forms a
nice grid of sorts what happens is
content spills over into the next
columns if there happens to be spillover
content so you can just stack as many
elements that you want inside of your
multi-column layout container and
they'll form this nice multi column grid
that can support divs of different
heights your your divs can also be all
the exact same height if you want it's
just a new way to get columns and CSS
but it also comes with this automatic
content spillover feature okay we're
going to start with some existing basic
CSS and HTML that you might have on your
page and let's take a look at what it
renders you can see we just have a lot
of divs on the page in the normal
fashion and each one has a different
height because there's a different
amount of sentences being written into
each of those so each is going to have
its own different dynamic height so this
is what it looks like before we apply
the css3 multi-column layout it's just
the normal way the divs stack on a page
now we'll apply the few lines of code
needed to create the multi-column layout
okay now I'm going to go in and apply
the two lines needed to create the
multi-column layout and keep in mind
that these have to be prefixed because
they're new css3 properties so you'd
have to put WebKit right here just for
now if you want it to work in all
webkit-based browsers but I'll put all
of those on at the end for you I'll put
the WebKit and the Mose prefix and for
now you can test this in Internet
Explorer that's what I'm testing in here
now let me refresh my page and you can
see that just those two lines render
the whole layout if I wanted that to be
two columns I'll just change that to a
two refresh my page and take a look now
I have two column layout and these can
all be dynamic percentages for instance
this container can be 100% and now you
see that you have a full width column
layout now I'm only going to show these
two properties because really that's all
that's needed to render the effect that
I want but I'm giving you this URL and
this is the URL that educators like
myself use to research the source
material from the horse's mouth so you
can go straight to the source material
and learn really all about the CSS
multi-column layout in depth and there's
more properties that you can investigate
for it now this column rule is what you
see in the middle see this vertical rule
it's like a horizontal rule like a
horizontal line but it's just a vertical
line so it's a vertical rule in between
your columns so if I put that back on
three and i refresh i'm going to see
that rule in between and you can remove
that you don't even need that in place
refresh and it's gone but I'll just
leave it in place for now and like I
said you can discover a whole lot more
that a lot of tutorial websites aren't
going to talk to you about if you just
go to this URL yourself and I'll put a
link in the video description to this
URL and I'll also put a link to all of
this code here in my document and if
you're wondering how I'm getting these
sentences to right dynamically into all
these divs for my dummy content I'm just
writing it in using these two lines
using this line and then a for loop okay
so that's about it that's really all you
need to know you can discover a whole
lot more yourself if you take the time
to read that whole page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
