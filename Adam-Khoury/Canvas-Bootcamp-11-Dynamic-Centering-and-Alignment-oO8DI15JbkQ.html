dynamically Center your canvas assets
according to any canvas dimensions the
first thing I'm going to do on my canvas
is set a fill style then draw a
rectangle so I have a magenta fill style
and a 100 by 100 rectangle positioned at
the top left corner so refresh
so we want to dynamically get this
magenta rectangle to be positioned in
the very center of the canvas dead
center no matter what the width or
height of the canvas is so the first
thing we should do is make a new
variable and call it rect X and at first
I'm going to make it equal to the CTX
dot canvas dot width semicolon now let's
see what happens if we take that rect
we're not done creating this value but
let's see what happens if we take that
value and put it here for the exposition
of that rectangle refresh you can see we
can't see anything because in actuality
the rectangle is sitting just off of the
edge so what if I just put a minus 10 we
should see a 10 pixel sliver of that
rectangle come back on this right edge
Watch say 10 pixels of that rectangle
came back so all we have to do is say /
to refresh and you can see how now the
left edge of our magenta rectangle is
dead center but we need for the center
of the magenta rectangle to be in the
dead center of the canvas so what I'll
do is I'll make these values variables
the width and the height of the
rectangle so I'll put rect W this rect
width and I'll put rec pipe and while
we're at it let's go ahead and just put
rect Y position here now let's copy that
variable here and let's make the rect Y
variable let's make that equal to CT X
at canvas that height divided by 2 so
above wreck X and wrecked Y I'm going to
make another variable called rect with
because we also need the rect width and
height variables I'm going to make that
equal to 100 let's copy that and do the
same thing for the rect
height now our fill rect function should
work because we have a wrecked with
wrecked hi and our wrecked Y and our
wrecked X but we still need to do some
adjusting to get dead center you'll see
that we almost get dead center but we
get dead center for the top left corner
of that rectangle so all we have to do
is subtract half the width of the
rectangle so in the rect X variable we
can compensate for that by saying - rect
width divided by 2 + / - can also be
represented as times 0.5 refresh you'll
see now you have dead center for the
width now let's just take that - rekt
with and put it on the height and we
make sure we put this on rect height
divided by 2 and there's your dead
centering you can also represent this as
x 0.5 but the same thing here and you'll
see you get the same results and you
might also want to group those let's
group those expressions we're going to
group those mathematical expressions so
we don't lose track of what's going on
and you see we get the same results
let's group these here as well so define
the dead center for the magenta object
to put it at the dead center you have to
take the canvas width divided by 2 and
you subtract from that the rectangle
width divided by 2
do the same thing for the height now if
I was to change the height or width of
my canvas so if I put my canvas at 300
and my height at 200 for my canvas
refresh
I get dynamic centering no matter what
put that back on 5 and 350 and there we
go that's how you can dynamically Center
assets on the canvas</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
