program a tip calculator application
from scratch over using JavaScript and
html5
so this is what you'll have in place
after you do some programming with me so
let's say I go out to eat and I want to
figure up maybe what's 20 percent of a
bill that I have maybe 1450 so I can
drag my tip percentage up to 20 percent
you can see it outputs to 90 so that's
for a bill of 1450 and you know if I go
to 50 percent we should have 725 because
that's half of 1450 you go to 100
percent it'll be the whole 1450 so
that's how it works okay and we're using
the html5 slider component which is a
new feature of the input element and it
doesn't work in all browsers yet but at
the end of the video we'll demonstrate
how it works in Internet Explorer
Firefox Opera chrome and all that stuff
and I'm running it in chrome right now
okay we'll start with the bare bones of
an html5 web document that validates and
will begin inside of the body element
placing the user interfacing that will
require for this application we can just
type in tip calculator and wrap that in
an h2 heading and that will give you
something that looks like that then the
next line down let's type in enter the
bill amount for your meal colon and then
a dollar sign and right next to that we
want a input field so let's establish an
input element it gets type text and give
it an ID of bill and this is going to
represent the bill amount that the user
is typing in how much they paid for
their meal and let's just put a break
tag right there
that'll give us a line break now let's
put the HTML slider component in place
so let's type in tip percentage then
we're going to open up another input
element I'm going to use the new type of
range and this is html5 only so some
browsers that you come across might not
show you a nice slider it will just
default to being a text field now we
have to feed this input certain
parameters we want the minimum value
that it could be we'll set that to zero
the maximum value that it could be will
set that's a 100 then the value when the
page loads up is going to be zero the
step factor is going to be equal to one
and that just means that every time they
slide it'll increment by one you can
make it step by ten if you want but for
this application it's best to step by
one and actually let's put this on the
line down here that way we have more
room and everything is a bit neater now
we want an on change event handler and
that's going to be equal to the
JavaScript function that we want to fire
off and we'll put that in place in just
a second now lastly we're going to set
some style for this element and we want
to give it a width 400 pixels or
whatever size you want because if you
don't set a width then it's going to be
kind of compact and really small it
might be hard for the person to drag it
to where they want then finally we can
close that
input element now remember this on
change event now what happens there is
every time the user grabs that slider
knob and moves it that is when the on
change event occurs so we can fire off a
JavaScript function every time the on
change event happens basically as
they're sliding so let's name is
JavaScript function tip calculate open
closed parenthesis and we're going to
need to feed this function to arguments
every time it runs the value of the
slider itself so you can say this dot
value since this function is being
called within the slider we have here
and then comma and in between single
quotes let's just type in bill now this
refers to this input text field here of
ID bill so every time tip calculate runs
for the on change event of that slider
it's going to be passed two arguments
this dot value and bill will be able to
get the value of bill by using this ID
reference now right next to the slider
off on the right end of it or really
wherever you want it to appear you can
put this span or have an element it can
be a div paragraph whatever you want I'm
just going to use a span that way the
percentage shows up right next to the
slider as they're sliding it but I just
have a span element with an ID of slide
valve short for slide value and I have
it set to a default zero percent so I'm
going to have JavaScript update this
number every time the tip calculate
function runs that way the user can see
the percentage as they're sliding they
can see the percentage change now under
that all we need is a little area that
shows the user how much tip to leave the
server so you can write tip to leave
equals and we can have another span tag
right here with an ID of tip and we'll
use JavaScript to show the user the
value of the tip or the amount of the
tip that they should leave the server
within the inner HTML of this span I'm
also going to wrap that in an h2 element
so I've got that all wrapped in an h2
element so they'll see tip to leave is
equal to whatever the dollar amount is
for how much tip they have
to leave and JavaScript is going to
figure that up for us so let's go up
into the head element and let's start a
script element let's go down and make
sure we close that thrift element this
is where we can place our JavaScript so
we're going to have function tip
calculate so let's copy that go back up
here function tip calculate open close
parenthesis opening curly brace go down
a couple of lines and put the closing
curly brace and we know that two
arguments are coming in so we have to
scoop those up so let's just call the
first one slider because that's going to
represent the slider value and then bill
that will represent the input text field
here now the first thing we want to do
is get a reference the values of things
and also get object references for
certain elements on the page we want to
get a reference for this tip this span
with an ID of tip we also want to get
reference for this element with an ID of
slide value and we also want to make a
variable in JavaScript that will
represent this bill input text field and
access the value of what the user typed
into it so those first three lines are
very simple we'll save our tip is equal
to document get element by ID tip so
within this local JavaScript variable we
have an element reference the same for
the slide valve span down here and then
for the bill input text field we just
grabbed its dot value so that means this
one doesn't represent the element this
one represents the actual number that
they typed in but these two represent
the elements and we're just getting
those established so we can affect their
inner HTML more easily now the next line
we have to figure up the percent so
let's make a variable pull it PRC and T
show up 4% we're going to make that
equal to the slider value and that's
going to be a number times point zero
one now what that does is it moves the
decimal point of the slider value two
places left so if this lighter value
happens to be 50
it's going to wind up being point five
so let's take the slide valve reference
that we have here so say slide valve
innerhtml
is equal to the string of dollar sign
and then we'll add to that string or
concatenate to it some mathematics to
complete the operation so we're going to
group this bill times percent operation
and that's placed in between parentheses
just to make sure that it's grouped
within this little mathematical
operation then on that number we can
call to fixed and we feed that argument
of two semicolon so what to fix does is
it takes your number and it fixes it to
have two decimal places like currency
would so for instance if you wind up
with a number that looks like this with
all kind of numbers past the decimal
point to fixed will make it look like
this and that's what you want actually
this is supposed to go into the tips
HTML so change that slide valve to tips
and for the slide valve we can put inner
HTML is equal to the value of the slider
as they're sliding it and we'll
concatenate or append to that value a
little percentage symbol all right so
that should be everything let's see if
it runs correctly let's type in $32
let's drag that to 50% see what we get
down below 16 that's perfect so 20% of
that would be six dollars and forty
cents so if I go out to a restaurant and
I spend $32 in the bill I would give a
640 tip or if I'm not too stingy I would
change this to 30% that's more like what
I would leave I would leave 30% okay so
that's how you can use the new features
of html5 to give yourself a nice user
interface of this slider component and
JavaScript for the logic of the
programming but the tip calculations you
can see that it was very simple
our programming for the tip calculation
is basically just
these two lines I'm going to take this
line control X I'm going to put it under
this line so really all of the
mathematical magic is happening in these
two lines right here everything else is
very basic stuff just populating the
innerhtml and getting values and if you
have any questions about the mathematics
or you can't wrap your head around
things just ask and myself or somebody
else will give you some sort of response
and you can use CSS to really make this
much more attractive than it is and you
can also add some JavaScript to make it
more intelligent for instance if I type
in atom into where I should be typing in
a number it'll just say nan which means
not a number so you have to add some
JavaScript to this function to make sure
that what the value of what the user is
typing in is not a string you want to
make sure it's a number and you can very
easily do that in JavaScript so I'll
leave the making it polished up to you
now I want to show you what it looks
like in Firefox I was using Chrome the
whole time let's see what it looks like
in Firefox you don't get the slider yet
in Firefox but soon enough it'll happen
I think by 2014 all of html5 should be
working so what will happen is it will
fall back to being just a regular text
field the user can still use it so if I
type in 1450 and I want to leave a 50%
tip si says 725 which is 50% of 1450 or
a 20% tip that'll be 290 so you can see
it still works but the user interfacing
is not as nice because that slider
doesn't show up there yet
let's also preview this in Opera
I like operas representation of the
slider it's really cool so I type in
1450 here I slide to 20% we should get
our 290 right there now I'll show you in
Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer
shows it pretty much like just like
Firefox does ok but everything still
works with your programming is just that
the user injured
the html5 slider is not showing up yet
in Internet Explorer and Firefox but all
the rest of the browsers it should let's
say 20% yep 290 you can program your
application to have a little submit
button and remove the slider altogether
and then wait till 2014 to make it
really nice so if you want to make it
work in all browsers the same just make
this a little input text field like it
is and then below just have a calculate
button and when they press calculate
they'll have their tip okay I hope
you've enjoyed this JavaScript
