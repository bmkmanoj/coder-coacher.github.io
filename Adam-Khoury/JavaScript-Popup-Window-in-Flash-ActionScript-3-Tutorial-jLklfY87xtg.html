you in this lesson how to use
ActionScript 3 to create a JavaScript
pop-up button that will open a
JavaScript pop-up window in the browser
with any attributes definitions you want
set inside of it and so on the stage
here I have a layer it's called Papa
button and there sits the pop-up button
which I just created and it's inside of
it you'll see it's just a regular button
symbol that turns green on the overstate
and I gave it an instance name a pop-up
underscore BTN and what we'll do is go
ahead and code it out I'll show you the
code right now to where you won't have
to place anything inside of the HTML
page that holds the SWF file this can
all be done right here in the in the
ActionScript so let's open the actions
panel by pressing f9 on the actions
layer there and let's start coding it
out first thing is we'll define the
function that will run when the button
is clicked we'll call it Jes pop-up
window so a function J is pop-up window
open parentheses type in event colon
Mouse event
it goes no-name happy
yeah please go bars and on my name is I
don't go out
okay let me open it
yeah I think present an imaginary he
throws up the faces you mean - I mean
okay your window focus boy yeah
it's all closed up named that does it
now we can take a look at it in the
brother and if you had the trouble
getting at the code overseeing the code
i typed in you can go and download the
fla file free from develop PHP comp but
let's look at it in the browser here and
if I click the pop-up button there it is
so you see it's working it shows all of
our attributes nicely it puts it in the
top left corner and that's it we'll see
you next lesson hey you guys just as a
side note I boo-booed in my code which
made things not work I didn't have a
space between my new and URL requests
those two words so I put the space and
underscore blank needs to be self I
thought it can work with blank but it
must be self so underscore self is the
method is the target rather
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
