we're learning to create and it's very
long and extensive tutorial in flash cs4
and ActionScript 3 i'm going to press
ctrl enter the export the file you might
want to turn your speakers down a little
bit music's a little loud
and so we have a nice little intro there
that plays with music and we also have
the menu and the main page tween in to
interview when the site initially loads
up and that's all done through code and
then when you press a different button
we have different swing effects that
make intro and outro of X for all the
pages so the data gets retained on the
outro and the new page comes in on the
intro see and I show you how to
dynamically add the content to the pages
using movie clips from the library and
if you'd like to learn how to load and
unload multiple SWFs uses your pages I
have that tutorial available at develop
PHP com already how to load and unload
swf files so you can use those as your
pages instead of pages that we assembled
in our movie in our library here that's
what we're using is pages okay first
thing we want to do is go to this frame
here 20 double-click inside of this
movie clip and we can zap out that
rectangle let's make the first layer
named main menu this is where we'll put
our button menu movie clip layer above
that let's call this page click pages
clip that's the clip that will hold the
pages and have the movie clip ons
already that will animate between all
the pages into view layer 3 we're going
to call as3 for actionscript 3 and now
what I'm going to do on the main menu
layer is create simple for button
instances so I'll have four buttons and
that will serve as my main menu you can
make as many as you like so here in this
other file I have four buttons ready and
if you have to c minor button instances
here they're not the fancy movie clip
animated buttons if you need to learn
how to make those or even regular
buttons we've got plenty of lessons on
all that at develop PHP under the
flash tab so I'm not going to cover that
in this lesson because I've covered it
18 million times already so I'm going to
copy all these let's say in your flash
file you just created them all their
control V alright so now I've got my
menu and I wanted to start right about
there and then tween down into view so
it's going to be in its own little
container so let's highlight all of
those buttons convert them to symbol and
make this a movie clip registration top
left and in the library let's name it
main menu now let's give it an instance
name of main menu underscore MC we can
connect to it with the code now using
this instance name that we've given it
alrighty now inside of that movie clip
we want to give each button an instance
name and then put a new layer
actionscript-3 layer above it all the
buttons let's just name this one buttons
and this actionscript-3 code here will
command the buttons when they get
clicked we'll put the functionality for
what happens when each button gets
clicked here inside of this movie clip
to keep things neat nice and neat and
also having them all in the movie clip
or four buttons will help us tween it
down into stage in a nice animated way
so inside of that movie clip lock the
ActionScript 3 layer give this first
button let's say menu BTN one underscore
BTN and we use underscore BTN and
underscore MC for our objects that way
we get syntax help and code completion
assistance within the ActionScript panel
okay so
this one is let's see what was that
first one let's just grab that name all
the other names will be similar so let's
just change this to a to this one gets a
3 menu BTN 3 underscore BTN this one is
menu BTN for underscore BTN now we can
connect to all four of those buttons in
the code and command them produce the
functions and the listeners okay let's
just go ahead and set up the function
ness while we're in here and let's say
my BTN menu BTN one underscore BTN dot
add event listener this is mouseevent
dot click
comma and the function that we want to
fire off when this button gets clicked
will name that let's just name it BTN
one click close all parenthesis put the
semicolon there okay now that one has a
listener let's give all four two three
four change this to a to change that one
two three that one to a four it's very
simple four three two one okay so each
menu button has an event listener for
mouse click listening for mouse click
when each one of those buttons gets
clicked so all we need is for functions
with these four names here that are
going to handle what happens when those
buttons get clicked so we type in
function button click this is event
colon mouse event
call them Boyd open curly brace close
curly brace now we have a nice function
nest set up there so let's just go ahead
and set up the other three actually
let's put it right here a little comment
it says what happened place what happens
when button is clicked here okay so now
i'm just going to duplicate those this
one two three more times you can just
change that to three and four that's it
now there's no nothing that will happen
when each button gets clicked but now we
have our function nests and our event
listeners all set up we're going to come
back to those when we figure out exactly
what we want to happen when each button
gets clicked we can just pop it right in
there nice and easy okay so now let's go
back out into the timeline of our whole
site movie clip here where we first put
in our venues zapped out that big red
rectangle and we're going to connect
some code now that's going to tween in
our menu down to the stage so the user
can press the buttons but we want it to
animate in in a cool way so we're going
to do is add some actionscript-3 here
that's going to connect to this movie
clip so let's grab that movie clips name
control C this is going to be some tween
effects okay the code for that is simple
so you see where my menu is starting its
out of view not even on stage and then
here in the code I've imported the
transitions necessary for using the
easing transition effects and I code it
out a line so what it is here is a tween
variable and it's a new tween and what
you do inside of the tween is you claim
the object that you want to move right
here
give it the instance name then you claim
the plane that you want to move across
the X or Y and then why is up and down
and X is left and right and then here
you apply your easing method there's a
whole lot of easing methods that you can
use but i'm going to use elastic that
ease out because i think it looks the
coolest and then main menu MC the next
parameter i guess that is looking for
for the next bit of information that the
tween is looking for is the start
position so you have start position and
end position i could put a number of
negative 20 here if i wanted but i just
want to use the current menu mcs dot y
position so i can just code that in
right there then i claim 70 is where i
want it to stop on stage and land and
two would be the duration it's kind of
like speed if you want to look at it
that way but it's it's not really
correct to think of the duration at
speed okay so this is what we have let's
look at it a little intro plays and
after that we should see our little menu
bounced into view it's beautiful okay
and you can adjust all those numbers and
the tween type to be just like you want
it okay so now we have that we can code
out well first before we code anything
else out let's make the little movie
clips that are going to be or all the
movie clips they don't have to be little
per se but will make all the movie clips
the for movie clips needed that are
going to be all of our pages since we're
going to be tweeting all of those
interview then we're going to have to
have them come in or not have to but
it'd be best to have them come in
dynamically and we're going to show you
how to pull them in from the library on
to stage at the time they're needed and
then remove them at the time there
needed to be removed it's very simple so
let's create that first one let's crack
out a rectangle primitive and let's say
if the menu stops right about here at 70
pixels we want to put
pages make sure they're going to fit in
here and like I said your file would
probably be much larger okay so let's
say that's one of my pages and that can
be the first page so let's give it a
better color really simple color really
simple border okay so inside of it well
we haven't converted it yet so what
we're going to do is convert this to
symbol well first let's put the elements
I'm sorry let's just say main page so
now let's say you have an image that
would get loaded in here but this is all
going to be converted to a movie clip
and I'll show you right now so don't get
lost ok I'm going to highlight all of
these items convert to symbol and call
this main page or page one and we'll
name all of them like that page one two
three and four now that's a movie clip
registration top left okie dokie now you
could have set the export for action
script right then when you created the
movie clip but i'll show you how to go
into your library and do it on the movie
clip that i just created page one you
right click that in your library you go
to properties export / ActionScript
class page one that's good we'll use
this class name in our code to connect
to that item bring it out from the
library and tween it onto the stage when
we need to press ok the definition
classpath cannot be found so one will be
automatically generated and yes if you
have to pawn to export okay you want
that all right now let's get that movie
clip off of their control x
now we don't need it on stage because
remember we're going to pull it out from
the library when it's time so if you
wanted to modify what's inside of it you
just double click it there in the
library and here you are inside if it's
inside of its timeline you can put
dynamic code in here to do whatever you
want run animations put movie clips in
here to have a ball do whatever you want
it can have its own timeline and so on
code and everything going on so I'm
going to make three more of these and
then let's go to the main scene let's go
back into a movie clip here you hit that
dot and there's the menu okay so here we
are back in we're going to make I'm
going to duplicate that in the library
actually three times so I have four
different pages to between interview
when people click on my menus menu items
ok so now inside of my library you can
see I have page 1 2 3 and 4 and they're
all different instances and now we have
to make sure that you go into the
library and export each one and the
properties of it right click it export
for action script okay okay each one
will have its a same name page 3 in page
for in the ActionScript class definition
there so that's what you can identify
with it in the code as
how is you this is this way you can just
drag things out that are in your library
and use them dynamically on the stage if
you want okay all right now all we need
is a movie clip now that's going to be
our page container so let's draw out a
rectangle primitive and since our menu
is going to be right about here let's
make this container at a zero position
here
there we go so just the size
so it looks like it's about dead center
okay let's give this a different Phil
and I want that radial Phil just make it
black and actually it could have no
background in it if you want let's just
convert that to a symbol now and call it
page container grabbed that name this is
what it's going to be named in the
library when we created here
registration top left now let's give it
an instance name page container
underscore MC there we go now we have
something to load the pages into and
this is the item that we're going to
give the tween effects to not the pages
themselves pages we're going to add to
this movie clip then this movie clip is
going to get the tweens alright so here
now we can effectively code everything
out we need I think okay now that all my
movie clips in the library are all the
same size I'm going to make this movie
clip of this inner symbol inside of that
page container movie clip the same size
to 70 CE right about
and let me just type it in 270
but 570 nope the other way around 270
height 570 with ok now we're good to go
now we can place this item this movie
clip exactly where it needs to go
onstage dead center everything will load
up in it properly now finally we can get
to some code and actually here I put it
on the wrong I'm just messing up
everywhere control x i'm going to take
it off of the ActionScript 3 layer which
should be locked anyway and put it on
the pages clip layer where it belongs
ctrl shift to be writing now we can
finally put the code in make this thing
happen it would highlight the
ActionScript 3 layer and press f9 and
here we have let's make a comment that
says between the main menu into place
upon opening
now we're going to put another comment
and this is going to be claimed object
variables or claim objects claim
movieclips claim MCS library to use on
stage when needed
using ad child okay so this is bar just
call it P 1 keep it simple colon page 1
remember that class name that was in our
library for that movie clip instance we
gave it export for action script that
was its class name so we can access that
into a variable called p1 then all we
would have to write out is addchild p1
and it would appear on stage if we were
to write that out right now so let's
make three more of those p2p to page
three page 44 page three page 4 page
three okay so we have page 12 or p1 p2
p3 p4 and they represent and hold page
one page to page three and four from our
library okay so now all we have to do is
let's see
in the page container let's see the
first page needs to get loaded in by
default without the user having to press
any button so they'll be looking at a
blank screen with the menu you don't
want that you want the first page to
come in so here we're going to add child
to that into that movie clip that we
created cold page container underscore
MC that's sitting there on stage let's
load p 1 into it or add child p 1 so now
let's see let's create a transition
that's going to be for the when the page
is going to get loaded in for the first
time let's create that initial
transition okay so we add child p 12
page container and then we instruct page
container to run a tween animation just
like we did for the main menu and then
what we'll do is code out the functions
for the buttons which we might move all
those functions here to have all of our
script in the same place I might just do
that and that way there's no code inside
of the buttons where am i right here
there's no code inside of this movie
clip yeah let's go ahead and set that
code out right now x then we'll just
refer to those buttons from the main
from the parent timeline here and I'll
show you how to do that so down here now
we have our buttons and functions so all
we have to do is grab the name of that
why cs3 is open here in the close
that all we have to do is access the
name of this movie clip which is main
menu underscore MC and now we can have
all of our code in one night spot here
by going my menu on just my main menu
underscore MC dot main or menu button
one underscore BTN add event listener
you can add event listeners from a
different timeline you see how I'm doing
that I'm adding event listeners to that
movie clips objects that aren't in this
timeline okay so now this code should
operate exactly the way it should let's
try it out control enter it is our nice
little intro I have the sound turned
down on it right now see it loads in
page 1 p-1 main page into that movie
clip and then it tweens everything in
you see that between animation if you
didn't rewind it ok so now so this code
right here takes care of loading or
tweening in the main menu loading your
movie clip pages in two variables for
use later in the script then we use the
first variable here to load p 1 into
that page container movie clip then we
just tween the page container now within
these functions now we we set up our
event listeners for a little main menu
and now within these functions we can
place what happens to that page
container MC when each button is clicked
and it should be all fairly simple we
can use different tweens and transitions
I'll show you guys are kind not cost
stop have a call okay we're really close
to seeing an end result to our work here
so let's take this toad out because
we're going to place what happens in
there now
now the first thing we're going to do
inside of the button one click is we're
going to make an out Roche tween so
let's just go ahead and grab between
here and this is going to be it's called
a BTN one outro BTN one outro because
what we want to have is the logic we
want to set out is each page when
clicked each button when clicked each
page wants to have an outro animation to
animate out and then new page animate in
when each button is clicked a lot of
people struggle with how to make a page
animate in and out multiple pages so
that's really what we're focusing on
here and we're focusing on using between
and transition effects for the pages
let's see BTM one outro this is going to
be alpha and it's going to be on the
let's see we want the duration to be one
we want the well first let's see what
between we won let's make strong okay so
let's talk from the beginning here in
this tween that we just created called
pto and one outro the page container MC
is the object that we want to affect
alpha is the effect that we want to give
this between event instead of using the
x and y positions to move it we're going
to adjust its alpha properties now here
is the ease method that we want strong
ease out and now here this number is
what it's going to be when done which
has is alpha of zero and here's what it
starts as I'm sorry I had that backwards
this is what it starts as and this is
what it will alpha 20 so it starts to
add alpha of one if you wanted fifty
percent opacity would be 0 point five so
you start with a full alpha of one and
you tween it to an alpha of zero
invisible duration of one okay and the
true property is said so it actually
runs now the next line is going to be in
an event listener so you say BTN one
outro we can grab this right there BTM
one altro that add event listener and
this is going to be between event
and we're going to listen to the motion
finish listen for the motion finish that
means when the tween is done because we
don't want things swapping out before
our tweens are done because that would
be uncool and things wouldn't operate
correctly so let's name this function
that's going to fire off on this motion
finish here on BTM one outro let's name
this run BTN one transition bring in the
new page make sure you guys will see the
logic of what I've coated out when we're
done here and we're almost finished so
now we need the function it's going to
fire off upon the completion of that
between event that we're just listening
for their function run BTM one
transition and this is event colon
between event still and now we claim the
void open curly brace and close curly
brace the first thing we want to happen
in that function is we want to remove
the page that's currently in the page
container MC so we grabbed page
container MCS instance name and we say
dot remove child this time we've got to
get that one out of there that's in
there now but only when this transition
finishes not before see so now we're
inside that function everything will do
it correctly at index 1 so we remove
child inside of that page container
movie clip at index 1 which will
effectively remove the child that we
used addchild to place at in the index
one here so it removes that child then
the next line is going to be the tween
to bring the new one in so let's get
grab this one it's going to be very
similar this is going to be BTN 1 intro
intro change that out and instead of
going from 1 to 0 we're going to go from
0 to 1 invisible to fully visible and it
makes a cool little effect and it's all
code no tween on the timeline okay so I
think that's everything we need so if i
press well it's not even present but in
one yet because you're really not going
to see much you really see the effect
when you have multiple set up so let's
go ahead and add this to function too
now watch this we add this here we
change a couple of things right there
change that to button to make sure all
these are button 2 and this has to be
run button to transition Run button to
transition that's it now you press
control enter
I have it no what did I do remove child
no child ah more child at
you can't just claim remove child there
if you want to remove a cert a child at
a certain index then you have to claim
remove child at now press control enter
okay so we get our initial tweens it's
great now when we press make page two
we'll see page 1 fades out and page 2
will be fed in because I'm missing
addchild
oh I never did add child
so we remove child then we have to add
the new child right here right when you
remove it you add the new one and this
will be p1 for that one and four button
to HP too sorry about that I'm going to
leave all these in and not edit that out
so you guys know everybody runs through
little hassles in their code but they're
easily fixed once you understand what
the code is doing so basically we run a
tween that's going to be the outro then
we put a listener that's for when that
tween finishes when that's when finishes
we fire off this function this function
has in it to remove the child in the
page container then we add the new child
that we want to add then we run the
intro to bring that interview in an
animated fashion same thing for this we
remove child at index of one in that
page container movie clip then we add
child page 2 to the page container MC
and run its intro on the page container
MC let's see if this works right now
ok press page two we'll just see it fade
out and page to fade in main page fade
out fade in fade out fade in you can see
it holds and retains the page value
until the motion is finished that's what
we wanted to achieve ok so you can see
it's all code no timeline tweening there
it's good stuff so what I'm going to do
is make two more which you saw the way i
coded these first two out so you should
be well familiar with what I've done and
you can be able to tweak it around and
what I'm going to do is add different
transitions for each page and then we'll
discuss that and that's pretty much it
will have this free file for download at
develop PHP and you guys can play around
with all the different transition
effects that you can achieve with flash
and I'm going to recommend another file
that you go and look at that I have
another tutorial ok I added the last two
transition effects inside of the BTN
three click and BTW and for click
functions and this one manipulates the
width of the object this one manipulates
the y-coordinates tweens the width
betweens the why this one tweens the x
coordinates and the first one twins the
alpha which you saw me built and they're
all very very similar and there's a lot
of different these effects that you can
play around with and is also different
tween effects and transition manager
effects in the transition class you can
also add those to these and I have a in
the animation sections in the flash tab
at developed PHP I have a tutorial that
is called learn transition effects
something I think you can see how the
transition manager is used if you want
to look into that let's press control
enter and see what we have
okay there's our nice law animation once
again I have the sound cut down for this
and they're our menu and our main page
bounces into interview on the initial
site load there then we press page two
you can see that X tween then you can
notice that it holds the current page
that's there on the outro and on the
intro it brings in the new page so main
page when we press page two main page
will stay in the container until the
outro is done see page 3 is the width
between the width so it holds the and
then the page for we're tweeting the Y
position to bring it in from that side
bring it in from that side you can go
between from this side you can do an out
between and also with tween and that's
how it works a lot of folks we're trying
to understand how to hold the current
page data on their outros and then bring
in intros with the new page data and
this one addresses that really well this
tutorial file and it also addresses
learning how to you know really master
your transition effects to do it all of
your tweens through code and not use the
timeline at all even on this main scene
I could have done this tween this alpha
tween using code but I just chose to do
it manually okay so I'm going to have
this file available free for download at
develop PHP comm in I might make a new
section for full flash websites and put
all my tutorials that pertain to that
kind of stuff in that section but we'll
see if not it'll be in that list
somewhere you'll have to find it it'll
be on the homepage for a while also</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
