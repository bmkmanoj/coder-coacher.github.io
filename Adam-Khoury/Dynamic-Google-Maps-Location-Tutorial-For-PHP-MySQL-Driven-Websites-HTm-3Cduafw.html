roaming around and I ran across a topic
that had caught my interest and the
guy's title was his name Stan member at
develop PHP he writes google map in
profile and that's what piqued my
curiosity because I kind of know what he
was talking about and I was like that's
a very interesting idea let me
investigate that so I wrote what he
wrote I would like to know how I would
insert a Google map in a user profile
that will show the user location based
on their address from the MySQL database
meaning that he wants a dynamically
driven google map so you can use little
snippet of code that you get from google
to embed a map into your page but all we
have to do is do a little bit of PHP
tweak it and we'll make it dynamically
render all kind of different information
for all thousands and millions of
different people you have in your
database one little map the same map and
I will be putting it into web intersect
because I happen to have a little
memberships in there with a lot of
people from different places all over
the globe ok so here I am at my member
base website and I want to get the map
embedded right there at the bottom nice
and big
just for example say you guys can make
it any size you want and I'll show you
how to adjust the size no problem but
first thing you got to do is go and get
the code so you go to cool and then you
go to maps and then you type in let's
see since my site doesn't give direct
address like to their home physical
address I think it's very safe to use
this on a site like mine but if yours
uses a direct home address you might
want to make sure that things very very
privatized and secure your site using a
direct physical address on a social
network that is wide open
you know maybe things profile should be
private at that point things like that
but I'm sure you guys started out
already
so what we're going to do is go to
Google Maps and we'll see that he is in
clack-clack then on CSX clacton-on-sea
xyx United Kingdom I think that's how
you separate that but anyways I'm just
going to type that in to Google Maps I'm
going to search that and there's
clacton-on-sea and I guess that's Essex
United Kingdom and so I'm going to go
here and you don't even have to worry
about this location you can do any
location in the world to get this code
at first but then we'll make it dynamic
and I think you go to link here and
right here it says base link in an email
or paste HTML to embed in a website
that's where we want that iframe now
grab that whole thing by pressing ctrl C
when it all turns blue and highlights
there I press control C now it's in my
clipboard now I go to Dreamweaver in my
member profiles here and I know exactly
where I want this thing to display under
everything else maybe I'll put it right
here under this I can actually just add
a very conveniently add a row to this
table will do it in design view we'll
make it two rows and then we'll merge
these two rows by hitting merge selected
cells or will merge those two cells
sorry and then right there where the
blinker is cursor the cursor is blinking
we're going to go to code view and in
that table cell that's where we're going
to put this code then we're going to use
PHP to tweak it out put the member
profile location data into this location
instead of right here instead of
clacton-on-sea at 69 Kingdom
blahblahblah we're going to make a
little string a variable data and we're
going to lay right in there instead of
that the width we're going to make a lot
wider on mine and this is where you
adjust your size and regarding this
little link I'm not sure if you need
that I'm not sure Google requires you
use that but it's a link to view larger
map so you want to might you might want
to use it anyway and make both strings
dynamic but I think you can just get rid
of that
let's comment that out all we need is
this big one the iframe we don't really
need the link unless Google requires it
and I'm not sure you might want to look
into that that's something I'll look
into but you might want to look into it
on your own maybe somebody can answer in
the comments section below here whether
or not Google requires that you use that
little small link that's wrapped in the
small tag after the iframe is that
required I don't know that's that's to
be a good question though
because I'm sure some people would
rather do without that link I don't
think I want to put it in but if I have
to I will now within your while loop
you're going to have all the information
for that member pouring out of your
database each field from the database so
we're going to grab the city state and
country in mind and like I said if you
happen to have a more direct physical
address like 55 - 55 55th Street some
city some town whatever then you can lay
that in there and get a direct location
to their address very precisely using
this method but like I said you might
want to have things privatized at that
point so we got what we need let's go
back down to where we're outputting this
frame and now let's make it a little
dynamic I'll just assemble the string
and show you the finished product and
explain it real quick it's not going to
take very long now I'll just show you my
process might take a little longer but
you might get more out of it so first
I'll throw those out there because city
state and country is what I want and
just the variable under that I'm going
to put a PHP block you can go and
Dreamweaver if you're in Dreamweaver you
can go up here to top make it nice and
easy putting code block if not you just
type that in and then we're going to put
in let's just put double quotes so to be
easier to bind all of these guys
together city first we're going to put
state right next to it and then country
then we're going to take a gander down
here at the code that produces the
iframe for the map and we're going to
see it has little
signs there you see that so all I'm
going to do is put comma plus sign in
between each one of those variables very
simple and since we're using double
quotes there we don't have to worry
about any syntax pawpaws using this
it'll put the users if they have it in
your database it'll put their city state
string right there over city state and
country string right there so we're
going to put that location string to
output actually we can just echo that
make it easier on ourselves less code
echo city state country and we'll wrap
that up wrap that up and guess where we
place that will control X and place it
right city state and country right there
between that equal sign and that and amp
that ampersand and that equals sign
that's where you put it right there
now the you might just want to leave out
the because it looks like there's
longitude and latitude there let's see
what happens if I just leave that out
make that equal nothing and see if I can
just remove that hole and amp for the
whole longitude/latitude thing Z equals
12
that's a restrictor alright I'm going to
try this out
well looks like there's another place I
need to get that right here Q equals all
the way to there boom same string and
SSL and amp SS s ll that's the longitude
and latitude I think again we'll remove
that once again let's see what it gives
us okay gave it the old FTP and I'm
going to now refresh the page on that
profile that PHP page and hopefully down
here at the bottom it will show the
location for this member which is
clacton-on-sea SX United Kingdom refresh
booyah baby and you remember I took out
the longitude and latitude and it still
works because if you put in that
longitude and latitude it's going to be
incorrect let's go to my profile and see
what happen should show me here in the
United States and like talk to North
Carolina because that's where I live and
there I am in Lake Tahoe a North
Carolina it's a beautiful thing so there
you have it I hope that proves helpful
to a lot of you guys I think I'm going
to use this actually and keep it in
place at Webb intersect because I like
it so much and Don from develop PHP I've
got to thank you for a cool idea buddy
it was really cool idea to dynamically
embed that into a member site and I'm
going to put mine right here somewhere I
think really small but just so people
can access it and be a cool little
gadget thing all righty we'll see you
guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
