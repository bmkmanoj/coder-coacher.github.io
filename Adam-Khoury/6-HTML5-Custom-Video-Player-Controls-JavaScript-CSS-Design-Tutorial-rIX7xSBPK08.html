the html5 video controls in this video
we'll show some design tips for
customizing the video player to match
your specific brand or your specific
site design and I want to remind
everyone that html5 css3 and some
JavaScript functionality cannot yet be
depended on to work in all browsers or
software environments now once these
technologies are standardized you can
then depend on them to work across the
board and that's going to happen pretty
soon first let's take a look at what we
left off with we have really all of the
components that we need for a standard
custom programmed video player with all
the controls that you would expect to be
on a standard player now the first thing
I want to do is customize the way the
slider components look because I don't
like the default slider component look
so we can just use some simple CSS to
achieve that effect
all right so enter into the style
element and pop in this code that's
going to infect all input type range
elements on your page and you can also
call those by ID or class name if you
want to have more range elements on your
page that are not styled this way then
you'll want to target those by the seek
slider and volume slider ID or give them
a class give those elements a class and
then apply these rules to that class but
what I'm doing right here is just I'm
targeting all input type range elements
on my page so let's press ctrl s to save
the file and now let's refresh our
little application alright so now I have
the exact kind of slider that I want I
have my own little custom knobby and my
own little custom track that that knobby
slides along you see you can make those
any color shape that you want those can
be square the way I got those to be
round little buttons and make the mouse
turn to that little hand symbol when
they go over them is by using
cursor:pointer to make the hand symbol
appear like it was a button and
border-radius 100 that gives me the
complete nice
effect on that element otherwise it
would be perfectly square and I made it
have background white and its size is 15
round and we use the WebKit prefix for
the appearance property and we give that
a value of none now in the future you
could remove the WebKit prefix right
there
and right there and right there
and you could expect it to work in most
browsing environments and that's in the
future for now we have to use some
prefixes where they're available and
this property and the slider thumb you
can't access the slider thumb and
Firefox yet because Firefox won't even
render the range element yet so you're
just going to have to wait now what you
can do is use a div inside of another
div for a custom slider component and
you'll also have to program custom drag
features into your knob that's why I
just opted to use the input type range
element this way I don't have to program
any custom drag features into my sliders
but like I said I'm going to be using
flash video just like YouTube does until
I my indication for when to turn to
using html5 video elements is going to
be the day when YouTube starts using the
html5 video element YouTube still uses
the flash video element so the day when
they switch that is your indication
that's the day you know when you can
switch safely and it'll be worth it for
you to check out their source code to
see how they're handling fall backs or
workarounds when that day comes and
actually I'm going to make my slider
look a little bit more like this slider
here where it has a little bit of border
color so I'll make this background black
and then give it a border maybe
something like that 1 pixel solid now
I'll refresh my little player see now I
have the exact sliders that I want and I
could make this any color that I want
you can also set a default font so I'll
show you how to change the font for any
text that you might have in your
controls so you can go into your
controls bar and set the font family
right there
I'll make mine Trebuchet then I'll test
this again and you can see now I have a
specified font now the only thing left
is to make graphical representations
these buttons you can see when my pause
when my play pause button goes into
pause state it knocks out like one of my
elements to go down so I'm going to make
a little button to go there where each
state will be the exact same size and I
won't have those issues and I'll just
show you how to customize the play pause
button and then you can go ahead for
homework you can change your mute button
to be graphics and also your fullscreen
button you can do that the same way that
I'm going to do the play pause buttons
okay I'm going to use fireworks to setup
my play pause graphics so I'm going to
create a new document make it 800 by 600
okay
now I want to capture the screen and get
the graphics or get the look of my
player in the screen so I'm going to do
that I'm going to press print screen on
my keyboard and I can close that now go
back into fireworks and press ctrl V to
paste that print screen and now I can go
ahead and put a little rectangle right
over that play button and then bring up
my properties bar and make that little
rectangle the same color as the bar that
way I have a nice clear little canvas to
create there so what I'll do is pull out
another shape
hold down the shapes tool and we'll get
the star or you can use I think smart
polygon let's use smart polygons and
I'll change the sides to only three and
I'm going to change the color on that to
a lighter gray or actually let's just go
ahead and make it solid white and we can
make it as gray as we want and have cool
hover effects on it using opacity
settings in css3 will keep things easier
so I want to rotate that little guy so I
can hit my scale tool and make sure I
have the little rotation symbol on my
mouse there and then just hold down
shift and it'll rotate at perfect angles
so you get it like that and then you
scale it and then
you just drag it into place and you can
make that any size that you want so I'll
make it a little smaller you can zoom in
by holding ctrl and mouse wheel I'm
gonna make it a little bit smaller all
right that looks good to me so it's a 16
wide and 18 high so now what I'm going
to do is remove everything control X get
rid of this control X and then I'm going
to make my canvas transparent you can
see my symbol is still sitting there
now I'll fit canvas on that little
symbol so I'll go to file export wizard
continue the web exit and then go to PNG
32 mat can be transparent mat and export
so I'm going to save it in the same
folder where I'm building my little
video player on my watch HTML page the
same folder that might watch HTML pages
you probably want to have this in your
images folder or something like that but
I'm just going to put it in the same
folder and I'll name it play save now I
also want to have a pause button that is
the same dimensions the same size so
what I'm going to do is go to my canvas
I'll make it like the color of my my bar
again and I'll just remove this control
X and I'll get a rectangle and I'm just
going to add two little rectangles there
I'll make them white also control C
control V make a copy of that one put it
right next to the other one now I'm
going to go and get my canvas back to
transparent and do the same process
again file export wizard continue
continue and save it as a transparent
PNG in the same folder this one we're
going to name pause save
alright now I'm going to go down and
check out my play pause button I'm going
to copy that ID for that and I don't
have any CSS rule setup for that bad boy
yet so I'm going to go up here maybe
right under the videos control bar and
I'm going to type in button with an ID
of play pause button it's going to be
targeted so we can bring that closing
curly brace down all right so we're
going to give it a background image and
the URL that we're going to target is
the play PNG and we give it a border of
none and we set the width that our image
was the little triangle and we make sure
we give it cursor:pointer that way the
little hand symbol shows up when the
users mouse goes over it so if we check
this out you can see that we get the
little hand symbol we have to remove the
word play and pause that are on it and
we're going to do that in just a second
and we also want to make let's let's
also give it a hover State so when the
mouse goes over it it'll turn a little
bit brighter so what we can do to
achieve that first of all let's go down
here and where it says pause on that
play button let's remove that now let's
go and give it an opacity setting of
maybe 0.7 and then take a look at what
you have you'll see it's a little bit
greyed out now it's a little bit more
gray than it was before
okay let's even make it 0.5 and now what
we're going to do is copy this and just
put it right under it close our curly
brace there put a colon to access the
hover pseudo selector so we put the
hover pseudo selector for that play
pause button and we're going to turn its
opacity 1.0 or just 1 when the users
mouse hovers over it and now you can
check out that effect so even if my
mouse goes over it changes to a brighter
sideways triangle now we still have to
go into the JavaScript and change the
play pause function so it's not putting
words into that element you know what I
mean so let's go and let's just go ahead
and collapse all this style code and
then we'll go and open the script code
and where are we we have the play/pause
function right there now we don't want
to affect the inner HTML of that play
button we want to change its style so
we're going to say play button dot style
dot background and then we're going to
set the URL right there so we can go
ahead and just borrow that code right
there ctrl C and then put it into place
right there and we'll see if this works
and this wants to be the pause you want
to say pause PNG right there and then we
can copy this code right here and put it
right there and change this to play dot
PNG now let's see if that works
oh I see I'm supposed to have it cause
by default I'm supposed to have this be
pause by default so this should be
paused by default up in your CSS now
test since we have it set to auto play
you have to have your pause symbol up
first and then when they click pause you
want to change it to the play symbol and
vice versa
back and forth see that's the
functionality you want so when it first
loads its a pause symbol and you can see
that it still has its full hover effect
no matter if it's the polish symbol or
the play symbol it's pretty cool huh
alright so now you guys can go about
positioning these things to be anywhere
that you want in there and if you want
to use display:block elements you can
set all of these elements to
display:block and then you can float
them in there and you can give them
margin top or padding top to move them
up or down in this bar wherever you need
them to sit exactly you can set the
exact pixel where those things would be
in there vertically okay I'm not going
to do all that crap for you now you saw
how I put that cool hover effect where
it goes from dark to light just by using
opacity you can do the same thing to
this little button and this little
button will also get that effect applied
to it now since you know how to do this
one I want you to do the same thing for
your mute button and your fullscreen
button and that's your homework and then
you'll have a nice finish totally
customized player I hope you've enjoyed
this series and I'll catch you guys in
the next one
that completes this series goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
