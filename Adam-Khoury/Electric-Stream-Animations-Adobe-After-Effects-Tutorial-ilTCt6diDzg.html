then this is dobby after effects
tutorial I'll be showing you how to
create electric stream you can work
right with me right along with me man
just open up your Adobe After Effects I
have mine open we can come together work
together you can just follow everything
that I do because I am the master no I'm
just kidding but anyway you can work
right alongside with me and I'll show
you how to make these effects it's very
simple it's using custom lines that we
create with the pen tool we're using the
wave warp effect any kind of wave you
want sine wave square wave triangular
wave and we're also using the wiggle
line wiggle whatever you call that
stupid thing and we're making the line
shaped anyway we need it and then we're
animating it it's pretty cool and we can
work together like side by side and
actually I'm gonna take off my pants and
my underpants and I'm gonna work like
that and you can work like that too if
you want let's get started okay the
first thing we do is create a new
composition so we go to composition new
composition and in the settings here you
can tweak these any way you like see
it's set at 15 duration I'm gonna change
that to be only about 5 seconds 0 5
okay 640 by 360 that's nice okay so in
the composition window here in the view
pane I have a 100% perspective I can
change that to 50% 400 all that good
stuff or you can just scroll put your
mouse in there and scroll and it changes
that all right so let's file import file
from the desktop electric stream logo
now the electric stream logo is here in
the project panel his project panel is
where all of your project files reside
drag it out to the composition window
and there it is now you can take your
pen tool right when you start to draw in
the composition window it will create a
new layer for that shape so let's click
down let's click here click down here
and then let's click somewhere around
over here and then hold it down and then
move it while you're holding it down and
drag it to get the shape you want now we
have a line with the stroke one pixel
solid right now so let's go to the shape
layer here let's lock the electric
stream layer and here's where you have
your your layering and also your your
timelines right here if you want don't
want it to be five seconds you can just
grab this timeline marker at the end
let's say we just want it to be three
seconds let's put it right there okay so
now to get this thing animated all we
have to do is add a few effects and we
won't be manually tweening the effects
will have the animation themselves so
let's go to first thing is let's go and
open by hitting this little arrow button
its openness shapes
attributes and hits add and go to wiggle
paths and you can see what it did it
made the line a little bit Wiggly so now
let's go into wiggle paths to edit these
options here inside of wiggle paths
let's edit the detail let's bring that
up a little worried about 30 the size 22
looks good maybe about 14 not even yeah
15 it looks good now let's bring the
Wiggles per second down to zero now when
we do that now it won't animate
basically all we've done is distorted
the line to look jagged and kind of
electrical so now let's go ahead and
close that up and we're gonna go to
effects let's click that layer now we
can't click the logo because it's locked
so that's good so let's go to effect and
first thing we'll do is add a glow so
let's go to stylize glow then go to
effect mm distort
and actually let's go ahead to stylize
again and roughing edges bring the
border down to maybe at one point six
looks good and then you can tweak these
settings out as much as you like offset
the turbulence see what that does you
can offset the position of your
turbulence there and then let's bring
that up a little more right there
complexity you can bring that way up or
way down I'm gonna leave it right about
seven it looks good for that now last
thing we need is so we have a glow
effect and the roughing edges so if we
go up to the top here let's close the
glow effect so here's the two effects
that are on this line this shape layer
shaped layer one okay so if we go down
to the timeline we highlight this
compound panel right here make sure it's
got the orange border around it you can
see when different panels are
highlighted by the orange border down
here we just hit the spacebar and it'll
make the playhead go and you can see
nothing's animated yet so after we get
the line looking like we want by using
the wiggle paths and roughing edges then
we want to add something that will
animate it and bring it to life so let's
go to effect distort and here we add the
wave warp and once you add the wave warp
that's when he gives it its animation
I'm gonna amp up the speed on the wave
warp to about maybe three and then
let's get the wave height down to maybe
104 and the wave width let's bring that
closer so and this is using a sine wave
and there's a whole bunch of different
types you can try and that looks good to
me so let's I'm gonna whip 22 let's see
what that looks like press play if you
want to get the animation or the
playhead tools here you can go to
effects and that will give you the time
controls there just press play and it
will start rendering it out and when it
renders out it'll be a little slow but
after the rendering gets done and it
renders in all these frames and it plays
quick like normal say you can really
tweak out that this direction you can
change the direction to make it the
points and the way it streams change
let's get these closer together
and then you can change you can also
change this to stroke makes a dramatic
difference that's a stroke of two pixels
you can change it let's get the right
color here
now let's bring it back to maybe see how
that looks so there you see it's a very
simple way to use kind of like
oscilloscope waves sine waves you can
change this let's try the square this
should look pretty cool
I almost like this better
it doesn't jump as much it just kind of
streams like electricity through there
it's flowing from one side to the other
so there's a whole bunch of different
ways you can tweak this out and you guys
that are more artistic than I am can
really go crazy with all these different
effects and all the different wave types
you got here and all the different stuff
you can add there's a million different
effects and presets and after-effects
that you can play with that's just one
way to do it and if you guys want to see
any more of After Effects from me just
let me know in the comment area now when
once you're done with this you can go to
file export render it out as a flash swf
use it as your logo in your flash file
because as you know SWFs can be imported
straight into flash and used right there
on the stage or couture key see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
