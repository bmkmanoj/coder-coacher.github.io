to buy flash building in this lesson
we'll go over importing custom models
into your scene to make any shape model
you need or body style that you might
want to start with raw polygon structure
if these default mesh models don't suit
your needs you can create your own mesh
models that are exactly what you need
all the exact shapes and intricacies
that you need so you can go into let's
close that out and there are let's see
there are several programs that you can
use to create yours but i'm going to use
maya you can be in google sketchup or
any type of program that exports obj
files it has to be a dot obj object file
for in order for Mudbox 2009 to bring it
in so let's go into Maya let's create a
custom shape
okay if you want to know what I'm doing
if you happen to have maya i just
created a polygon cube i'm going to also
create a curve and it's see EP curve
tool zoom out a little bit
I'm going to draw out my curve
zoom out a little more
more yeah that's a good curve now let's
take this little square put this cube
and make them a little bit bigger it
should be good right there and then you
can go to where you can look at that
face and then grab let's make a little
smaller there we go and what you want to
do is right click the object select face
grab that face and then press shift on
your keyboard and grab the curve as well
with them both selected you go to edit
polygons and extrude face and what that
did was they brought that face out to
the end of my curved point now that I
have that I can go into divisions here
and subdivide it and bring it up a lil
you see it better see how I'm
subdividing and when you subdivide more
and more and more makes the polygon
count higher throughout that and then
you you can twist it
and add a taper to it if you like make
it bigger or smaller in the end I'll
make it smaller and then you can go to
let's see let's just right-click it go
back to object mode selector select it
go up to polygon smooth now you can see
I've got a nice snake looking thing
there so this is how you could create a
custom snake easily there's a tutorial
for you in Maya ok so or hair or fingers
or whatever you're going to make that
has to have a nice curve to it like his
fingers wouldn't have that curve but you
can make fingers with this that little
lesson right there without taking the
taper so far and the twisting and all
that you know what I mean alright so
we'll we're in object mode just select
that item and then go to file export
selection and save it as snake it's
going to be an object file you see down
here obj export that makes an object
file and put it on my desktop press
export go back into the mud box
go to file import double-click snake go
to find it on your computer and
double-click snake or whatever you named
it as and then you'll notice that it's
super tiny so we'll go ahead and zoom
out zoom out some more and a little more
that's good then we'll go to scale first
we got a selected object scale and then
just go ahead and drag that either way
to scale it up or down and because that
would have been way too small to sculpt
on now we have a nice big model there
it's not a little bit there now you have
a nice big models to begin your your
custom model sculpting to detail it and
then there's all kinds of things you can
do with it from there but that that
concludes importing custom objects and
custom shape meshes that you need a
custom forms in order to to really get
the the intricacies that you need okay
and the next lesson in Lesson number
three we're going to start sculpting
will show you the tools really quick and
then won't take too much time on the
tools and then we'll just head straight
into sculpting all right we'll see you
guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
