building here what we have here is a
file that I created about a year ago and
it was inspired by a menu I saw at
adobe.com and I was at adobe com and
they had they were showcasing i think it
was like it was something like
dreamweaver was sitting there and then
flash and photoshop they were all going
up and down and i noticed how they had
cool reflections that would go up and
down away from them so it looks like
kind of like a glass bottom flat
reflective surface there that they were
flying and floating up on the moscow is
over and then you click them certain
things happen and you click these
they'll go to a URL open a webpage but
you can have it script to where it does
something in your flash file too so let
me explain to you now it's going to be
free for download at develop PHP calm
and you can just go and snatch it up and
since it was just laying around I
haven't used it for about a year now
maybe a little less but I haven't used
it for a while it's just going to go
obsolete and I won't use it and I think
it's a really nifty effect and it's all
manual is not much really complex going
on about it so it's easy to understand
how to do it so let's check it out good
okay so if the men if the menu interests
you and you coming you downloaded you're
going to open it up in cs3 or cs4 notice
it's programmed in actionscript 3 and
this is the only movie clip right here
that's of interest really this is just
text fields and crap that I threw in
there now this movie clip you
double-click inside of it and that's
where all the magic happening and what
we have is a red glow layer which is
that red glow behind all three of those
display items their menu items and then
we have site one which is menu item one
site to and site three so you have three
menu items and each is its own movie
clip and you can see how the reflection
and this idea the item is join together
inside of them what we could and you see
how they each have instance names down
here ok I just rename this layer as3
because that's where the script is and
there's also this little black gradient
that's on the on that layer as well now
I'm going to mention something really
quick if you happen to have a pattern
background where it's not possible to
have a gradient to make your reflections
effect and your fade offs then you can
use caches bitmap tutorial we have a
develop HP which shows you how to take a
movie clip and make a perfect reflection
of it with the gradient on it like that
and you can use a pattern background
using this year only works for flat so I
have a flat black background so using
this gradient works for me I just wanted
to note that you guys to know that if
you had a pattern background it's still
possible to do all this but you have to
use the cash is pit Mac method
ok now the code is also simple easy
button stuff and let's highlight that
layer press f9 open the actions panel
and look at it so what we have here is
function target / and function target
out which are universal functions that
run for all the menu items when they
rolled over since each menu item each
three of these each one of these three
menu items has the same structure on the
inner timeline then we can use Universal
functions so that's what we do instead
of having an over and out for each one
they're Universal and all you have to do
is make a listener for each you don't
have to have a function for each that's
if the inner timelines allow you to do
that if all your buttons are the same or
all your items ok so now usually it
pertains to movie clip buttons you can
use that ok so now the the functions we
see here FB down we down and develop PHP
down let's just name that way because
that's the site that it goes to flash
building web intersect and develop PHP
so those are the functions that when
clicked when those menu items are
clicked each one of these sites then
these functions will fire off and it'll
navigate to that URL that's navigates
URL code right there and so that's what
happens so here's the listeners with a
rollover and roll out for the functions
the universal functions up top and
here's the listeners for the cliq
functions which are right here that have
the URLs of where to go when clicked so
that's the extent of the complexity of
the code just simple button sub now
what we have on the inner timeline of
each menu item i'm going to show you now
okay so since all three are exactly the
same i'm going to click on one double
click it and show you the in enter
timeline and how the this movie clip is
set up and each one is set up exactly
the same okay so on the top we have the
actions layer where if you'll press f9
on those you'll see the stop action
there and then there's a stop action
there and we have an over state that
happens right here so this fire is off
with those event listeners that we were
looking at a minute ago in the script
over it opens up or Rises and then out
when out fires off it goes back down
it's very simple over and out now what
happens is this item here goes down this
item here goes up and then there is an
item in the center right here on the
bottom which I put there so when we're
all the way extended up and down this
item is here to make sure that it stays
up even if the mouse is sitting right
here the users mouse is sitting in that
blank spot between those it will stay
active and up and so that's why that is
there this layer 6 and then there is a
gradient that goes up with this bottom
layer let's see if we make it to where
we can't see that gradient it looks just
like the one on top so I just put a
gradient on it black to match my flat
black background and it makes it looks
like it's more of a reflection on a
glass surface so that's how that works
and like I said each one of those three
is exactly the same
and that's pretty much all you need to
know and it makes a really really
awesome effect really classy cool
professional looking great for a website
portfolio like I'm using it here it's
like a showcasing these three websites
or products software's whatever anything
it's just very engaging menu very nice
okay well I think so anyway and I think
a lot of other people would think so you
don't really see this much it's very
unique</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
