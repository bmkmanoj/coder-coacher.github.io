html5 video controls in this lesson we
will focus on programming sound controls
into our custom video player using
javascript we're going to add a mute
button and a volume slider control by
accessing the muted and volume
properties of the video object in
JavaScript there's two properties we can
access one is called muted and the other
one is called volume we're going to
continue with the same code that we left
off with in video number three so right
under your time display or right next to
your time display we're going to add
we're going to add another button so
let's just grab this button and paste it
right there and let's name it mute BTN
and on the inner HTML let's put the word
mute now let's highlight that ID press
ctrl C to copy it and now let's open up
our JavaScript now we go up to the top
of our JavaScript we're going to
initialize a new variable name called
mute button and let's go ahead and set
an object reference for that mute button
so let's put mute BTN right there and
mute BTN right there and we have to set
up a click event listener for that
button so let's just grab this play
buttons click event listener let's put
it right here at the bottom and let's
change that to mute button mute button
add event listener of click and we'll
name that function vid mute now all we
need is a vid mute function put into our
script so let's go down to the bottom
here let's type in function vid mute
open closed parenthesis curly brace and
curly brace now this function is going
to be set up very much like the
play/pause function so let's just grab
that if-else condition statement put it
into place in the vid mute function and
then we're going to say if vid dot muted
we're accessing the muted property so if
the video is muted will say vid muted
equals false to turn the sound back on
then we have to make sure we're
targeting the mute button here
and it's innerhtml it's going to say
mute and then down here in the else
condition you can make the button say
unmute and remember in the later videos
I'm going to show you guys how to put
graphics in place of all these words
because you would want little icons
instead of words and your buttons and
then the else condition also make sure
that you're setting the muted property
to true now let's view it in the browser
that we're testing with so I hit mute
you can see my video is now muted and my
button says unmute so if I click that
button again
I hear sound button says you
okay so that's working just fine now
let's take this seek slider and I'm
going to give it a specific width
because right now it just has the
default width so I'll type in input in
my CSS pound sign seek slider open
closed curly braces and let's give that
a width of say 240 pixels whatever you
want now let's see what that looks like
I just want to make sure that I have
enough room here to put a volume slider
and then a full-screen button so I want
that to be a little bit less wide so I'm
going to make it maybe 180 refresh and
now I have room for the other controls
that I'm going to put in so we're going
to put a volume slider right here it's
going to be very similar to the seek
slider so we'll have a volume slider
right here and then we'll leave
ourselves enough room for a fullscreen
button on the end here so let's go down
into our HTML and we're going to copy
this seek slider input and we're going
to put it right next to our mute button
and we're going to name that instead of
seek slider sound slider or you can name
it volume slider that makes more sense
now let's highlight that let's go up
into our CSS and let's put input pound
volume slider open closed curly braces
let's give that a width of about 80
pixels you can check to see what that'll
look like that looks good to me
and remember we're going to be pretty
fiying making this whole thing a lot
more sexy after we get all the basic
controls programmed now all we have to
do is apply it to the script so the ID
of our volume slider is volume slider so
what we'll do is add that right after
the mute button where we're initializing
all of our variable names we're going to
go ahead and make an object reference
for that as well
right under the mute button put volume
slider there and there now you have an
object reference for that let's copy
this seek slider add eventlistener
function
let's go ahead and put that under the
mute button add eventlistener and we're
going to change that from seek slider to
volume slider add eventlistener of
change and what we're going to do is
change the vid seek function to a set
volume function so the name of the
function that fires off when people
slide that volume slider the name of the
function that will execute is set volume
so let's copy the name of that function
let's go down to the very bottom let's
type in function set volume open closed
parenthesis opening curly brace and
closing curly brace now in the HTML for
the volume slider we're going to put the
value at 100 that way the volume knob is
all the way in the full volume position
so if we check that we'll see our
all the way to the right like it should
be now inside of your set volume
function you only need one line of code
so you save it'd take the video object
and you access its volume property and
you make that equal to your volume
sliders value divided by 100 and let's
go ahead and give that a test see
everything's working just fine
now when you mute it you're going to
want so if you hit the mute button
you're going to want this little dial to
go all the way to the back then when you
unmute it you want this little dial to
go all the way to the front and I'm not
going to program that in for you guys
it's very simple to make this knob go
wherever you want it to go and set the
volume for your video so you see how I
just set the volume for my video so what
you want to do is go into your view tunc
ssin and put in some more code that will
make sure that that volume slider knob
goes where it needs to go and the volume
is set where it needs to be set when
people mute and unmute your video that's
your homework assignment that I'm going
to leave for you I can do it I can do it
in just a couple of minutes but I don't
want to do everything for you
okay let's take a last look we have a
nice volume slider control we have a
mute button that works we have our time
display the current play time and
the full duration we also have a
play/pause button and then a video seek
bar now the last control that we need is
a fullscreen button sitting here and
that will give us a whole standard
player and that will be just the
programming side of it and I'll also put
out another video after that one showing
you guys some design tips you can use
CSS to prettify this whole thing and
make it sexy make it look the way you
want and instead of using words on your
buttons we're going to use actual
graphics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
