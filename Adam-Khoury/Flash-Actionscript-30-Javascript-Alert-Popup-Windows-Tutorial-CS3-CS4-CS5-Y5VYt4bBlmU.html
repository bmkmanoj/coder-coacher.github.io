video tutorial in flash ActionScript 3
about how to create pop-up windows from
within flash any buttons that you wanted
to press or any time in your
ActionScript you can make a JavaScript
pop-up window happen and now I've got a
request from someone to do a tutorial
about a JavaScript pop-up alert from
within flash I've had this request about
10 times now so I'm gonna go ahead and
bang it out today so if you want to
learn how to make a pop-up alert window
from within flash ActionScript 3 you'll
be learning that today ok first thing
we'll do is go into flash cs4 or you can
be in cs3 any version of flash that
handles ActionScript 3 let's create new
ActionScript 3 file and once we're
inside let's go ahead and grab a
rectangle primitive draw it out to stage
and around the corners just a little bit
on it okay so I've got my button
graphics all laid out
you've got static text sitting on top of
my rectangle and I'm gonna highlight
both of those right click convert the
symbol I'm going to turn it into a
button type symbol with the center
registration okay I'm going to give that
an instance name I'm going to highlight
it on stage go up to the properties
panel here and give it an instance name
of alert underscore BTN now I can apply
code to that instance name and have my
code communicate with this button so
let's go ahead here to the layers add a
new layer let's name this one a s3 short
for ActionScript 3 and let's press f9 to
open our actions panel ok so once the
scripting window comes up let's make
sure we have a good size you guys can
see what's going on here the first thing
we're gonna do is type in the function
now it's important to note that when you
have this code running it doesn't have
to be on a button I'm gonna have mine
put on a button just for demonstration
sake but it's important to know that
this code can run at any time and it
doesn't have to be in a Button function
but I'm gonna put it in a Button
function here I'm gonna call it function
J s alert window and that's my function
name and this function is event colon
Mouse event
putting the void open this squiggly
bracket the curly braket their curly
brace go one more line down under that
and let's put the eventlistener for this
function on our button so alert
underscore BTN which is the instance
name we gave our button dot add event
listener and this is going to be Mouse
event
dot click comma and then the function
name which was jeaious alert window here
control-c control-v now we can just
close off and put a semicolon now all we
have to do is put one line in it's going
to be setting up the functionality we
need to make a javascript pop-up window
happen from within flash so let's type
in var alert and let's make this URL
request its equal to a new URL request
now we have a new URL request object
open parenthesis close parenthesis
semicolon now within these parentheses
let's type in double quote double quote
and then within the double quotes let's
type in JavaScript and here's where you
can put any JavaScript you want really
JavaScript : alert because this is going
to be an alert window so we have to
signify it as alert for JavaScript to
understand that and we're gonna put in
single quote single quote within those
parentheses and here you just type in
whatever you want any message you want
let's type in hello world I'm gonna type
in hello what okay so now all we have to
do is type in navigate to URL
alert
because that's the URL object here you
see alert alert , and let's put it in
the target which is going to be self
let's close all this off first
in between these double quotes put it in
self so to be targeting itself as the
window but it's gonna be a JavaScript
pop-up alert so you don't have to worry
about I think that could be blank or
self I'm just gonna have it itself so
now all the code is in that's
communicating to that button and like I
said it this code right here these two
lines don't have to be inside of a
button function they could be in any
part of your ActionScript where you want
a JavaScript pop-up alert window to come
up so now let's press f12 actually let's
go ahead and save our file file save as
and I'm gonna put it I'm going to find a
location where I want to save it on my
computer
okay so I've FTP to everything up to the
web so it's online on my live server I'm
gonna go to the URL where the file is
and there's my little button I'm gonna
click it and there's a JavaScript alert
window easy peasy
there's Internet Explorer here's Mozilla
Firefox same thing works beautiful great
and here we are in Google Chrome
so there you have it the three most
popular browsers over there works no
problem I hope you've enjoyed this one
and we will see you in the next lesson
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
