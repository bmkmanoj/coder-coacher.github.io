Adam a flash building here and in my
opinion this is one of my best and you
can take this lesson and apply it to
your projects whether you're a beginner
just coming into working with flash or
you're a seasoned professional well you
got to do is understand math a little
bit and I pretty much talk you through
the rest and show you how everything's
done to create this from scratch what is
this is kind of like a full flash
website with a an easing multi-plane
background so it has multiple layers
that are easing at different speeds and
they're different sizes okay so you show
you how to get menu items on there as
well it slice little static menu bar up
top - and you'd be a champ if you able
to which I'm going to do this for some
of my designs it's going to the flash
section at develop PHP comm and go down
to the in the Adobe Flash section
there's miscellaneous general
miscellaneous flash and ActionScript 3
tutorials right there true fit elements
if you can combine this one and that one
oh man you'd be in business you'll be
making some of the coolest websites on
the net you'll have it have some nice
templates down that you can create ok so
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial it's
not too long not too short either but it
gives you a cool effect ok this will
work in flash cs3 cs4 or cs5 as long as
you're using ActionScript 3 that's all
it really matters so let's create
ActionScript 3 file when we get inside
let's adjust the stage size you can make
yours whatever you want but you would
just have to adjust your math
accordingly in this size of your objects
accordingly you once start off with what
I have here and then adjust okay so
we're ahem go up to frame rate of 30 if
you're in cs4 you'll already have a
frame rate of 30 but if you're in cs3
you have to set it to 30 so say your
frame rate to 30 get you stay
sighs mm by 600 first thing we'll do is
grab a rectangle primitive you can go
over to the tools hold down on the
shapes tool and grab the rectangle
primitive put it on stage you'll notice
we have a black border and a gray fill
I'm gonna take that gray fill and I'm
gonna make it alpha 23% I'm gonna make
sure it's sitting is zero zero
coordinates x and y and I'm gonna make
sure the size of it is twice the size of
my stage which was 1,000 so I'm gonna
make it 2,000 wide and twice the size of
the height of my stage which was 600 so
it's gonna be 1,200 wide here so now I
have a rectangle that is mm wide 1,200
high sitting at 0-0 coordinates I'm
going to right click convert to symbol
movie clip registration top left is good
and then name it clip one in the library
okay now let's give it an instance name
go to the properties inspector and give
it an instance name of clip one
underscore MC all right that one's set
now let's create clip number two which
is going to be our second plane or our
second layer create another rectangle
primitive same thing except this one's
going to be twice the size of the one we
just created so this one set zero zero
coordinates let's make it 4,000 now
yours don't have to be this big and I'm
gonna have some discussion at the end of
the video the end of the tutorial
about why things are the way they are
and how they can be a little different
you might want to stick around for that
so let's look at this at a viewing of
25% so now you can see we have the stage
which is one thousand and then we have a
rectangle on top of the stage which is
two thousand and then we have on top of
that rectangle
another rectangle which is 4,000 pixels
wide now the one we just placed is still
a rectangle primitive so we're going to
convert that to a symbol and call it
clip 2 now we have two movie clips and
here in the instance name for that one
clip to underscore MC so we have two
clips both of our instance names let's
go over here and highlight both of them
to where they're both selected right
click convert to symbol we're gonna nest
those into a movie clip now and we're
gonna call it whole magic background
okay now we have a movie clip called
whole magic background and we don't have
to give that an instance name it's just
gonna be kind of like a container that's
holding everything
that way we can layer other things into
our flash file on top that maybe you
don't want to move around they want to
be stationary or whatever okay so now we
have two Clips nested inside of one
movie clip let's go inside here let's
make sure they each have their own layer
so let's grab the big one in the back
now let's grab yeah the big one in the
back control X put it on the new layer
on top control shift V you can see
they're still set at 0 coordinates of 0
and 0 both rectangles so layer 2 let's
just rename clip 2 you can see I dry I
grabbed it and I drug it under clip 1 so
clip one is on top of clip to make sure
this one says clip - ok clip one clip -
you can see when we highlight this one
the big one has a blue highlighted
border around it and I like this one the
little one does alright now let's create
a new layer above those two and call it
a s3 we are about to begin some coding
program this thing to work alright now
see is there anything else we need to do
yeah I'm gonna put some items inside
first before we start to code this out
so let's go back to 100%
actually if you want to look at it at
about 5% you can just change that let's
just change that to 15% now we can see
the whole thing you see how big
everything is the stage is that little
white square then we have this movie
clip on top of that and the movie clip
that's under that one
okay let's go back to 100%
viewing size and let's make sure we're
in clip 1 it's a lock clip 2 for now and
the ActionScript relayer double click
inside of it layer 1 let's rename rect
because that's where the rect rectangle
is let's give a new layer above it by
clicking the create or insert layer
button let's rename that stuff this is
the stuff that you're going to have
inside of it
alrighty let's go - and by the way these
borders on that rectangle it's not even
necessary to be there just for my
demonstration I'm going to keep that
black border that black edge on that
rectangle and at the end I'm gonna make
this completely opaque the fill color
right now it's set to alpha 23 so we can
see what's going on a little bit ok so
on the stuff layer I'm going to grab my
pen tool and draw a leaf or something
just some real simple for demonstration
purposes
there we go
and I'm gonna highlight that give it a
fill of green I don't want any edge on
it so I'm gonna take that away I'm gonna
rescale this make it the size I want I'm
also going to skew it just a bit maybe
even this way
you know that works okey-dokey
now I'm gonna convert that to a movie
clip call it leaf okay I'm just gonna
place control C control V control C
control V and place these everywhere
control C control V but all within this
box okay now I have my little leaf movie
clip duplicated in there a whole bunch
of times and just placed in random
places all throughout the inside of that
rectangle and I can grab them see I have
the rect layer locked so I can just
highlight and grab them all and if I
want I can set the Alpha on those down
to whatever I want let's make them about
30% okie dokie now I'm gonna do the same
thing let's double click on the side
here to go back into this layer where we
can highlight the clip to layer let's
lock clip one open clip two and double
click inside of it let's do that same
thing let's go to the library grab our
leaf and start putting them everywhere
okay now I could choose to put different
stuff in this big movie clip what I
think I'm going to do is go into this
little movie clip and grab all this
stuff ctrl C go back into the big movie
clip on this stuff layer ctrl shift V
and then while they're all highlighted
I'm going to go to the scale tool and
I'm going to hold shift and scale them
proportionately to fit inside of that
movie clip but be larger which will give
us a cool effect okay now let's go click
double click on the side here to go back
into the whole magic background clip
where we see our clip 1 and clip 2 layer
and we can lock those because
essentially they're done now we'll go
into the as3 layer and press f9 to open
the actions panel okay I play some code
and it's gonna start our application off
nice and let me explain all these lines
that I just placed in first we have a
stage object and what I did was
just made an instance or an object out
of the stage and so now it's an instance
which can be targeted kind of like a
movie clip would we can find out the
properties of it like the width and the
height and all things like that and so
what we'll do is the next line is set AB
our first stage width and stage height
these next two lines here and we just
target my stage object their stage with
property and so the number is stored in
this variable you can see this variable
is used in the equations down here so
all we did was set stage into an
instance there and then we set the
height and the width in two variables
here of the stage okay now here we set
variables for numbers we're going to
need in our equations that are going to
be inside of our function
okay so we have diff 1x and diff 1 y 2x
and dip 2y which is the difference
between the stage height let me just
explain the first one to you and then
you'll know the other four are very
similar and you can decipher what
they're doing so we have dip 1x is an
integer type variable but we're creating
it here and the value of it is clip 1
underscore MC which is that first movie
clip we made its width minus the stage
width so we know that the stage with is
1000 right and we know that the clip
with is 2,000 so we're going to have a
dip X is going to have different 1 X is
going to have a value of 1000 because
this is 2,000 minus 1000 these are very
similar you can check out what those are
doing map those out in your head with
that same logic okay so the next line is
the ease speed and the e speed is going
to be the rate of movement and each clip
can have a different easing speed but
I'm going to use the same names it
should be easy speed for both and the
offset this is just in case you might
want to offset things a little bit
within your code I placed another
variable but set it to zero because I'm
not gonna really
using it but it might open up some more
functionality that you may need
sometimes so I left it and you can
adjust it if you need to okay now we're
gonna pop in two little listeners and
two little functions so here you can see
I have code comments above it says
listeners on the activator let's change
that to stage because this is a modified
version of one of my tutorials I think
it's one I just put out a couple days
ago but I just took that code and
modified it a good bit to make it do
what I wanted it to do in this case okay
so now we have my stage which we made an
instance we're adding event listener to
it and the it's a mouse event of mouse
over so when the mouse goes over the
stage we add enter frame event the
function is listening well I'm sorry the
function that's going to fire off when
the mouse goes over the stage is at
enter frame event which is this function
sitting right here the function that's
going to fire off when the mouse goes
out of the stage because we have a mouse
over listener and a mouse out listener
is named remove into frame event so
that's this little function right here
and all they do inside of the add into
frame event listener we add an event
listener of enter frame and what that is
is a looping mechanism so where it will
constantly loop and code will run many
many times per second according to your
frame rate and then we remove it here
when we're instructed to when the mouse
goes out okay now we're going to place
the code that is the function activate
so you can see inside of the add
interframe event and remove into frame
event functions here we have a function
called activate that we haven't coded
yet if I tried to run this file right
now I'd get an error because it's
looking to fire off a function called
activate that's not even here yet so
basically when the mouse goes over the
stage you you're going to run this
function called activate in an ornament
and
listener for interframe which is a
looping mechanism many times per second
then when the mouse goes off of the
stage you remove that event you can
choose not to remove that event it's up
to you okay so now I'm going to pop in
that function and let's take a look at
it so here we have lines 26 through 41
this function activate let me explain to
you what happens inside of this function
so just so you know this enter frame
event is firing off multiple times per
second
running this activate function multiple
times per second okay you got to keep
that in your head all right now we have
a set of variables here the first set
are setting the division the division
number that is going to be the mouse X
wherever the mouse is at that second on
stage as this event is firing off
wherever the mouse is at that second on
stage divided by the stage width and
that number is stored in a variable
called div X then we have div Y which is
set up in a similar fashion and that
number is used in these equations down
here or in these variables rather and
then these variables are used in these
equations here so these variables are
the move amounts these are how much each
clip is going to move move X and move Y
are going to be or clip 1 which is let's
see right here diff 1 you can see diff 1
X is referring to clip one dip one Y tip
2 X is referring to clip 2 so here we
use that so this div X we use div x
times dip 1 X and that number is stored
in the variable called move X that
that's so the the movie clip everything
knows how much to move you know each
clip is is going to be aware of how much
it should ease around and move according
to where the mouse is that's what that
variables for so
this one is remove X and move wise for
clip 1 and move clip 2 X and move clip 2
y is for a clip 2 okay
and so here in the final little lines of
code the last war that really make the
objects move around after we get all
these numbers that we need we set the x
position and that's how the movement
occurs and when you set the x position
in the y position so we get up-and-down
in side to side movement out of each
clip and we use the e speed we divide
everything by the e speed and that's how
we get the easing effect to happen and
it happens by multiple times per second
placing it in the new position and new
coordinates that it has to move to and
it creates the ease effect so what we
have here in this line I'll just explain
the first one and then the other three
are very similar so clip one is X
position where it's going to live or
where it's going to wind up is equal to
the offset and really it just keeps
compounding the number by adding by
using this type of operation here plus
equals it kind of keeps compounding it
so you don't lose an original number it
kind of just changes and so what you
want to do is say offset which is set to
zero remember you can change that number
- move x - clip 1 X position and you
divide all of that by the e speed and
that's the math if you don't understand
how math works you know that's as
clearly as you're gonna get an
explanation of how this math works so
it's zero - move X which is attained
here so really you're just kind of kind
of traced back to the math and these
variables to get what numbers these
would be but these are always changing
these numbers are always changing and
that's how we get the effect that happen
so now let's press control enter and see
what we got oh that's awesome look how
awesome that is didn't that awesome you
got to love it
now there's a little bit more to cover
here
okay we've set the math up in such a way
that we can grab these movie clips now
and let's say we had a button menu that
was on one of these layers inside and we
wanted it to be dead center when the
file came into view just place these
wherever you want them and the math will
still work the same so let's just make
everything dead center on top of the
stage as best we can here and see right
about that looks good
something like that now press ctrl enter
you can see it's starting in the center
now we're really where ever you want it
to start it'll start and that is that is
an awesome effect you gotta love it you
can have buttons in there I'm going to
show you how to put buttons right now
buttons menu items other things flying
around whatever and there's those don't
have to be those can be any shapes you
want they don't have to be the same kind
of shapes they give me different kind of
shapes all over the place you can put
whatever you want in those movie clips
alright now we're gonna place a nother
layer above clip one and and like I said
you could just put your button menu
right inside of this movie clip if you
wanted or the smaller movie clip if you
want to put it in there you just put a
button menu and I'm viewing it 20% if I
was at a hundred percent that's what it
look like here let's get back to the
stage here I can put a button menu right
here and it would float around and
everything but I want my button menu
above everything else
so here's clip 1 and clip 2 let's go
back to 20%
so here's clip 1 clip 2 above those I'm
gonna make a new layer I'm gonna call it
menu and I can very easily program this
thing to fly around with everything else
or I can set it static and I'll show you
what I mean I'm gonna put a rectangle
right on top it goes across the whole
stage I'm just gonna make it like a grey
or something and then press control
enter you can see that menu stays on top
you can also make that a little bit
opaque with that menu bar rather will
stay on top make it spill a little bit
opaque and you'll be able to see the
leaves flying around behind it which is
a cool effect and then you can put
whatever menu items you want right up in
there any buttons we've got tons of
button tutorials menu items tutorials at
develop PHP com
you could put any kind of menu items you
want up in there make any kind of
buttons and they will stay stationary
now inside of these clips let's just go
inside this little one and star get this
little item right here or let's just
make a new one here grab a rectangle put
a dead center make it blue or whatever
color and then right-click it convert it
to symbol you can make it a movie clip
button or a regular button let's just
call it button okay and there's a button
now let's press control enter and you
can see that button is now flying around
when I go over it it is clickable and
let's go inside of it and give it a
different overstate and you'll see that
it's active let's make it yellow when it
goes over okay and that's how you would
have menu items inside if you want and I
think it's cooler to have your menu
items your cool little buttons to be
floating around as well but maybe not as
fast as everything now here's a little
hint for you here let me go ahead and
remove that button control X let's get
back out of that movie clip into the
whole magic background timeline here and
what we can do is if you wanted a movie
clip that had a button menu in it but
say you didn't want it to move around as
much as these others that sees others
later as these other layers do you can
place it here and instead of making it
see how our stage is 1000 by 600 instead
of making this clip 2000 by 1200 it
could be 1500 by what 800 or 900 rather
15 by 9 that way and you can set it up
in the same way you set those up that
way it wouldn't move around so much so
you can put a third one in there and I
think I'm going to to do that and it
will be in the free source files that
you can download from develop hp.com
this lesson okay I just decided to add a
clip clip three underscore MC with menu
selections inside of it that's gonna
float around in the scene and I made it
1200 by 900 just like I said I would and
I'm gonna show you how I'm gonna set it
up and get it working just like the
others are I'm gonna take those two
lines right there so I can have a dip
three X and a dip three Y change those
to three then I'm going to go down here
to inside of the activate function I'm
going to grab those two lines because
we're going to have to move the clip
threes X and a clip 3y according to dip
three X and dip three Y and then simply
all we have to do is add two lines here
under these and now we can these lines
will actually create the movement let's
see that's me clip three three just
change all the twos to a three it's that
easy
it is so easy okay now let's press
control enter see what we got
alright that's very cool see so you see
they move around at a different rate
than everything else does you can see
that text doesn't sit too still in there
like that
but that's cool for demonstration
purposes it's beautiful
and it doesn't even have to move around
at all you can just comment out those
lines there and here and here and now
it'll sit still with those buttons on
top which is pretty cool I almost like
this better so I'm gonna leave it like
that hope you've enjoyed this lesson and
there's many more like it at develop PHP
comm you can integrate a lot more of the
other flash files into this file to make
a full website maybe you want a little
mp3 player somewhere whatever you want
galleries you can throw in here and I've
made it this really setup smart to wear
on scene one you can see everything is a
whole one big movie clip so that way
other things can be added on top you add
a new layer boom you put new things on
top of everything if you want or set up
a preloader from using some of our the
vials whatever you want to do but this
one is really cool I'm digging this a
whole lot I like it okay we'll see you
