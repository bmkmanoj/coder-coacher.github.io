beginners I want to introduce new coders
to the concept of searching for needle
in a haystack and we're gonna do it in
both PHP and JavaScript so it's gonna be
like two lessons smashed into one in
this lesson we're gonna try something a
little different we're gonna code line
by line in PHP and JavaScript both at
the same time that way everybody can see
the logic in both technologies side by
side so fire up your favorite code
editor and create a new example dot PHP
file and remember the PHP code has to be
tested on a PHP enabled server so the
first thing we'll do in our PHP is we're
going to add the haystack which is an
array and this array happens to have
only four items in it now like I said
we'll go side by side so let's go ahead
into the JavaScript now and let's copy
and paste that same line now to make
this work for JavaScript we simply
remove the dollar sign and put the bar
space haystack is equal to and let's
just make this a basic JavaScript array
with the square brackets around it that
way JavaScript creates an array object
out of it so now you have a PHP array
object and a JavaScript array object now
for those of you who don't know array
indexes the position of elements in the
array start at 0 all arrays have a
starting index position of 0 so for
these arrays we have index positions of
0 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so we have 4 elements in the
arrays but the index positions are 0 to
3 now in the PHP we're going to pop in
our needle and you can think of this
just as the value that you want to
search in that array 4 to make sure that
it exists in that array and you can do
things in your code according to whether
or not it exists in the array so we're
just going to search haystack for needle
now let's take that variable and let's
also make that in JavaScript so we'll
replace the dollar sign with a bar bar
needle equals pig now what we want to do
is put in an if-else condition statement
and this if-else condition statement is
using the array search function in PHP
and what array search returns is the
index position where that value is found
in the array so Pig we can see is going
to be found at 0 1 to an index position
of 2 or a key of 2 in that array so all
we did is put an exclamation mark in
front of the array search function and
what that does is if the array search
returns a null value then we're going to
echo out that pig is not found in the
PHP array but if it's not a null value
and array search returns an actual index
position from that array then we know
that it was found in the PHP array at
that index position and you can make
this index position where it's found in
to a variable no problem I'll show you
how to do that a little later on and
that's basically it that's all the logic
that you need to search for a needle in
a haystack searching for a value within
an array now to do the same thing in
JavaScript it's very similar we put an
if-else condition statement and what
we're doing here our expression is
saying if the index of the haystack
array where the needle is found is less
than 0 then we're going to output that
it the needle is not found in the
JavaScript array because the index of
method returns the index position where
the needle is found in the haystack now
if it's not found in the haystack it's
going to return negative 1 it returns a
value of negative 1 if it's not found in
the haystack so our expression is set up
to say if the index where it's found is
less than 0 meaning negative 1 then
we're going to output that needle is not
found in the array else that means it is
found in the array because index of is
returning an actual index position
number to us in the array where the
needle is found so we know that we can
output that needle is
in the array and I'll put this one into
a variable as well so you can see the
actual index position the number that it
returns now let's just go up in between
these two scripting tags and let's put
in HR for a horizontal rule just to put
a line in between the two different
output now let's run this on a PHP
enabled server okay when I run this on
my PHP enabled server I get the output
from PHP saying Pig found in the PHP
array now in the JavaScript output I get
Pig found in the JavaScript array so now
you effectively know how to search for
needles in the haystack for both PHP and
JavaScript and sometimes you might need
it in a PHP program and sometimes you
might need it in your JavaScript program
now what we have here is just searching
for a needle in a haystack to see if it
exists there now there might be an
occasion where you want to remove or
extract the needle from the haystack to
where it doesn't exist in the haystack
any longer and we'll show you that right
now
first before we do that let's go ahead
and change this needle to cow let's give
it a value of cow for both the
JavaScript and the PHP now we can see
that that doesn't exist within our
haystack so now we should get different
output let's refresh the page or reload
the document and now we see cow not
found in the PHP array cow not found in
the JavaScript array all right so let's
just change that back to Pig now what
we're gonna do is create a variable from
this returned value right above that if
condition so let's create a new variable
I'm gonna call it index because that
represents the index position for where
that needle is found in the haystack
because remember array search the return
value that you get from that function is
the index position of where the needle
lives in the haystack that way needle if
it is found will be extracted from the
array and will no longer exist in the
haystack now that we have the index
position where the needles found in the
haste
we can easily run some code here that
will remove the needle from the haystack
so first I'm gonna put in a break that
way new output is on a new line and then
I'm going to run the line that's going
to actually remove the element from the
array at its index position where it's
found you can do that using the unset
function in PHP now the last thing we'll
put in place is just for developer
purposes so you can get some further
output to show you what's going on we're
serializing the haystack so it prints as
a string so you can see that the unset
worked and then you're also going to
output the count of the haystack array
because it starts at four elements and
you'll see that it ends at three
elements because where the needle is
found the needle is going to be removed
out of the haystack
using this one line of code this line of
code is just to show you things on the
page for developer reasons so let's save
that okay so now the output we get is
first we get a two because we're echoing
the index position where the needle is
found in the haystack then the next line
of output is we get pig found in the PHP
array and that's rendered in our if and
else condition statement letting us know
if it's found within the array then the
next line is your serialized new array
after we run the unset function to
remove the needle from the haystack and
reading a serialized array is not very
difficult as three elements in it then
in between the curly braces are all the
elements so the index position for the
first element is 0 the size is 5 because
there's 5 characters for horse the index
position for the second element is 1 and
its size is 4 because it's a string of
goat it's 4 characters then the next
element index position of 3 has a size
of 7 because it's a string value of
chicken and that's all that's in the
array of those 3 items after we use the
unset function now let's make the same
thing happen in JavaScript where we're
going to remove the needle from the
haste
just in case you guys need to do that
one day now to mimic the same exact
functionality that this line performed
in PHP but instead in JavaScript we can
use this line haystack dot splice we use
the splice method on the haystack array
and we feed it two parameters the index
position where we want to start the
splicing and how many elements we want
to splice out so in this case we want to
just splice out the one element which is
the needle where it's found and here
we're just gonna write the haystack
array so we can actually view the array
and we're gonna write the haystacks
length just like we did up here okay now
when I look at the output that my
program renders the value Pig has been
removed from both the PHP and the
JavaScript arrays so you can see the
resulting JavaScript array is horse goat
and chicken it's only three elements now
the element that represented pig in the
haystack was removed and in PHP that's
done using this line and in JavaScript
it's done using this line so now you
know how to not only search for needles
in haystacks you know how to pull them
out now if I were making this a script
that actually removed needles from the
haystack I would set it up a little bit
different I would take this unset
function ctrl X and I would put it up
here in this else condition or actually
I would just put it in the if condition
and remove the else condition so I'll
have a couple of different code examples
on the page but just to show you real
quick you can remove the exclamation
remove the else and then remove the not
because you would know it is found there
and then you put your unset there so if
array search provides us with an index
which you can probably just use this
index variable right there so let's say
if index then we unset so that's
basically what it would look like and
you really wouldn't need any of this
either so that's a slimmed down version
of removing needles from the haystack if
they're found within the array and like
I said I'll put different code examples
on the page for the lesson code
and of course the same would apply for
your JavaScript so if you are making
this into a remove needle from the
haystack script you would take your
haystack splice method control X and you
put it in your if condition control V
and remove all the output that we had in
place just for developer reasons and
there you have it now all you have to do
is change the expression here to say if
haystack that index of needle is greater
than minus 1 that means if it's at least
0 then you're going to splice that
needle out of the haystack and that's
how you'd set it up for JavaScript for
removing needles from a haystack ok that
concludes learning to search for needles
in haystacks and not only searching but
optionally removing as well for both PHP
and the JavaScript technologies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
