developer video handbook in the previous
lesson we showed you how to use flash
cs5 to render our APK file which is the
kind of file that you must load up onto
an Android operating system as an
application so it'll install and
everybody can use it so what we're going
to show you how to do is and in the
video before that we showed you how to
use Eclipse and Java to do the same
thing to render out that completed apk
file which is your Android application
so in this video we're going to show you
how to do is actually test it out on
your personal mobile phone or whatever
device you're using this one is using
Froyo 2.2 so that's what I'm going to be
testing on and that's what I rendered
out my application I targeted Android
2.2 when I rented out my apk files so
before you load up anything to the
market online you really want to put
your apk files on your personal device
and test out how they're going to work
because you can try them out in an
emulator and that's all good but really
you want to see how it works for real so
let's show you how to mount it up first
you get your USB cable from your
computer and plug it and plug it into
your phone then you give it a second if
that window pops up you can just close
it because what you want to do is give
it a second and allow your phone to
recognize the computer connection and in
a moment the screen will pop up in any
day now just give it a moment to
recognize it there it goes when you see
that just click connect USB storage
button there and then okay now the phone
is connected to the computer through the
file systems now you can just put your
phone down and now we'll get on the
screen so we can have a closer look at
what we have to do here ok now simply
just open folder to view files so you
can view the file system so this is the
window that removable disk h right there
into main root directory is where i'm
going to add my two APK files to test
out the one i made in flash here and the
one I made in Eclipse and Java here so
first let's grab the flash the dot APK
file copy and now let's place it in your
phone's filesystem so right here just
right-click and paste so now I have a
hello world flash that APK in there and
now I can double click this one grab
that one copy this one was made in
eclipse in Java right click and in the
phone file system paste it so now I have
2 apk files sitting there
okay now let's unplug the phone from the
USB cable and what you want to do is
find your my files folder I keep mine
right there you can see it that little
orange folder keep it right on the first
page of my phone when my phone opens up
but if yours is not showing you can go
down to applications and then somewhere
in there you'll see a little folder that
says my files I can see it right there
if I click that you see those two on top
hello world flash APK i hope that's not
blurry hello world APK and hello world
flash at APK you can see it's right
there in the file system so let's do the
flash one first and here we are we're
going to install it now it says hello
world flash do you want to install this
application install and there you go now
we're going to open it and it's going to
prompt us to install Adobe AIR because
all flash Android applications require
Adobe AIR to run so you just press
install and anybody with an Android
phone can install Adobe AIR and it just
takes a second so right up here it takes
you to the market and you press install
accept permissions ok and then if you
pull down your tab up top you'll see
that Adobe AIR right there on top Adobe
AIR is downloading and this is a
required step for running flash
applications that are created through
Adobe AIR through flash cs5 point 5 now
Adobe AIR is successfully installed I'm
also going to install the other one the
HelloWorld apk that we created in
Eclipse and Java so let's open that one
now you can see it says I don't know if
you can see that but that's my
application it says hello world that's
the one we created in Eclipse and Java
and we can back out of that and go to
the home in applications you should have
both of those in your apps now there's
hello world flash and hello world
regular I'm going to click HelloWorld
flash
and that's the hello world I made in
flash you can see it's animated and
flash is cool like that so just keep in
mind that any apps that you want to put
on your phone that are created through
Adobe AIR the user has to have Adobe AIR
installed in their phone which you saw
the process is very easy painless and
quick and now they can have extra cool
flash animations and applications
running on their phone okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
