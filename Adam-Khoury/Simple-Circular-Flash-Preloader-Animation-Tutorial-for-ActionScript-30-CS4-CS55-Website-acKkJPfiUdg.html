here today we'll learn how to create
simple circular pre Lotus for a flash
ActionScript 3 projects that a hefty or
maybe bulky so that's what I'm showing
you how to do and let's go ahead and see
what we have the bore we start learning
and that's what it is
very simple one in the next lesson my
next tutorial is going to show you how
to do it a little more dynamically this
one is dynamic and code driven and the
next one I'm going to show you how to do
a wedge that is kind of starts like a
little tiny small pizza piece of pizza a
little tiny wedge and it grows to a full
pie and that will be a mask that will
reveal some cool circular animation you
have going on behind it which is a
better method in my opinion so
definitely don't miss my next lesson but
stick around for this one because this
is extra cool as well
okay first I'll show you my drawing
symbol I created here this is very
simple it was just it started as a if
you hold down in the shapes tool you
grab a and oval tool not the oval
primitive regular oval and you draw it
out you'll see that you have a drawing
object see what this is drawing object
see that is drawing object double click
inside of it and boom that's where it's
all dots and that's where I manipulate
it you can cut out like you can press
ctrl-c ctrl-v
you have another circle there make it a
different color you put it on top of
that circle you remove it or you
deselect then you remove it and boom it
cut it out you see that that's how I did
all that and I used a couple of
rectangles but you got to make sure
everything's dots that's on dots and
different colors and if you have things
of the same color
it will merge so if I grab this and I
have another one just like that they
merged you see okay that's how I made
this shape so if I am in the main
timeline here double click inside of it
you see it starts when I click it it's
editing the native symbol okay now what
we're going to do is add some code to
this so first let's just go ahead and
shrink it I'm going to shrink it that's
a good size and I want to put a filter
well first I have to point make it a
movie clip so let's convert to symbol
make it a movie clip let's call it
nested clip and this is just so we can
style it registration Center okay now we
go to filters add a filter of glow and
make it magenta whatever color you want
that's nice pleasing to you strength
bring it up the glow bring it up quality
I'm going to make mine high because it's
cool like that and then I'm going to
double click inside of this thing and
right here I'm going to actually I'm
going to right click click this convert
the symbol
and make it another movie clip let's
call it nested clip - okay and now all I
have to do is set some code here that's
going to animate it first let's go way
deep inside and turn the drawing object
magenta there we go now let's go back to
the main timeline to levels up now
here's our movie clip you see it has no
instance name because at this level it
doesn't need it let's go back inside
you'll see we have that other movie clip
next clip - we can give this an instance
name of load circle now I'm going to
give you some code here that is going to
dynamically rotate this item so it looks
a little more smooth then if you will
try to do it on a timeline so let's just
make a new layer above that one layer
and let's pop some code in control V and
I'm going to make an extra frame here
control or sorry f5 on frame 2 and f5 on
frame 2 on that layer as well on the
script let's take a look at that press
f9 now we have an Advent listener so
we're adding an inter frame event to
this timeline so every time that this
frame is entered and since I added two
frames there it's going to be
continuously looping and at 30 frames
per second that's going to be happening
15 times a second or something like that
30 if it's um yeah very very fast faster
than you can comprehend but what happens
inside of the on into frame function and
here is the event that fires off is from
here and inside of the own into frame
event function we low up we give the
load circle which is the instance name
we gave this thing Z click that and says
load circle here so we can talk to it
through code and we say rotation it's
rotation value is plus equal 20 and you
can change this number if you wanted to
rotation value to be greater or less and
which will make it look like kind of
like speed it's kind of like it's speed
value how fast it will spin alrighty so
that's the code
all you need to see is it implemented
into a working file now so I'm going to
show you that well first let's take a
look at what we have here control-enter
that's beautiful I start beautiful
little tails on it it's awesome okay I'm
not going to leave anybody guessing on
this one I'm going to show you exactly
how to implement it into a full flash
website or a big bulky flash file what
we do is go back into scene one where
it's glowing you have a nice glow effect
on it the main timeline alright and here
I have a file which I've established for
you because I'm nice like that and I
called it flash ActionScript 3 simple
circular preloader and actually all I
did was take one of my older tutorials
that had a load bar and I'm going to
show you how to do apply this circle now
so here you see circular animation that
layers there and it has some text on it
but I'm going to put something else on
it right here I'm going to grab this
ctrl C go back into that new file and
I'm explaining this file to you in just
a second and press control V on that
layer I'm going to replace existing
items because I loaded it in here before
to check it out
and it worked ok so now what we have
here is on frame 1 if you want to know
how to preload your Flash websites you
can go and check out the other tutorials
we have I'll explain it really quick
this code here on frame 1 is load
percentage of this file and what it does
is it reads the load percentage once it
reaches 100 or above 99 we make it shoot
to frame to where it has a stop command
and that's where your whole site is and
basically your whole site would be on
this file content layer see I even named
it nest whole site on this one layer
boom right there and that one frame you
have one movie clip it has your whole
site watch double-click on that movie
clip and there's your whole crazy
timeline that you would have in your
site don't put a big crazy timeline up
here in this main timeline in the scene
1 timeline just one frame you want two
frames sitting there
maybe if you want some little simple
animation maybe 20 frames at the most
but that's it and have everything nested
inside of one clip you want to fade that
one clip and that's fine but everything
in one clip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
