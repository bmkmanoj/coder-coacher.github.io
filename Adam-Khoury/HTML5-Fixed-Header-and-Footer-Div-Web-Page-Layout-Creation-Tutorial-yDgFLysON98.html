for the world of web crafts new asset
vault and video tutorials into one
process so what that means is as I
create specific assets for the
repository I will record and explain the
workflow on video and apply them to the
channel in their own special playlist as
video tutorials then once the asset is
created I will deposit it into the asset
vault at the world of web grab this
first asset that I want to share is a
page layout type that people constantly
ask me how to make this first layout I'm
calling fixed in place header and footer
layout so it's fixed in place header and
footer layout and believe it or not this
is one of the most requested layout
types that I get
so after coding it I'm going to show you
how to validate it according to html5
specifications now let's take a look at
exactly what it is when I think a lot of
social networks use this type of header
and footer so you can see as I move the
content on the page as I scroll the
content with my mouse or if I use the
bar and I scroll the content the top div
stays fixed in place and no matter
whether I resize the window or not and
there's also a bottom div that I added
to this tutorial as well because a lot
of people ask me how to stick a div to
the very bottom of the window no matter
how big the window is so you can see as
I scroll the data the page data is
scrollable but the top div and the
bottom div stay fixed in place and
actually YouTube uses a fixed bottom div
like this for their little playlists
alright let's open up our code editor
and let's create this from scratch okay
we're going to start with the bare bones
of a new html5 document so first in the
body tag let's open up a new div element
so make sure we close that div element
as well let's give ourselves a little
bit of space here in the body tag now
this div I'm going to give an ID of
let's just call it top div keep things
simple and inside of that element I'll
just write top div content I'm going to
highlight that div I'm going to create
another one just like it a couple of
lines under it and I'll name this one
bottom div so it has an ID of bottom div
so now it
between those two divs I'm going to give
myself a little bit of space and I'm
going to type in an h2 element this will
give me a heading 2 type tag and I'll
just type in a random heading and then
directly under that I'm going to open up
a paragraph tag and close that off then
I'm going to type content placeholder
dot I'm going to copy that many many
times now I'm doing this just to give
people who are going to grab this asset
and look at it and evaluate the code a
really good length of scrollable
material scrollable content that way
they can see that their header and their
their top div and their bottom div are
staying stuck in place I'm just going to
copy those put a whole bunch more right
under that and another stack of those
right there so it's just a bunch of big
stack of paragraph tags just to give
some vertical scrollable length to the
page now right underneath the meta tag
for the character encoding of the
document will open up a new style
element we'll make sure we set its type
to text CSS then we'll go down a couple
of lines and close that style element
now if I was to render this code to the
browser right now without applying any
CSS we can see what we'll get will have
a top div and everything will just be
like normal scrollable content your top
div and your bottom div will just blend
in with all of the other content so now
the trick is to apply some CSS just to
stick those two divs in place now the
first thing I want to do is change the
body element of the page to have a
background color so I can just go
background color and make it whatever
color I want I'll just make it that
color keep things simple and quick and I
also want this page to have margin
settings so I'll type in margin and the
top margin of the page I want to be 44
pixels the right margin I want to be
zero pixels the bottom margin I want to
be zero pixels and the left margin as
well zero pixels you can set those
margins however you need we're setting
the margin top to 44 pixels that way the
content the
first heading will be pushed down
underneath your fixed in place top dip
when we fix it into place your content
might get lost underneath it if you
don't push it down so that's why we have
margin top 44 pixels now the next thing
I want to do in the CSS is target the
div with an ID of top tip open a curly
brace and put in the closing curly brace
hey you still awake
we're almost done all right now let's
give our top div element here some CSS
properties so the first one is position
position is going to be fixed then we
want to set the top to zero pixels and
we want left set to zero pixels that way
our div is fixed in position and it's
tucked up into the top left corner of
the page we want to make sure it has a
width of a hundred percent away it spans
all the way across the browser window
and we want a color whatever color you
want to choose I'm going to choose this
dark color right there actually that's
going to be the text color so let me
give it a light text like that we'll
give it a background that's dark
background color that is dark like that
and the last thing I'll do is give it
padding that way the text isn't all
squished up into the top corner eight
pixels should be okay press ctrl s and
save your document and view it in your
favorite browser you'll see that you now
have a div on top that is fixed in place
now you see the one on the bottom is not
fixed in place yet and it has no styling
so let's just take this copy it press
ctrl C then go down press control V make
this a bottom div now you want to keep
this saying position fixed change top to
bottom
leave left just like it is with leave it
just like it is and leave everything
else just like it is I think that's all
groovy so let's press f12 or you
whatever the way you render it in the
browser you can go ahead and do that
you'll see that you have your fixed top
div and your fixed bottom
now let's make sure we view it in some
other different browsers because you
know there's a big problem sometimes you
make a CSS layout it doesn't work the
same in Internet Explorer so let's
checkout out right now yeah all right so
we got Chrome Internet Explorer we're
fine let's check Firefox okay my box
looks great too
now all we have to do is make sure it
validates under the html5 specifications
since this is an html5 web document okif
DP'd my index.html file that I was
testing on up to my live web server
online that way I can easily validate it
online
so I'm going to navigate to the URL
where it is you can see we have our
working fixed in place header and footer
or top div and bottom div we got to make
sure actually in the code that this one
says bottom deep content okay now you
can just google HTML validator and
you'll get the link to the w3c markup
validation service now you grab the URL
to your page online that you've been
working on and you just type it in right
there and you check okay I have one
error element head is missing a required
instance of the child element title so
that's easy to fix
let's go into the head right here let's
put in the title opening tag and the
closing tag by the title and just call
it fixed header and footer layout now
I'm going to reapply this to the web re
FTP it ok now go over here you click
your revalidate button at the mark-up
service now you can see we've passed yay
GI if you're missing anything or you
have something that's not too html5
specification the validator is going to
let you know and it'll let you know
exactly what you need to fix so there's
one asset ready to go for the world of
web crafts bolt now like I said this is
one of the most requested types of
layouts that I get for some reason I
guess because social networks use that
type of header a lot and this type of
footer alright we'll see you in the next
lesson goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
