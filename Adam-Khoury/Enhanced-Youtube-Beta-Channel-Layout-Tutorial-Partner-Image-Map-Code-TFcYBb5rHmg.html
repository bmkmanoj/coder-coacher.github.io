become a YouTube partner because a lot
of our subscribers I think are striving
to become partnered with YouTube that
way they can share in the revenue the
money the money that's generated through
the viewing of your videos and I've had
a lot of people ask me how to pimp out
my profile layout or my channel layout
to look any way I want or whatever and I
work in fireworks whenever I'm making my
backgrounds for any social networks and
so I'll show you if you're interested if
you're not interested in the
enhancements you can get when you become
a YouTube partner then this is not the
video for you you can just click away
and go watch something more interesting
but if you're looking to become a
YouTube partner and once you do become
YouTube Partner if you're looking to
maximize your layout and get custom
buttons up here you can see each one of
these buttons is its own little entity
and even if you're not a YouTube partner
and have no interest in becoming one
then you might find a few of my tactics
for making my layout helpful and
fireworks I'm gonna show how I export
and everything like that okey-dokey
so let's say you are partnered and you
have the branding options button
available here when you click it and
this is for the new beta layouts when
you click it you'll see a couple of
different sections one tab is banner and
image maps and the next one is tracking
redirects and last one is video page
branding video bridge branding video
page branding is the one that's where
your videos play let's say let me show
you
wherever the videos play there's a
little see where I have YouTube's
hottest webmaster tutorials subscribe
that little banners custom and when it's
clicked on it takes the user to your
channel so they can subscribe to you and
all that good stuff
but in the branding options that's let
me pause this and the branding options
that's one here in the video page
branding you set that little one up but
for the big banner and the one people
are most interested and I think because
I get the most people asking me about
how to make this larger how to get more
space in between where the channel top
starts and how to get custom graphics up
there and all that good stuff
that's right here on the channel banner
and then you have channel side column
image which is this little guy right
here and that goes to any URL you want
to make it go to now all of these can be
given image map code and I've only set
up image map code so far on my top
banner which is this one and the image
map code is what allows me to place
these independent buttons up here along
with my custom graphics okay so I have
my channel banner height set to 150 so
it pushes down 150 pixels my channel
starts my regular normal channel start
is at 150 now and so that's what that
does
and what I have is a channel banner
image that I uploaded that is I'll show
you here in fireworks banner dot PNG and
it's a clear no background there's no
canvas color and that saved as a PNG and
that's what I upload as see you can go
to file export wizard
continue the web exit and then go to PNG
32 it allows you to save it with no
background no color clear totally opaque
and then export you save it where you
want to and that's what you upload to
YouTube right here channel banner just
make it have no graphics at all just
totally clear
now once you have that established all
you have to do is get your image map
code ready and you can do that and
fireworks I'm going to show you that
right now
and you've custom background whatever
your custom background is going to be
laid out like and I'm gonna show you
mine right now
let's go into fireworks and here I have
it's called new hotness dot PNG and this
is the editable version of my channel
graphics and you can see if I make it a
little smaller there's the whole thing
that's the size of it it's uh I think
it's sixteen hundred wide by a thousand
hi file export wizard this is how you
export it out to be a nice small but
quality file JPEG continue the web
continue exit then go to jpg maybe I
always bring the JPEG quality up a
little bit you can leave it right at
eighty which is a good standard quality
and it's around and see if I can hit
eighty again there ad it's fifty nine
kilobytes it's tiny it's great you can
bring it all the way up to the bar
eighty eight look at that in seventy
seven kilobytes and you press export and
it looks nice and crispy you save it
wherever you need to save it and that's
what you upload as your image background
as your channel background so here's my
channel background you can see when it
uploads the channel just lays right on
top wherever you want it to you can see
in mind I have a few nice custom things
to make it things jump out you know Mike
that text right there it just jumps out
a little bit because it has a little bit
of depth set to it everything this has a
little glowy effect and these little
bars are just Grady lines gradiated
shapes
and then I have the buttons in there and
the buttons are directly in my channel
background layout now to get the hot
spots
now when you upload it this is what
you'll have you'll have this look but
you won't have the click button
functionality so all you got to do to
get that remember I said I had this
clear thing this opaque thing here so
what I did was I made a copy but on this
copy has no background everything I put
hotspots in these hot spots and I'll
show you how to put a hot spot right now
you go here and this is in fireworks cs4
you go here to rectangle hotspot tool
grab it draw whatever size you want and
wherever it's going to be positioned
where you well your buttons are on your
layout you put it right there in that
spot and then you go down here and you
put the link where you want it to go
online you want to go to google HTTP
colon slash slash www.google.com alt is
the alt message and you can put go to
Google
and then here in the target this
designates whether it's going to open in
a new window or the window it's the self
window the same window that's viewing in
or a new window parent on top and that's
how you make hotspot wherever you need
it in that clear banner on top so you
can set up all kind of funky layouts
with all kind of button functionality up
there going to all the areas of interest
that you wanted to navigate people to
online you know if you're doing a cool
service on YouTube you can have your
donate button sitting there follow on
Twitter here's a couple of my websites I
don't want to clog it up too much and
put too much junk up there so I'm just
gonna leave it with four buttons and
let's see I think that's everything
oh no let me show you how you have to go
to get this code that image map code
which is the last little ingredient
you'll need to make all of your handy
dandy links go to where they need to go
online and everything you go to file
export wizard and then continue and
instead of the web go to Dreamweaver
press Continue now exit and whatever you
want the image to be since I'm not
really worried about the image it
doesn't matter I'm just gonna pick JPEG
I'm gonna export and here I have this
folder set up on my computer called my
channel image banner and I'm going to
save it it says it already exists
because I already did this and then I'm
just showing you how it's done but yours
wouldn't exist yet so it would just save
it there and so what I would do at
YouTube well first I would go into
Dreamweaver and I would open that go to
that file on my computer find that
folder called my channel image banner
open image code that file and there it
is there's the hotspots and everything
you go to code view and all you need is
the map code so here you can grab the
map tag where it opens and closes here
closes and you can see here it opens you
grab the whole map you don't want the
image really it
you're setting it up the way I'm setting
it up you don't need it press control-c
you go into YouTube and that's it right
there
and that image map code that's where you
would place that it would be empty when
you come to it you just pop it right in
with control V and then you save
everything and then you'll have these
nifty buttons that go to all your nice
web entities or areas that you want to
take people online okay I hope that's
helpful for some of you aspiring YouTube
partners out there I know a lot of you
guys are making it in more and more by
the day so this might be a handy little
bit of knowledge for you that Ray that
way right when you partner up you can go
and start bling-blinging doing cool
stuff and you can put as many buttons as
you want in there you're not limited at
all going to all kind of web
destinations okay we'll see you next
