calm here once again and in the last
jquery animation lesson we learned how
to program this horizontal animated menu
system by using the switch class method
of jquery and it has nice smooth
animated effects when you go over one it
switches to the second class and when
you remove your mouse it switches back
to the original class or style now in
this lesson we're going to demonstrate
how to do the same kind of thing but
it's going to be a vertical menu instead
of horizontal we're going to have it
vertical like this one you can see this
one has nice smooth transition effects
animations for rollover and rollout of
each button and we're going to be
stemming off of this tutorial so if you
want to understand how we build this
from scratch you can watch this tutorial
that I will link to right here
I'm in the same exact code that we left
off with in the last lesson so now I'm
going to get in the cold view here and
change it up to make it a vertical menu
system first thing we do is go down here
to this div menu we're going to place in
a UL tag which is unordered list and
then right before the first a tag I'm
going to type in Li for a list element
tag and then after the first a tag let
me put a little line there after the
first a tag closes I'm going to close
off that li element so you can see my
little link is now wrapped in a list
element now let's go down under all the
links and close off this UL element the
unordered list you have to make sure you
close that nested element it starts here
so it has to close after all of these Li
tags so what we'll do is line separate
each one of these links it's very simple
and we'll make sure the Li closes and
opens after each one that way each one
is wrapped in a list element so we'll
take this control C control V control V
control V control V control V alright
now each one of those links is wrapped
in a list element and all of those list
elements are wrapped inside of an
unordered list and that is all within
our menu did now let's manipulate the
CSS in this file the first thing I'll do
is change this background color of the
whole page the top banners background
color I'm going to make that black and
I'm gonna leave everything else the same
there that's fine
now this menu styling but the menu div
I'm going to remove all of that stuff
because I really don't need it but what
I'm doing here
but I will copy that and if I want to
add any styling to that menu div I could
add it there if I need it so I'll leave
that there what I will do is target the
UL element now that's inside of that
menu the new unordered list right here
that we put into that menu div so I can
target that element by doing this I'm
also going to target the Li tags with
that unordered list so you can say menu
space ul space Li and that will help you
target and style any list elements that
are within this unordered list that's
within this menu and finally in the CSS
I'm going to target the menu unordered
lists list elements space a tags so if I
put any code here for styling it's going
to affect the a tags that are within
those list elements that are within the
unordered list that's in the menu tag
okay so for the unordered list
I want this styling we target the list
style property and we give it value of
none and we target margin and give that
a value of zero pixels and the padding
we give that a value of zero as well
that can say zero pixels okay so for the
menus unordered list list elements we
want this styling and that's all we're
going to have in there is one property
the height and we're going to make it 54
pixels and you can make that whatever
you want that's going to be the height
of each list element within that div
once you change those numbers and you'll
see exactly what it does when you change
these numbers now we're targeting all of
the link elements the a tags inside of
this menu so what we're going to do is
put a couple of lines there that way we
can put a few properties in place and
there they are these are the properties
that we want to affect all of the a tags
within all of those little list elements
we want them to be display:block we want
width of 148 and that is how you make
them all even so they won't have uneven
widths they'll be all in a nice little
column the padding you can set that at
whatever you like and if you rearrange
your padding you're probably going to
have to rearrange your height that's for
the each list element but it's very
simple to do the bond size easy to set
for each of the links and the font
family for each of the links now really
what we could do is go in here and take
out text decoration control X and put it
right here and remove it from the style
too as well now I'm not going to react
splain anything about the jQuery that I
fully explained in the last lesson I'm
not even gonna
we discussed the jQuery at all because I
don't have to change it at all it's the
same exact jQuery that's running from
the first tutorial we're not going to
change it at all for this menu system
we're simply changing the HTML and the
CSS properties so with the border I'm
going to leave these properties here for
style 1 and style too that way you guys
can get creative with your borders and
your the padding really could be up top
yeah we don't need the padding because
we have the padding up top so we're not
going to adjust that between the
animation normally you would just adjust
the background color in the font color
which the font colors set right there so
there's the font color the font size you
could also take font size out of each
style one and style two here and just
put it up top and you can see I already
have font 16 there so I can remove this
but if you want to have your font
different from one state to the next in
the animation you could leave it down
here in these styles but since I I'll
have mine just being one font throughout
the animation one font size then I don't
have to worry about it I can have it up
here because this is affecting all of
those link tags okay I just did style 1
and style 2 to get the look I wanted now
let me press f12 there we go that's a
lot smoother that's what I wanted</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
