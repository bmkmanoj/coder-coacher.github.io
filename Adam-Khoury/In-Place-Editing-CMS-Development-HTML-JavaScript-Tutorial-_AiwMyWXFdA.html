behind building in place content editing
systems where we allow the user to edit
content directly on the front end where
it displays a good scenario to use this
is granting a privileged user the right
to edit some content in place save it to
the database on-the-fly when they finish
editing and then we restored a Content
container back to its normal state first
we'll show you a quick little demo
before we get into the code you can see
we have a little demo web page and we
have a heading that says this is a web
page and then we have a div containing
content to be managed by the user so
what I did I just made it to where if
you the privilege user double clicks all
the content can then be edited by that
user so I could just put whatever I want
in there and then when I click away from
that we're gonna run an Ajax post
request here to save the div that inner
HTML or div dot text content to the
database and it's really that easy and
then the container is put back to its
normal display state where it's not
editable anymore and the content would
then be saved to the database now we see
this on a lot of popular sites for
instance if I go to YouTube right now
and I look at one of my videos I'm on
the video watch page all I have to do is
click I don't even have to double click
all I have to do is do one single click
on the description area and I can edit
it in place so YouTube uses it Facebook
probably uses it in a bunch of places
and all kinds of other sites where
content is managed by users and you can
use it for your clients for instance if
you wanted to allow your clients to edit
in place directly on the front end of
any content management systems that you
create for them this would be a good way
to go about it ok so here we have the
div that has the content that we aim to
make editable in place so the first
thing I'll do is put an on double-click
event and you can also use the on click
event if you want to use a single click
instead of double click and we're also
going to add the onblur event
so this event fires off when the user
double clicks the div this event fires
off when the user clicks away from the
div when they click something else on
the page or they just focus on something
else on the page and at the end of the
video I'll have a little discussion
about how to make this only accessible
to privileged users and not everybody so
the function that I wanted to handle the
double click event is called make
editable open closed parenthesis and
then we're going to pass one parameter
of this which refers to this div this
gives local access to this object now
the function that I want to fire off
when the user takes their focus away
from that div is called make read-only
and we're gonna reference this again as
a parameter being passed to the function
so now let's write function make
editable function make editable open
close parentheses opening curly brace
and closing curly brace and here we're
going to scoop up the argument of div
that way we have an object reference for
this editable div and it's not editable
yet we're gonna make it editable within
this function but first we're gonna
change a little bit of the styling on
that div just so the user knows that
it's now an editable region and just
show them like something has changed
make it look like a text input field or
a text area so we'll make the border one
pixel solid and black then we'll say div
dot style dot padding equal to something
like 20 pixels whatever you want then
finally we make the div content editable
so div dot content editable is equal to
true now let's take a look at our
application running and see what we have
just run it in your favorite browser so
if I double click its now it's not
editable yet let's
I'm a moron and I forgot a T in content
editable grew up now double-click and it
should be editable now ok now the
content can be edited by the user but
when they click away from it nothing
happens so that's where this onblur
event and make read-only function comes
into place and that function is going to
pretty much do the opposite of these
things make it not editable anymore and
change the styling back so we can
actually duplicate that function and
let's just make it named make a
read-only the border we're gonna just
change back to none or whatever it was
originally padding same thing we're
gonna change it back to whatever it was
originally and this we're just gonna
change from true to false to make that
div not content editable anymore so on
blur we make read-only again now let's
check that in our favorite browser
double click edit the content then if we
do anything else on the page it goes
back to its original read-only state
it's not editable anymore now there's
one more thing you have to do only in
the onblur event I'm just gonna put an
alert right here this is an instruction
to you as the developer you run an ajax
post request here to save the div inner
HTML okay let me put a line break there
on this text so you can see it and then
escape that so run ajax post request
here to save the div dot inner HTML or
div dot text content to the database so
within this make read-only function in
the onblur event that's when you would
save the content that they've finished
editing to the database and you really
don't even need any Save button or
anything like that but it might be best
if you put save and cancel buttons under
the div while it's being edited but you
really don't even need it
now can you use different events such as
just the on click event this will make
it happen with a single click if we take
a look and we just click on it once we
get to edit it
I'll just leave that with the on click
event you can have on double-click you
can have on mouse-over whatever events
that you want to target now it doesn't
even have to be an event of the div that
makes this make editable function run
you can have a little button in place
next to the div a little edit button and
when that button is clicked then you run
the make editable function make the
button click run the Edit make editable
function instead of this div click same
goes for the make read-only event or the
make read-only function that function
make a read-only can be made to trigger
at any point I just happen to use the on
blur event but you can have a little
button that says save and when that Save
button is clicked that's when you
trigger the make read-only function to
run and you can give this div an ID that
way you can easily access it through
other buttons and things ok finally
let's have a quick little discussion
about how to make this only possible for
privileged users and not everyone so if
I wanted to make this possible
for only privileged users I would have a
PHP document and not a HTML document so
I have a change example dot HTML to
example dot PHP and then above all of my
HTML in the document I would put a PHP
tag right here and then in that PHP tag
I would check the sessions to see if the
session variables are set for any logged
in users and then I just checked their
credentials in the database and make
sure they're privileged before I put
this on click event and onblur event
attached to this div so basically you
can have a div that renders for
everybody else without this in the HTML
markup just like that that way it's just
a normal div but if the users privileged
and we check the session data on the
server then you want to render this div
like this and you can use PHP if-else
condition statements to just change the
HTML markup in a document very easily so
you just put it if else conditions
to say if the user is sessioned and they
are privileged then we're going to write
this HTML markup if they're not we're
going to write or echo this HTML markup
to the page for everyone else does that
make sense that's exactly how you would
do it that makes total sense and finally
some of you might need to learn how to
make Ajax requests so you can post that
data to their database and then get some
reply so you can just go to develop PHP
comm and we got some video tutorials in
the JavaScript video section we have
Ajax programming right there on top and
the first video is Ajax post to PHP file
and that's the exact tutorial that you
want to watch to learn how to run an
ajax request without the help of
third-party frameworks it's very simple
now when the Ajax request is done you
can just give the user a message saying
the data was saved or in actuality you
don't even have to give them a message
you can just save the data to the
database using the Ajax request and then
maybe when the Ajax requests return data
comes back then you run these three
lines to make the div go back to a
read-only state ok hope you found this
tutorial helpful and maybe you can use
this kind of feature for your content
management systems your clients your
social sites or whatever you're building
we'll see you in the next exercise bye
