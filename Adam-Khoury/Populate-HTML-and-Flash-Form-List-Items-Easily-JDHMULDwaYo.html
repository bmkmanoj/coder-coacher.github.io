and let's say you're making when you're
creating a project that has to utilize
HTML forms or even flash forms for that
matter the same technique can be done in
flash using the replaced text method and
if you want to see that I can show you
but i'm going to show you an HTML
because more people use HTML forms and
they do flash forms so in my project I
have a drop-down list which I already
populated here let's press ctrl-z let's
get rid of that let's say I'm riding out
years and I want to have a drop-down
list in my form for the years and say I
only have one or two and it's already
getting to be two and three minutes into
it and I'm like man if I need 180 it's
going to take forever what you can do
will make life easy just go to any
website like youtube earning other big
website that would have an official sign
up form create account and right there
there's the year drop-down list and
that's what i want to snatch up and
there's nothing illegal or anything
about this this is not their code this
is the standard way I'm going to view
source I right click view source or you
can go up into your browser here
somewhere and there's view source
somewhere up in there one of these
this is internet explorer and a lot of
you guys are going to yell at me for
using internet explorer but if you're
that type you're stupid i want to hear
from you okay so where is it view source
down here at the bottom or you can just
right click the page and view source in
that menu let's pull down a little bit
and let's go to right there you can just
pull down as you go you'll see the form
lists those option lists you see them
there's the country there is month day
and year I want all of these years all
100 of them or 109 I think it is all the
way to 1901 ctrl-c I highlighted all of
them all those options like I says
nothing illegal about this it's a
standard form programming for any HTML
page then you press ctrl-v boom you just
saved yourself 20 minutes or more
depending on how fast or slow you type
so I have 2009 all the way way back to
nineteen oh one in my list and it took
seconds ok I just want to pass that one
along you know a lot of you season guys
already know how to snatch up source so
if you'd like to tell me you already
knew that and then I'm stupid and stuff
go ahead now in the comments see you
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
