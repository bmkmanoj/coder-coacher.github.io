you how to add custom shadows to your
graphics to help you stand apart from
other designers and web masters who
simply use the pre-baked drop shadow
effect within their art program and this
will work for fireworks Photoshop
Illustrator or any art program you're in
that will handle distortion of images so
it will go to create a new fireworks PNG
and give it a width 800 and a height 500
any size you want is fine it's just a
quick example and you click on the shape
tool usually it's a rectangle there
first grab a donut draw your donut and
shift the drag the inner radius out a
little bit okay let's make another donut
actually let's give this one a inner
shadow
real quick just so it has a little bit
of depth
and let's change that to blue the inner
shadow okay now it looks more like a
donut or a ring okay so now i press ctrl
c and ctrl v and copy and paste same age
on image right on top of itself and now
we have two of them now this one I'll
add the regular the pre-baked drop
shadow go to shadow and glow in the
filters and drop shadow and there's the
default drop shadow and you can
manipulate the depth you can manipulate
the opacity and you can manipulate the
blur it has on it and you can also
manipulate its angle which is all really
cool things and most programs are like
that but with this effect and I'll show
you how it's different you can't achieve
this effect with that pre-baked drop
shadow so we go to see we'll highlight
this one press ctrl-c ctrl-v paste
another one right on top like we did
last time and this one in the back
remove the inner shadow make it black go
down in the filter give it a blur
Gaussian blur Gaussian however you say
that and you can adjust the blur that
slider press ok and now bring its
opacity down now you grab the one in the
back go to distort go up to the
transform tool distort
and this is what you cannot achieve with
the regular drop shadow effect so there
you have it to drop shadows one will
help you stand apart a little more
because it's custom this one everybody
uses ok that's it we'll see you guys
