custom community in PHP and MySQL
dynamic website where people can create
profiles and such and I have a juicy
little tidbit that I wanted to knock out
real quick so i thought i would share
with you guys because you guys might
want to format things the same way and
you see where people have joined the
site if their names are too large or too
long then it messes up the format there
everything's all lopsided and jumbled up
and that's not cool so what we're going
to do is go into the index file that
renders that data go into the code view
and right here where we have first name
and last name well first of all I'm just
going to make it use the first name so
right here we can just remove the last
name or you can choose to put the whole
thing inside of a div like this let's
try this first I'll show you two methods
so within the name let's put that in a
div and make sure we close the div off
the closing div tag
for the link closes
right there and now let's give this a
width overflow hidden height make this
width
and think it's 80 pics is perfect
overflow hidden let's save that let's
ftp it up to the web index PHP and i use
FileZilla if you guys have no and
that is a great program for ftp
functions all right now let's go look
and see what happens refresh the page
that helped a little bit but you see
there's still line breaks there and we
do not want that so what I'm going to do
is only show the first name
save it FTP it
and I'll probably still have to add one
more thing you can also shrink the text
okay so that's a little better let's
Center it div align equals center
now let's ftp it this is just a good
lesson in display of dynamic data that
comes out of your mysql database in
loops okay i didn't get any a line div
align center i'll put it on the wrong
one needs to be here right there do a
line center now let's ftp that now let's
check refresh see now everybody's name
is centered and everybody's back into a
wonderful display and you can also cut
the string i was going to show you that
let me show you that
okay so let's say we didn't want to put
that div in there and but I'm going to
keep it in there because I like that but
what you can do is cut down the first
and last names if they happen to be
extremely long so you can take just make
the same variable here last name oh no
let's do first name and i'll just show
you that example first-name equals and
we're going to use a PHP function that
you can read all about page pin it and
the substring subtract string think
that's what it means I'm not even sure
let's close off the parentheses with the
semicolon then inside the parentheses
we'll put quote or double-quote
double-quote then a comma we're going to
cut it 02 maybe 8 10 characters there
and now we just have to put the variable
right there that we want to cut which is
first name
see if that does it rot lock bring a
comma in okay so that should cut it down
to 10 characters and no more and let's
see if that works index entropy you put
that up now refresh and it sure did the
magic Dwarfs name just got shorter let
me show you a more dramatic so you can
see if the effect more dramatically here
I'm going to cut it down to three save
ftp index and now let's refresh the page
and you'll see everybody's name is cut
to three characters see that so that's
how you can really force an iron fist
and an iron hand on your display on your
site but keep in mind you're going to be
cutting peoples names there so i would
suggest maybe making the text smaller
and leaving in the div there so you can
still kind of get the layout you want so
i'm going to leave it at 10 there's not
many people's first names for longer
than 10 characters
Penelope p/e and EP oh yes a 10 is good
okay so that looks beautiful so if you
paid attention throughout the few things
I just did here you'll have a good
handle on how to manipulate the data
that is rendered in the loop out of your
database out of your mighty Skrill
database rendered into the HTML of the
page I just wanted to show you guys that
because i went to the web intersect
homepage and i looked at it and
everything was all out of whack right
there so i was like i had that's no good
i gotta show these guys how to set that
up right so we'll see you in part 17
thank you and goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
