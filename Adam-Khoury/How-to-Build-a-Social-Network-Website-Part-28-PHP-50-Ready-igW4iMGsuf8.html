intersect series and anybody who happens
to be using the web intersect source
files there's a little tidbit of
information that you'll definitely want
to know what happens is when I log into
the site well first I switched my server
over to PHP 5 maybe about a week ago and
so when I did I went and observed all of
my dynamic pages and all my sites to
make sure that all of the things were
displaying correctly and made fixes
where I needed to because sometimes when
you're running PHP for there are certain
things that you can do that won't cause
Everest to occur and then there's in PHP
5 this are those same certain things
will cause an error to occur so what has
happened here in our case with the web
intersects source packages when i login
everything is fine i can go from page to
page and I stay logged in and
everything's great but when I go and
close my browser the cookies aren't
working so let me close the browser you
know the files on my desktop and then I
open the browser back up and go to web
intersect and you see what happened it
logged me out my cookies were never
established when I logged in now that
the server is on PHP version 5 and it's
really my fault with the code and the
way that I set up the login script and
it's a very very easy fix so let's fix
that now so here we are in the login dot
PHP file which is inside of the scripts
folder all you got to do is open this
file up and with PHP 5 you cannot output
anything before you set cookies you have
to set cookies before you run any output
so I looked in my script and I said
there's output right there right before
I set cookies so there's the flaw in the
script and there's no other output so
all we have to do is grab that and and
honestly it doesn't even have to be in
that while loop that where that was
printing out doesn't have to be within
that while loop so we can just take it
out go down here right under the end
remember me section code and pop it back
in so now we're printing out the flash
under or after we set cookies which is
what you have to do if you're running
PHP 5 and I should have scripted it like
this from the beginning but when I
switched my server over that was the
only evers that occurred and the only
bit of functionality that or the only
part of the scripts that stopped working
when I switched over to PHP version 5 is
this cookies the login script the cookie
set cookies weren't working but now with
this it should all work just fine i'm
going to save it i'm going to log in
that PHP i'm going to upload it to the
server and go back to web intersect and
now i'm going to log in see what happens
I'm going to make sure I hit the
remember me box now login see what
happens okay it's logged me in and go
from page to page stay logged in now
what I'm going to do is shut my browser
down and it doesn't matter which browser
it is all browsers it will it will fix
it up because if you switch to PHP
version 5 or if you just attempt to use
that script in PHP version 5 set cookies
will not work so now let's open the
browser back up see what happens you see
except cookie works now and all we did
was take those two lines of code out
from inside this while loop and place
them after we set cookie and it fixes
everything up hunky-dory running on PHP
version 5 now the whole server and
system so now you know irrefutable proof
that the source files work for PHP
version 4 and version 5 and I don't see
any other errors I switched the versions
over the last week to PHP version 5 and
that's the only thing that was out of
sync that's the only thing I have to I
had to change and now everything's fine
and you saw how long it took me to
change that two seconds okay dokey and
what I'm going to do now is update the
source package on the free source
package page here this is going to be a
new one version 1.2 fixing this bug and
these old versions will stay as as they
are bugs and all okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
