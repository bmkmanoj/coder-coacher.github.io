room wysiwyg rich text editor flash
actionscript 3 use of all your input
forms and your flash websites or regular
HTML website should put it in there bang
save it to the database boom bring it
back out for display bada bing bada boom
ok so in part 2 we left off well part 1
we made the text bold and you can see it
let's show you here make it a boat that
was part one and in part two we made it
to where it would unbolt wherever we had
our mouse ok ping shappers ooh ok so now
we want to add the italicizing button so
to replicate buttons instead of just
grabbing this one ctrl-c ctrl-v if i do
that and i try to change what's inside
of that it'll change what's inside of
that one because it's the same instance
of that in the library so we'll go into
the library and duplicate duplicate
right click it and duplicate that button
ok now out here click on that and swap
it for that one that we just made now
when we go inside and we change the B to
a slanty I for italicized it won't
change the be you see of the bold button
let's get that in the middle let's
remove these the bees off of those key
frames will replace it with I now I'm
going to change the text to something
that has a
across on the I capital I on the top and
bottom the cross lines is that one okay
i found an eye that I kind of like still
not completely happy with it probably
change it but oh well let's go to our
actions panel and open highlight it and
press f9 to open up the code well first
let's give this an instance name right
now it's instance names bold button
because we copied it from the other one
so let's name it ital italicize
italicized button now let's go into the
code now like I said all you have to do
is take yeah I tell you what let's move
all this down put that there because
we're going to reference that in a
second with this add event listener now
we're adding about listening to the
italicized button we're just going to
mimic with the bulbs buttons doing here
so the function make bold we'll grab
that whole function and the if and else
conditional inside of it
oh I see I'm on the outside of it there
that's where the function ends so right
here that's on the outside of it so now
here's the function let's grab the whole
thing you'll see we'll make sure we grab
it on the edge control C come down here
control V now you're going to see let's
change few things up and now let's add
the format that's going to be well first
let's just go ahead and change this
format default ital this size
def italicized that'll work
this one changed to italicize
well let's just say italics
or Matt italics format default italics
so one will make it italics and the
other one will switch it back so section
will change this here and then we'll put
in the format and we'll be good to go
okay so now let's set the formats first
make sure here we have dot eyetality
equals false talak false oops was the
wrong one here we go
one minute i'll take the s off of that
one might italic default format italic
make italic
oops
Oh caps lock
attack of the killer bees I'm sorry
get out of here bug make italic that's
the function name scribe that put it
here okay so everything is ready for the
italicized listener and the function on
the italicized button so all we need is
copy these and let's put it right under
here and we're going to make some code
comments pretty soon so we don't get all
lost in our code here put some nice
separators in with some comments see
let's see format default I tell it put
that one here format default I telling
and then the regular format I talent
that will be formatting it to italic so
say italic true
let's see and then here italic balls
italic balls evil and I tell you that
should work make sure you listen there
let's try it
ok let's see and try to italicized that
word beautiful now let's fold it fold
half of it now let's uh night Alice eyes
the bold part look at that it doesn't
get any better I'm going to have a
full-blown wysiwyg editor that I can
offer everybody free it's great ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
