how simple and clean it is to achieve
smooth buttery custom animations for
your button and menu systems we're going
to use one line of code to perform magic
while many of our peers are still
including bulky JavaScript animation
libraries to perform simple animations
on their pages and if you still see
people like that you can call them a
sucker but after you learn things like
this that's what I do before we take a
look at the code let's look at the
finished product and this menu system is
geared to have onmouseover and
onmouseout behavior so you can see how
they light up nice in an animated
fashion when the mouse goes over them
and if the user swishes their mouse
across them they get that cool like
Nightrider effect
remember kit the front of Nightrider
whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo Michael Michael
what are you doing Michael with that
babe okay so it's a very simple way to
achieve on rollover and on rollout event
animations ok let's start with the bare
bones of an html5 web document and I
have mine named example dot HTML and you
can name yours I'm gay HTML now inside
the body element I'm going to create a
new div and actually in html5 you can
use the nav element here instead of div
if you're going to have a menu bar or
something like that you might want to
use the nav element instead of divs but
I'm just going to use a div and I'll
give this div an ID that's equal to menu
bar one and I'll open up some space
inside of the div so I can put some
content there now we're going to make
buttons out of the a element the simple
link element so I'll put myself an a
element there and make sure I give it
the href attribute and I'll make mine
equal to pound sign just for this
example this is where you put the page
that you want to navigate to so if I
wanted to go to contact dot PHP that
would go there for navigational purposes
okay so I'll just put home as the label
for that button and I'll make some
copies of that I'll make an about Us a
services button
staff and contact button so this last
one will be contact this will be staff
this one services and this one about us
so if you render this in your favorite
browser now you'll see that you don't
have anything very exciting and it looks
like one string of links that are have
no spaces in them that's exactly what
you want now up in the head element of
my document I'm going to open up a style
element and make sure I close that style
element first thing I'll do inside of
the style element is I'll affect the
body element on the page the body tag
and I'll make its background color black
and I'll give it margin of zero because
usually by default pages have a little
bit of margin space for the left top
right and bottom you can specify them as
zero pixels if you want to make sure
there is no margin space now we're going
to target this menu bar because we're
going to use this menu bar ID the ID for
this menu bar div to affect all of the
link elements inside of it to make
buttons out of them that way we don't
have to put a class for instance right
here we don't have to put class for each
one of these links we can just target
the menu bar and since these a elements
are all children of the menu bars we can
easily target them so up in your CSS you
write div and the pound sign to specify
that you want to target by ID and you
can target the ID of menu bar open close
curly braces we're going to give this
padding of whatever you want 24 pixels
and a border property just so you can
see where this menu bar is residing on
the page and I'll give it a color of
grey one pixel dashed now you can take
how you're targeting the menu bar there
and then go down one more line and say
menu bar child a elements get whatever
properties you want to put here now this
is how you can target all the a elements
at once that live in the menu bar
alright let's stack some properties in
here first thing we do is specify the
font family then we give it a font size
we give it a background color for each
button and that's what creates the
button look is your background you
also put a URL we pad the buttons that
way they the words in the buttons have
some nice christian space around them
we're going to make the color of the
text a nice light gray each one we're
going to give a margin right property of
ten pixels that way the buttons aren't
all stacked up right next to each other
side by side they have a couple of
pixels in between them text decoration
is none that way none of the words have
underlined and border-radius just to
give the buttons a little bit of rounded
effect now if we render this in our
favorite browser you can see what you
have but we have no hover state yet so
to apply a hover State you can just grab
start of this rule go down here and then
put colon hover right after the a
element because that's the element that
you want to target for hover purposes
now within the hover State we're going
to change to these properties we're just
going to change the background and the
color everything else will stay the same
you can change many more properties if
you want but I'll just show you how to
change these two and we'll animate them
using transition property so now let's
see what we have this is the normal
functionality that you get without
animations see when I go over the button
they instantly change to that color but
we want to smooth animation and you only
have to add one single line to achieve
that alright so here we're going to add
in the normal state of the button and
not in the hover State we're going to
add the transition property and I'm
going to test this in all major browsers
right now so you guys can see exactly
which browsers it's working in or not
using this standardized property usually
you'll see the WebKit prefix the Mo's
prefix the MS prefix for Internet
Explorer and the old prefix for opera
and I noticed that you do have to use
the old prefix for opera still with the
other browsers all the modern versions
of Internet Explorer Chrome and Firefox
the Adam the transition will work using
the standardized syntax and I'm going to
show you where you guys can learn more
about the transition property at develop
PHP that way you guys aren't in the dark
about what properties you can animate
and all of the features that you see
within the property here and what we're
doing is putting code in to animate two
properties background and color so the
background over half a second actually
let's make that a little quicker over
0.3 seconds the background is going to
animate in a linear fashion and over 0.3
seconds the color of the text is also
going to animate in a linear fashion and
you can see 0 seconds means delay so I
don't want any delay I want it to happen
instantly for both the background and
the color so now let's see what we get
now I'm going to run this in Chrome
here's Google Chrome see that nice
animated effect I have now so you can
see Google Chrome is using the
standardized property and you don't have
to put WebKit on the front of that
transition you don't have to put the
WebKit prefix anymore now let's check
this in Firefox see you don't have to
use the prefix for Firefox either old
versions of Firefox you do have to use
the prefix okay now let's check this in
Internet Explorer no problem and I'm
using Internet Explorer 10 so if you
want to target Internet Explorer 9 or 8
you can probably get away with putting
MS right here and that will work for
older versions of Internet Explorer so
just make sure you put MS and then the
transition property standardized version
of the syntax under it okay so this is
where older versions of Internet
Explorer I believe it supports the
transition property if you use the
prefix I'm not exactly sure now let's
check this in Opera up so you can see an
opera it doesn't have that cool animated
feature if we use just the transition
property so let's change this from MS to
oh now let's see what we get
file preview and browser opera nice now
I have smooth animations even in Opera
so that shows you how you can use those
prefixes to target any older browsers or
browsers that don't support
the regular transition property syntax
some browsers older browsers especially
you might have to use prefixes WebKit
Mose MS and oh if you want if you want
to just be sure put all of them in there
put all five lines and then after that
put the regular transition syntax under
them and you'll have no problems alright
let's take one more look at this it's
beautiful and when you try it on your
page and take a look at it you'll see
that how much smoother the animation is
because the frame rate of my video will
kind of make the animation look a little
choppy but I'm telling you it is smooth
as butter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
