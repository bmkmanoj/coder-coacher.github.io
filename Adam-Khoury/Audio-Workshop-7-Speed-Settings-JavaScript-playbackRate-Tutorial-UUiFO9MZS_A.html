playback speed control to your
multimedia programs if you press the
little cog button in the YouTube video
player bottom bar right now you'll see
speed settings that is your live example
and that's what you're gonna be learning
to program now it's important to
remember that you can use the same exact
property adjustment for html5 video
programming as well as audio programming
and it's very simple to accomplish
because all we have to do is change one
simple property okay the little
application that we're beginning with
simply initializes some audio to play so
right when the page loads this file is
going to begin playing now down in the
HTML we're going to add our selection
list first which will be the user
interfacing for allowing users to
control the speed and we're going to add
just a simple select drop-down list with
options so put in a select element and
you can also put in the first option
element the Select element we're going
to give an ID equal to speed list and
then for the option we can put in the
first value that we want so the first
value will be equal to the default
playback rate which is 1 and for the
label I'm just going to put change speed
then I'm going to copy that option let's
create the second option this one is
going to be 0.5 which is half speed so
we can just put 0.5 there now let's copy
that one and make the third option let's
make this normal speed and we can
actually put the word normal there and
then the fourth option can be 1.5 and
then the last option you can put as many
as you want and increment it any way
that you want we'll just make this a 2
so those are the options that we're
going to give the user an hour speed
list now when they select and they
change any of these options in the
change event for this element is when
we're going to apply these values to the
playback rate property for this audio
object so right under where we're
calling the play method that plays the
file we're going to add an event
listener for the speed list element
which is
this select list on the page so we save
our speed list is equal to document dot
get element by ID speed list then we say
speed list dot add eventlistener
for the change event and we're going to
run a function called change speed every
time the change event is fired that
means every time they change the options
so let's take the name of that function
there and we just simply need to write
that function now function paste it
change speed open close parenthesis
opening curly brace and closing curly
brace
now here we want to capture the event so
let's type in event as the dynamic
argument so we captured the event as an
argument we can use that within the
function to access whatever element
that's calling this function to be
executed which in this case is speed
list this element here so we'll be able
to access that element using event
target so now all we have to do is take
the audio instance say audio dot
playback rate is equal to the event dot
target dot value or you could just say
speed list dot value but if you want to
do it more dynamically its event that
target dot value
so basically you're taking the value of
whatever the speed list is set to and
you're making that the playback rate
normal playback rate for the playback
rate property is 1 and so remember if
you're testing an Internet Explorer you
might need to test with mp3 files but
I'm testing in Chrome you can test in
Chrome and Firefox with OGG files now
let's test in our favorite browser to
see if we have a working application
let's change the speed to point five and
you can hear a dramatic reduction in the
playback rate it's half speed now now
let's go to 1.5 or back to normal now
with a 1.5 go to two back to 1.5
back to normal back to half-speed and
you can also put a point two five point
one whatever you want okay so just to
re-emphasize all you're doing basically
is changing the audio playback rate
property so whatever number you want or
whatever number that the user specifies
at any time within your audio programs
and remember works the same for video
programming as well now a couple of
people have asked me to write a page
that showed all of the JavaScript
aspects of the audio programming or the
audio object so I put a page together
called audio object for JavaScript
section at develop PHP so that's in the
JavaScript library now with all of the
other objects here where is it
JavaScript objects here it is at the
bottom now so you can access this audio
object page to see all of the properties
and you can see I have playback rate is
the property that we're adjusting in
this tutorial see that's the property we
just adjusted playback rate so this
shows you all of the different
properties that are open for you to use
within your audio programming not only
that there's all the methods and the
events and I'm not done updating this
pace they'll have more things to write
on it but this shows you all of the
properties methods and events that you
could possibly apply to your
applications and in experiment with so
remember that's in the JavaScript
library under JavaScript objects which
is section 5 and then we have audio
objects here at the bottom and check out
these are the objects if you're not
really comfortable with JavaScript yet
you'll want to get comfortable with all
of the built-in objects and this is not
even all of them there's a lot more but
I haven't documented them yet
very soon we're going to get into the
Web Audio API which will allow us to do
all kinds of really cool things
regarding audio programming
we've only merely scratched the surface
so far of audio programming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
