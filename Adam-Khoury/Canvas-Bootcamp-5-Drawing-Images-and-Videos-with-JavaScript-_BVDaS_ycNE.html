three different types of parameter
settings for drawing images videos and
canvas elements on the canvas the first
parameter of the draw image function
will allow you to either put in an image
resource a video resource or another
canvas the first thing we're going to do
is right above our draw function is
we're going to have to get the variable
for the image resource established so
I'll name mine my pick that's going to
be equal to a new image object in
JavaScript and this is how we're going
to establish whatever resources we need
to in the top portion of our script that
way they're loaded when our draw
function runs so we'll take that pick
and say my pick source and I'm going to
put the path to the image resource and
my pick is called me face that JPEG and
here's where you can also establish
video resources and canvas resources
through JavaScript all through code I've
noticed there's a lot of examples online
that demonstrate how to take a picture
that you have in the HTML on the HTML
part of the page in an image tag and
then place it in the canvas but you
don't have to do that you don't have to
have any image tag down in the body or
anywhere on the page you can just load
the resource through JavaScript like
this ok now let's use the draw image
method draw image open close parenthesis
semicolon and inside we're going to feed
it the parameters it needs now there's
three different types of parameter
settings that you could feed this method
the first and the most basic is you feed
it your image resource as the first
parameter that's my pic comma and the
second parameter is the exposition where
you want it to be placed on the canvas
and the third parameter is the Y
position where you want it to be placed
now let's refresh our canvas and so we
get our picture at 20 pixels offset to
the top left so we can see that the
parameters for the draw image function
the way we're using it here is the image
resource x and y positions now we'll
show you how to use the draw image
function like this with the second type
of parameter setting that allows you to
size the picture so you still can put
at any x and y position that you want
I'm going to keep mine at 20 X and 20 Y
then I'm going to make my picture 100
wide and 100 high refresh so that allows
me to size and position it now the third
setting allows you to add clipping so
I'm going to put in the values now that
will give me my picture how it looks
normal and then we'll start to clip it
up so you can see I have my clip X and
clip Y set to 0-0 I have my clip width
and clip height set to 200 and 200
because that's the dimensions of my
picture by default by default this
picture is 200 by 200 pixels and then I
have my exposition at 20 again and Y
position at 20 so it's not tucked in the
top left corner and then my width and
height is still 200 you can see if I
change the height so you can play with
all of these numbers and you can also do
things like take my pick instead of
using static numbers say my pick dot
width right here and that already knows
it's a value of 200 and you can show
yourself that to prove it by putting an
alert my pick dot with refresh the page
and you get a 200 value so your canvas
is going to know the pics width even if
you don't because it's loaded the
resource dynamically you can access the
width and height properties the same for
your canvas remember you can access all
of your canvas properties so if you want
to make an image match the dimensions of
your canvas or be centered in your
canvas you can do those sorts of things
by using the image width and height
against the width and height of your
canvas so don't think of these numbers
being so static they can be very dynamic
and also keep in mind that these can be
video resources and other canvases that
you can load into your canvas alright
now let me show you how the clipping
works if I clip X 100 pixels and then
refresh let me get rid of that alert
okay so you can see it clipped it to the
left if I want to clip it to the right
I'll just put minus 100 there it clips
it the other way so let's just put minus
50 so you see it's only a 50 clipping on
the right edge if I put positive 50 it
clips the left edge 50 pixels so if I
wanted just a corner of the pixel the
bottom corner maybe 100 here and then
100 here should give me just a corner
the bottom corner all right so put these
back to zero and that gives you the
regular picture again now the clip width
and the clip height for instance if I
change this to 150 you can see that it
clips the image to that width and it'll
stretch it and same for the clip height
so now we understand all of the
parameter settings for all three
different types of ways we can work with
images in the draw image method and
remember you can put videos resources in
place of this my pick resource that can
be a video resource or another canvas
resource and remember that you can load
those resources straight through
JavaScript ok that completes drawing
images videos and canvas elements to
your canvas element through JavaScript</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
