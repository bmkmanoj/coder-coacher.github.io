calm here once again with another video
lesson in today's lesson we'll
demonstrate how to use PHP to parse
multiple selection HTML form fields
let's first run a live demo of our
little application in a browser to show
you guys what you'll be learning in this
video lesson have you ever been on a
website that has a form and in that form
it has a select list and in that list
you can select multiple items and
they'll usually tell you in the form
hold control to select multiple items so
I just made a quick demo that says what
skills do you have and here's my select
element and you can see that if I hold
ctrl or even if I hold shift I can
select multiple items
so if I click HTML hold shift and click
PHP I'll get all of those items or if I
click html5 and hold ctrl and click PHP
I'll just get to both of those items and
let me click MySQL while holding ctrl
here press submit and then I show you
guys how to parse that whole select list
with the multiple items and access each
multiple item within the array and the
resulting variable that you're going to
get posted to PHP is an array so you can
just break down the array simply and
we'll show you how to do that no problem
ok first start with a new dot PHP file
for this lesson and even though your
form might be sitting on a page that's
HTML based maybe you have your form
sitting on a dot HTML file and you won't
have it in a PHP file that's just fine
but the name of my file is multi-select
parsing dot PHP because I'm going to
have my PHP script directly in the file
where the form is so pretty much the
file that the form is on is going to
actually parse the form as well and you
might not have that situation you might
have a PHP file elsewhere in your server
that does the parsing for your HTML form
and that's fine which is doing it all in
the same page to keep things simple for
the demonstration to pop in an h3 tag
here which is just a heading then under
that heading I'm going to start my
opening form tag and you can see the
action attribute is set to multi-select
parsing dot PHP which is the name of the
file that I'm building here so it's
going to parse on itself and you can
even use the PHP
serve yourself variables they're the
global variables but I'm just putting
the name of the file in it's easier that
way the method is post so when the form
is submitted these variables will be
posted to the PHP script and the name of
my form is my form now let's go down a
couple of lines and close off that form
tag now I'm simply going to type in what
skills do you have then put a break tag
and under that in parentheses I'm going
to tell the user to hold C ctrl key to
select multiple then the next line down
I'm going to put a couple of break tags
just to separate my select element that
I'm going to put in right now now let's
place our select tag into the form and
you can see my select tag has a name
attribute of skills now this is a
traditional way to set up your select
list type thing to get into where people
can hold ctrl to select multiple items
in that list you just give it another
attribute called multiple multiple
equals multiple and you have to be
really sure that you put the opening
bracket and closing bracket here after
the word skills to signify to the PHP
parsing script that this is going to be
an array that it can split up and break
down an array of individual options
because we're allowing them to select
multiple okay the last thing we need
under the Select tag is a couple of
break tags and just a simple input
button and we can name that my BTN and
that will process the form to our PHP
script which we're going to have right
above this heading so the first thing in
the file we're going to open up a PHP
block PHP scripting block and here is
where we can put our PHP script it's
going to parse this form and break down
that array so you can use it for any
kind of data handling you need the first
thing we want to do is check to see that
this form field is posting to the page
before we try and parse anything because
if nothing is posted through the form we
don't want this PHP script to run up top
we just want the form to display to the
user so this if condition make sure that
the posted variable of skills is
definitely set before anything within
this if condition executes and the is
set function of PHP handle
that nicely now inside of the if
condition let's place these two lines
the verse line is we're creating a
variable called skills array we named it
skills array because that's what that
data object is this posted variable of
skills that data object is an array so
we named its variable skills array so it
makes good sense then if we were to run
this line echo skills array let's change
that to the right variable name what
you're going to have is the page will
echo the word array basically it'll just
echo the array object and it won't be a
broken down separated list of items that
you can see unless you use special code
in PHP to break down an array or display
an array you can either cereal or cereal
are they're serialized and array to see
it if you echo it you can serialize it
use the serialized function or you can
use print R that will also show an array
but that won't do you much good when it
comes to processing the data is
separating it out and then maybe sending
it to a MySQL database saving it or
using it for some kind of data
processing need you really have to use a
loop to iterate over that array which is
what we're going to show you right now
and if you happen to not be good at all
you don't know array programming and PHP
at all you can go to develop PHP com
click learn PHP and you guys that are
familiar with develop page people notice
I have a new table of contents for every
section at the site now so it's easier
to get to different sections within each
course or video tutorial section but if
I click learn PHP here and then I click
working with arrays in PHP this is the
data that you want to look over this
will school you on how to work with
arrays in PHP and let you know what it's
all about that way you're not in the
dark about what we're doing right now in
the script so what we're going to do is
under this echo actually let's comment
this out because it's just going to echo
the word array to you anyway I just
wanted you to see that it was an array
object that's going to be echoed out if
you tried to echo that out right there
what you need to do is put a for each
loop right here so here's our for each
loop you can see we're targeting the
skills array and we're using the adds
syntax to create key value pairs out of
each array element so where the for each
loop does let's say you have six items
within your array the for each loop is
going to run six times an iterate
overall six of those items so just for
referencing purposes which your script
might not even need we're going to put
an iterator variable here or an index
variable and we're going to set it to a
value of zero to start with then inside
the for each loop the first line inside
the border each loop we're going to take
I that variable and plus plus it and
what that does is it keeps compounding
and adding to that number each time the
loop runs and I'm putting it in just for
you guys to reference what's going on
and the next line is where we actually
echo out to view all of those different
values within the array and the key
actually so this line is set up real
slick to show you which loop index we
are in in this for each loop which array
key that this array item has and the
value that it contains and you can take
these values and parse them to MySQL
whatever you need to do now under the
for each loop let's just put exit that
way the form won't show in the
processing part right when your script
gets to right here none of this other
data will render to the page because the
script will exit it will tell the PHP
file to stop executing okay now let's
press ctrl s let's make sure we're on a
PHP enabled server before we test this
because if you're in your local machine
you don't have PHP configured to run on
your local machine this script don't
work for you you have to be on an online
server that has PHP enabled or you have
to have PHP installed on your local
machine so that my friends is how you
parse multiple list selections in your
HTML form select elements using PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
