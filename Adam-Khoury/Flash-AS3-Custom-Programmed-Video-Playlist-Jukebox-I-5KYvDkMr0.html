with another free flash ActionScript 3
source file that you can download from
our site if you head to our site you
click the Flash tutorials tab there's a
video section there and you see a few
flash source files that you can download
free but what we have here is a custom
built video playlist player flash video
jukebox
type thing tutorial file for
ActionScript 3 and the reason why we
call it a tutorial file is because
there's these the code of the source
file and the structure of the the file
is set up in such a way that it's easy
for a beginner to dig through it
understand it change things so on and so
forth so let's take a look at the
features first and then I'll show you
the source file now what happens is when
you first come to the page I'll refresh
the page
and it starts playing automatically so
it has autoplay and when you pause it
like I just paused it you'll see a play
button appears here Auto magically and a
play movie clip shows in the center of
the screen and it's flashing to let the
user know that they can click it again
to resume the video play and there's
also a nice volume slider here and we
have a nice full screen button so when
you click the full screen it goes to
full screen mode and then you can still
click the video thumbnails and playlist
fashion to where you can still control
the thing in full screen all the
controls are available and what else
so yep you click the videos
they control which one is playing and
each time one is paused if it happens to
be stopped then you click a thumbnail it
starts so it's all kind of good
functionality and it also resembles
YouTube's player design and I did that
on purpose so you would have a familiar
interface to work with but I recommend
changing it up all of these items can be
changed up so let's go ahead and oh one
more thing is the buffer time I think is
set to 5 seconds so let me check that
and for dial-up users you might want to
make a movie clip and give it a longer
buffer time let's see
not set to two
you might want to set that to five or
seven set the buffer time to about five
or seven then dial up users will have
well actually you would have to listen
for the load it would be complicated but
you'd have to create a function that was
listening for the load progress and also
the playhead progress and if they don't
match up you would have to show the
buffer movie clip and I didn't program
that into this player version 1.0 but
maybe in the next version I'll program
that in but that's pretty much that'll
that'll make it as powerful as YouTube's
player and you'll see that my the
playhead and the playhead dragger resume
resemble YouTube and it's blue instead
of their red so let's see we're gonna
seen one and you download the files
you'll see there's a whole gallery on
the scene one layer in the main scene
and it's just one movie clip sitting on
that one layer so you'll double click
inside of that movie clip and I do that
so you can take this movie clip and
easily paste it copy and paste it into
other applications without having to try
and highlight a bunch of layers so once
you double click inside that movie clip
you'll see and let me just tell you now
that if you have any questions about
this code I'm not gonna go through the
code fully here because I don't have a
lot of time for the videos and I also
I'm happy to answer any questions in the
forums at our site it's at develop PHP
and you can join up just post any
questions you want in the form for the
ActionScript 3 section and we'll try and
get you an answer but here we have the
ActionScript 3 is on four layers right
here 1 2 3 4 and it's inside of a folder
I called scripts as3 and folders are
cool for organizing your
your your file and your timeline to
where groups of similar layers doing
similar things or holding similar
objects can be set you can create a
folder and set all those layers inside
that folder close it up and then you'll
have other layers that you can still see
or maybe even other folders you want to
put there but anyways all the script is
in that ActionScript 3 folder and the
first one is dynamic thumb buttons this
loads this whole section deals with
loading the thumbnails and making them a
button see there's one thumbnail 2 3 4 5
ready to be loaded their little movie
clips and they're gonna be buttons once
the pictures get the thumbnails get
loaded into them then we have the net
stream and button functions code any
questions about this code I give you
nice comments there so you should be
able to understand everything any
questions about the code just go to the
forum develop PHP and post up and full
screen code is here it's pretty simple
quick and the scrubber and volume code
is right here this gray section I have
grayed out deals with the scrubber and
the playhead dragging and the section
deals with the the volume slider and
then we have the background items
you can double-click most of these
background items or single click them
and change the appearance move them
around put them anywhere you want
frame and title text is on its own layer
above the background items so you have a
title that shows for each video when
it's selected or when it's playing thumb
loaders or on their own layer those are
those 5 movie clips I was telling you
about and player controls which are the
controls for the player are on the top
most layer with content on it and that's
about it I hope you enjoy this one and
like I said if you have any questions
hop into the forum there and don't be
afraid to ask any questions or also
don't be afraid to offer any answers to
people if you happen to be a flash
ActionScript guru head over there and
help us out ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
