tutorial we have a member at our forum
who was having problems making one of
the contact forms which is a tutorial at
our site at develop PHP com he was
having problems making the form connect
and if what happened is if the user
happened to navigate to his site without
the wwan it wouldn't connect to the PHP
script like it needed to and I can show
you a couple of examples of this let's
go to web intersect and I already have
these methods implemented I'm going to
show you how to to do it yourself using
htx dot HT Access file if you happen to
be on a linux server apache and so let
me get rid of this www let's see what
happens let's say if i tried to navigate
to web intersect without the WWE r which
is sometimes how google will render
search listings they'll put your link
without the freaking www in it and it'll
mess up your scripts so you should
consider something like this especially
if you're building this these kind of
dynamic communities where there's lots
of PHP scripts that have to get
connected to its very serious and I'll
also show you how PayPal PayPal does
this trick as well and or they utilize
this method now maybe not the exact
method but same logic so let's press
enter here you see how it added the WWE
that has that would not happen
ordinarily on another website unless
let's see let's go to youtube see what
happens
they're using it too okay that's good
let's go to paypal try not to put the
WWE no lie paypal calm and you'll see
they're going to add a ssl URL see go to
paypal now it's just a secure lock down
server with ssl and they make it they've
read write the URL using an HT access
trick or the trick that Jake 2008
mentioned here using the httpd any
script and and he was correct about
Linux being at HT Access file so let me
show you that file now this is very
important for making your scripts all
get connected to correctly with contact
forms with dynamic database with
anything that that you need so this is
very very important and what I did in
the first line here is I just put the
comment of pound sign comments out of
line so you can pound sign it anywhere
to make yourself comments to keep notes
and it won't process it the script won't
process that line so here we claim
disallow viewing of HT access files on
our server and that is four lines four
through seven now to make the rewrite
condition work correctly you turn the
rewrite engine on and here i just put a
note says make all requests have the WWE
in them so here is the condition and
then here is the rewrite rule so you can
see the condition is anything in the web
intersect website
on that server and any page that happens
to be navigated to if the www is missing
then it gets added to it using this
little file and this is how you make the
file you go to like notepad or something
that's just a very basic text editor or
you can create the file and then rename
it once it's on the server using your
FTP program and let's see let's put in
that code so you would just take this
code and you would put it in a notepad
file where is that give it all this crap
is the notepad file untitled so far and
then put the code in you go to file save
as let's just put it on a desktop and
put dot HT access that's it press save
and now we have a file here on our
desktop let me move this you can see it
this little guy right here and as you
see it has no name it just has an
extension you pop that into your server
or onto your server root the root
directory on your server and then test
the effects you will like it something
you need if you're going to be running
dynamic scripts like the big boys okay
we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
