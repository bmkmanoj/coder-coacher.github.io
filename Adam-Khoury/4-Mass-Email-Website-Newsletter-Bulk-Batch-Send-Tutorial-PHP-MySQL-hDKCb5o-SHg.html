we're continuing creating our PHP and
MySQL newsletter email blast application
we've covered these four steps already
with the check marks on them two green
checkmarks in lessons one two and three
now we're continuing on to the email
blast part of the application so the
first part of the applications all out
of the way what I'm going to do is talk
to you about filtering because we sent
their info into a MySQL database but we
didn't filter that the form variables so
we get a filter those form variables
before we send them to the MySQL
database so i'm going to discuss that
very briefly before we get going on
section two here in section two we're
going to compose our newsletter body the
way it looks and we're going to have an
HTML formatted email that gets sent out
to everybody that way you can have it
color the way you want the text the way
you want and images you can use images
that are on your server and refer to
that URL for the image right there in
the email body and it shows right up
okay in part three we created one file
that was the forum for gathering their
name and email address and the parsing
mechanism all in one and up here on line
nine is where we gather the posted
variable for the name and the email when
they put the data in that form it gets
posted to the same script and here is
where we're going to talk about
filtering the data I'm going to put it
in a little comment and the comment says
be sure to filter this data to deter SQL
injection you don't want anybody to be
able to apply SQL injection attacks on
to your database because it's harmful
for your data and they can also get to
certain data that might be private and
so what you want to do is make sure you
research fully on all the different SQL
injection protection methods that PHP
developers have come up for come up with
for this sort of thing and you have to
make sure you safeguard from that
whenever you're gathering variables from
a user you just want to treat everybody
like they're the the worst hacker on
earth that's going to rip down your site
everybody even if they're cool people
don't even give them a chance I also
have examples of the filtering data that
comes in from forms before goes into
your database in the web intersect
series and the custom content management
series I have both playlists here at my
youtube channel just hit the little
playlist button there on my YouTube
channel and you'll see custom CMS and
how to create a social network or
community and those two lessons show
examples of that if you want examples
from me
and now it's the fun easy part you go to
file new and I think we can just make an
HTML page for what we're going to do
here let's remove all this stuff you
don't need any of that actually let's
keep the body in the HTML tag
we'll keep the HTML tags and the body
tags opening and closing for both of
those alrighty and in the body tag is
where we're going to set up what our
page looks like or what our newsletter
body's going to look like and it's
important to keep in mind that you can
use most web design tactics for
populating the body I mean any images
that are on your server you can make it
look pretty much just like a web page
using HTML ok that's what I'm going to
do okay like I said mine is going to be
super simple so I'm just going to go
into the design view in Dreamweaver and
I'm going to add an image I'm going to
use that image button there and let's
also go to the code view now in the code
view you want to make sure it doesn't
say file that are data data on your
system it has to be from the website so
you have to say HTTP colon slash slash
WWE develop PHP com put your site there
put the forward slash to your images
folder my niche happens to be in my
style folder so that's where I'm going
to refer to it now if I press design
it's still going to show up but it's
going to refer to that file from online
and you can even set the link to develop
PHP on that so let's just grab the link
develop PHP calm so you go into code
view or design view rather highlight
that image and let's make an image link
out of it press control V right there
paste it in
and let's give it a border of zero so it
doesn't have that ugly blue border on it
their border zero we'll get rid of that
ugly blue border on your image links all
right so that's really the main
complicated part that most people would
have trouble with is referring to the
images they want what most people would
do as a mistake is make this say refer
to their C Drive like it did with me my
documents and settings on my local
computer the people who get this
newsletter would never ever see that
file because it's sitting on your local
computer and the web can access that you
have to have this file on your server
which I do I have my file on my live web
server develop hp.com ISM it's in my
style folder to a picture called logo
layout logo P&amp;amp;G so that's the most
important thing to realize here when you
want to use images within your
newsletter body okay a lot of people
follow up right there and that's all you
have to realize is that image has to be
online not just on your computer it's
good that if it's in both places
relatively the same that way you can you
know you're not I'm saying okay so
here's what I wound up with my simple
example you can see it's all HTML
formatted it has like a grayish
background it's not exactly white it's a
horizontal rule there and there's an h3
tag heading 3 and then there's my image
and now here in the first line you can
see I'm rendering out a dynamic variable
there's a dollar sign there and the name
variable so if there's three people in
your database like Adam Suzy and Jill
then you're going to have hello Adam
that's the first email it blasts out
then the second email it's going to say
hello Jill the third email it's going to
say hello bill
whatever the third name was and then you
could put whatever information you want
whatever links you want whatever
pictures you want in the body and it
doesn't have to be set up like you look
just like a web page if you want
nice div borders and colors and
everything like that
and then at the bottom it's pretty
important to have an opt-out link and
the opt-out link I'm going to show you
how to construct the opt-out script and
that's very simple script it's just
going to be a few lines to update the
database to remove the listing this
person is listening from the database
now let's go into the code view so we
can take a look at this dynamic variable
and the name dynamic variable here those
are the only two dynamic variables
within my email body my newsletter body
so you can see right here we have the
script develop PHP tests folder the
newsletter folder and your Zorn
ordinarily wouldn't be an ax testicle
there it would just go straight to the
newsletter folder the opt-out dot PHP
script which we haven't created yet
that's coming up and it has a URL
variable called e which is equal to this
person's email address whoever is
happened to be blasted this email in the
loop so that's always changing to
different people's email addresses upon
who's coming through the loop and then
this name will also change to match the
person the email owner's name will
display right here and that's how it
works
so stay tuned for bar five which I'll be
putting up today there won't be such a
large gap in between these the
completion of the lesson here we're
going to bang out the rest tonight
within the next couple hours and then
part five what I'm going to show you how
to do is get this into the email blast
it's going to be a PHP script that sends
the newsletter body which we just
created to many people at once let's
take a good look at that email body one
more time here's the HTML of it and I
will have this file available for
download at the end of the tutorial
series all of these files will be
available I'm using inline CSS styling
here
and links will show up and all that good
stuff okay now let's just go ahead and
save this file as it's not anything
we're going to need it in the server
we're going to save it as mmm let's save
it as body design and it's just going to
be for you to design your body so when
this newsletter gets blasted to
everybody you're going to want to change
to the next newsletter change the text
pictures whatever you're going to do to
make it the next campaign and then when
everybody gets this newsletter you
change the body put it in the script
that's how it's going to work so you
just keep this file call the body design
save in that folder and it can be an
HTML file because that's what it all is
HTML okay so stay tuned for part 5 I
believe I think we're on par 5 next and
I'm going to bang these all out within
the next couple hours so now we're going
to finish this up and I'm sorry about
the the gap in between one two and three
and then four and five okay all right
okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
