pseudo element selectors of CSS and
these are a little bit different from
the pseudo-class selectors and you can
always tell when you're looking at a
pseudo element selector because it has
two colon symbols side-by-side and
there's only four of them okay let's
take a look at the first line pseudo
element selector now in our HTML we have
a paragraph element that has a couple of
break tags in it let me get rid of those
forward slashes cuz you don't need those
anymore so this paragraph element has
two break tags in it so it's gonna have
three lines of text and we also have an
unordered list that has three list items
within it so what first line does is it
targets the first formatted line within
the element and let's see what it
renders so you can see the first line
all the way up until the break tag in
the paragraph gets styled and then the
first line in the list gets styled as
well so you can use this pseudo element
selector anytime you need to Target or
select the first formatted line within
an element
now let's examine the first letter
selector and the terminology should let
you know by itself exactly what it's
going to do it's going to target the
first letter within the text note inside
of the element that you specify here so
you can see we have two P elements and
all they have in them is regular text
and see what it renders so by the looks
of things it would be especially handy
if you're a storybook writer on lines
and you can have all of the first letter
in your paragraphs or whatever be bigger
and styled differently or whatever and
there's other situations you would use
that for but that'd be a good one
alright moving on to the B for selector
and this one's really cool the before
and after selectors are really cool and
handy so you can specify any element or
a selector type here and then you put
the before pseudo-element selector right
next to it and then you specify content
that's going to be placed before the
content that's in the element so
basically right here before it says the
word paragraph is going to be content
placed into the element let's see what
it does so you see the string that I put
in the content property is inserted
before the content within the element
now you can put a whole lot more than
just string content there let me see if
my code editor will bring up options
here yeah these are all the things all
the options you have for your content
property so the string is just one of
many options that you can use for your
content setting now the after pseudo
element selector is very much similar to
the before selector but it just
generates content after the content in
your element so you can see we have
string content of paragraph content now
this string is going to be added after
giving you this
okey-dokey and remember a content can be
one of many options it could be much
more than a string you can do many
things you could put even an image could
come after so you see we get this kind
of result if we use the URL setting for
the content property and that uses this
setting that you see right here I have
the string the custom string that I want
and then the image and they both render
after the content</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
