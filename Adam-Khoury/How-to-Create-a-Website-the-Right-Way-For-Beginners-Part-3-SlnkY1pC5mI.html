to create a website the right way for
beginners when we last left off in part
2 we had created this where you see here
it's a web page in a web browser we had
all of those elements that we sliced up
out of fireworks placed into making a
full complete site that has an auto
expanding body section to accommodate
any amount of content that you have
within the pages you can see some
highlight able HTML text here we left
off with I'm going to show you how to
get it all step set up smart and a style
sheet to where if you have 50 pages on
your website you can change one line of
code and change the whole style of the
website up from one central file you
don't have to change all 50 files if you
have 50 pages okay so let's go into
Dreamweaver is where we left off I
wanted to add to my body tag text the
default font and i want to add
background to not repeat so i'm going to
go to background repeat' no-repeat
semicolon first let's add two ids for
this table i'm going to add ID styling
tag for this header table then I'm going
to do one for the body and then the
footer table so first we have to make an
ID name so we put the pound sign and
let's call this header open curly brace
go down a couple of lines close the
curly brace and that's the little nest
that you're going to put all the styling
in for this header check this out let's
just grab all that styling right out of
their control x remove that style
attribute all together put what you
copied or cut right here in the header
definitions so you have background file
the width and the height there's your
header now you can do the same thing
make two mortals one for the body we'll
put
fota because you only have to change the
styling in one place not to so what we
have here footer da da da this has to
save footer and that was height of 16
pixels and not 195 this one the body has
no height so it auto repeats and I think
that is it for this now we can get rid
of these the styling on this and this
styling here now if we were to look at
the page in design view now we would
have lost all our cool graphics and
everything but all we have to do is go
to table ID is equal to header
and i'm using ID and not class because
i'm not going to be reusing that that
header table anywhere it's going to be
the only one so it has to be unique on
the page if I wanted to have multiple
tables that look like that with that
same header graphics in it I would use
class class definitions instead of ID
alright so footer body this would be
header let's grab ID right there put it
into the body right here this has so the
body table here has an ID body this will
help you visually stay separated to with
it you'll know which table is serving
which purpose put it you can use divs to
you just have to do a little more
experimentation and research dibs dibs
might be a better approach but i'm using
tables to show you how easy this is
going to be and you'll see in one second
why i'm using a table I won't have to
float anything let's see that should do
it a header body footer all ready to go
these all have the ID name for that
style so let's go into design view and
see what we have well first we have to
change the name of the file group this
has to be buddy now let's design view
and there it is your site is the same
way it was just a second ago let's press
f12 okay it looks exactly the same way
it did just a second ago even though we
took all that styling out of the the
actual table we put it in external
styling it still looks exactly the same
now what that means is we can take this
styling everything within this style tag
and put it in an external style sheet
but before I do that I'm going to show
you why i picked using tables and
highlight this body table bring up my
properties panel in Dreamweaver you see
where it says rows and columns I'm going
to give it three columns so that means i
just made a three column website with a
click of a button let's make this column
maybe 248 let's make a good and skinny
over there may be two hundred and then
right here I can have dual columns so
I'll have a three column site i can put
content their content here content their
menus whatever now if you would have
tried to attempt that with divs and
floating them and everything it takes a
little more work now that's why i opted
with the tables now you CSS guys know
why it makes my tutorial go a whole lot
faster and i don't have to train
everyone on how to be a CSS zen master
like you okay they can do that on their
own time right now I'm just trying to
show everybody how to get a good
professional powerful validating fast
loading website the easy way and not the
hard way okay sorry if I sound brass but
you deserve it because all you guys jump
down my throat because i like to use
tables i'm going to use tables until the
validation service tells me that they're
not accepted any more so just hush hush
with your CSS Zen crap div / table
argument I don't care nobody does so
let's looking let's put some font over
here we put some text over here and now
let's save it press ctrl s look at it in
the browser you see we have a three
column set up and ready to go and I'm
going to show you how to really get it
looking nice and the content on the
pages to be nice i'm going to show you
almost my actual page this is going to
be a live web site called web intersect
where people can go to find web
professionals near them or abroad so
you're seeing an actual site being
produced that's going to be running on
the web maybe within a day or two all
even
throw it up and be working on it live
real time and it won't take me but a few
days to build because i'm doing the
tutorials along right along with it
otherwise i'd have it done in a few
hours or within a day the whole site
would be built okay now last thing i
want to do in the style before i take it
out of here is we're going to add let's
just go to the design view and do it
through dream we go to page properties
go to the default font and i'm going to
make mine what should I use how about
I'm just going to use Arial black gadget
sans-serif apply let's go to size
default 12 apply okay and I can make
different font size styles within my
style sheet okay so just so you
understand the code when we changed we
use dreamweaver on the page properties
to change the font and everything you
can see where it added that style
definition here to the body TD th but
you can set custom styles and classes or
custom IDs and classes for any page
elements that you like as long as you
give them that IDC my tables have that
ID so they're going to adhere to all
these style definitions within those
depending on what id they carry and this
can also say class to set up a class
styling you put dot my class and that's
it you set everything up in there and
then this would say table class myclass
let's get this thing now into an
external CSS file let's go to file new
and we're going to go to CSS here in
Dreamweaver if you're a notepad you just
save it as a dot CSS extension type file
and you can leave that in there that's
fine so here we're going to go into the
page we don't need the style tag we just
want the labels and the definitions
until X we can get rid of this style
altogether that style tag go into the
new file press ctrl-v now we're going to
save it file save as in our root
directory in the style folder right here
just name it mane it's going to be main
that CSS in the style folder so you
cannot refer to these images in the
style folder refer to them directly
because they're in the same folder we
just moved the whole style definitions
to a new folder called style and these
images are already in that folder called
style for our site so we can't if we try
to refer to a folder called style from
within the style folder these images
won't get found so within the style
sheet make sure all your images let's
look at the where are we here's where
we're building the site in the root
folder all we have is the index page the
home page in style pull that we have
that style sheet now along with our
images see those your images for the
site does your stylesheet now let's see
if it worked main that CSS let's go to
index let's go ahead and uncomment this
link tag in the head section and you'll
see how it magically still brings in all
of that stuff that we have styling the
site let's press design see now you are
in design view press f12 and there you
go you have successfully taken your site
styling and put it into an external
style sheet now anytime within any one
of the 50 or 100 pages in your site if
you want to change any little thing in
here you just do it from one central
file called main that CSS that's the
smart way to program any website okie
dokie so we'll continue on in part four
where i'll show you how to make this
site start to look a little more like a
website we'll get some actual text
images or whatever into the page we're
going to validate it
and we're going to check it in all four
major browsers that's pop for so stay
tuned if you're interested bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
