exercise we will demonstrate how to
close specific things when a user clicks
outside of them you may have a drop-down
menu that you want to close when a user
interacts with other stuff on the page
or clicks outside of the drop-down menu
or perhaps you have information windows
that appear over content and you want to
close them if the user clicks outside of
them we're going to begin with a simple
pop out interface let me show you what
it renders we have some dummy content on
the page and a button that says pop out
interface when I click it an interface
pops out that I can interact with now
what I want to happen is when I click
outside of that interface I want it to
go away
so really the focus of the lesson is how
to sense if the user is clicking outside
of a target element you can see the way
I'm opening that interface and that's
not relevant to the lesson because you
guys would probably have a animation
that you drop your menus down with or
maybe you're fading something in so you
would already have an approach for
popping up some magic menu or magic box
we're just going to be demonstrating how
to sense if the user clicks outside of
that target element and then do
something accordingly like close it back
up okay so in order to do that we'll put
some JavaScript in place mobile ad is
the window mouse up event so we'll add
event listener and we'll target
the mouse up event and then comma and
then the function that we want to
execute when that event is triggered by
the user so we'll just type in function
open close parenthesis opening curly
brace and closing curly brace now you
can go down a couple of lines in between
your curly braces to make a more
familiar function nest the first thing
I'm going to do in the function is
target the box in question the thing
that I want to go away when the user
clicks outside of it now you may have
many boxes that you want to make go away
when the user clicks outside of them so
you can put them in an array and then
loop over them within the mouse up
function and I'll show you that at the
end of the video because you may have
more
than one magic menu or magic box so now
the last thing we need is an if
condition that's going to sense whether
or not the user is interacting with the
magic box or the magic menu so in order
to do that we have to get the event
reference so in our if condition we say
if event dot target which is how you
capture the object for the event so you
see how we made an object reference for
this box this is also an object
reference for whatever element the user
is over when they mouse up so we're
going to say if event target is not
equal to box then you can run your code
to close the box now we need some more
logic in this if condition but this will
show you base functionality so you put
your code whatever code that you're
using to close your menus you put it
there and I'll show you what that does
so if I open the interface now and I
click outside of it it goes away but we
have to put more logic in place because
if I'm interacting in the menu let's say
if I click over here in the magic box it
stays open but let me go interact with
anything in the menu it closes and
that's not the functionality that you
want because you'll probably have things
in here that you want the user to
interact with if I interact with things
the child elements inside the box the
box goes away and that's not what you
want you want the user to be able to
remain interacting in that box until
they click outside of it so all we do in
the if condition is put and which allows
us to evaluate something else we can
copy this event target and say and if
the event target dot parent node is not
equal to box that means if they're
interacting with any of the child
elements in the box you don't want to
close the menu so you're sensing to see
if what the user is mouse upping over is
not a child element in the box does that
make sense so now with that in place let
me interact with some
thing in the box now see I can click and
interact with this child element in my
magic box all day long and the box stays
open
I can click all over in the box and it
stays open and then if I click outside
of the box it closes and that's the
functionality we want we don't want the
box to close if somebody is interacting
with the child elements so that's why we
put this little and if the event that
target dot parent node does not equal
the box either then we're going to close
the box so this if condition is saying
if the thing that the user's mouse is
over when they Mouse up on the page is
not the box and if the thing that the
user is over when they mouse up on the
page is not equal to a child element in
the box now what we'll do is put an
example in place that will show you how
to loop over a whole array of magic
elements that you might have because you
might have more than one box okay so in
my HTML I've added two more boxes so I
have three magic boxes that open up as
pop-out interfaces now in the CSS I just
changed things up a little so I can give
them a class that way they all kind of
look the same but they all have
different locations because I'm
targeting their IDs here and making them
open up in different locations on the
page wherever I want
so I'll set this one to 300 and this one
to 600 left position now in the
JavaScript let me go ahead and collapse
all the CSS now in the JavaScript all we
have to do is add an array that's going
to represent these three boxes or the
IDS of those three boxes so we save our
box array is equal to box one box two
box three each box is an element of that
array and we can for loop over that box
array within our window mouse up
function so right before all of the code
that we already put in place within the
function what we're going to do is just
put a for loop structure around it so
then we can indent this code correctly
into that for loop
and in the for-loop we say bar I equal
to 0 semicolon I is less than the box
arrays dot length semicolon then we I
plus plus that's what allows us to
iterate over the length of the box array
in this for loop this for loop is only
going to run as many times as there are
elements within the box array and we can
access all of the elements within the
box array by targeting their index
position within the array it's very
simple now instead of saying document
dot get element by ID box 1 we just
target the box array here and we put in
between square brackets the I so the
first time is loop runs it's going to
target box 1 the second time this loop
runs it's going to target box 2 and so
on and so forth because the I is
incrementing so this lightning-fast
little loop will remove all the boxes
from display now let's see if that works
so if I open pop out box 1 and I click
away from it it goes away if I open pop
out box 2 and click on it and interact
with it it's fine but if I click away it
goes away pop out box 3 I can interact
with all day long when I click outside
of it it goes away and the way our code
is set up you can toggle really between
boxes by default the code the way it's
set up is removing all of the boxes
except the one that the user is
interacting with so that's what makes
that automatic functionality of when I
click another button to open up an
interface any that are existing on the
page already go away and the new one
comes in actually let's just say pop out
interface one pop out interface to pop
out interface 3 that way you can really
see what's going on there's interface
one interface 3 interface to I click in
it it's ok I click outside it goes away
all right so I hope the first little
static example helped you wrap your head
around things and now this second
example shows you how to run this over
an array of magic boxes or magic menu
that you might have on the page if you
