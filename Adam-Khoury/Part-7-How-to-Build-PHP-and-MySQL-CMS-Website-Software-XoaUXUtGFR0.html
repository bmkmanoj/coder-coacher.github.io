creating custom content management
systems using PHP and MySQL we're
showing the bare-bones in the foundation
of how to build the system sort of like
Joomla or WordPress whatever at a very
basic level to give you ultimate control
over layout and design of the site
alrighty so when we last left off we had
created the backend so let's go and log
in and as I said in the intro to this
series I might change things I might
change my mind on what to show so I have
in fact changed a few things on my own
and I'll be discussing a few of the
things that I added and because I have
to move on to other projects so I'm
going to just release the source code
for the whole thing I finished it all up
the basics for it anyway and you guys
can expand upon it from there if you're
somebody looking for a full robust
system go get Joomla or WordPress this
is system is for learning how to build
something like Joomla or WordPress from
scratch and then expanding it on your
own
ok so let's press admin and let's go
ahead and log in the Terminator and
goober nuts is the password and I'm
gonna I'm gonna put the the username and
password over here on the side or on top
or on the bottom somewhere maybe to
where anybody can log in and test and
use the system sort of like a sandbox an
open sandbox for anybody to use that way
they can see how it works before they go
through the steps of learning at all ok
so plus login now and so what I changed
on the admin home page is let's see I
changed this from a form into a regular
link so when you press create new page
this is where we last left stop let last
less left
oh my god tongue-tied this is where we
last left off was we said we were gonna
create the the page that created new
pages in the system I don't know what's
wrong with me my brains retarded today I
am retarded today okay so if I press
create new page I can just go ahead and
create a page put a sample page that's
the full title let's just make that the
link label to give that uppercase and
this is sample data create page now
operation completed successfully click
here take them back to the admin home
page and they can view live site by
clicking this link there you see there
it is sample page this is sample data
and I also have a few other pages and I
think I'm just gonna lay it out like
this so if you guys want to come and
test the system out make a little
question like what is javascript and
then explain it I put it in what is CMS
I just grabbed some data from wiki real
quick but I'm gonna put my own custom
data in there and what I think CMS is
and describe it myself with my own
custom copy so I'm not plagiarizing from
another site and so yeah if you want to
make a page just says you know what is
HTML what is CSS what is JavaScript what
is all about web dorky stuff that's what
I want here on this sandbox so if you're
gonna test it out give me some useful
information how about that and all right
so we go back to admin what we also have
added in is edit existing page so let's
go see the ID of the page that I just
created sample page let's click that up
here it says PID equals 11 okay so we
know that page is 11 so we just go edit
existing page we've put in place ID of
the page to be edited here is 11 then
press edit existing page if I try to
press that
without putting in a number watch what
happens please enter the ID number for
the page to be edited a nice JavaScript
function come up or JavaScript alert 11
and there it is
the full title the link label and you
can edit it right here now so I'll say
what is Ajax
what is Ajax info on Ajax goes here
alright so I press submit edit operation
completed successful click here view
live website bada-bing bada-boom
what is Ajax info and Ajax goes here so
you can see how powerful and easy the
speeds to use it's very nice
ok so let's discuss the create new page
functionality I changed from button to a
link so it's just a regular link that
goes to create page dot PHP which is
right here and what that has in it is
the admin check once again we want to
make sure they're logged in as admin and
then we have a JavaScript function in
the head here that validates the form
fields the three fields in the form so
if we go to design view you see that
there's one two three fields and if they
happen to be empty and somebody presses
submit we give them a little little
alert that lets them know so for
instance if I go to admin create new
page and I just press create this page
now see please enter the page title ok I
enter a title please enter the info for
the link label okay and so on and so
forth until they get all the data in and
stop being retarded because we tell them
from the get-go be sure to fill in all
fields because they are required so if
they happen to miss something Bing
they're getting the alert okay so that's
what happens there for the form and this
form is set to here is where you run
that function on submit return validate
form that's the name of that function
validate form and let's see what else do
we do here we're submitting this to page
new parse PHP
and that's a script that's going to
update the MySQL database add this new
page and pretty much complete the
operation at hand so that's pretty much
all we need to talk about in that create
page it's very simple you can see it's
just a form with a button and the
JavaScript alerts if they miss something
but if they get everything in they press
submit it goes to this page right here
we grab the posted variables from the
form let me put them in local PHP
variables and here I showed you a nifty
little method of creating a custom
function that you can send these
variables to that will filter them so
instead of writing out a whole bunch of
lines when you're doing your filtration
systems for your forms you can send each
variable to a universal filter system
which is my filter function here you can
filter them any way you need to and I
send all three right here through that
function the page title goes through the
link label goes through and then the
page body goes through and it comes out
right here is where you send them and it
comes out filtered into these local PHP
variables so then you can use those in
your inserts to your MySQL database
without worrying and let's see
and I I convert to HTML special chars so
I don't have to worry about tags they
get converted and any malicious code any
hack attempts of being thwarted by using
HTML special chars in conjunction with
these two custom Eric replaces on single
quote and tilde marks then here we just
connect to the database after
everything's filtered we connect to our
database and then we just run the MySQL
I query we're using MySQL I throughout
this series which is an improved version
of the MySQL family of functions so
MySQL I ever
show up if things are not correct and
ours is all correct you saw how it
worked out nice operation successfully
completed was echoed to the page and we
had a link to our index and that's the
end of that script that's how that whole
thing works okay now I'm gonna be
wrapping up the source code tonight and
making it available because everything's
pretty much done and I'm gonna make the
last little two videos back-to-back here
and throw them up on YouTube
everything's gonna be finished I'm
putting this project behind me and you
guys can fly with it now what I've got
left to explain our edit existing page
this little form and the page for that
will call the MySQL database to bring in
the existing data to be edited I'll
explain that one in part 8 and also the
delete page is a very simple little
script which I'll also be talking lined
by going through the code line by line
for that functionality as well and then
part 9 there might just be 10 parts to
this whole series part 9 after we
explain these two things in part 8 in
part 9 I'll explain JavaScript WYSIWYG
editors to put in your instead of having
this form field here see this input or
this text field this text area input
this gets replaced by a JavaScript
WYSIWYG editor and that allows people to
put in bold underline images links all
that good stuff usually all that
functionality is in most WYSIWYG editors
a nice Java Script was if we get it it
will do it and you can give people more
power over the formatting colors sizing
fonts whatever they're usually all and
all those features are usually included
like when you send an email while you
have all those little buttons up there
that say underline bold font size color
it gives you all those options or it
gives your client all those options and
a lot of them
ow image upload so that's what I'll be
talking about in part 9 and then part 10
I might just do some blablabla out of
that about how you can some logic for
making the system a little more
intuitive and robust or maybe we'll just
stop part 9 after I talk about the
WYSIWYG because that'll be pretty much
everything ok we'll see you in part what
a yes part 8 will be explaining the edit
existing page functionality and delete
page functionality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
