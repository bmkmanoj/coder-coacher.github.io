we'll be learning how to apply clipping
masks to achieve interlocking
interweaving or interlacing of our 3d
perspective items alright let's get
started click new web document I'm just
going to leave everything standard
normal let's go to 100% here I'm going
to see you draw out an ellipse and then
let's give it a fill color of an orange
there and no edge
no stroke and then going to go to the 3d
options to show the effect a little more
dramatically so go to extrude bevel I'm
going to go to rounded just get it about
like that and extrude depth maybe thirty
eight no cap let's preview at this time
as you can see it makes a nice ring
almost looks like a wedding band and the
height let's see if I rotate it you can
see the height of the object see if I
change the height make it look a little
more like a wedding band you can also
change your depth okay so say we have
something like that and we want to enter
we or interlock or interlace another
item make it look like it's going
through that ring so let's just press ok
that one's all set up so what we'll do
is we'll take that and get another copy
of itself control-c control-v okay so
now it's we have two copies of the same
item one sitting right on top of it the
other okay so what we'll do is we'll
grab another item
let's just grab a rectangle
only needs to be about that big instead
of right there now let's grab another
rectangle draw it out right about there
get the color on that one green
there we go
okay so now all you have to do is take
this one let's change the color and
that's where you can see it really good
and we're going to grab one of these so
highlight both together and into the
ring that's on top that we're
highlighting with that little rectangle
and we go to object clipping mask and
make so now what happens is that
clipping mask let's put this right on
top here and you'll see what what it did
so what I'm going to do is bring the
clipping mask section it's a front
object arrange bring to front now when I
move this up into place you can see
what's going to happen okay
masked it beautifully so that's how you
can get objects to interlace err into
weave or make it look like something's
going through something else in Adobe
