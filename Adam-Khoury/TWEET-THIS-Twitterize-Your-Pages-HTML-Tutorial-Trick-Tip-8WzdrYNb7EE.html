little tidbit here for anybody
interested in allowing people to tweet
your pages so what we'll do is automate
the tweet process on Twitter for people
and put a little button or link that
you'd like them to press so they can
tweak the content of your page to their
twitter status so all you gotta do is go
to Dreamweaver open Dreamweaver or
whatever your favorite HTML editor is
you can go into the design view if it if
your software is capable of that and you
can see the exact location that you want
to put the words tweet this and it will
be a link that will tweet the person's
status to show this page and whatever
you want to write as their status so I'm
going to put it right here I'm going to
go to my code view now so it shows me
this exact location that I should type
in my little link here so I want to put
it right after that break tag so i'm
going to type in a space href equal to
HTTP colon slash slash twitter.com slash
home and this will bring up the person's
home and status section automatically
and they have to be logged in but most
people stay logged in on their twitter
so that's no problem now you want to put
right here the status reading this
webpage you can type whatever you want
here checking out this awesome web page
whatever you know and then maybe dot dot
dot and then just put the link to your
web page so let's grab that link on the
web right there flash building about
that PHP you guys can come to my site
and check out the page and click that
link if you logged into your Twitter
account and test it out and see that it
will load it into your status section
and let's go right here and add that
link right there boom now once that link
is in
we can then claim the target attribute
as blank and you want to target as the
make the target value blank so it'll pop
up a new page you don't really want to
let them get away from your website and
your pages and now you just right I'm
going to write it in all caps people can
see it real good tweet this exclamation
and then close the a tag and that's it
now we press ctrl s we can look in
design view and see it's sitting there
and you can see the link right here you
can also apply your link this way you
don't even have to do it in code view
and do it in design view if you want put
the link right there and claim target is
blank okay so let's ftp this up here
about the PHP now let's refresh the
about page in the web here and let's
click this tweet link tweet this I use
this a lot and I have I use a button a
graphic as a button instead of those
words there it is reading this web page

see I even tweeted it a second ago about
to make a tweet tutorial now I'm
tweeting that I completed my tweet
tutorial I'm linking to the my about
page nobody's really going to understand
it till the video comes out but oh well
that's cool okay so let's close that you
see it opened a blank page and let me
tweet so if you're logged in you come
here to my page flash building calm

will see that if you logged in to your
Twitter account you'll be able to just
tweet my page here in just in a click of
a button we hope you like that one and I
