our e-commerce website building lesson
series this one we're continuing our
cart display so here in part 11 when I
uploaded the video maniac of web brings
up a good point will the price be
changing when the quantity is increased
like example if the quantity is 1 the
price is $4.99 but when the quantity has
increased a 2 that will show the price
as 998 and you can do that very simply
let's open up that cart PHP that section
of code where it's rendering the cart
output right below the while loop you
can simply let's take this price
variable price equal to this price
whatever the price is for that item
times you put the star symbol the
asterisk times each item quantity so
that's very simple to do there and
that'll make you a little math equation
that'll say if the price is 499 the
quantity happens to be 2 it'll make it
998 the price will be 998 for that card
item let's press ctrl s to save it and
FTP it up and see what happens I'm going
to put the black hat in my cart I'm
going to go back to home put the black
jeans in so I'm going to add the black
hat again it should be quantity to item
price 998 so let's go ahead and add it
again and there you go item quantity to
item price 998 and actually you should
have been able to figure that out on
your own because of all the in-depth
explaining we've been doing about what
variables you have at your disposal to
work with so you have the quantity
variable right there and in PHP you can
do a subtraction addition multiplication
the asterisk symbol the star symbol here
is simply multiplication so you take the
price for that item out of the database
times it by the quantity and you'll have
your your total price for that one item
no matter how much the quantity is for
that item in the cart ok now I'm going
to go into design view and I'm going to
just put in a cart
static representation of the cart the
way I want it to be designed okay so
here is the cart output variable so
right under that I have a break tag
under that so the line under that I'm
going to put it in a table insert table
I want it to be let's just say two rows
and I don't know six columns I don't
know if that'll be enough but we'll try
it up we'll try it like that and so I'm
going to put various titles for each
products details here and then we'll
have a dynamic rendering of each product
and its actual details in this dynamic
row that will be here but for now I'm
just going to statically design it just
like you would statically design
anything else directly on the page here
and then we'll resume the video because
I don't want to sit here just tweak in
the design of the cart in design view
when anybody could do that really any
monkey with Dreamweaver can design their
cart in design view here but making it
dynamic will be where we pick up okay so
you see what I've got here is a table
with my six columns to rows I give it a
cell padding of six border of one and
that's it
it's got a 100% width set on that table
and I adjusted these cells to be size
just like I need to just by visually
dragging them around so what we want to
do is make this table row in the code
view that table row right here dynamic
to where each product in the cart will
render out its own little table row make
good sense
sure does let's go so let's try
something here let's highlight that
table row and right here where it says
TR to the TR put it make put that into a
code comment comment it out so it
doesn't render and then right here let's
put that card output variable
right there
semicolon and go up to your PHP tab and
echo it out now since you're going to be
echoing it into the table you're going
to make sure it has to have the same
amount of table cells six table cells
that you have to render within this
section of the card output in the PHP
it's very simple so you see this card
output instead of just throwing these
things out for display like that we're
going to neatly packed them into table
cells six of them to be exact and we're
going to get the items image to display
in the first table cell along with the
title of the product all right so let's
put a little comment that says dynamic
table row assembly each thing needs to
get placed within the TD tags right
there so let's take this first one
actually it's going to be item name
would be the first one so let's take
that ctrl C let's put it right there
take these TD tags make sure the closing
ones on that side you can get rid of
that and n s and BS P which is just a
space so this is how you want it to look
you want to have your opening TD tag
here and then the variables whatever you
want to be inside of that TD tag in
between them and then close it up with
the closing TD tag so the product name
will be there and we'll also put the
product image but first let's make sure
this all works and renders out to the
table let's change all of these up so
this one we don't need and we know the
next one we want description so let's
make sure in this while loop that we get
the details
make sure this says details and details
so we're accessing the details from the
MySQL query for that item we can put
that right here
details that's going to be the second
table cell in that row now let's make
sure we have six altogether four five
six so the next one so we add details
and these you can actually just get rid
of all these murmer done these four
lines the price is going to be where was
that unit price is in the third one so
we're going to have to change this price
to price total because we're going to
have to have the unit price in the third
cell right here this is going to be
price and that's going to be the unit
price would be $4.99 for all my products
and then you want to have the total
price which was after quantity so we
know we can get the quantity variable
here pop it right into place right there
and then we need the total so we can
take price total variable and put it
here
and the last thing is going to be a
remove button so let's just type that in
for now let's just type in an annex
character just for static representation
let's remove all of these we don't need
these anymore we're going to have to put
the table row tag in there too so let's
make carp pop card output variable again
and this is going to be starting TR tag
that's the starting table row tag so
right there at the top you put the
starting table row tag at the very
bottom you put the closing table row tag
so there you go there's a dynamic table
row it's going to be assembled within
this for each loop for each card item
and it's going to be placed right there
in card output let's see if that works
let's FTP it to the server and check
things out we still have to add a few
things to this table to make it really
work as a card should alright so I FTP
the new programming up to the store and
this is what I get which is exactly what
I wanted you can make these this table
header any color you want that's what
I'm going to do I'm going to change the
color of it let's go to the back to
design view instead of white you can see
I have mine set is all background of
white for those table cells I'm going to
change those to maybe some blue color
light blue there we go
and I'm going to make all that text bold
ctrl s FTP it and there you go so you
have little headings up there that
describe what all the information is
inside now let's work on getting this
image for black hat to show and we also
want to make this a link to the actual
store product so they can go and view
that product in depth if they're not
sure what they had put in their cart so
we'll make that a link to the product
we'll also put the product image there
and so let's go into the code view the
card output and right here where they
have the product name let's put a break
tag right there
so the prod
name will be on top then pop in this
code now we can do here is encapsulate
these with single quotes this whole
string that way we can leave all the
double quotes in there for all of the
HTML attributes of that tag and they'll
still render incorrectly but where you
want the variables to come in is right
here where I have these X's so this has
to be you can see I have the width set
to 40 and height set to 52 for all my
product images
so they'll be nice and small in the cart
so item ID I can grab that variable
right there and pop that right here by
putting a single quote space period
space the variable space period space
single quote that will allow that
variable to render in this location here
since our string is encapsulated by
single quotes we have to break the
string using single quotes then add the
variable and then resume the string and
here in the alt you just want to have
the product name I guess so let's do the
same thing single quote period variable
period single quote and let's put the
variable right there product name so you
see how that works
you don't really need the spaces in
between your period there but I like to
put the spaces because it really lets me
know what I'm doing there it gives me a
better visual representation of what's
going on and I know it's a little tricky
because there's two different ways you
can render variables you can render them
in double quotes or single quotes but
you just have to make sure that you're
quoting the way you're using your quotes
is correct to let the variables display
okay so that should give me the image
right under the name yeah let me just
show you the other way to do it I'm
going to remove those single quotes and
periods that we put in to make the
variable display within the string
that's encapsulated by single quotes and
we'll have it
if we use double quotes here so watch
I'm going to use double quote and double
quote this might be a little easier for
some of you guys anywhere in your string
where you have double quotes you can see
it breaks it so what you have to do is
escape all double quotes in the string
by putting the backslash so you see
there I'm just putting the backslash
between all double quotes in that string
now I don't have to do anything just put
in the variable and it will display in
the string there so let's test that out
say the reason why I just I took the
extra time to show you both methods
there is because I know a lot of people
run into trouble when they were trying
to quote and escape things within a PHP
rendering string okay so you see what
I've got there and I have to go into the
HTML section make sure right here we're
not echoing the cart output up top
anymore we just have it down there where
it should be for the dynamic table row
now if I look at my cart that's exactly
what it should look like and you can
align all of these things vertically
align them to the top if you want I'm
just going to leave it as it is now I'm
going to make a link like I said to the
actual product on the site now if you
want your link to be around the product
title just go ahead and highlight all
this right there so right there around
the product name we're going to put in
throw in a link okay you can see that we
have to escape that double quote and
that double quote mark and that's it now
we can put the actual href to the
product product of PHP
ID is equal to actually we can remove
these those double quotes and the
periods there because we don't need them
anymore since we made the string
encapsulated with double quotes since
our whole string is encapsulated with
double quotes here that means we do not
have to do anything to those variables
and they'll still render so what we need
here is item ID variable product dot PHP
question mark ID equals item ID let's
FTP that up your cart okay so now you
can see I have links let's click that
see if it goes perfect let's go back to
my cart let's click this one perfect go
back to my cart
I'm good to go all right now when we
pick up in part 13 we're going to add
the last few essential things that the
cart needs like changing the quantity
within the cart interface here and the
remove link and once we get those two
things working we're pretty much close
to finished because all we have to do is
assemble all the variables into a nice
little package that can be sent off to
the payment gateway and we're also going
to have the payment gateways ipn script
for paypal which will show you how to
database all your transactions and
really that'll be the end of the series
so we're very close to the end now guys
but now you have more of a of a real
cart look going on here and we want to
put dollar signs in front of these
prices so we can just go in to the code
very simply and place in a dollar sign
there and one right there save there you
go OOP I put it in the wrong slot group
each item quantity right here price
totals where I wanted that there we go
okay so there you have
there's your total the dollar sign unit
price with the dollar sign there you can
see I have three of those items three of
the black hats in my card so that's why
it says 1497 yet and the card total will
show you how to get the cart total in
the next lesson where we'll be showing
you how to up the quantity or decrease
the quantity and show you show you how
to let the person change the quantity
here and remove the item will also show
the cart total and we'll get into
discussions about the payment gateways
all right so we'll see you the next part</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
