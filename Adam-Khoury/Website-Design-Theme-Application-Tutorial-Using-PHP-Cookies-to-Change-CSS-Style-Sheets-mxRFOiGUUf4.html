if I could show how I made my theming
application at develop HP com
so that's so what this tutorial is gonna
be all about I'm going to show you how
to use the PHP and CSS stylesheets will
use PHP cookies and in CSS stylesheets
to theme out your website and allow
people to choose between those themes so
if I go here I click apply plastic
you'll see it takes on a whole new
design and if i go to the forums it
retains the design all the way through
even if I shut the browser down
completely come back a week later this
design will be what I see when I come to
the site any of the homepage the
tutorial sections anything man every
Singh mine I show you now what I've done
is I put a package together that is
three simple pages so rather than try to
have you decipher through the code that
developed PHP source code I just put it
into simple little files that are easy
files and this is the working
demonstration where you can take this
download package and put these files up
on your server it has to be ap a PHP
enabled server so if you have a PHP
enabled on your local machine you can
test write in your local machine but if
you don't have PHP enabled on your local
machine you can test it online you just
throw it on your server online and
you'll see it all working dandy so here
I'm at the home page here's the contact
page this is just a simulated website
very simple here's the themes page
you'll see there's two choices you can
put as many choices as you like I put
ladybug and cardinal ladybug is default
so if I click Cardinal it changes the
theme of the whole site and you can
change anything about the site placement
of these items color of all these things
color via links color of the boxes
ground color background image so if I go
back to ladybug by the picking part upon
Cardinal go home contact page it retains
that theme if I'm a user at your site
you have this going I close down my
browser I come to your site a week later
it retains the cardinal theme for me
even though ladybug is default so now
let's take a look at these files okay so
now that you've seen it working and
we've tested it fully I'm going to show
you the files now and we'll discuss the
code so here is a folder called my
website which would be your website this
is just a little website that I
simulated for this example so the code
is nice and slim inside of these files
as to not clog things and get in the way
so you can fully understand what's going
on when you download this package you
look at these files you look at the
source code you'll say Oh Betty hey see
it's Betty it's a thank-you item for
doing that for me and give me me the
comments in the code I appreciate that
now there's gonna be some people on
YouTube user tutorial I will see you
typing code I add up type the code for
the videos you took it damn it no I'm
not doing it because there's a few files
here it takes a few files to get this
going okay so you got the index page
which is your home page your contact
page and say this is the page called
choose theme this is the one you want to
put on your site this page will allow
them to choose the theme to change the
theme up on your site that's what that
page is purpose is it's open the home
page opens with a derby cs4 the remover
you'll notice it's just like any other
home page actually let me just over them
all file all right that's all the files
that's powering the whole site this
simulated site I have so let's look at
the index page and let's talk about how
the index page works okay so the first
thing that happens in your home page or
really on any page where you want these
themes to be displayed which would be
all the pages on your site
probably you have to do this CSS cookie
check let's move right over here I'm
gonna look at that code in just a second
so first we do the CSS cookie check
which is including the from the style
folder a PHP file called CSS cookie
check so when we run include here that
means that codes going to execute that's
in this cookie check file and you'll
notice here in the choose theme page and
the contact page we run that cookie
check in the CSS cookie check what we do
here let's just read the comments it
says this file checks to see if they
have a style cookie present in their
browser software if they do then we
access its value and put it into the
style choice variable if they do not
then we simply place the default site
theme into the variable value you can
see that's taking place here within this
if and else condition statement first we
just initialize the style choice
variable then we say if is not set
cookie site style then the style choice
is the default ladybug or whatever your
default style is for your website
whatever default theme else that means
they do have set a cookie style we put
this cookie style variable into the
style choice local variable so that's
just saying you know if they have a
style cookie set then we put that style
cookie variable value into this variable
here if they don't have one set yet it
has to be the default layout that's how
that works okay very good
let's close that one so on the index
page after that runs then your index
page is going to know whether or not
that there's a style choice set or not
if it has it it's going to give it the
default value or the option that they
chose and you'll have to understand CSS
somewhat to get this working real nicely
for you you'll see in the example you
don't have to understand what CSS
by this example but if you want to do
really elaborate things with this you'll
have to understand CSS and you'll have
to understand working with a linked
stylesheet use style sheets like I'm
using for each theme so what you do here
is you use PHP to render in the
stylesheet linkage so we go to style
folder whatever their choice is so if I
chose cardinal this is gonna say
cardinal PHP is gonna echo out the value
cardinal there so it's gonna say style
slash cardinal slash style dot CSS it's
gonna pick up the cardinal style sheet
and use that to theme out the page if
this was the default theme which is
ladybug this is going to say style slash
ladybug slash style dot CSS which is
going to use the ladybug style sheet to
theme out the page that's how each page
in your site's going to work using just
a couple of alterations to your existing
files your style sheet linkage and then
you add this right above the doctype
okay now the choose theme page is very
simple this is just a page that you make
to give them the options of changing the
theme to various different things you
see here we just have two links one for
the changing to the ladybug theme one
for changing to the cardinal theme in
the code you'll see that those links are
set up using a URL variable URL variable
is choice and its value in this instance
is cardinal here for choosing ladybug
the link is set to choose underscore
theme which is this page PHP choice
equals ladybug so when this link gets
clicked what happens is the URL
variables get sent through the browser
and then the page can access it once it
comes back in and those values will be
read by this page so the first time this
page runs here at the top you'll notice
we have just disregard all this say the
page really starts right here
if they don't choose a style if they
don't click one of those links all of
this code here gets bypassed doesn't
even get processed at all this code only
runs if they click one of those links
just choose a style so if it is set to
get choice variable from the URL
variables we put the get choice value
into this local PHP variable called
choice here then we run an if condition
to say if the choice equals ladybug or
if the choice is equal to cardinal then
we'll process this code if the choice is
not ladybug or Cardinal that's some
theme we don't have one I'm sorry we
don't want them choosing it you know
what I'm saying here if it's ladybug or
if it's cardinal we execute these lines
of code these two lines of code this one
sets the cookie this one actually
creates the cookie and it sets it to
approximately 30 days in the future so
this cookie will last and it will
remember their choice in the browser for
30 days then the header will send them
to any URL that you want them to be sent
to so that's pretty much it that's how
the choose theme page works it's so easy
this little bit of code powers the whole
thing and all you need is links or forms
I put a little comment in here if you
want to use post method using form
buttons you can like I'm doing it the
develop PHP okay so that's the the home
page and the choose theme page the
contact page is just a generic page I
threw in there just like the index page
same thing let's close that close that
and close that and now we have just the
two style sheets the one for the ladybug
theme and one for the cardinal theme but
what we have in both style sheets is
very simple you refer to any images
within that themes folder so you put any
images for that theme in the theme
folder and then that way you refer to
them
the path directly in a local folder so
you can see I'm just going straight to
background thought jpg to theme out this
for this stylesheet because the
background that jpg is living in the
same folder as this style sheet you can
change everything really this is where
knowing CSS really will come in handy
for you in an application such as this
because you can make wild different
changes from one style sheet to the next
one theme to the next so basically all
you do is style it you play with the
colors change everything up the way you
want from one theme to the next using
these style sheets okay
and that way you can achieve something
cool like I did at develop PHP here let
your members change the website theme
and it'll be site wide all over your
site as long as you set the right code
within the pages to hook it up and if
you have happen to have HTML files you
can just turn them into dot PHP files
and all your HTML and everything will
still work exactly the same a PHP file
is just a different kind of fancy HTML
file that can process server-side
language called PHP ok so I'm gonna zip
this up right now and you guys will be
able to download it I'll put the link
it'll be available in the description of
the video so you can just download the
package and take a look at everything
throw in your server see how it changes
the site up and everything ok peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
