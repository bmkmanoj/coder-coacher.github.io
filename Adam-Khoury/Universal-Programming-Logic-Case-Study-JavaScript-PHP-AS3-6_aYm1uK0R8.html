an article that I read at world of web
crafts com who was written by a friend
of mine named James within his article
he's discussing how he's noticing a lot
of similarities between various
programming languages that he's messing
around with so what I'm going to do now
is write an article stemming off of
James's article and I just wanted to
throw out three code examples that show
I'm very similar javascript actionscript
and PHP are okay get yourself a blank
HTML file ready and x y la la wait me my
bank okay all right within your
javascript element you're going to type
in compute and we want to feed that
function three arguments or three
parameters to numeric values and one
string value so what I'll do is give it
a tu cama a 7 comma and a string value
of a username I'll just put my name
there you put your name and yours ha ha
ha now let's just double click that
right there press ctrl-c to copy it i'm
going to type in function and then paste
in function name compute open close
parenthesis open the curly brace and go
down a couple of lines and put in your
closing curly brace there so you have
your function nest all set up now this
is in taking three parameters so we're
going to make three variables out of
those parameters we're going to say
value one which is a numeric value is
going to be a the next one will name be
for the next numeric value and for the
user name that's coming in we're going
to name you so we have variables a B and
you which represent these 3pm so when
this function compute runs it passes
those three variables through so when
the function processes it has access to
those three variables using the names a
B and you now in the first line within
the function we're going to type in Bar
C so we're creating a new variable
called see and it's going to represent a
number which is the sum of a plus B and
we put semicolons to break a statement
so that's why semicolons are used in all
of the scripting languages that we're
going to be demonstrating within this
video now to output the results to the
program we're going to type in document
dot write and in between parentheses
we're going to put in set of double
quotes and outside the parenthesis will
put in our semicolon okay so you can
just type in the following string in
between your double quotes what i did
was i just typed the string the way I
wanted to output but you can see I need
to put the variables here in place of my
XXX so in order to do that let's just
put in a double quote where the three
exes were plus sign another plus sign
and another double quote and in between
those two plus signs we're going to put
the you variable that way it says okay
Adam then we want the sum of a and b is
equal to we want the sea variable here
so let's just remove those three X's and
put it plus C there you go there's many
ways you can make output to the program
so now let's take this since it's done
make sure our file is saved and run it
in the browser press f12 it says okay
Adam the sum of a and b is equal to 5
now if i change this number to a 7 and
this to joe run that in a browser ok Joe
the sum of a and b is equal to 10
alright so you can see how a basic
function that intakes parameters
dynamically works ok so that's
JavaScript now let's take that exact
same code and let's put it into action
script ok here i am in Flash
Professional authoring cs5 I'm going to
go up to my timeline and open my
scripting panel on that keyframe by
pressing f9 once my scripting panel is
open I'm going to pop in that JavaScript
that I just copied from my HTML file now
all I have to do is change one little
thing javascript and actionscript 3 are
so similar so you can see I change
document right to say trace everything
else stays exactly the same so those are
very similar programming technology so
all we have to do to see the output of
this program since we're using trace in
debugging mode is press control enter
you can see we have okay Joe the sum of
a and b is equal to 10 so that's the
output let's go back to the timeline and
you can see the code I just changed one
little tiny thing which was the way
we're outputting to the program alright
so that's javascript and actionscript so
let's just take that action script let's
go into PHP now here we have an empty
PHP document all ready to go with
our PHP opening and closing tags in
place let's pop it in that code and it
says we have a syntax error which is
natural and our variables we have to
have dollar signs in PHP so that's all
I'm going to do I'm going to add dollar
signs tall these variable names here and
instead of plus signs I want dots so I'm
going to get my dollar signs and burn
all my variables and these plus signs
turn them to dots because that's how you
append to a string instead of using a
plus sign like action script and
JavaScript you use a dot in PHP to
append a variable within a string there
and you can't trace what you have to do
is echo and you don't actually need the
parentheses around your echo value now
you see where we have bar we don't need
to signify bar C is just a variable
created at that point and you don't put
bar in front of it okay here's the
output of our PHP program and you have
to make sure that you have PHP enabled
on your local machine or that you're
running this online on your live web
server where PHP runs natively basically
just you have to be in an environment
with PHP processes in order to see the
output of the program okay so that was a
universal programming case study for
JavaScript PHP and actionscript 3 that
shows how strikingly similar all three
of these programming languages are okay
I won't take up any more of your time I
hope you've enjoyed this presentation
I'll talk to you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
