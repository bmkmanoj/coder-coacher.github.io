flash source file for ActionScript 3 for
those who are interested in creating
multi-page galleries and you can see all
I did was invert the images from gallery
1 and then I made them upside-down in
gallery 3 but those can be all different
pictures with different captions and
you'll see once you download the Fla
source file and all of the example
images I have in the little folders
you'll see how it's all set up and laid
out and if you're interested in making
custom dynamic dynamically loaded image
galleries that is images that are loaded
from the server at runtime they're not
in the flash file you can see how each
one kind of loads up and I put a little
movie clip it says loading image behind
it this is just like my other image
gallery the basic image gallery but I
just wanted to show how to easily make
multi-page galleries if you wanted
multiple galleries in here and the code
will also show you how to place more
images if you like then 5 if you want
more than 5 images in each gallery the
code if you read the code comments will
show you how to do that so go ahead and
download this Fla from develop PHP comm
it's free and it might give you some
insight into something you're looking to
create okay we'll see you guys next
