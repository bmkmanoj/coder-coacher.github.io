tutorial we'll be showing all of the
steps required to create a fan loading
animation just like YouTube uses you
could go online and just take one that
is already made by another designer to
bypass learning how to make it yourself
and nobody will yell at you if you do
that so a little animated graphics like
these are used with Ajax data calls and
data transmissions so sometimes it takes
a few seconds to request certain data
from the server now when we're using
Ajax to send or receive data from the
server we should give the user some kind
of indication that something is taking
place or loading and that is what
graphics and animations like this are
used for okay let's open up fireworks
and let's create a new fireworks
document PNG and I'm gonna make my
canvas 500 by 400 pixels okay now the
first thing I'm going to do is grab an
ellipse and you have to hold down on the
shapes tool to get to all of the
different shapes so you grab an ellipse
and if you want to see the tooltips so
you see those little x and y-coordinates
next to my mouse cursor you can get
tooltips like that if you go to view
tool tips okay so if you don't have
those little numbers you might want to
view tooltips so you can see them all
right now let's just hold shift so we
draw out a perfectly round ellipse and
let's make it 200 pixels and let me
bring up my properties panel so you can
see the exact size of that so you see I
have 200 by 200 and I'm gonna take away
the fill now I'm gonna grab that ellipse
and put it in the direct center of my
canvas now grab another ellipse and make
that 160 by 60 and let's give that one a
light gray fill and no edge and grab
that one and place it in the direct
center as well now what you'll do here
is press ctrl and mouse wheel so you can
zoom in and then when your mouse goes
over the big ellipse you're gonna see
the outline of it now just bring your
other ellipse down to where its center
dots or its center points there look
like they meet up right about there
looks good to me you know it doesn't
have to be super precise
so let's zoom back out to a hundred
percent now with that one in place we
can just press ctrl-c ctrl-v and then
drag that one down right about there and
then let's zoom in and make sure that
one looks like it's little points see
how this ellipse has four points you
want to make sure its side points look
like they match up with that big ellipse
on the line okay so once you have that
you can zoom back out and then you can
delete your big ellipse control X so
just remove that from the canvas and
then highlight the two of these then
press ctrl-c ctrl-v now let's go to our
scale tool that way we can rotate these
things so once you have your little
rotate symbol there just press shift and
rotate one two three times let's do that
again control C control V one two three
control C control V one two three when
you press control C and control V your
copy and pasting so that's why I press
ctrl-c and ctrl-v
now you can highlight all of those and
let's make those just a little bit
lighter maybe right about there
okay okay so we have our group of
ellipses and we're going to scale those
now so you hit your scale tool grab it
from the corner and hold shift while you
scale scale it down to about 20 by 20
we're gonna make it very small all right
now once you have that little guy you
can just fit canvas and it doesn't
matter where it is the canvas will fit
to it when you hit fit canvas now we can
take that and ungroup it ctrl shift G so
ctrl G groups control shift G on groups
now all we have to do is animate this
little sucker so first we'll start with
here let's zoom in you can zoom in on
your canvas by pressing ctrl and mouse
wheel zoom in and out and the first one
I'm gonna make a dark color now you want
to open up your state so you can go to
window States and actually I'm going to
turn this back to
the light gray before I start animating
I'll just keep them all gray and then
we'll make the states now we'll make all
the states that we need and then we'll
start changing the color of those so
we're gonna duplicate state one
so you right-click state one duplicate
state and let's duplicate that six times
okay and if we need to add another state
on the end it's very easy to do you can
just duplicate this state seven one time
but on state one make sure you click
state one highlight that one and then
make this little ellipse darker then on
state to make this little ellipse darker
then on state three make this little
ellipse darker State for this little
ellipse gets darker state five this
little ellipse gets darker state six
this little ellipse gets darker state
seven this one gets darker and I'm gonna
need one more so I'm going to duplicate
state seven one time okay and then I'll
just make this one the dark color and
bring this one back to a light color now
I'm gonna press play down here you see
what I have let's go ahead and zoom out
to the normal size so there's a hundred
percent let's start at state one and
press play so you see what you got and
you can make those other dots as dark as
you want it looks like those should be
maybe a little bit darker and you can
use any colors you want maybe mine are
too light and dark maybe it's too much
contrast but don't worry about that you
can make yours any colors you want so
once you have your animation set up then
you go to file export wizard continue an
animated gif continue and then you're
going to export and save that animated
gif onto your computer in any folder
that you want and then you can load that
up to your web server and use it for all
your Ajax data transmissions to let
people know data is being requested from
the server so there's either data being
sent to the server or it's just being
it from the server you can use it in
both of those instances okay so now the
next time you're on YouTube and you see
their little fan loader you can think to
yourself I know exactly how they made
that and I can make it too alright I
hope you've enjoyed this tutorial and
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
