to be learning how to create a PHP and
MySQL newsletter and email blast
application which is for allowing people
to sign up for it through forms on your
site we send that information to a
database store it when it comes time to
send our periodic newsletter or our site
bulletin we can just blast it out to
everybody that's within that database
all those email addresses that we've
accumulated we just blast it out to all
of them automatically at once to make
our lives easier as a webmaster a lot of
my clients have requested this from me
and as you get further into web
development your clients will request it
from you so it's good to know and have
okay there's going to be a few parts to
this lesson series but it's going to be
in depth and it's not going to be overly
complex and it's the sort of thing that
a beginner can jump right into wants to
save money on this type of application
because a lot of people pay money from
their hosting account providers for this
type of added functionality when you can
create it from scratch it's open-source
programming and I'm teaching you how to
do it free so there's really no cost and
operating it on your server but there is
a cost if you get it through your host
hosting provider they charge you nice
for this kind of thing ok so what we'll
do is we'll get started in this first
video here but there will be other
videos that follow with that that will
complete it and I'm just going to talk
about a little bit of the applications
logic and flow here so the first part of
it is the user comes to your website and
they love it and you want to receive
your periodic newsletter or your website
bulletin now we'll have to have a MySQL
database table and be sure we connect to
it so that's going to be the first thing
that we knock out and the next thing is
creating a form on our website or a page
that has a form on it for gathering
their names and email addresses when
they press submit we're going to have a
script written
that is going to parse that data their
name and their email address to a
database first we'll do a little error
checking them will parse it to a
database and store it there and then
what happens after that is we wait with
all those names and people's email
addresses in our database for when we
shoot out our our website bulletin or
newsletter and board that occasion we
write a script that's going to gather up
all of those names out of the database
and shoot whatever content we designate
as our newsletter to them and throughout
the lesson series I'll be discussing
important applicant relevant information
such as staggering because staggering is
going to be important because most
hosting providers and hosting
environments have a sending limit a lot
of them are set to a thousand for most
websites unless you have your hosting
environment all amped up and you're
paying extra if the things you probably
have it a nice limit on how many PHP
mail functions can fire up per day and
that is broken down by hour as well so
you can you'll have a thousand per day
maybe but you can only shoot so many of
those out per hour so you definitely
want to get to the documentation about
your server or just get in touch
directly with representatives from your
hosting provider and they'll let you
know no problem and they have all that
information on hand okay so just so no
one video in this series gets too long
we're going to shut this one down now
and continue on in part two I'm gonna
get to work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
