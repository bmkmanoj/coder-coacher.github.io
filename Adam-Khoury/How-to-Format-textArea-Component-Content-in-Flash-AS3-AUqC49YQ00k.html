courtesy of billy goat karaoke and his
thread reads hi i have a textarea
component that loads external text into
it and i was wondering how you control
the font size for the text that appears
in it I can't find any font parameters
so I have to add something to a s of the
external text function what do i need to
add cheers sean ok well it comes
courtesy of Sean sorry alright so what
we'll do is I'm here in a new flash
actionscript 3 file will drag out the
text area component in the from the
components library there's a text area
drag it out to stage and I'm just going
to set the size manually let's go to 400
x 200
it's going to instance name of TA
underscore txt text area underscore txt
so ta underscore txt is the instance
name on it and now let's put some code
here just make a new layer and on that
new layer let's type in a string
actually let's type in two strings so
I'll show you two different sizes my
string one this is a string type
variable and also let's just type in as
a value string value is hello little
world exclamation now let's take that
line and copy it and let's just say you
had another value going in another
external section or another section of
external text coming in say hello big
world and normally you would only have
one external string coming in but I just
wanted to show you how you could format
two of them if you wanted in different
ways okay so now let's just write in ta
let's put the instance name for that
text component text area component ta
underscore txt and we're going to use
the HTML property HTML text property
that way we can have it render HTML in
the string and we're going to say HTML
text is equal and put everything in
between single quotes here and then we
put the semicolon in between the single
quotes we're going to type in font size
just like you would in HTML it will now
respect your HTML commands or formatting
let's make this 1-2 that hello little
world and right here
let's go to close up that Pont tag we're
going to put after the single quote the
last single quoted a we're going to put
plus space space plus space space and
two more single quotes now here we're
going to type in the closing font tag
here and all we have to do is put in my
string one right there now we press ctrl
enter you see you have nice little text
says hello little world now all we have
to do is you can append text well
actually let's just put a line break
here BR / close the BR and we're going
to have font size
Plus 8 make it really big plus 8 and
then we put plus space space plus space
space single quote single point in
between the signal quote we close the
font tag there there you go my string 2
goes right there now let's press control
enter and there it is hello big world in
hello little world this is negative 2
sighs and this is font size plus 8 and
you can do a whole lot more formatting
say you wanted this one to be underlined
just pop in the HTML underline tag close
it off control enter or f12 in the
browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
