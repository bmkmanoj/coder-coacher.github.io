actionscript 3.0 sound programming video
textbook yeah we're showing you how to
make billions of dollars online by
mastering the most powerful tool for web
media in the world today yeah Shane yeah
a lot of people have come to the del L
of PHP forums and they have said add up
you have these cool players and
everything and that's fine but I don't
want it to autoplay how do i make my mp3
player not autoplay very very simple and
that will be the focus of this lesson so
we're right where we left off last time
to where we press control enter the
sound is playing in the right and left
big things to do anything alright so
there's a movie clip that our sound code
is contained within so let's double
click on that and here we are in it's in
your timeline and this is the code we
last left off with that's pretty much it
so far so it auto plays right when your
file loads some people might not want
that salt what you do is you go into the
top here you type in bar autoplay and
this will be a bull NZ put colon
bullying equal to false now once you
have that variable in you simply go here
right here line 7 where it says channel
equals sounds up play that's where the
sound starts up in place so just bring
that down a few lines and right here you
type in an if condition nest open curly
brace close curly brace within the
parentheses we're going to evaluate the
autoplay variable so if autoplay equal
true then we're going to start up the
sound so let's grab these two lines of
code let's start up the sound and you
also have to grab these listeners this
at the frame event listener put that in
there as well or else you'll get an
error or and this complete event
listener put that in there as well
now let's press control enter see
nothing happens because we have set our
autoplay boolean variable to false what
abilene variable is just something that
lets you toggle between true and false
so if I turn this to true right now and
I press control enter there it is it
plays because my if statements
evaluation if autoplay is equal to true
then I play the sound the black pepper
back so in this instance when you load
your player and this is set to not
autoplay a value of false that means the
user needs a play button to press that
way they can start the sound up so let's
do that right now so in order to save
time I'm just going to go to window
common libraries buttons I'm gonna go
all the way down to play back rounded
and I'm going to take out rounded gray
play pop it where I want it I'm going to
make sure it's not on my actionscript 3
layer control x off of that layer I'm
going to lock that layer so I can't
accidentally put anything there because
I don't want any assets there I just
want the code there so I'm going to go
into the stuff layer where it should be
press ctrl shift V put it back where it
was now i'm going to give an instance
name of play BTN actually let's give it
an instance name of play underscore BTN
that way we get cold hints when we type
that in to the actions panel you'll get
code hints if you have a an object with
an instance name of either underscore
BTN or underscore and C or underscore MC
if it's a movie clip underscore MC will
give you code hints and if it's a button
symbol underscore BTN will also give you
code ends whereas if you didn't have it
set up like that you would not see the
code hymns I hope that makes sense and
some of you know what I'm talking about
but it's just handy if you have a button
you put underscore BTN if you have a
movie clip you put underscore MC and
you'll get magic code hints trust me and
you may wish to design your own fancy
looking buttons you know take the time
to make your player look real
but just with tutorials sake i'm just
going to use the pre-baked button now in
order to program our play button we need
one more variable that's abilene this
one's going to be cold is playing and if
any of you have programmed sounds before
or programmed the player you know the is
playing variable well and that's going
to be false right when the application
loads and you change that is playing
boolean variable to true any time your
sound starts up so right here under
where it says sound that play with the
sounds actually starts up is playing
should be turned to true and you can
remove that bullying and the bar because
the variables already defined here so
you just put is playing equals true
there and that's a very important part
of things when you go to toggling play
and stop and all that so that means
we're also going to want to take that
variable in the playback complete event
the function that fires off when the
sound finishes playing you also want to
put that in there is playing equals
false because the sound would be over
done finished okay so now all we need is
a play button click event listener and a
little function that's going to start
the sound to play so I'm just going to
go down to the very bottom under the
playback complete event put a little
comment to myself play button
functionality and I'm going to put in a
listener here so you see it says play on
the score of BTN I think that's what I
named my button play underscore BTN dot
add event listener mouseevent click and
the function that's going to fire off
it's going to be play sound okay so
here's your little play function so
function play sound is a mouse event
function and it happens when anybody
clicks on that play button some side of
the function we have an if condition
statement to evaluate whether or not is
playing is true or false so if is
playing is equal to false then and only
then do we start up the channel sound to
play and pretty much I took everything
all these lines right here the
five lines of the same exact five lines
that are in this if evaluation that we
just put in a minute ago they were
saying if autoplay is equal to true we
start up the sound and add the listeners
we need so I just did the same thing
here if somebody hits the play button if
you have it programmed to where autoplay
is false so let's see what happens press
control enter hit the play button and
you'll notice that it bite into play
button again it doesn't start up again
that's a common problem when people of
programming sound so within that play
function you say if is playing is equal
to false then and only then you start up
a sound to play because if it's playing
is equal to true you start up the sound
again you're going to have a problem
because you'll have two sounds playing
on top of each other alright so now
let's see if this player works the way
we intended to so right now we have it
set to auto play false that means when
we control enter it shouldn't autoplay
and we have to click the play button to
start it up and that's what we have so
if we change this to true everything
should remain cool and all the coach
still work but the sound will autoplay
because now our autoplay boolean
variable set to true and our player is
sensing whether or not that is set to
true or not so there you go if I click
this thing happens is playing is set to
true that very important is playing
boolean variable alright so I think in
the next lesson will show how to create
the ever popular play pause toggle
button that way when you hit this play
button if a sound is playing and I was
to hit this play button I want this to
change to a pause
so if that changes to a pause symbol the
sound is paused then when I hit it again
the sound resumes that's the kind of
button will show you how to make in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
