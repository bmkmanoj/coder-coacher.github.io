you how to add some bling bling to your
Christmas gift bow by applying some
decorative gold trim to the ribbon and
adding some shiny bling to that so you
can go from ordinary to extraordinary
first we'll take the bow that we left
off with in the last lesson I'll just
move it off to the side press ctrl-c
ctrl-v but the new copy over here and
actually before I even start messing
with it I'm gonna put a rectangle
background behind it something like that
that way it looks more like a forest
green or a Christmas green as opposed to
a neon green now i'll highlight that and
hold ctrl shift and press down arrow key
i'm going to highlight my bow and press
control shift g to ungroup it all for
this top object has five shape so ctrl
shift g to ungroup those as well and i
want to delete this one control X and
this control X and I also want to delete
this control X because when we add the
trim we're just going to do it on these
two sides and then we can just copy it
and flip it that way we can save
ourselves a little bit of work now let's
select this piece of ribbon and zoom in
on it by holding ctrl and Mouse wheeling
you zoom in on it just a little bit to
get it a little closer that way you can
see the contour better we're gonna grab
our pen tool now you don't have to have
anything selected grab the pen tool I'm
gonna start right about here and what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna try and follow
the contour so I'll click down I'll let
go if i zoom out a little I can see the
contour a little bit
click down hold and drag until you get
the contour about matched up and then
you can complete your shape by going
down to the bottom here right to the
very edge click down hold and drag and
curve that one until the contour meets
up a little bit with that last taper
something like that now you can just
press control D to deselect everything
now just hit your regular pointer tool I
like this the new line that you just
made press ctrl-c ctrl-v and move it
over just a few taps with your arrow
keys now with one of those selected I'll
hit my pen tool and let's go up to the
top I'll click down right here and then
I'm going to click right here on this
point you see how I connected it and
then at the bottom all I have to do is
click down right here and then click
right here and I'll make a shape and I
can give that shape a yellow or gold
fill I'll give mine a nice gold color
like C something like that looks good to
me okay and take that white edge off now
with a little bit that's coming down
here that's easy to chop off all you
have to do is grab your pen tool and
draw a shape that's going to cut that
line right where you want it say right
about there
then just make the shape go all the way
around and then highlight those two
items modify combine paths and punch now
let's zoom in on it a little bit and
what we'll do is maybe we'll darken it
up just a little bit make it a little
bit darker and then we'll go and give it
green texture you can give it any kind
of texture that you want through here
but I'm gonna give it grain 100% that
way it looks like flecked gold actually
you can go and make that color part of
your custom color so add two custom
colors if you want to save that gold
color
okay all right so I'll show you how to
do one more of these and then you can do
the rest on your own following all the
curves appropriately to add trim where
needed so I'll just select this item
here and zoom in by holding ctrl and
Mouse wheeling in like that then I'll
select this item that way I have the
yellow in my bill and then I'll deselect
everything ctrl D and then I'll hit my
pen tool you see I have the yellow pill
alright now I'm going to start right
here and I'll do the outside edge of the
trim click down let go and then you go
somewhere around the top area where it
starts to curve down all right about
there click down hold and drag until
your line meets the contour and then
tapers off towards the edge then you can
let go then you're going to click down
right here and you're going to go down
just a little bit further maybe right
about there click down and let go and
then you want to go right about here
with your mouse click down hold and drag
until your contour kind of matches up
with the other one and you can click
down here let go click down there and
then your shape will give itself that
yellow fill and you'll already have the
texture grain of 100% on there and you
can just take this piece highlight this
piece and ctrl shift up arrow key to
bring it back to front and then you can
zoom out and see what you have all you
have to do is make one now going right
here matching this contour and then one
going down right here matching this
contour now once you have all of those
in place you can just take the one that
you put there press ctrl-c ctrl-v make a
copy of that place it on the other side
now let's highlight these five objects
or these four objects rather one two
three four by holding shift as we select
them press ctrl-g and now that is a
group what I'm gonna do is go to filters
shadow and glow and give it an inner
shadow coming from the in from the left
so to be zero
so you really want that to be on zero so
you can just set that to zero hit enter
and we'll bring that inner shadow in
we'll fade it in a little bit I would
set the distance a little higher maybe
not so high right about there now make
sure I still have that item selected
press ctrl-c ctrl-v and then go to my
scale tool and I'm going to scale down
just a little bit from the corner here
and a little bit this way and then I'll
grab that one to make sure it's still
within this piece it looks like it's
within this piece good and I'm also
going to turn it a little bit let's go
ahead and turn it rotate it just a tad
bit something like that and then just
make sure it looks like it fits back in
here well bring it down right about
there and if you want to adjust any of
these pieces say for instance you want
to hit the sub selection tool and grab
just this piece and this piece by
holding select you can adjust their
colors so if I wanted to make them
darker for instance on the bottom there
I could just make this color a little
bit darker like that but they'll still
be in groups when you hit there when you
hit them with the regular pointer tool
you'll see it's still a group and you
can't adjust it that way but if you hit
the sub selection tool you can adjust
anything within any group now if you
want for added effect you can take this
one highlight the little one little loop
that you have on top now and go to drop
shadow and make the drop shadow go in
the direction on top of the other loop
that's behind it you can drop it way
down in there like that bring the
opacity down so something like that and
it'll give you just a little bit more
depth and shadows on everything okay
that's pretty much it besides the bling
so we'll highlight this and the one
behind it and actually let's go ahead
and group these first I like this this
trim and then the ribbon piece so you'll
have three objects selected press ctrl-g
now you'll have this thing grouped so
let's highlight that this piece and this
piece so you have three pieces control C
control V and flip them horizontally and
then just use your arrow key to bring
them over to the other side where they
need to live
okay now let's group some stuff so let's
grab while holding shift I'm going to
select this one this one this
centerpiece its trim on both sides and
this one and this one so I have seven
objects there that I'm going to ctrl G
and put them into a group you see
they're all one group now and I'm gonna
go ahead and take the let's go into
these and ungroup them ctrl shift G and
this one to ctrl shift G because I want
to take the shadow drop shadow off with
these two items there now I can group
these independently again ctrl G ctrl G
now what I'll do is just highlight all
three of these things and give them the
same drop shadow and make it go to 70 so
it's going down to the bottom or really
you can drop the shadow any direction
you want see now you have a nice shadow
underneath your two little ribbon tails
where they lay underneath the
centerpiece you have a little shadow
under there and that helps the effect
now all we need is the bling-bling so
let's go into our tools and we'll grab
where's that shape tools star draw your
star out and just make your star have
four points right there and then bring
yeah I'll make it the solid black so you
can see it real well take all the grain
down and then what I'll do is grab this
radius and bring it in to where it's
like something like that then the solid
fill I'm gonna make a gradient radial
and on the edge where it's black
make sure broke both edges are white and
that one
make sure the opacities all the way down
so once you have that you can press
control C control V and then go to your
scale tool and then rotate this by
holding shift to rotate it at perfect 45
degrees and then scale that one down now
you have two stars one on top of the
other right there
now I'll highlight those two together
and I'll just go to modify and flatten
it right now I can bring it off to the
side over here if I one press ctrl-c
ctrl-v make a copy and then bring it
over here and scale it down and what
I'll do is I'll try to put it on a place
on the item where it looks like this
should be shine for instance maybe right
here or right here yeah that'll be a
good spot so I'll put it right there and
then I'm going to scale it down
make sure I put it right there now just
take that little guy and pepper him
everywhere you can change his size you
can rotate him whatever and you put them
all over this thing where it looks like
there should be little glint effects or
glittery effects from where the speckled
gold trim would be shining
okay there it is with all little stars
placed around on it to make it look like
it has some bling-bling now this is the
ordinary one that we did in the first
tutorial and this is the one that we
made extraordinary I hope you've enjoyed
this Christmas design exercise and I'll
talk to you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
