ActionScript 3 tutorial I'm showing you
the simplest and most efficient way to
generate a solid random number
let's press control enter and I have
mine set to be 1 through 10 actually
let's press f12 get it out to the
browser you can see it has a 1 now we
refresh in the browser
every time we refresh it'll give us a
random number that's between 1 and 10
all with one line of code click new
ActionScript 3 file and I'm working in
cs3 so whether you're working in cs3 or
cs4 ActionScript 3 file that's work for
you ok easy so first thing I'll do is
grab a status text field and pop that on
stage and type in Adams random number
generator
and I use one line of code
there we go now let's grab another one
put it on stage put some values in it so
this is static stasis changes to dynamic
text they get a little larger this is
where a random number is going to
display multi-line know we want single
line not selectable give it an instance
name of status underscore txt just to
display the value that we derive from
that one line of code which is going to
give us a random number okay so let's
get rid of that value let's make this
center-aligned beautiful okay now let's
pop in the code let's make a new layer
create a new layer by pressing the
insert layer button name that as3 let's
work with the ActionScript now let's
type in VAR r and num it's gonna be the
variable variable name the value that we
derived this is gonna be a number
variable and it's going to be equal to
let's just make it equal to math that
random just to show you how that works
and then we'll tweak it out to where it
displays correctly and you'll see what I
mean mapped out random there's the math
dot random function okay so let's press
control enter and it's going to put a
value
into that text field no it's not because
we have to type in status underscore txt
dot text is equal to let's put an empty
string value and then plus this variable
name now let's press control enter
you'll see it gives you a number with
the decimal it's a floating number it's
not good you want a solid number that's
rounded so what we'll do here let's type
in math right around that math dot war
and then put that in between parentheses
the whole thing well you did math that
random you put that in between
parentheses so in between the
parentheses for the math dot floor
function we have the math dot random
function now let's press control enter
you see that and give us a random number
but that random number is still a very
low floating-point number so we have to
multiply by ten so let's put the
multiplication symbol so if I want a one
to ten random number I put a 10 here now
let's go ahead and press control enter
and you'll see that you will get a zero
eventually let's see
keep pressing control enter and your
random number that comes up from one to
ten you're gonna get a zero in there
eventually and that's not good because
you want only from one to ten let's see
if I can make a zero occur here come on
give me a random zero there should be a
zero and
here I tell you what if you really want
to check you can just use a for loop
right here
to pop the for-loop right on top or
surrounding where that variable is being
rendered and we're gonna make it at
50/50 loop it's gonna happen 50 times
this loop is going to happen it's going
to iterate 50 times so we're gonna trace
the output I'm gonna show you that the
zeros in there we got to get rid of them
for now let's just no we can leave that
like it is
press ctrl enter you see all these
numbers here these are all the 50
occurrences that happened gave us a
random number in between 1 and 10 but
you see that zero in there right
that's not good so if we do it again
you'll see that there are more zeros see
there's a couple of zeros down here you
see those and that's not cool and if you
really want it accurate all you have to
do to make sure there's no zeros and
it'll be solidly 1 through 10 every time
you just put +1 and it will have an
index now press control enter
of 1 1 through 10 every time there will
never be any zeros in there now so now
it's a more solid accurate way to get
any random number you want and let's see
if you want it to be a random number
between 1 and 1000 you just put in
thousand right there see it gives you
random numbers between 1 and a thousand
so that's how it works it's very easy to
do and just one line of code does it let
me get rid of that for loop we don't
need it anymore and there we go so now
I'm generating a random number in
between 1 through 10 no problem let's
press f12 to render the file out to the
browser and there
now you can keep pressing refresh you'll
see it gives you a random number between
1 to 10 every time okay so that's the
simplest way to create a nice solid
random number in flash and it's really
just this one line the second line is
just showing us the value in this
dynamic text available on stage okay
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
