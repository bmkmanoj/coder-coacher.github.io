today I'll be sharing with you some more
Swift 3d workflow because Swift 3d is a
great affordable tool for graphic
designers who enjoy 3d modeling and
animation without breaking the bank now
for today's exercise I've chosen
shanky 9/8 logo who's a member of
develop PHP comm and he's given me full
permission to use his logo in this video
as long as I give him the finished
product of what I create the rendered 3d
animation that will be an SWF file that
he can then throw onto webpages or do
whatever with and I chose this logo
because it has very distinct shaping and
there's another shape set inside of the
first shape so I thought this would be a
really good one to use okay here we are
back in Swift 3d now to get started
we're going to go into the extrusion
editor and once in the extrusion editor
I'm going to go to view background image
and I'm going to grab the image that I
saved that is his logo the 2d version
this is on my desktop somewhere here
there it is
I'm going to bring it in you can see
it's sitting right there on my grid I'm
going to bring the opacity down just a
little bit right about there it looks
good we don't want the opacity up too
high so we can see the lines that were
drawing out as we create them let's
press okay and now we can start making
our lines now I'm going to use the
tangent point now whatever method you
think is best and quickest for you you
can use the curve point you could use
corner points but I'm just going to use
tangent point for each point that I make
as I go ahead and trace his logo out so
I'm going to start right here I'm going
to put a point right here I'll put a
point right about here then I'll put a
point right about
there then one right there then one
right here then one right there then one
at the very tippy top then one about
midway on the left side then one at the
very bottom Center then one to close it
all up and while creating your points
they don't really have to be very
precisely placed at first because at any
time you can move them so if you go to
the pointer tool here the shape tool
you'll see if I highlight this point and
I use my arrow keys I can move it around
put it anywhere I want okay so if you
didn't put a point in the perfect spot
don't worry about it and all of these
tangents can also be manipulated so
let's start right here at this point and
what we'll do is move it's just like the
pen tool that you're used to in
Photoshop Illustrator or fireworks
whatever Adobe software are you working
or actually any software that has a pen
tool so you just want to get all your
curves just right manipulating the
tangents tangent points here I said
change it okay so let's just keep
manipulating these around as we go let's
get this one a curve in come down a bit
and it's very easy
nothing hard here now let's move this
down a little get that out of the way
pull down so we can see the bottom real
good get to that tangent point
manipulation okay right about there
let's click on that one for this to make
a sharp edge we're just gonna pull the
tangent in like that you'll see it's a
better nice
this one we're going to curve it just a
bit
okay so I'm gonna continue going all the
way around curving my points as they go
to get the exact a shape but that I need
sort of just like tracing it basically
nothing difficult
let's get that one nice and sharp let's
get this one a little bit sharp on the
edge so let's bring that up to where it
meets that edge there excelente now all
we have to do is get this one rounded
and by lapping bottom now you can step
back take a look at what you've got now
and at any point at any time these
points can be manipulated so if we go
into the scene editor you'll see we have
our shape there there's a couple of
points that I want to fix up so I'm
gonna fine-tune my points just a little
bit in the extrusion editor okay I'm
happy with that now on the bevels I'm
going to give it an outer rounded bevel
but I want to make sure it's not so
puffed out like that so I'm gonna give
this point zero zero eight that looks
pretty good to me smooth all the way up
mesh quality all the way up now we can
go into our preview and export actually
let's go ahead and slap a reflective
material on it let's put that there and
the inside let's also give it the same
actually I have too many lights here
let's get rid of that one by default
you'll just have those two lights and on
the bevel I'm also gonna give it the
same color or maybe even a darker color
in the bevel let's see how that looks
now let's go to preview an export raster
generate the selected frame so you can
see how that logo is really coming to
life now let's go back into the scene
editor and let's go to scale because I
don't want it so thick and I'm sure
shanky wouldn't want it so thick either
so let's go to the z factor and press
down and that arrow key you'll see it in
your left view pane by the way you can
look at it from the front
the right the top whatever you want and
you can also adjust these view panes
once you're in it by holding the Alt key
you can drag that around using the left
mouse button holding alt and holding alt
using the right mouse button you can
zoom in and out on it so now we have a
little bit of a better shape there I
think it's not so thick so let's go to
preview and export faster generate
selected frame okay it's looking good so
far
and you can still manipulate these
things in the extrusion editor if you
want to get this point a little sharper
I'm going to take that bevel down just a
little bit maybe zero 0.005 preview an
export generate selected frame that's
great
I'm even going to put that darker color
on the bevel preview an export let's
check it out
betting eyes are not on the bevel I
meant on the inner edge you can use this
view pain if you need to just slap stuff
on it like that so if you can't really
see the edge that you want to apply
material on then you can use a different
view so you want to get at it from the
right at the top you can do that now
you'll see that jenkees logo has that
inner shape that kind of greenish gold
inner shape there so all we have to do
for that is deselect the item go back to
the extrusion editor bring in that model
or that image once again so we can trace
the inner shape this time and we're
going to be using the same technique
that's okay
now let's just grab our tool for our
tangent point here point there put a
point there put a point there
and then a point there I'm going to do
the same thing and manipulate those
points okay so I've manipulated those
points now if we go into the scene
editor you'll see we have another object
where it should be right with that other
object and this one is let's go to the
scale this one is Z factor 0.15 so now
let's make this one point one seven
and now you'll see that it shows on both
sides it should show on both sides let's
look at the back yep so it's showing
through on both now let's go to the
reflective materials once again and
let's get that color and if you can't
find the exact color in the materials
here you can click on the item in the
view pane go to material and put any
color that you need to so we'll just
leave it like it is and let's go to
preview and export check out what we
have generate selected frames aha so you
can see it's coming to life
okay now let's highlight both items you
can highlight one and then hold shift
and grab the other one and they'll both
be selected or you can just press ctrl-a
in that scene in the view pane and it'll
select everything now let's go to
arrange group now with this being a
group of those two items now let's go to
animations and let's just give it a
regular horizontal spin you can check
out all the spins you get there but I'm
just going to use a regular horizontal
spin press play
alright that's really beautiful I'm
gonna go to let's go back to frame 1 and
I'm going to select animate and I'm
going to take this and drag it out to
maybe 30 frames just so it's just
smoother animation and a little bit
slower actually I'm going to go a few
more frames maybe out to 36 or something
like that click animate again to toggle
the animation mode off now let's go to
preview an export raster generate all
frames
okay so once all the frames are rendered
in you press play and you can see what
it's actually going to look like that's
smooth as butter baby doesn't get any
easier or cooler than that now you can
go to Target file type and any target
file type you want let's go to Flash
Player SWF adjust the quality of the
bitmap compression you can leave it how
it is by default it'll look okay I'm
going to put mine all the way up I'm
going to export all frames to my desktop
let's call it shanky SWF save let's
minimize this now I'm going to open
flash I'm going to go to create new
flash ActionScript 3 file or
ActionScript to a file whatever you
prefer working in and I'm going to file
import to library at SWF
so flash is now loading that into the
library so let me go open the library
you can see all the bitmaps that make up
that animation let's drag the full movie
clip you see I scroll down in my library
to the full movie clip and now let's
press control enter and there you have
it you can even make the scene black if
you want let's go to the background make
it black let's give this thing a glow
effect let's go to filter add glow
whatever color you want let's grab that
goldish color that he has there bring
the strength up on it let's make it
medium give it more of a blur whatever
you want to do
so there you have it
okay so I hope you've enjoyed this
little lesson in Swift 3d on how to make
custom things using the extrusion editor
to get just the logo shapes and design
shapes that you need and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
