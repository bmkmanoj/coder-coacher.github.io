here with another tutorial series and in
this lesson which is going to be very
in-depth and I'm going to go really slow
that way beginners can hang with us is
we're going to do raw data management
systems from scratch which are the
equivalent to content management systems
which a lot of us already know what they
are there are systems that you can
create or you can download template
systems and use to give to clients or
use for yourself to have a dynamic PHP
MySQL website that's what Joomla and
WordPress both are or dynamic PHP MySQL
websites and what they do is they store
data all the data of the site
essentially is stored in a MySQL
database and PHP interacts with that
MySQL database to render all the pages
and the menus themselves the a lot of
those templates have CSS menus or
JavaScript based menus that populate on
the left and right sides and columns and
those menus are all dynamic they're not
a statically coded into a template
somewhere they're coming out of the
database as well according to what data
is in it so that's what we're going to
show you how to do and will take you all
the way through starting the system from
scratch building the MySQL database and
going all the way to basically the point
to where you can hand it over to a
client I might not show everything I
might change my mind on what to show
throughout the series but you'll just
have to you know check out what the
finished product is and see if you'd
like to learn something like that and
it's not going to be as many steps to
this series as it was at web intersect
which is like 30 videos this will be
much shorter and I'm going to be working
in PHP myadmin a lot basically for
building the whole series or building
the whole system in the web intersex
series I showed you guys how to write
scripts that make your tables and
database that modify your tables
database but in this one we're going to
work straight in PHP myadmin
which a lot of beginners enjoy working
with and it shows you a lot of what's
going on behind the scenes with the
programming so they can get their their
objectives completed and learn at the
same time using PHP myadmin and I'll
show you how that works
okay let's touch on a few things before
we get started so we really have a good
understanding of what we're going to
build here and what it can do for us as
web developers and website owners first
thing is your earning potential is much
higher or has the potential to be much
higher if you're keen and the clients
are much happier with the unique
powerful site so let me show you an
example this is an all flash website and
I just wanted to show this as an example
because the guys who who can hack a
Joomla and WordPress real well the
designs and put in any kind of templates
to look like whatever they want they
cannot do this they cannot do this
unless they have custom coding knowledge
my client he puts in his own journal
entries his gallery is dynamically
rendered all his images he's an artist
and all of his image is a dynamically
rendered so and the gallery is dynamic
flash gallery and it's packed into a
full flash website you can't guys guys
who modified Joomla and and wordpress
templates cannot do this I don't care
what they say they're just they're not
good enough if you have custom coding
knowledge and you built it from scratch
then you are good enough and you do know
how to do stuff like that and there's
also a this guestbook I have in flash at
flash building and I'm not saying this
system is only good for putting data
into flash I'm just trying to show the
diversity of it you're not locked in is
what I'm just trying to say you know I'm
not trying to knock any
systems God knows Joomla and WordPress
sir magnificent and powerful and a lot
of people have made a lot of money using
them and benefited a lot but what I'm
saying is there's no design boundaries
there's no data feed boundaries there's
no boundaries whatsoever that's all I'm
saying and that site that you showed you
should be proof enough that whole site
being dynamically rendered is amazing
and MySQL driven that's crazy it's all
flash and that's got Clarke vision com
if you want to check that site out
Scott Clarke vision comm and this one is
my site flash building and a lot of
people ask me how I built my guestbook
a lot of people want to know how I built
this guestbook here that's all dynamic
and it updates without refreshing the
page right when you type it in it goes
up and it updates right away and you'll
see it right away and a lot of people
want to know how to make that I've got
all kind of comments in there and if you
like go and leave me a nice comment
especially if you enjoy the work we do
leave me a nice comment there so so I
can have a nice good stack of comments
anyhow let me show that let's go back to
what we're talking about but that just
shows you another example of the
creative freedom that you can have when
dealing with your your own custom built
system but it can all be HTML and CSS
get flash right out of your head you
don't this actually this whole system
you don't need any Adobe tools
whatsoever it can be done in notepad
because I'm going to be showing you the
code basically I'll be in Dreamweaver
cs4 and you can just follow along if you
have Dreamweaver cs4 but if you happen
to not have any Adobe software you'll be
just fine you can use WordPad or notepad
no problem because I'm going to show all
the code and I'm going to give the code
away at the end okay so let's move on to
adding flash elements we talked about
easily break away from the WordPress and
Joomla design we talked about now the
design tweaks and updates take minutes
on hundreds of pages so say your site
gets up to indexing to where it has 200
pages where a developed PHP we have way
over 200 pages
what you do is you use templates I'm
going to show you how to use templates
effectively to make the design updating
and changes in certain things a whole
lot easier so on hundreds of pages
instead of taking days to update things
it just takes minutes to update a couple
of template files and then you're done
now number five is suited for people
this system is suited for people that
enjoy creating their websites from
scratch if you enjoy just going from
getting some free software this is not
for you this is it's going to be a
bare-bones kit you understand me so you
have to want to get your hands dirty you
got to want to learn you got to want to
grow and make it a powerful system I'm
going to give you the bare bones okay
and so this is really suited for people
that enjoy creating the websites from
scratch like me I enjoy creating full
flash websites for clients and making
them dynamic is nobody can do this yet
that's why I'm such a valuable little
dude is because I have the power to give
any kind of website and it all be MySQL
driven not many developers can do this
yet after this tutorial series I'm
blowing the lid right off of it all kind
of developers are going to know how to
do this and it's going to be a lot nicer
for everybody alrighty number six is the
system is ideal for e-commerce or deep
data indexing systems on or off the web
I had a buddy of mine who was creating a
plant indexing system where he was they
were indexing him and his company were
indexing all of the plant life on earth
I believe all the Latin names all the
little bits of information about each
plant on earth I think they were
assembling that system and he was using
Joomla I think it was and he he just
wanted a little more creative freedom so
it's it's ideal for that type of
situation where you need deep data
indexing whether it be on the web or off
the web if it's off the web you have to
set up a local environment to run PHP
and MySQL and
but I recommend just doing it right on
the web because on hosting systems you
know it all set up MySQL and PHP is all
set up ready to go and Apache Linux all
that so it's ideal for deep data
indexing systems or just regular
websites because let's face it folks you
got to have a lot of pages nowadays to
even get seen and get up there in the
search engines not many five page
websites really jump out and and rise to
the top not many at all you've got to
have a dynamic system going
okay so ecommerce is also this type of
system makes ecommerce a breeze because
once you learn button programming for
whatever gateway payment gateway you
work with then it's a breeze making all
the pages and the putting the Cart
buttons in add to the Buy Now buttons in
whatever kind of buttons you need and
all the pages can be rendered out and
all the items can be catalogued rather
in a table so you make a special table
call it items catalog and each item goes
in and gets its Product ID blah blah
blah blah and then you just work on
rendering all that data out make
pagination you know pagination is very
important for systems like this okay so
here we're going into what will we need
what we will need is like I said before
no Adobe tools required but may be
preferred I'm going to work with
Dreamweaver cs4 throughout the series
because I like the the HTML syntax
highlighting code help and all that good
junk and if you have just notepad or
WordPad you'll be just fine too because
all the code will be available and we're
not going to really do too much in
design mode and Dreamweaver anyway it's
all going to be in the code view okay so
number two here is what and what we'll
need really number one is basic HTML CSS
PHP and MySQL knowledge I'm sorry I
skipped over that but that's very
important
we'll need at least basic level all four
of those technologies HTML CSS PHP and
MySQL if you don't have any PHP and
MySQL knowledge you can still hang with
this trust me but having some HTML and
CSS knowledge is kind of essential not a
whole lot just a little bit and an HTML
text editor which like was I saying
before which is Dreamweaver for me in my
case and in your case could be WordPad
or notepad or Dreamweaver or whatever
you have if you work on a Mac if they
have different text editors whatever
okay
so number two is an online server that
processes PHP and is MySQL ready
equipped with PHP myadmin we're going to
be working with PHP myadmin
almost exclusively when we're going to
be interacting with our database except
for when it comes time to render the
data out but feeding the data in we're
going to be using and building the
tables and assembling the structure of
the database we're going to use PHP
myadmin
which comes on any hosts or really any
professional host that offers MySQL
databases that is MySQL ready we'll have
PHP myadmin already installed for you
ready to go all you have to do is create
your MySQL database and then PHP myadmin
is there in your hosting control panel
and you can go right to it then you just
save that page favorite it and get to it
easily that way and I recommend an
online server rather than trying to set
up lamp lamp or zamp
forget all that ok if you do and you've
never set that up before if you have it
running already use it but if you never
set that up before don't even try it go
online get find yourself ten dollars in
the couch go buy a calm and put free
hosting on it so all you spend is ten
dollars you got a year to play around
ten dollars you can afford that and then
you have a year to play around with a
PHP enabled server that is my sq already
equipped with PHP my
Minn okay I know GoDaddy does it you can
just buy the dot-com and then put the
free hosting on it which GoDaddy will
offer you you put the free hosting on
and then it's PHP and MySQL ready okay
number three you'll need good FTP
software that has folder creation and
file file permissions control which is
Jamaat or file permissions same thing
and I recommend FileZilla because I like
the way FileZilla handles FTP and you
can use whatever you want though but as
long as you can get to manipulate file
permissions and things like that it
might not even be necessary maybe you
can just use Dreamweaver or whatever you
see how far you get you get stuck use
FTP like FileZilla okay number four is
you'll need a free
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor
WYSIWYG editor and preferably JavaScript
based and not not in any flash ones just
yet you'll you'll want a free JavaScript
based WYSIWYG text editor and that is
what you use to for yourself or for your
client to easily assemble the page or
edit the page and that's how it works
that's how Joomla and WordPress work
they just use a nice WYSIWYG editor and
they render out the - cue love data if
it's a page you're editing that already
exists the data comes out into the
WYSIWYG and then you edit it move things
around if it's a page you're just
creating for the first time you're going
to see the WYSIWYG with a blank canvas
and then you just go to town creating
your page press Enter boom page is done
okay so you'll need a free WYSIWYG
JavaScript base text editor and those
are is plenty of them all over the web
three don't buy one I'll slap you okay
so number five is listen very closely to
instructions on the video series that
I'm going to be creating to avoid having
to ask many questions later I mean if
you pay attention better you pay
attention the less you'll have to ask
I'm going to cover basically everything
I'm not going to leave anything out and
if you have trouble doing certain things
that it seems like I am just doing
easily then you really have to buckle
down and experiment and say why is it so
easy for him to just do it and then I
have in trouble oh my god I just just
pay attention the best you can to avoid
many many questions that you'd have to
ask people later number six is I will
supply free scripts upon tutorial
completion study them and experiment
before you ask any questions take the
code package listen to the videos watch
the videos really closely pay attention
real well before you ask any questions
in our forums or any other forms about
this this system so study the scripts if
it's pertaining to what you're talking
about go to that part of the script
study it change it around experiment do
things that just seems logical to you
for the functionality you want to change
it up or whatever okay so what if I get
stuck you can try the forms that develop
PHP and although no help guarantees in a
free form online anywhere I can tell you
right now if you go in there and you ask
a question it's a little bit too complex
and got to keep in mind there's a lot of
people just learning there is not many
super pros there most super pros are out
making money and don't have time to hang
out in the forums like I do
I don't like money anyway
but you can try the forms of develop PHP
com I might not answer I'm a very busy
guy but you can try another member look
kind of our members are all different
levels of knowledge and you can get a
lot of help from a lot of smart people
there or you can get somebody you know
maybe nobody that day or the those two
days that understand how to do what
you're asking is hanging around you know
so it might just not get noticed that's
just the way it goes
or number two you can hire me if you get
really desperate you get to the point to
where you want to kill yourself you can
hire me at 666 dollars per hour to help
you produce your system I won't ask any
questions you command me I'll be your
little programming robot okay now try
not to ask people to help build your
site for you for free
you can't come to our forums or some any
other poems' can't go and just be like I
got this great idea help me build it
freedom will take over the world
nobody ever jumps on those opportunities
you got to pay money you know so just
pay attention to the series best you can
and build it all yourself don't have to
go to any one just try to muscle through
it the best you can if you get stuck I'm
here for 666 dollars per hour or you can
try and get somebody else but I can tell
you not many guys know how to do this
stuff from scratch so this was the
introductory serie a video to this
series on creating magic - ql websites
and foundation systems
foundations for the system like
WordPress and Joomla WordPress and
Joomla much more powerful than what
we're going to be creating but this will
give you insight into how to get started
with your own systems like that to offer
your clients and have total control or
design and programming it's going to be
a wild ride so strap on your head gear
sit back and relax</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
