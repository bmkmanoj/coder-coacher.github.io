and actionscript 3 tutorial I'm going to
show you how to include external action
script into your timeline just as if you
had typed it into the timeline somebody
on our forum requested this one so I
figured I'd make an example let's see
let's go ahead and create a new folder
on a desktop and name it project let's
go ahead and open it up and fire it on
fire up flash and click action script
file now we're going to type something
in that would normally be in our
timeline so let's put bar my words colon
string equals
and double quotes we're going to type
hello world okay so now we have hello
world and double quotes and a semicolon
that's it so that's all we need to prove
that we have connection to this external
actionscript-3 file so let's go to file
save as let's go to desktop that project
Boulder we just made and we'll save this
as external file dot is actually you
don't have to type the dot is because
it's already knows it's an Aes file
it'll put the a s on it already press
save now you can close it now let's open
an actionscript refile like we would
normally where we have the timeline and
everything and let's go ahead into the
the actions panel in your actions panel
you can access your action you can
access your actions panel by pressing f9
if you highlight a keyframe one on the
timeline you press f9 open the actions
panel now let's type in include this is
just like PHP it's the only reason I
know this because all kind of PHP code
works in actionscript 3 I don't know if
you guys know that or not but that's the
reason why I'm kind of so good at
actionscript-3 I'm not real good but
that's why it's just it's it comes easy
for me because I know PHP really well so
let's say include and this will also put
in double quotes external file
external underscore file a s that's it
now that included the code into our
project now that variable that we
created of my words now to prove it to
ourselves let's display it will say my
text text1 see there's no variable in
here says my words so you'll know if it
comes in then we have connection and we
say plus in double quotes we're going to
type in space is played out there is
played out period and then after the
double quotes we can put another
semicolon and that's the end of this
application this tutorial now we're
going to test it press oh no first we
have to save this file in the same
folder save as a desktop project folder
and we're going to save this as my flash
site my flash site save it now we're
going to render out press f12
oops I'm a dummy on stage you got to put
it in a text field dynamic text field
name it my text and now let's render out
there it is hello world if we go into
our project folder going through that
external action script file hello world
is sitting right there it's not in the
flash site it's in that external file so
any kind of huge code huge blocks of
code that you would have in your
timeline here in flash can easily be
included with this one little line you
just put all that code you take it you
highlight it you cut it right out of the
timeline you put it in a new file that's
an action script file and then you
include it here and all of that code
comes right in and works just as this as
if it was sitting here itself okay
that's the end of this lesson we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
