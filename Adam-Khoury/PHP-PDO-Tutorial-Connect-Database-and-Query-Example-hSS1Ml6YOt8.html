playlist I want to quickly demonstrate
how to connect to a MySQL database and
query it for a result set using the PDO
extension in PHP and after the coding
exercise we're going to have a MySQL I
versus PDO discussion that you might
find informative the first thing we'll
do is create a variable to represent the
database handler make that equal to new
PDO object instance so we supply the
hostname for the database driver that we
want in this case it's MySQL database
and for most of you the host will be
localhost
so database host goes here and you put
the database name here in the second
parameter you put the database username
and then the third parameter you put
your database password the next line
will establish the SQL syntax now we're
going to run a for each loop that
queries the database using this SQL
syntax and returns a result set within
the loop and finally we close the
database connection to close the
database connection you just specify the
database handler variable as null make
it equal to null now a for each loop is
made to able to access all of the items
in an array so this represents an array
and each item as row so you can see here
we're referencing the database handler
and in an object-oriented approach we're
running its query function and query is
one of the functions that are open to
the PDO base class you can see that it's
not much more or less complex than using
MySQL I have your connection to the
database happens to fail the PHP manual
recommends that we use try and catch and
this is what that looks like so you try
the database connection and you can
catch PDO exception then we run the get
message function to render out the
problem
now let's run this on our PHP enabled
server
and this is the results I get from
running that script and this is exactly
what my people table looks like
now let's have a quick little PDO vs.
mysqli discussion okay I'm going to lead
you guys to this page but I'm just going
to touch on some interesting paragraphs
that you can read in the page under what
is an extension it says an extension
typically exposes an API to the
programmer to allow its facilities to be
used programmatically
however some extensions which use the
PHP extension framework do not expose an
API to the programmer the PDO mysql
driver extension for example does not
expose an API to the PHP programmer but
it provides an interface to the PDO
layer above it I'll scroll down a little
bit more and here it says MySQL I
extension sometimes known as the MySQL
improved extension was developed to take
advantage of new features found in MySQL
systems
version 4.1 point 3 and newer the MySQL
eye extension has a number of benefits
object oriented interface support for
prepared statements support for multiple
statements support for transactions
enhanced debugging capabilities and
embedded server support now if we scroll
down a little bit more it discusses what
PDO is and it this paragraph here is
very interesting it says while PDO has
its advantages such as clean simple
portable API its main disadvantage is
that it doesn't allow you to use all of
the advanced features that are available
in the latest versions of MySQL server
that's a very interesting paragraph and
so that should tell you right there that
it limits what you can do but PDO does
have its advantages which are it's a
clean simple to use portable API that
you can have in place within your
programs and just change out the MySQL I
driver for another type of database
driver or things like that
but it doesn't in any way make you more
capable it actually limits what you can
do ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
