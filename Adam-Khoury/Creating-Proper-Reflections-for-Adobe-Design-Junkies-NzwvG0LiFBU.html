this lesson we're showing you how to
create proper reflections because we
notice so many people make improper
reflections hello everybody Adam a flash
building here with another quick
fireworks cs4 tip role of you adobe
design junkies and I notice a lot of
people many of you guys may know about
this technique but a lot of you guys
don't because I see it a lot all over
the web improper improperly made
reflections so let's drag out a
rectangle there let's go down to
gradient let's give it a linear gradient
and it's go ahead make this maybe
that grey this could be black then let's
make this
and bring this so all you got to do is
really click anywhere here and it adds a
new color point and then you bring them
together and you can make like a solid
line something like that you can get it
really tight there you go now so say you
had something like that and you had your
logo let's make it all caps fresh
building and it was bring up the pixel
or the font size and you can make it any
font you want that you have it like
might look funky let's see what's funky
no no it was funky no I don't like the
way that one comes down there
and that's good enough okay so hobo STD
all right so say you have your logo and
you want to make a proper reflection
this is what I see a lot of people doing
ctrl-c ctrl-v then they flip it upside
down and then they don't go through very
much trouble at all they just bring down
the opacity I see a lot of people doing
that and that that's not good that
doesn't work to make these white
so I don't care how opaque you make it
it doesn't look true okay so bring it
all the way back up and instead of
bringing the opacity down just go up to
commands creative auto vector mask and
this is the proper way that way whatever
kind of background you're on you just
press apply you pick the the type of
gradient you want to apply to it and you
press apply I'm going to apply this
linear now let's just transform that put
that here and let's bring this one
around to where it makes a proper
reflection now we're going to adjust
this dot let's grab it let's bring it up
up up up to about right there let's
bring this down some more and bring this
up up up now that's how you make a
reflection so whether or not you had a
gradient like that gray surface looking
thing I have there it doesn't matter see
even if I have it all up in black up
here it still looks good whoa just
disappeared
ah i move the gradient
double click get the gradient back down
where it should be my job see so whether
you have it here or there makes no
difference whether it's on a background
the surface okay it looks more true so
use the auto vector mask is very easy it
makes a very nice effect okay see you
next listing goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
