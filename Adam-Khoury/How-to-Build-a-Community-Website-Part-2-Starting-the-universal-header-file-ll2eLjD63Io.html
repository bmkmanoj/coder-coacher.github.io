dynamic community member based website
created by flash building and presented
by develop PHP calm and the last video
we stopped off at number 4 here I do
believe where we created the members
table and we added the appropriate
fields to it and if we have to add any
fields to it later on to that specific
table we can do that no problem and if I
run it into that scenario you'll see how
I do it and but you can do it from
inside of PHP my admin or you can write
a little script to add any time the type
of field that you want to the table it
exists already okay so now we're going
to create the universal site header file
the footer file and any main menus
needed right now I'm not sure what kind
of main menus I'm going to need because
the site is still kind of in development
phase and i'm not sure where i'm going
to have things what exactly is going to
be in the menus itself so i'm going to
worry about the header in the footer
first here and i'm going to build a
flash header and some people might
disagree with that but i'm going to use
a flash header in cs3 flash cs3
professional and click actionscript-3 if
you want to follow my code examples will
have to script it in actionscript 3 but
you can scriptures in ActionScript 2
i've done it before in ActionScript too
and it works just as well so what I'm
going to do is create a header file
that's going to be a really smart kind
of template file that will be living on
every single page of my sight and the
the header file itself will check to see
whether or not users are logged in to
give them a different display a little
different menu items display will have
them buttons to where they can click to
edit their profile and see all the juicy
little things that they can manipulate
in their account and people who are not
logged in would see a different sort of
configuration in the header just like
YouTube does it but YouTube uses an HTML
header CSS and they use scripts like
like I'm
to check to see if the users logged in
to render the header differently or not
but I don't think they use a flash
header but that's what we're going to
use and a lot of people disagree but
don't listen to them they're really
stupid they're stuck on their ajax in
JavaScript and they have no open minds
for what the future brings to the web
for the web through people like me and
others who are really in love with flash
and everything actionscript-3 can do
regarding dynamic web applications so
I'm going to make my site 950 wide and
the header file itself just wants to be
150 maybe less than that maybe 100 let's
see how big that is and let's make it 24
let's just make it 30 frames per second
in case we put any animations in it so
they look nice and the background white
is fine and because my web page is going
to be white but you can set yours too
transparent if you need to let's press
ok and we have the correct size
dimensions we need for our header file
here and I might even make it a little
bit shorter so since we're doing the
design what I have here in fireworks and
you can be working in illustrator or
Photoshop whatever software you use to
make your web graphics with I happen to
use fireworks because I think it's a
more powerful tool than the others but
everybody has their preference so what I
did was I created a little logo you know
i just made a custom a big custom shape
that I want it to be for the site logo
and that's going to sit up on top so i
can take this here right into flash
that's a little group of items right now
i'm going to filter go up to adjust
color brightness contrast convert it to
bitmaps and there's probably a
conversion to bitmap option up in here
somewhere but i haven't found it yet
maybe one of you guys can tell me about
it but that's how this is how i convert
the bitmap so my images don't lose any
quality when they go into flash or my
graphics
don't do any adjustments in the
brightness and contrast for us okay and
now you have a bitmap press C ctrl C go
into flash press ctrl-v and it's going
to bring in that that bitmap as a movie
clip here current frame as movie clip
press ok and there we are there's the
start of the website anyway so we'll
stick this guy to where he's going to
look like he's coming out the top of the
browser window and have him all the way
in the edge may be right there and now
i'm going to just do a few cosmetic
things and then i'll restart the video
up and we'll continue on and i'll show
you all the cosmetic things that i put
in and if i create any movie clips i'll
show you what i did
okay so I've got the graphic elements
that I want my header file for the most
part and it looks like I've got some
space I can clear up and bottom there so
let's make it 60 that looks just about
right looks like one more pixel up so 59
so okay there now it's meeting right at
the edge that and so what I'm going to
do is make my header file and you can
create yours in this fashion as well i'm
going to create it to where when the
user if i need to have expanded items
expanded menu items if they go over one
of these main buttons and this right now
is just a rectangle primitive that I
curved the edges up on and so are these
things these two back here and I'm going
to create this make this convert to
symbol those too long ovals back there I
highlight both of them and call that
menu bar it's a movie clip it's okay
press ctrl shift down and it'll put it
on back on the bottom that whole movie
clip you can see I'm writing my main
scene here right on the first frame of
the only layer sitting there I haven't
really divvied anything out yet in two
layers or movie clips except that one
that I just did this one's already a
movie clip and this is just a rectangle
and that's going to be will probably
make that a movie clip button or maybe a
regular button symbol but we don't even
have to activate that yet until we get
our registration form mate and allow the
members to join the database is no
reason to give them a login
functionality when there's no account
for them yet so that's going to be
afterwards so right now we can save this
file as the header template so save as
let's see let's go to actually before we
do that let me stick some text on here
say web
intersect I'm just going to use nice
standard arial font because i'm a dork
like that ok so that's black just one
white it's a little big so let's make it
about eight
there we go web make this one same size
intersect
if they're insane
it works for me okay now we can save a
file save as let's give this one a glow
nice white bright white glow
get this one a nice dark green glow
there we go okay now file save as I'm
going to get to that Desktop folder
where we have our website web intersect
in the root directory you just put it
right there in the main root directory
so name the file header save it press
f12 publish it renders out an HTML file
go get the HTML file now we have our
index and our header this header file is
going to become the index file so we're
going to edit this with dreamweaver 8
now i'm going to take the actually i'm
going to cheat a little bit and i'm
going to test it in all browsers see if
it works i'm going to go to the design
mode with that header file that was just
rendered out and i'm going to select
that object highlight it press ctrl c
then i'm going to go to file open let's
open the index page now now all we have
to do let's go let's get rid of this
well actually let's get rid of all this
we already went through the beginning
steps
press ctrl-v pops it in go ahead where
we can get to the alignment click next
to it here align center so now it's
centered now go into a code view you can
see that it just popped the object tag
in and the embed tag and that's a cheat
and a hack and lots of people going to
yell but I'm going to prove it to you
right now in Safari Firefox and Internet
Explorer that you all for the crap okay
well not that you're full of crap but
i'm just going to show you that it works
you don't have to do anything special i
mean all modern browsers you got like
point 0 0 2 percent of people that won't
be able to see your site whoopty
freaking do ok
okay now so let's see how our home page
would look in the browser on the web in
all major browsers and so we can shut
people up that insist that object and
embed tags must be wrapped in JavaScript
I think if somebody doesn't have flash
in their browser installed in their
browser on the web they were only seeing
like ten percent of the web nowadays nah
maybe more than that but maybe fifty
percent but there's a lot of flash
elements on a lot of websites you'd be
missing a whole lot of the web you can't
watch youtube videos come on you need
flash player installed so if somebody
doesn't have flash player installed I'm
not even going to worry about them I'm
not running the JavaScript all that mess
to check and see if they're running it
or not they can go to hell as far as I'm
concerned if you want to leave the
JavaScript all intact and have all that
AC John run Java that Adobe puts out for
you automatically that's fine but I'm
going to show you right now that you
don't need it okay so you go to let's
put up the index file since we changed
it let's make sure we saved it yes okay
index and make sure we just put up the
header swf with it it's that simple now
let's go look at our website let's
refresh web in a sec come today this is
google chrome we're in hey look at that
it just shows up no problem no
javascript now let's open Safari let's
grab this URL open Safari
and now bitch it's going to show no
problem no javascript no mess raw object
tags brought in bed tags look at that
there is chose and when I make buttons
everything will work once I make all of
this fancy-dancy you put the buttons and
everything begum active and let's fire
were firefox doing all this just to show
you that you can just make flash files
that will grab the file that was
rendered out by flash the HTML file open
a Dream Weaver in design view just grab
that box put it anywhere you want into
your other site files just make sure you
put the swf in the proper directory
webpornosex calm go what do you know
there it shows up near elaborative I
haven't done anything special to these
browsers I'm using Fireworks safari
Google Chrome let's try internet
explorer there it is okay there's all
four major browsers of people using
nowadays if you're using opera I'm sure
it'll work two or event that whatever
you use to browse the web the bra object
tags and embed tags should work just
fine no problems I don't think you need
all that JavaScript mess and it's a
total hack and people going to yell at
me for that but I don't care let's move
on okay now but it's going to be very
helpful and help you move faster as
you're producing all of this stuff later
on and you can always put the the check
the browser check for is open it back up
c-webb intersect you can always put the
browser check if you want but I'm not
going to add it cuz I don't feel like it
it's so easy to add in flash I even have
a tutorial about it how you add the
detect if the user has flash player
settings within your publish settings I
have a tutorial out there so I know what
I'm doing guys but I'm just hacking
bypassing the norm and doing it my way
shouldn't say hacking but it's a form of
hacking when you do something out of the
norm when you use something the way it's
not supposed to be used or whatever you
know people talk a lot of crap okay so
and web standards I could care less
about web standards everybody knows how
I feel about that see if YouTube or
Google or any billion dollar website
validates at WWDC validator or whatever
you call it see if they validate see if
any website that makes millions of
dollars online bumping and moving and
shake and see if they validate and then
you'll shut up okay so let's go to page
properties make sure the left margins is
0 right margin 0 bottom 0 and top 0
apply ok press save and now we'll be
flush at the top when we ftp the index
file watch this see how we're not flush
at the top here we got a gap let's make
it refresh Booya now it's coming right
at the top of the browser just like I
wanted it's going to be a cool menu
because when people go over with their
mouse we're going to have things come up
up here other sub selection items if we
need them otherwise it'll just be a
button and the source code for this
flash file will be available maybe my
graphics won't be in it but there'll be
similar graphics in it and the exact
code that I'll be using for my system or
the sandbox system okay so that takes
care of the header template file and the
footer template file is just going to be
an HTML simple simple HTML thing and
we're going to assemble it on the
homepage here
we'll just go into the design view is
still on the index homepage eventually
this is going to turn to index dot PHP
but for right now while we're designing
it and getting it ready it's just going
to be index dot HTML I tell you what I'm
just going to stop here we'll do a part
3 just so this thing doesn't run run too
long and we'll do a part 3 and I'll show
you the header the footer creating the
body section and the footer for the
homepage real quick that's that'll be
super easy and fast and those will also
be universal files once we chop modded
there so what I'm going to do is create
the homepage look get it the way I want
it to look in a web browser then I'm
going to dissect it and make it template
include files that we can use
universally on every page on our website
when we need to change up in this header
we want to change this graphic 22 maybe
orange for Halloween or something you
change it once for 5,000 pages they all
change at one time you don't have to
change it 5,000 times it's that silly
it's not a good way to work not when
you're doing some kind of website like
this okay so see you in part three and
we'll continue on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
