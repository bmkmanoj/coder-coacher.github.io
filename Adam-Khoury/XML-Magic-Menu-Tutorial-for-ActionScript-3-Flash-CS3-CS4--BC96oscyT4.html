I'll be demonstrating how to create an
XML magic menu and the reason why I call
it an XML magic menu is because once you
go to develop PHP and you download the
source files the XML and the Fla file
for this tutorial you'll notice that
when you open the Fla file there's
nothing onstage there's nothing in the
layer there's nothing in the library so
you're wondering how is he creating a
menu and let me render out the file
you'll see when I render out there it is
a nice menu with rollover effects and
click State so when I click any of these
buttons that one should take me to
YouTube and there it is
this one should take me to wiki
this one should take us to flash
building and so on and so forth and you
can see the XML file right y'all
there's the XML file and you can see all
the the item labels develop PHP flash
building Adam Cory wiki Google myspace
Facebook YouTube you see all those
labels on those buttons right there
we keep MySpace YouTube and then inside
the XML list is also the HTTP URL string
so you have a full URL string and an
item label and it's pretty much that
simple but the part that's not simple is
the the code that makes the magic
possible and in the top of the code
you'll see that I I laid out what you
need to import if you're gonna run this
using external scripts and just in case
you want to put this in external files
but then we set some bars for how the
menu is gonna be laid out on the stage
how far apart the buttons are gonna be
in such a few colors for the text and
then we set up the XML to be opened and
read and then once we read the XML we
run it through this XML loaded function
so once the XML is completely read by
flash we load it into this function
called XML loaded and that's where
everything happens once on XML load and
then even inside of this
XML load function XML loaded function
that's where the for each loop lives so
there's a for each loop that iterates
through all the menu items in the XML
list and that's how it renders each one
out using the same block of code so if
you had 50 items you wouldn't have to
add any more code it would do it
automatically
you just have to add code to the XML
file you'd have to add more items in the
XML file but the code set up here in
flash will suck it all up automatically
so what else down in the bottom outside
of the XML loaded function there's two
more functions one for the Mouse out and
one for the mouse over effects and a lot
of the code inside of the functions
deals with how the buttons are supposed
to look and you can change that all up
change up the colors the gradients the
the over effects so we have the over and
out effects at the bottom there and the
click effect or the click State is
actually in the the loop and you have to
do some special targeting and you'll see
how I laid that out because I can't I
comment the code out real nice you'll
see how I laid out the click State and
you can understand how using one
function this one function will work for
all six buttons
so pretty much that and the next lesson
I'll be putting up and right after this
one is going to be XML magic pages show
you how to make a menu and pretty much
basically it's a whole site through code
it's pretty cool so you can expect that
one too so see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
