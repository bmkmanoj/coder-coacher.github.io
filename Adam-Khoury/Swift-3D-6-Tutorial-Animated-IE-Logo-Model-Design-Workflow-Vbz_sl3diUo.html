and this is the finished product of what
you'll be learning how to design and
animate using Swift 3d version six and I
also discuss how to bring all these
things into flash and a few of my
previous tutorials show how to bring it
into flash so you can render it on your
web pages and I'm not a big Internet
Explorer fan or a big windows fan at all
I just chose this logo because it's
something a lot of people can identify
with
it's a logo that a lot of people have
seen so I wanted to make something real
familiar to you guys to choose to design
and watching me go through the workflow
will help you pick up some some little
techniques in Swift 3d okay the first
thing we'll do is create the circular
swoosh thing that goes around the big E
and will click on create cylinder once
that's down on the view pane we're going
to put the segmentation up to 64 axial
and 64 radial and that will increase the
polygon count inside of the mesh to give
the mesh model more detail now I'm going
to go to the lengths and start clicking
down you'll see it starts shrinking so
it's not such a tall cylinder I'm gonna
put mine on
I don't know point 0 8 now with that one
like that I can just ctrl C I'm gonna
highlight it control C control V now I
have two cylinders one right on top of
the other let's put the lengths up on
the the one on top so you see that one
has more length let's make it a
different color so we can see the
difference of what's going on there now
I'm gonna go to the top view on this one
and once I'm in top view I can position
these discs right on top of each other
because I'm going to use one as a punch
out for the other so this one I'm going
to move it's uh
let me manipulate its radius first so
you can see how its fit inside of the
other one now kind of and I'm gonna go
to position and move its x-coordinates
so right about there and now once you
see it's going to cut out a piece of the
edge and then taper the other two edges
that's exactly what you want now there's
a new feature in swift 3d version six
that the previous versions don't have
where you can make Abilene out of
objects so one object I'm gonna select
this main disc we started with first the
one that's a little wider around and I'm
gonna create boo lean with it selected
I'm gonna go up here and click create
boo lean this is gonna allow me to cut
or punch out or intersect two objects
that I want so what I'm gonna do is with
that selected still I created bullying
with it you'll see a little new dialog
comes up in the properties window
the boolean and we'll select second
operand now you have to select second
operand you click this button and you
select the other operand that you want
to work in that bullying with the first
item this big black disc click down on
that and you'll see it'll load in those
two objects as abilene and you can see
even up here in the scene properties the
objects both of those items are in that
baleen now I'm going to go to difference
a B and you can select all of all four
of these to see what it'll do for you so
what it did was it took the black
cylinder and it cut the shape right out
of that the tan cylinder there so with
that we can take that and let's go to
the scale properties of this object now
and I think it's the X Factor no it's
not the X we've gotta find the the one
where it deals with the depth how thick
it is I think it's the Y factor yep so
let's just go down on the Y factor make
nice and skinny and now we have our
Internet Explorer
swooosh thing that goes around now
highlight it and you can tumble it now
see what it looks like it's exactly what
we wanted so that's the little swoosh
that goes around the big e and it goes
it's probably sitting at about that
angle isn't it on the actual logo but
now let's get the E in there and finish
it up now this part super easy you just
go up to the text tool and create text
and now manipulate what the text is
rendering as just make it render and E
and I think Ariel is the the either they
use in the Internet Explorer font I
don't know I'm not sure but it looks
like the one to me so I'm gonna go with
that I'm gonna go to bevels I'm gonna go
to out around it or out around you see
how it made it all puffy and begging
what I want is not so puffy to where
it's not all puffed up on itself like
that so I'm gonna go to a depth instead
of 0.5 or point zero five I'm gonna go
to point zero two point zero two and see
what that gives me that's that's a
little better I like that I'm gonna get
the mesh quality all the way up and the
smoothness all the way up now all I have
to do is get it a little bit bigger
let's go to scale and let's mess around
with the properties of the scale let's
make it a little bit taller and wider I
think that's about it that's what I want
and I'm gonna tumble this just a little
more right about there now I can put
some materials on it let's go to the
materials tab here and on the swoosh we
need an orange I'm gonna put glossy
orange on this whoosh
and the big e I think I'm gonna go with
reflective no I'll just go with glossy
there's a whole bunch of different ways
you can style it up I'm gonna go with
this dark blue on all the edges the
bevel the sides and top and the back in
front faces now okay now to get it
animated all smooth and graceful I'm
going to click in this view pane and
we're off of those objects and press
ctrl-a I'm gonna go to arrange and group
so those two objects the letter E and
the swoosh are grouped together now and
I'm gonna go to position and I want to
move the pivot only I want to make sure
this pivot you see that green spot that
green dot or the pivot marker is
directly in the center of the e so I'm
gonna move not that way
I want to move this position here yeah
put it right in the middle and then
we're gonna move it up a bit let's put
it in the middle on this pane so you see
I targeted the middle here and I
targeted the middle there on the top
view to get it right in the center of
that e now I'm going to in this view
pane I'm going to select the item go to
animations and I may use just one of
these regular horizontal spins
let's go horizontal left that works any
way you want to animate it just drag it
onto it then I'm gonna go to animate
click the animating tool or the
animating icon there that way you can
manipulate the animation you can see
exactly what's going on there the
rotation is animated I'm going to
stretch that out to be more frames maybe
about 40 so mine it comes out really
really smooth and with today's web
everybody on DSL and cable it's not too
much for most people and DSL and cable
it's not too much of a burden to have a
few extra frames in there now let's go
to preview an export
faster generate all frames and there you
go the Internet Explorer logo 3d like
you've never seen it before
and these are true 3d model animations
that you can then bring into flash
you just export to file make sure you're
set as player SWF it'll render out an
SWF that you can then bring into flash
and what's really cool is that the
background that gray background you see
won't be there it'll just be the model
spinning around so you can put effects
on it and everything and also have the
the user's Mouse interact with it if you
want if you're good with setting up
timeline timeline in ActionScript a
little bit you can have the users Mouse
interact with it if needed but something
like this can just be sitting there
spinning and look friggin awesome that's
butter man okie dokie we'll see you next
