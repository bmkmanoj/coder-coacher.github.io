I need to know what you want to know
next part three here's pretty much
finishes up the base the logic of the
application gets things go
welcome to part three of creating our
flash ActionScript 3 view scroll and
click mp3 playlist player let's take a
look at where we are a project yeah
where is it there it is so in the
project we've completed part 1 and part
2 and we're going to move on to part 3
here so let's copy this folder copy and
paste let's rename it part 3 part 3
double click inside of it let's open
that flash file we'll save as part 3 ok
we're ready to roll so in that folder
part 3 we have our xml well we can get
rid of part 2 here let's get rid of that
one then we don't need that either
okay so what we left off with was in
part two this where we had our list
populated with the actual songs that are
on server but it's just not playing it
and that's we're gonna cover in part
three here so now in part three folder
we're in this flash file here that's
part three and all we have to do is talk
about the timeline a little bit what
we're gonna do is click or highlight
frame two and press f6 create a new
keyframe blank keyframe frame three
we're going to do the same thing create
a new keyframe now on frame two let's
highlight that press f9 or go to window
actions and let's type in this code now
above the code I put a little comment
that says this is where and when the
song switching takes place when a list
cell is clicked so within your list
component when any cell is clicked
actually let's extend these out now
press f5 on the list layer on frame
three it'll extend it out to live in all
three frames it will be in existence in
all three of those frames that way any
part of the code that needs to talk to
that list it won't have any problem
finding it now so let's let's look at
this code this is the song URL variable
that we established in frame one which
the application really will never go to
frame one again this is how it works
when the application enters it goes it
automatically hits frame one and
establishes all these things that we
discussed in part one and two once the
XML is loaded we're giving it a command
to go to and stop three in this timeline
so it's going to go two and really pass
right over two and not read it and go to
frame three and stop it's going to start
playing song one the one we established
to be first song remember so that's what
happens and then it never goes back to
frame one again when a new item is
clicked to play it snaps to frame two
and then goes to frame three again so
it's kind of just gonna keep snapping
between frame two and three when people
click on things or when a song ends or
what
so on frame two we're establishing a
song URL to be a switching variable of
track to play so the track to play is
established on click of the list items
and let's put that code in now and
explain that really fast it's just a few
lines not much at all so I'm frame three
we're going to highlight that go into
the actions panel there so we're done
with frame two that's it it's a
one-liner it looks into the mp3s files
folder and it has which track to play
established right there dynamically data
mp3 so that's the new song URL that the
player is gonna be set to play when it
snaps to frame three here and here's the
code okay this is the code that pretty
much will make the application operate
at a base level so it will have the song
it'll start playing song one night by
default and it will switch the songs to
play and play those new songs when any
item in the list is clicked so let's
explain the code very quickly first we
stop the application from looping so we
stop on frame three every time because
this is where the sound the song
actually plays it only snaps back to
frame two to switch the song variable
that is set to play then it goes to
frame three again very quickly and plays
that song so frame three is really where
the application lives most of the time
where the the timeline marker will be
most of the time during when people are
listening using the player on line so
the first thing we do is stop then we
set a variable for the sound object and
we set another variable for the channel
attached to that sound object and I
learned my sound programming techniques
from the flash help file in cs3 you know
you just type in sound programming and
there's a whole bunch of tutorials a
video jukebox podcast player this
podcast players where I learned most of
my stuff for sound programming in
ActionScript 3 so what I did was set the
sound object I set the channel for
the sound object and then I set the
context variable called context which is
the sound loader context object for this
sound object and what's gonna happen is
it sets a buffer of five seconds
to each song that's loading in so it'll
be a five second buffer you can change
that to ten thousand if you want a
10-second buffer and actually it's not
even a very necessary feature but it's
good to have a buffer so here on line
five we set the sound to load and we add
as parameters or arguments to that load
is song URL which is going to be a
constant changing dynamic variable and
the context which is the five-second
buffer which context like I said it's
not necessary feature but it's nice to
have on line six we set the channel to
actually play now so the sound is loaded
here now we can set the channel to play
so we set play pause position now right
here is where it actually starts playing
so the pause position is made in case we
want to add a pause button to the
application which most the mp3 players
have a pause button so that's will
probably be adding that in I'm not sure
but we're gonna set that there just in
case and the pause position variable was
established on frame 1 remember right
here
pause position number type variable set
to zero we're gonna be using that but at
the base level of this application
really doesn't even need it because
there is no pause button yet now on line
8
here is where we setting the playlist
item click listener so this list
component has an instance name of list
so we just say list that add event
listener its event and it's the change
event for the list component and the
function that's gonna fire off is called
item click and here it is 10 through 15
there there's four lines inside of it
there's four things that happen when
item click function runs let's explain
those now
okay the first line is we set the
channel which controls the sound object
to stop then we set in the status text
field actually we have to say the label
is correct for that yeah so in the
status text field we're putting now
playing a string of now playing the
event that target which is the list
component selected item you so you can
pretty much just type list right there
if you wanted but you say list dot
selected item dot label and that's
what's going to show inside of the now
playing and I might have to change that
to song string and then the next line is
track to play this one is very important
because this is switches
this helps the switching that happens on
frame to see right here track to play
right here it knows what track to play
by what cell is clicked inside of the
list component so we say event that's
argot which is equal to the list
remember list that selected item dot
song string and where did we get that
song string from the XML file that's
right remember on frame 1 right here we
add song string into the list item
through the add item function remember
we had label their song string is
sitting right here and has a value of
the song title so the player would we'll
know exactly which song we want to play
when we click on that cell in the list
finally the last line is go to and play
to so we switch the variable track to
play snap to frame - what that does is
it switches this URL request variable
and then that snaps back to frame 3 very
quickly and starts that song to play
with the song URL variable reset it's
very simple
now I've explained every line of this
pretty in-depth and you should have no
problem understanding exactly what's
going on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
