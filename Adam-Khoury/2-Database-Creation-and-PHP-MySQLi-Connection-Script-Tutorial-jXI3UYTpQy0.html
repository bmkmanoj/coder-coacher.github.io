website is going to require a stable and
efficient system for storing lots of
information and accessing all of that
store data when it needs to the
technologies we will use are MySQL for
the database system and PHP to interact
with the database the largest most used
social network running online right now
has a PHP a mysql core you will also
have those technologies at work in your
system does that make you happy hmm now
if you have a large development team
like Facebook or Google+ has grown to
have that is when you would most likely
need to invent your own frameworks for
your software otherwise if you're one
loan coder like me you can simply
modulate the functions that make sense
to make modular reusable and dynamic
object-oriented programming is no more
complex than making your functions
modular and reusable only when it makes
sense to and I will point out when it is
best it makes good sense to make a
function external and modular so you can
get a good sense of when to logically
apply object-oriented programming to
your system some people over OOP I call
it over
ooping and I'll make sure that you guys
don't over open anything
we'll only OOP the things that need open
okay
now login to the hosting provider for
your website and go to your control
panel
we're going to create the database now
scroll down till you see MySQL databases
and you might happen to be hosted at
GoDaddy or some other hosting provider
that doesn't have this style of control
panel but you can just always contact
GoDaddy and have them lead you through
the steps of how to create a MySQL
database it's no big deal it's very easy
I think four year old kids can do it
okay so we click MySQL databases and
keep in mind that nobody would normally
ever see what you're typing in here what
the credentials are via database nor the
naming conventions and things like that
so you might see some things while I'm
doing the tutorial within my system that
might cause a security consideration for
my site but you wouldn't have to worry
about those things because nobody's
going to actually see the credentials
for your stuff and I'm not going to show
you guys my passwords or anything like
that but you might see what my database
is names and things like that that's
that's no big deal now this is an
existing database that I have if you
have a brand new hosting account you
would have no databases listed in here
and you would probably have no user
MySQL users either so you would have to
create that so first you just create
your new database I'm just going to call
mine social and then click create
database and then then says added the
database let's go back you can see now I
have that world all the little
underscore social with no user attached
to it though so I'm going to if you
don't have a user for your database you
have to create that now so you put your
username there and you make your
password here then you verify your
password blab it Blair and then you
create user and then you'll be able to
do this I'm going to add user to
database right now you ready I'm going
to take that user that I created and I'm
going to add it to my social database
add and it's going to ask you for what
privileges you want to give that user
for production purposes I'm going to
give that user all privileges but when
you go to actually run your site you're
gathering members you might want to come
back
and remove some of the privileges that
this user has to alter the database but
for production in the beginning here I'm
just going to click all make changes
then it says user Adam was added to the
database social okay so you can see now
this is the database for my website
Adam Cory comm so just disregard that
that one's even there you would just
have your new database listed just one
of them and you would have your user for
the database attached to that database
by adding the user to the database down
here so you have successfully now
created a MySQL database and now I'm
going to show you how to make a
connection script that way on your
website you can communicate with that
database through PHP and it'll be a PHP
based connection script
go into your code editor go to file new
PHP file get rid of all of that data
that's prefilled press ctrl s and within
your folder system in your root folder
let's make one new folder and we're
going to call that PHP underscore
includes and those will store all the
files that are going to be included into
other files because our connection
script
let's name that DB underscore connects
save because this file is going to be
included into other scripts that need to
connect to the database that way you
don't have to keep writing your
connection code into each file that
might need to connect to the database so
it's like a modular way to have your
connection script set up ok let's create
a PHP scripting block and let's make our
connection variable named DB underscore
connects and that's going to be equal to
the MySQL I connect function and we're
using MySQL I extension instead of the
regular old MySQL just to give us some
improved performance because the MySQL I
extension is an improved extension over
MySQL it's like the next gen MySQL I
connect is a PHP function that is used
specifically for connecting to your
MySQL database make its six parameters
it can have possibly six parameters but
we're only going to use the first four
parameters because the last two
parameters are optional for socket
connections so all we're going to need
is the first four parameters and I'll
explain those to you now the first
parameter is going to be the database
host and for most of you guys and for
myself it's going to be localhost now
sometimes the database host will be a
different string that you have to put in
there depending on where you're hosting
your website but for most hosting
companies its localhost if you have any
trouble connecting to your database you
can get in touch with your hosting
company to find out the exact
credentials that you need to put in for
localhost then you put comma and then
the next parameter which is the database
user
you remember what mine was that world a
lot of Adam and you put comma and the
next parameter is the user password for
that database user so I'll just put some
X's in there because that's where I'm
going to put my password and I don't
want you guys to see my exact password
because then I'll be doomed and then
comma and the last parameter which is
the database name and here's the name of
my database so you have your database
host string goes right there database
user database user password and then the
database name itself now let's evaluate
our connection because when we run it
we're going to want to see some error
output if our credentials happen to be
incorrect and the connection to the
database does not occur we want to know
and understand why so we'll place this
next few lines of code to perform that
we're saying if there's a MySQL I
connect ever message then we're going to
echo out the exact MySQL connection ever
and then we exit the script and here is
where you would handle whatever you want
to happen if a MySQL connection ever
occurs but while you're in production I
would recommend that you run some kind
of output string to tell you exactly
what the error is that way you can fix
it but after production while you're
running the site live you might want to
change that to do some kind of other
functionality if a MySQL connection
error occurs for instance you can just
echo out a string to say our database
server is down at the moment that way
the user doesn't see exactly what kind
of error connections or any details
about what's going wrong they just see
whatever message you want to output to
them or you can header them to a new
location some script that says oh you
broke the site come back later all right
just so everybody understands MySQL I
connect Erno returns the error code from
the last connect call and MySQL I
connect ever returns a string
description of your last connection
error if there happens to
be one and this returns the code from
the last connect call and you can easily
evaluate this with an if condition and
we can see that since my password is not
in place I will get a connection error
so let's take this script just as it is
right now and we can place it anywhere
on our live server online and run it to
see if we get a database connection so
actually let's just while we're testing
the page let's put an else condition
here and let's echo out a string to
ourselves that says successful database
connection happy coding all right so
we're going to take this script and
we're going to put it online right now
and you're going to see that mine is
going to cause a MySQL connection error
and it's going to tell me exactly what
the description of that ever is and mine
is going to be related to the password
being incorrect because my password is
not correct here so if your localhost
string is wrong or your user is wrong or
your password for the user is wrong or
the database name is wrong this PHP
function is going to echo that ever to
you tell you exactly what's wrong so I'm
going to take this now and I'm going to
FTP it up to my live web site web
intersect comm and I'm going to run it
by navigating directly to DB connect
stop PHP so I'm going to navigate
directly to DB connect PHP and it says
access denied put a user Adam at
localhost using password yes that means
my password is incorrect and we can
clearly see that because mine are all
X's now I'm going to put my proper
password in my actual password and I'm
going to run that script again see what
kind of output I get I'm going to re
load this file to the web re FTP it and
then run it again from my server and
remember now we're just testing things
right now okay now I have the new file
up and I'm going to press refresh in a
moment but I want you guys to know that
if you get some kind of ever message
like this there's usually almost hosting
a counselor on your host server you'll
have an error log file in the directory
where the error was created
so look within your FTP program to see
if there's an error log file that ever
shows up and that will show you all of
your errors that occur within your PHP
scripting and if an error log file
doesn't show up within your file system
on your server you can adjust the master
PHP any file that is for the PHP
directives on your server and there's
also functions in PHP that will show you
ever reporting you can put them directly
in your scripts for instance in the
first couple of lines here you can put a
couple of functions in PHP which I've
gone over in other tutorials that will
show you ever output so now let me
refresh this page there you go
successful database connection happy
coding now at this point I can go ahead
and create all the tables I can just
create a temporary script that's going
to communicate it's going to connect and
communicate with the database to create
all the necessary tables that I'm going
to need to store all the information for
my members and that's what we're going
to take care of in the next tutorial
we'll be creating a script that's going
to magically create all of our tables
within our database or you can use a PHP
myadmin
there's two different ways to get tables
created into your database you can use
PHP myadmin which is so for beginners to
have a more hands-on approach to table
creation and manipulating data within
the database or you can use direct
scripts in PHP which I'll show you how
to use direct scripting okay so stay
