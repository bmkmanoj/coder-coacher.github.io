this flash he is 5.5 Android app
developer lesson we're gonna teach you
how to program orientation into your
apps for a more professionally
functional app and let me show you what
I mean here's a simple test app that I
created in flash orientation is when the
user takes their phone and they turn it
like that you can see what happens is my
app gets all skinny right in the middle
of the phone and that's not cool and
that's not professional you'll see that
most apps when you turn your phone like
that they auto adjust their width to be
100% of the width of the screen so so
I'll show you how to program orientation
into your flash cs5 point 5 apps using
ActionScript 3 that way when the user
turns their phone like this your app
will stretch the entire width of the
phone it'll fit in there perfectly
that's what I'll show you how to do now
so let's get to it ok here I am in flash
cs5 point 5 working with air for Android
and ActionScript 3 and here's the little
test application that I have going which
you can see it's just a movie clip and I
have it instance named my app and inside
of that movie clip is nothing but static
text and a box sitting on layer 1 so
that's all there is in my file so far
and that's why no orientation occurred
because I didn't program it in now what
happens is when a user has their phone
the normal tall view everything is just
fine because the size of your stage is
480 wide by 800 hi now when the user
turns their phone the other way they're
viewing wide so they have 800 wide and
480 high those numbers swamp so let's
double click inside of this movie clip
we have here let's create a new keyframe
here on frame 2 by pressing f6 that puts
the same elements again on the next
keyframe and here I'm going to select
the box I'm going to go up to modify
transform rotate counterclockwise 90
degrees I'm going to drag it back up
into position 0 and this text from my
wide view I want to get that bigger ok
so I simply just made my text bigger
you can make this box as tall as you
want and it will fit within the users
wide view and they'll have scroll up and
down abilities with their finger all
they have to do is drag and they can
scroll up and down your app but this way
your app doesn't have to lose a lot of
proportion or anything it'll look
exactly the same it'll just be bigger
turn to the side in the wide view
okay now let's add another layer and
this layer we're going to name labels
let's add another layer above that one
and it's named that as3 for ActionScript
3 let's make a keyframe by pressing f6
and the ActionScript 3 layer another
keyframe on frame 2 on the labels layer
by pressing f6 and this one you can put
you just name that app so the label name
over here in the properties panel the
label name for this first one is going
to be told view T ALL underscore view
the label on this keyframe is going to
be wide view wide underscore view now
here we're going to put stop commands up
top so we press f9 to open our actions
panel and we'll type in stop commands
this so that's everything we need inside
of that movie clip now let's double
click here on the side or you can click
scene 1 here to go back into the main
scene now in the main scene we're just
going to simply add a new layer we're
going to call this orientation code I'm
going to highlight that keyframe and
we're going to pop in our orientation
script and I'll explain it for you guys
that are new to ActionScript 3 first we
import the necessary things for allowing
us to work with scaling the stage and
the events that are connected to stage
scaling that's what those world lines
are doing and here we're going to create
a new stage object calling it app stage
and that's equal to my app movie clip
which is this movie clip here on stage
dot stage then we use app stage object
to signify scale mode and alignment
the stage the stage scale mode is no
scale because we don't want any scaling
to occur and the alignment is stage
aligned top left because we always want
our app to be top left position now the
rest of this is pretty basic function
and event listening here so before I
explain the function to you let me
explain this listener we've added to the
app stage object an event listener for
resize so the event is resize and the
function that we want to fire off when
the resize occurs is called orientate my
app and that function is sitting right
here so function orientate my app is
sitting right there so each time the
user turns their phone either way to
view it tall or wide this event resize
will fire off making the code inside of
this function execute and in this code
we create a new variable actually two
new variables one for the device width
and one for the device height which is
equal which is integer type variables
that are equal to the app stage stage
width and the app stage stage height so
you can gather what those numbers are
put them into variables here that's all
we've done and then the rest of this
function is an if-else condition
statement here which says if the device
width is greater than the device height
which means if they're viewing their
phone in the wide view and not the tall
normal view then we say my app dot go to
and stop the wide view label that we put
inside that movie clip so you just go
into the movie clip here where we put
the wide view and you're directing it
through code to navigate to this
keyframe here instead else if the device
happens to be flipped the other way and
they look at it tall view again it's
going to go to and stop the tall view
which is the default and that's pretty
much all there is to it now I'll throw
some code comments here for you guys and
I'll make sure I have this code
available at develop PHP comm right
underneath where the video is playing
that way you guys can copy and paste
this code in case you can't see it in
the video here completely or you have
some syntax error it's not exactly like
mine you can get my exact code and now
I'm going to load it up onto my phone
I'll publish this file out like I showed
you guys how to do it in the last video
and test on the phone that way you can
see the app when I turn it it'll go into
wide view when I turn it back it'll go
back in the tall view all right now let
me open that test application now that
I've reinstalled it you can see it says
simple test app on top now let me rotate
my phone tada
there you go app orientation and like I
told you when they turn the phone like
this all you're gonna do is make sure
you make version two nice and long that
way you have all your apps information
still in this same format but it's nice
and long this way that way the user can
use their finger to drag up and down and
that's how it works folks so we'll see
you in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
