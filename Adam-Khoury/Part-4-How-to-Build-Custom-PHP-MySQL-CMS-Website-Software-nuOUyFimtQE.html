custom content management systems using
PHP and MySQL now at this point if
you're paying attention well you realize
that what we have created here is a one
page template an index file that is
capable of rendering up to thousands of
pages and all have the same design
scheme and flow going on and so it makes
website management really easy and you
can have lots of data archive or indexed
in your system all right so now that we
have this system set up to where this
little magic page is gonna render out
everything from the database according
to what's clicked we have to make sure
we put in one security measure because
there's one little hole that we created
by allowing the or making it to where
the URL string up top here tells the
page what to be so when I click about
you can see it says PID 2 if I click
home it says PID 1 but what if I put PID
er no page data renders because there's
nothing like that in a database so what
I'm gonna do is show you how to remove
all letters and other characters for
instance if somebody puts quotes or the
word or or whatever in there will make
sure that it's only numbers that can be
put in there and then when it's a number
that's in the system the page will come
up if it's a number that's not in the
system you can you can account for that
in ways but I'm not going to because
nobody really should be tampering with
this number up here it should always be
automatic according to what's click down
here so let me show you that really
quick alrighty here we are in the index
page let's go to the code view
and actually I'll show you really quick
let me put when I stuck a div in here to
make sure this thing keeps its size no
matter if there's only one or two lines
it'll still have some some links to the
page and if it's more than what's in
there it will show it too if the page
content it's bigger than this area it'll
still show it vertically okay so now
let's get this line in here that's going
to clean out all letters and characters
from that URL string so it's nothing but
a number we can ensure that a database
will not get hacked
okay so let's grab this line I made a
regex
that's going to replace all non numeric
characters non number characters so all
we have to do is put that right here
where we determine which page ID to use
in the query so if there's no get PID
then we make it page one the home page
else page ID equals whatever values in
the URL string and that's where they can
tamper with your database if you let
them because they can just type into the
URL string hit return and your script
will process it so when your script
processes it you want to do this now
what this line does is uses the Reg
replace function the PHP function and we
use a reg ex a reg expression and what
it does is it knocks out everything but
numbers zero through nine and you can
see what it does is it claims what to
allow here and if you wanted letters you
can just go a through Z and then capital
A through Z and that would allow all
letters too but we just want numbers
here and you see right here it's going
to replace it with nothing so basically
it just takes all characters that are
non numbers and replaces it with nothing
and let's see if we can get an example
of it
let's echo and really this is the last
thing we have to do before we can make
the back end the little forms that will
allow the admin or your client to create
pages and edit pages without having HTML
knowledge okay so now let's see let's
just echo this value that way you can
see it I'm gonna show you what it does
let's go to design view and pop it in
right here in the footer let's just give
this a couple of spaces all the dashes
and right there we're gonna echo this
value all right now let's go and put
this on the web and dekstop PHP put it
up and let's go and refresh the page
or we can just hit home all right now
you see that little one down there
that's this value now let me put a two
in here and you'll see what it does it
goes to the about page or you can just
hit the links and it shows the ID down
AC now watch if I put some letters in
there and a1 see it's still just a 1
down here that we effectively stripped
all those letters out okay so now in
part 5
we'll start our little back-end system
that will allow yourself or your client
whoever is operating the system to
create pages and edit pages and all that
good stuff and I'm just going to show
you a simple admin system or back-end
admin Center and then that might help
you get your creative juices flowing so
you can create really complex systems
