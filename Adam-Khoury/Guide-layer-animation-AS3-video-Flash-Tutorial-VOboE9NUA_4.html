demonstrate how to animate your movie
clips or your symbols using a motion
guide layer and really it's called a
guide layer but it adds nice motion to
your movie clips without give you a nice
curved animations let me just show you
what I'm talking about here okay so
let's create a symbol first thing and
we'll just create a rectangle primitive
here
let's make it our develop PHP colors
and now
I'm going to extend that time line out
to about maybe 160 and press f6 and then
move the symbol now this can be a movie
clip really nice pulsating or but
whatever you want to make it let's try
and grab this thing oops
okay well let me grab it let's move it
across the screen you can put it
anywhere really and
actually it's not going so far with that
and then once you have it at the spot
you want it to land so that's the
starting spot is here and then the
landing spot is here and to add your
motion guide you simply go to the later
one let's just name this or a symbol and
then right click right here and add
motion guide then once we have the
motion guide layer we click up on that
layer and lock the symbol layer and
highlight the first frame of the guide
symbol layer and then grab the pen tool
and start on the symbol
and then make a curvy line
crave it around some more oops
curve it around some more and some more
way over here back over here and it
landed somewhere around there I think
okay so now will we have a line in there
let's go ahead and make sure we have
this symbol it's going to land on the
ending point you could move this line or
you could have drawn it to wear the
symbol is going to end by making
yourself a little visual of where that
thing's going to end put anyways let's
grab this thing and make sure it's on
the end unlock the layer
grab the symbol
and put it at the tip so you start at
one tip you enter the other tip and then
you create a motion tween by
right-clicking the middle of that layer
the symbol layer create motion tween and
then you'll see that when you drag your
timeline marker it's animated to that
path pretty cool and so what you want to
do is publish out now or give it a
better time frame rate maybe 24 publish
out you won't see the line you'll just
see your motion and that's what you're
after you want to guide your movie clip
with emotion guide and you can create
any kind of lines you want and the movie
clip will stick to it say you wanted the
movie clip to stop at the end and not
loop through the animation you just
create a new layer here on top of the
guide layer go to the last keyframe
press f6 press f9 and then type in a
stop action that's it then you publish
out and you'll see it you'll run its
course
and then at the end of the second point
where it lands it'll stop so if you
refresh again
see
hit refresh again say it one more time
but you'll see this sitting at the page
and you can get to this this tutorial
video and it's nice big formatted
develop PHP calm and ask questions are
not formed like always we'll see you
