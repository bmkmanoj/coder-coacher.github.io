tutorial we're working in flash cs4 this
time to show you guys how to structure
out a full flash website complete with
intro loader free loader bar and
everything and then on the second frame
we have an intro movie clip and inside
that intro movie clip we have animations
with different layers that we show you
how to create a little intro with sound
integrated into it and then at the end
of the intro we show you how to program
it to command the parent timeline which
is this main timeline to go to and stop
frame or go to and play frame 3 upon
which our main file loads in and part 2
of this two-part series I'm going to
show you how to construct inside of this
main file movie clip your menu and your
pages and the pages we're going to bring
in are going to be dynamic external SWFs
each page and we're going to show you
how to put different transition effects
on each page just to give a good example
so turn your speaker's down and I'll
show you what we've got so far
press control enter see that red box
would be your main your main site file
so it right there it would be the menu
and everything would come in when that
faded in and in first before that little
movie clip would play your little
freeloader would load up the whole site
but anybody with dial-up will have a
nice indication of to let them know that
your site is loading so we're working in
flash cs4 and I'm going to save this as
a flash cs3 version type file as well so
lastly as three users can get to it and
in flash cs4 and my plug and my publish
settings I saved as Flash version 9 you
see that flash Flash Player 9 I targeted
Flash Player 9 for this file that way it
will work seamlessly between cs3 and cs4
ok we're going to be working in cs4 in
this lesson just to show the
similarities between what you can do in
cs4 and CSS script 3 file and in the
publish settings because I'm gonna save
this source file that you guys can
download as in the zip package there
will be a cs3 version and a cs4 version
or maybe they'll just be a cs3 version
know they'll be both so I can prove to
you guys that it works just the same in
both but we're gonna target the Flash
Player 9 under the Flash tab there and
let's also go to HTML tab and let's not
display the menu
you know the right-click menu that
people normally get we just want it to
be very minimal and not have any options
in it so we'll uncheck that display menu
it's okay if you need a tutorial on how
to change the items in that right-click
menu I have that develop PHP calm okay
now let's press ok because everything is
just right let's change our properties
to
I have to make mine a little less wide
than you would make yours more than
likely yours would be a lot wider than
700 pixels wide but I have size
restraints because I want this demo to
be shown on the page of develop PHP
where this tutorial displays you see we
have 30 frames per second frame rate
that's good everything is good okay now
we'll create a few layers well first
let's just start with the first layer
this would be the file content that
would be the main movie clip of the
website right above that would be the
main movie clip for the intro so they'll
be an intro movie clip file content
movie clip above the intro layer we'll
need let's call this dark dots dark
below debts it's gonna be our loader
here on the first frame the first key
frame this main timeline here
so now we'll say bright
load dots dark blue dots bright load
dots and above that this is gonna be the
mask that grows mask the crews to show
bright dots all right so on our loader
we're just gonna have a series of little
dots they're gonna be dark and it has
the file loads up the dots will light up
until it reaches a hundred percent and
we'll also have some text in there as
well so above that let's call this layer
a s3 for ActionScript 3 now we're ready
to start putting in some items and then
we'll put in some code to create the
loader this will be the initial loading
bar and text that the people will see
when they come to your site so the dial
up users especially they won't see an
empty screen for any amount of time okay
I'm gonna focus on the design of my load
bar mechanism so I'm gonna start with
the dark dots the dark low dot Slayer
and I'm just gonna draw out some little
tiny dots not very big at all and we go
to the properties of that item when it's
selected you can see that it has a fill
and Stroke the fill is black and the
stroke is gray so we'll change the fill
well actually the first thing is let's
change our stage from white to black
because I'm gonna want mine to have a
black background so let's make sure that
dot looks okay the stroke we can change
to maybe
just change it manually to 1.5 there we
go
a nice dark gray like that would be fine
and it has a black fill so now actually
let's go ahead and change that to not so
dark there we go now we can take that
control C control shift V and just make
a whole bunch of those so I'm gonna
duplicate those control C control shift
B and keep making more and more of them
till I have a nice line okay so you see
all my dots here and I made just enough
to where it comes close to 300 width
okay I'm gonna change my workspace to
classic anyway we can see everything a
little better when I highlight stuff so
I'm gonna highlight all of this and
you'll see that it has a width of 297
and that's just about right because I
want my load bar to be my load bar
mechanism to be about 300 so let's go
ahead and get that centered on stage as
best we can okay now let's just
highlight all of them convert to symbol
and we'll make it movie clip and we'll
call it dark dots
okay now on the layer above it the
bright lode dots
let's press ctrl C to highlight this one
first then highlight this layer the
bright lode dots
press ctrl shift + V now you just pasted
it on top so now you can go into your
library see where it says dark dots
duplicate that call it bright dots okay
now here we're gonna swap it out so you
go to swap four bright dots and now we
can go inside and change those so we'll
change all those dots to not be so dark
in the middle we'll make them a nice
bright color it looks good to me
okay so what will happen is let's make
it to where we can't see the bright dots
on top see the dark dots so our load bar
is going to reveal using a masking
method it's going to reveal the bright
dots as the file gets loaded in so all
we need now is a mask movie clip to grow
so let's draw that out this is really
simple it's just rectangle primitive and
you want to make it after you get it on
stage you can make it have no fill make
it some strange color but you don't
normally use I'm gonna use that pinkish
color and then the width make two
- and then the height can be something
small like 10 as long as it's going to
reveal the dots so let's put it right
there and it's going to grow to be 300
pixels wide dynamically through code and
it's going to reveal all the dots in and
slowed process when all the dots are
revealed that's 100% loaded in the file
will show let's convert this rectangle
convert to symbol movie clip and let's
name this load bar or main load bar mask
load bar
Oh Kido key now let's give that an
instance name
bright dot mask bright dots mask just so
it makes good sense to you alrighty now
all we need is the code to bring these
things together and we'll have an
official preloader for our entire site
it'll preload the intro then preload
that it'll preload the file content and
once everything's loaded your intro will
play and then your bio content okay
before we pop in the free loader code if
you guys happen to one a loading text so
you hit the text tool we'll put it right
here on the edge maybe right underneath
pop it right there dynamic text we'll
give it an instance name of load % text
now our code can communicate with this
text field now let's make sure that we
have the right properties on that text
field so let's see how it'll look if we
type something in we definitely don't
want it pink so let's make it the same
color as our load bar and let's go ahead
and embed it let's go to character
embedding now let's put upper case lower
upper case lower case numerals and
punctuation okay and this way this text
that we have assigned whether it be
Arial or any other system font you have
that you want to use in that field it
will display property properly whether
the user has it in their system fonts or
not on their machine so now let's go
ahead and remove everything out of that
make it Center aligned that way it's
loads up right in the center and we see
it in the center let's go to alignment
Center okay now that's all ready to go
so that will display something now in
our code let me explain the code to you
now that will manipulate what this
dynamic text field has in it and it'll
be an animated number that's moving
along
then let's move this over one pixel
there we go
and this mask we have to go ahead and
mask this layer now mask of this layer
with this layer so this little pink
movie clip that we made is gonna serve
as a mask and it's gonna grow to be 300
pixels wide according to 100% of the
bytes loaded in from the file and it's
going to reveal the bright dots over the
dark dots so let's go ahead and make a
mask now out of that layer C so that
layer has effectively masked the bright
dots can't even see the bright dots
anymore unless you unlock these let's
just go ahead and keep them locked and
also on the the dark dots layer you can
put your little tiny whatever graphics
you want on the loading screen like I'm
just gonna put flash building simple
text and you can have whatever you want
let's make it dynamic static text let's
make the size a little bigger there we
go something very simple change that
bond something that Apulia
that's cool
okay now that we have everything we want
for our full site pre loading mechanism
and display then we can look at the code
that's going to run it all and I took
the text that I put on the ActionScript
3 layer that dynamic text field and I
put a where it should go on the dark
load dot slayer just to let you know
okay so let's highlight the as3 layer
and you can use your actions panel menu
here or press f9 to open your actions
panel so here's the code I'm using to
load up the whole site so what's going
to happen is there's a function here and
then a function here you can see this
one's called loadcomplete and this one's
called load progress and here are the
two listeners that enable those
functions to fire off there's an event
listener in progress and event listener
for the complete so here are the two
mechanisms that run for those listeners
so in this function we say we claim a
variable of % and that's a number
variable and we claim math.floor on the
content bytes loaded times 100 and then
we divide it by the my content by its
total so that number that we derive from
this equation is we've rounded so it's
not a decimal number and then we make
sure that we put it into the load
percent text so after we attain that
number in this variable we can then use
that number here in next to our
percentage symbol here so this will roll
along in an animated fashion as it loads
now the bright dots mask movie clip that
we made the little pink movie clip its
width will grow to be x percent I'm
sorry will be the percent times three
because we want it to be 300 wide upon
completion upon 100
so it'll be 300 pixels wide when it
completes its growth according to the
load percentage and it's going to reveal
the bright orange dots now the function
loadcomplete is when it reaches 100 then
the flash player knows to go to and stop
play 2 because we coded that in the
complete event ok so we go to and stop -
now on frame 2 here's where we're gonna
build our intro so let's make a new
keyframe there by pressing f6 we have a
new empty keyframe here and since we're
going and stopping plate frame 2 let's
go ahead and make a new keyframe on the
actions layer open the actions panel and
just put a stop action just make double
sure it stops there it will anyway you
don't have to put that but I'm going to
now we're going to build our intro and
this is gonna be a movie clip so let's
just go ahead and start it off with a
rectangle
there that's your intro now convert that
to a symbol let's call it my intro
registration top left okay now double
click inside of it and think of this as
your main timeline you just build your
whole animation your intro through here
when it gets to the very end of its play
we just script to go to and go to and
play three of the parent timeline we're
going to modify the parent identifier to
go to the parent timeline which is the
main scene so after the intro plays all
the animations that you have in it it
will command the time this main timeline
to go to three right here so here is
where you can make a keyframe for yours
bio content layer right there and that
is where we're gonna build the movie
clip for the main site and I'm just
using the rectangles as placeholders for
now it's gonna be a lot different when
we go inside of those and change them up
so right here let's make this one a
different color so we don't get confused
convert to symbol this whole site
press okay yeah now we have a movie clip
there we don't have to give it an
instance name nor the do we have to give
an instance name to the intro movie clip
so when we go inside I'm gonna zap out
these boxes and really make a more you
know an animation intro and then once
the intro like I said once the intro
finishes playing the inside of its
timeline tells the parent timeline here
to go to and stop one three or maybe go
to and play three whatever we choose to
do and we'll cross that bridge when we
come to it but for now let's go ahead
and build this intro this intro movie
clip now for the sake of time video file
size and the amount of effort I have to
put into this tutorial I'm gonna make a
very simple intro it might be short
animated and sweet but it'll it'll give
you the fundamentals that you need to
understand to make a nice more intricate
involved intro movie clip okay so here
is our intro movie clip let's double
click inside of it and like I said this
is considered the main timeline of our
intro movie clip and it's a separate
timeline from the main scenes timeline
here so you double click inside of it
now you're in its timeline so let's go
ahead and let's just zap this out of
here because we don't want that and the
first thing I'm going to do is draw a
line so I'll grab the line tool let's
say I want a line to come animated in
this way and fill the screen to about
right there
and then I want another animated line
that's going to come and fill this into
the screen maybe right here for my intro
I'm going to keep it very simple like I
said okay so now create another layer
and on this layer name this line one
line one and this one line two
convert to symbol
movieclip registration left top left
it's good call this movieclip line one
whatever you want to name it in the
library it's not important and now this
one let's convert this to a movie set or
a movie clip convert to symbol
movie clip line two and make its
registration to the right because it's
gonna grow from the right to left this
one was gonna grow left to right okay
now we can take this one off of that
layer actually line one control X put it
on the line one layer control shift V
all right so at the same exact time we
want both of those to animate in so all
we have to do is make a keyframe on
maybe make it do it quick about 8:00
bring both of them to make a new
keyframe by pressing f6 on frame eight
so now you have two instances of a
keyframe where you can start an
animation and complete it so let's say
this will be our complete phase so here
will be where it starts so where it
starts we want it to be very small so
where it's complete its fully grown so
in this keyframe we're going to go to
the size properties of this symbol let's
go to position and size width bring the
width down see how I'm dragging okay
that looks good to me now in this one
I'm gonna do the same thing bring the
width down so what's going to happen is
after we create motion tween here right
click in between so you can do both at
the same time if you just highlight both
of them like this right click create
motion tween now once we
oh that's the wrong tween wait one
second
highlight both of them create classic
tween now what happens is on frame one
right when the intro starts these lines
will come out and play like that and
press ENTER and you can see the actual
animation that's a little too fast
slow them down a little bit by extending
the keyframes out okay there's line to
line one now press Enter so that's how
fast it'll play okay now let's make the
next segment of this intro okay before
we go any further with this file let's
go ahead and save it as a new project
and a new folder on our desktop may be
anywhere you want let's make the new
folder called my full site my full
dynamic site
cs4
double-click inside of it and just name
this my site whatever you want to name
your file the flash file okay so it'll
save this now I have a little song here
an mp3 where is it my full dynamic site
there's our folder I'm gonna take this
loop put it in that folder open that
folder rename this loop this little mp3
and yours can be a full song whatever
but just remember it's gonna take longer
to load the larger the file is so let's
just name this my track my intro track
really doesn't matter what its name now
in the flash file you're going to make a
new layer because what I want to have a
little sound on this intro so on layer 3
let's just name that sound double-click
it we name it sound and right here in
the first frame well it's just imported
to the library import to library you
know what it's gonna do is open a file
dialog that will let us browse our
computer to find a media file or any
type of file that flash will import ok
so let's go to desktop my full dynamic
cs4 intro track it slapped it in the
library now and now here on this
keyframe you see it right there my intro
track that mp3 it's in the library along
with all the movie clips that we've
created so far now on this keyframe we
can go to sound my intro track and you
see how it places the sound you can even
see the sound there let's go ahead and
extend these frames out too
maybe 120 oops yeah
120 you can see the sound plays all
through there okay now I'm gonna grab
these two keyframes here highlight both
of them extend them out a little bit
further it seems like they're playing a
little too fast maybe 25 should be good
now I want we can remove these key
frames or remove frames there we go
now I also want two more lines so let's
take these lines keep them together name
this line 3 line 4 like I said I'm just
making a very basic example yours can be
as beautiful and complex as you want so
let's make a new keyframe there and
right there
by pressing f6 now all we have to do is
grab the line tool again and right here
well actually let's bring these two in
so we can really see where we need to
work so right there when those and their
little animation and they snap to the
end spot there I'm gonna have two more
lines start and this line will start
line three will be coming off of line
one right here I'm gonna make a box
right there
now we convert that to a movieclip
converts a symbol
make sure the registration is top center
or top left top center or whatever you
want as long as it stop call this in the
library line 3 okey-dokey now for that
one we're gonna animate that over about
the same amount of frames 30 press
keyframe here so press f6 right there
and right here remember we're gonna make
it small like we did last time so we
highlight this item and we go to the
height and we make the height less there
we go right there now what will happen
when we create classic tween here is
once we set these to be seen go right
here and press f5 to extend out those
keyframes so those first lines will be
seen the whole second part of the
animation so the first lines come in
then the second lines will be drawn in
and that's how it works so I'm gonna do
the same thing here for a line 4 it's
gonna come up here and grow to there
same process I use for line 3 okay so
let's say that after those second lines
the set of lines comes down and gets
drawn in let's say that we want lines 1
and 2 let's give them new keyframes here
we want them to come in a little bit
from the side what we can do is make the
keyframe or the registration point and
manipulate the sizing of the object
manually to snap right there
so let's not do that yet let's make it
animate over maybe just ten frames so
let's go ahead and set a classic Twain
again and right here frame 55 drag it in
like we just did make it snap to that
edge same thing here for this one
keyframe 55
f6 right click in the center create
classic tween nope sorry before you make
that keyframe make sure you make the
registration point here for the when you
resize it now here you make the keyframe
on it pressing f6 on keyframe 55 the
center create classic tween and then
here I'm gonna make sure it comes in and
snaps to this line so now this is what
our animation will look like kinda in
slow motion these lines will be drawn in
and a box will be drawn by two more
lines coming in and those lines will
come in and then you'll be left with a
box there so I think that's a pretty
cool cheesy animation to show you guys
how to get a an intro started now make
another layer above the line for it's
called this my logo text or welcome text
and then above that let's make another
one this is my little go text so on the
welcome text we want to make sure we are
about right here frame 60 and you can do
all kind of cool flashy stuff within
this timeline your it's only limited
what you can do to your imagination okay
so right here I'm just gonna do
something very simple cheesy so let's go
to frame 50 on the welcome text layer
press f6 make a new keyframe grab the
text tool and we're gonna make static
text and say welcome to
make sure it's static tech so it looks
the way we want nice clean and they
thought we want to use I'm just gonna
use Ariel let's make that white whatever
color we want to make it and whatever
size you want it
okay and it's center-aligned it's good
so we'll have it like that
right about there now let's go ahead and
make a new keyframe here on the my logo
text layer let's copy this and place it
here ctrl shift V now let's drag this
one down and this one will say flash
building and make it a little larger
whatever you want to do to it
and so we're gonna animate these now as
well so we're gonna convert this to
movie clip and we're at the symbol name
it whatever you want in the library blah
blah if you want or you can name it
appropriately my logo text my intro logo
text whatever you want to name it I'm
just gonna name it nonsense
converts a symbol on this text as well
I'm gonna name it nonsense so I'm not
gonna be using any of these instance
names because we're manually manually
animating them so here on frame on the
welcome text let's go ahead and drag
this one so we can't see it yet in the
welcome text we want to animate that in
using the Alpha animation let's go to
about 80 make a new keyframe here create
classic tween again and on the first
keyframe we're gonna make sure we go to
the where is it color effect alpha bring
the alpha all the way down so you see
what's gonna happen is it's gonna alpha
in fade in real nice right when that box
comes to a close the words will start
fading it so that words set of words
will fade in make you go a little bit
longer and now this set of words can
fade in right here
let's make a keyframe for that right
about there what 20 create classic tween
are you here we'll do the same thing
bring the Alpha down there we go
so what happens is the box comes to a
close first words fade in the second
words fade in and then that should be
about it then we'll go back and make
sure we code right here let's make a new
layer called actions
or ActionScript 3 whatever you want to
name that because that's where the code
would be you know all the way here on
the last keyframe of the animation let's
make a new keyframe by pressing f6 and
the actions later go in let's type in
movie clip with a capital M movie clip
open parentheses type in parent closed
parentheses dot go to and play 3 so
that's instructing the parent timeline
to go to and play its frame 3 and this
is how you modify to go to a parent
timeline if you happen to be in an inner
timeline so it'll go to scene 1 and play
the main content movie clip of your file
intro will be over at that point so ok
now inside of my intro I have everything
that I want you'll see if I drag it slow
across you can see it brings in lines
makes a box brings in one set of words
then another set of words then I made it
flash the word flash building real quick
there and I did that by accessing the
glow filter I put a glow filter you can
go down here and add filters to any of
your movie clips and I gave it a glow
filter so it animates from no glow
filter to glow filter and then back to
no glow filter so it looks like it kind
of flashes let me just press play
and there's a track playing along with
it that fades out just at the right time
let's bring this out to maybe 225 or 220
and all the rest of these as well press
f5 extend all those out now we have a
nice intro animation that is commanding
the parent timeline on its last very
last keyframe it's commanding the parent
timeline to go to and stop actually we
have to press place a stop action here
or the single key looping so put a stop
action so this movie clip this animation
that we just created knows to not loop
so it'll stop right there and then we'll
say movie click that parent go to and
stop plate 3 so then you see the parent
movie clip here's our site content of
vile content layer and this one is a
movie clip as well so what we're gonna
do to add a little bit of a little bit
more smooth to the file is animate this
in with an alpha effect also maybe 20
frames out press f6 here create classic
tween and right here on this movie clip
go to the alpha make it 0 so now after
your cool little intro plays it's gonna
tell this timeline to go to and play
frame 3 and when frame 3 comes into play
here you see what happens your main file
loads up nice it comes in with a nice
smooth effect so right here let's make a
