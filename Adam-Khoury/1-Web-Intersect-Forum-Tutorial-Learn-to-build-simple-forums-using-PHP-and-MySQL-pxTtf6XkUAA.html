calm here once again with another little
lesson series that's going to be all
about building custom forums into your
website now here is what a viewer would
need to follow this tutorial series
through to completion
the first one is you'll need one hour
give or take a few minutes it may come
out to be less than an hour or may come
out to be a little more than an hour all
of the videos combined in the series
number two you'll need a website server
operating online life with PHP 5 ready
to go on it now PHP 4 may work out too
for all the scripting that we're going
to demonstrate but I'm going to
recommend PHP 5 just so yours is exactly
compatible to mine number 3 is MySQL
database access and an existing table
full of members you could have you know
two dummy members in your in your
members table and a basic understanding
of HTML CSS PHP and MySQL if you don't
understand PHP and MySQL at all what
they are and how they work in this
tutorial series will be a little bit too
advanced for you and we're just going to
use basic HTML and CSS so part 1 here in
this video will be all about adding a
layer of security to your members
session data to make it harder for bad
users to impersonate other members in
your forum system so I'm going to be
showing you a way to go into your login
dot PHP script and add a couple of more
session variables that way we can
cross-reference those within our forum
system you can also add this to any
other systems that are on your website
if you want an extra blanket of security
and then after we get that set we'll
start building the actual directory for
the forum and the index page the home
page for the forum and everything like
that
there won't be very many videos in this
series at all it's going to go pretty
quick because it's not a very complex
kind of system to get set up in a basic
fashion the first thing I'm going to do
is go into my website files and open
login dot PHP in Dreamweaver cs4
whatever program you want to open it in
notepad I don't care I'm also going to
go into the scripts folder and open
check user log because I might need to
alter something in that one as well so
now
I have those to open and Dreamweaver I'm
going to go into the part of login dot
PHP where the session variables are
being created here here's the one for ID
there's ID X and there's username I want
to add two more one for email and one
for the password for each member that
logs in so I can just grab that code put
it right there and another one right
there create the session bar for their
email create the session bar for their
password now all you have to do is
change this right here row email we can
make this user email that'll be the
sessions variable name so let's take
that put it here and then the variable
name for the session itself the session
variable name itself will be user email
and we'll do the same with this we'll
just call it user pass put it here and
here and make sure you get the right
name out of the database that's password
field name is row password put it into a
variable called user pass then you can
sync it in right there into the session
variable called user pass this way when
somebody logs in from now on to web
intersect they're going to have two more
little session variables created within
their browser that will help my website
system remember their data one for the
email and one for the password now I'm
going to go into check user log and see
if there's anywhere inside of that where
I need to alter things as well I might
need to define these two variables there
as well so let me highlight those and
copy them just in case I need to pop
them in place so I'm here in check user
log PHP and it looks like we're dealing
with the session cookies if the session
ID X is set then we know that we have
their email and their password set as
well so we don't have to look at that
code but if they're cookie set and their
sessions aren't set yet and they have
the remember me
function on the log in selected this is
where you're setting some new sessions
down here remember so we need to get one
for the username the email and the
password going in this check users the
log script right here so that means we
have to query the database and get that
information you see where we're
selecting username and we output it
right here in the while loop we can
simply add email we're going to select
their email as well because we already
have access to their password which is
right here because that's set in a
cookie file so I'm just selecting their
email along with a user name now that
way I can put their email and the
password in the username into session
variables here if they happen to be a
user that clicked the remember me
checkbox on your login script I'm going
to pop those into place right here okay
so you see what I've done I've added
these three lines right here one is to
session in the username session the user
email and the user password the user
password variable I simply attained
right here from the one that was in
place already in the script I didn't add
that today this was already in place
where we get the user password through
the cookie so that gets put into the
session variable for user password of
the user email I simply got out of the
database row along with the username
where we were selecting username from my
members before I just added select
username and email so then I can access
that right here and that gets put into a
session variable in the username we had
all along already right here so now
we're setting those session variables
username user email and user password
inside of check user log and login dot
PHP now let me explain the important
part of why we just added that and how
it adds a little blanket of security to
your system okay now here's the danger
you want to look out for some people
know how to manipulate actually open and
alter the cookie files in their browser
so maybe they have a session ID cookie
of five they can change that to seven
so it seems like your system is going to
sense that they have an ID of seven or
whatever you know what I mean so if
they're in there changing those things
and they can actually impersonate people
within your system so what we're doing
by session by setting the email and the
user password into session variables now
is we can cross-reference those as well
so some little idiot who wants to try
and impersonate people on your site he
might go into his cookie files and
change you know the ID variable but
he'll also if you put these security
measures in place in your site he'll
also have to guess some user's password
and their email that corresponds with
that user name or ID you understand so
when you're trying to make the bad guy
guess people's password that makes it
almost impossible to guess their email
and the password mixture especially the
mixture of the email and password it's
going to be very hard for somebody a
malicious user to guess those sort of
things so you'll pretty much make
impersonating a member an impossibility
within your system unless somebody gives
out their password in their email to
somebody else like a dummy most of the
systems that I build nobody gets to see
anybody else's email but everybody can
still pop around and interact within the
system and be social but nobody's really
going to guess anybody's password I
don't think and the only way
impersonation could occur past that
would somebody would have to actually
hijack all the session variables from
somebody using JavaScript or something
like that so session hijacking is a
concern but it's very hard to accomplish
when you setup the right kind of systems
make sure nobody can put in script tags
into your systems that's usually how it
works and they'll put it into a link
your malicious user will put in some
JavaScript into somewhere where they can
input things into your site and if
another member clicks on it and it has
script attached to it that members
session variables can be viewed by that
bad person and then they can go into
Firefox or something and manipulate
their cookie files and the session data
to match that person that way they're
impersonating them so you got to watch
out what people
putting into your site and you also want
to cross-reference their session
variables with password and the email to
add an extra blanket of security so when
I go in part two here and I make the
forum directory I'm going to make sure
in my PHP that I'm cross-referencing
making sure the user password matches
the user ID in the database or wherever
I need to check those things so I just
had to throw this part in here and it'll
help make your whole complete system
more secure if you add those kind of
checks to your other mechanisms on your
website so now in part two we can
continue forward nice and smooth with
building the forum so stay tuned for
part two of Eddie</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
