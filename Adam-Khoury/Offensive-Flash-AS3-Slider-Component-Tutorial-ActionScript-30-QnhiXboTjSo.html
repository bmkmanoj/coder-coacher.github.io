we demonstrate how to use your slider
component from the components library
and have it manipulate stage objects or
you can use it to manipulate dynamic
code objects for media or whatever
you're using it for the slider can be
used for many many things so you see
when I slide it it makes her boobies
bigger and smaller you can adjust her
boobies giant melons there you go okay
let's click on create new flash
actionscript 3 file I'm going to adjust
my stage properties to be 640 x maybe
340 that should be good ok now I'm going
to create a couple of layers and the
first layer on top is going to be named
head this layer is going to be named
boobies this layer is going to be named
body right above the head layer let's go
ahead and add one more call that a s3
that's where we're going to put our
action script recoding okay so the first
thing is let's lock that actionscript-3
code layer let's go and grab the head
there's your head
pop it in that key frame press ctrl-c
and fireworks or whatever program you're
using and press ctrl-v once back in
flash and it will paste it in as a movie
clip now in the body layer highlight
that one and let's go back into
fireworks and grab this little body now
in flash we can pop that into the body
the layer ctrl V brings it in as a movie
clip as well bring this down to where it
looks like it makes sense
something like that is ok now on the
boobies layer I'm going to create an
oval primitive draw it out and it's all
black so what I'm going to do is give
that a gradient fill then I'm going to
go and adjust the colors of it to match
the colors of our flesh actually I'm
going to leave it white gradient like
that and I'm not going to give it a
nipple so as to not be disgusting okay
or overly children to stick with this
tutorial okay so now we have one will be
there let's press ctrl C now realize
we're on the boobies layer control C
control V control shift V rather and it
pastes a copy of itself right there then
let's give these an edge for a second so
I can see where they are
right about there
now those are a little bit large but
it's okay
so let's take that make sure we give
them no edge and convert to symbol in
the library called it boobies give it a
center registration point movie clip
boobies okay now give it an instance
name over here boobies okay now we all
all we need is a slider and a little bit
of code before we begin the code we have
to drag out the slider because that's
what the tutorial is all about slider
component and now let's also drag out
the dynamic text field make sure this
text field is set to dynamic down here
and let's give it an instance name of
Boo slider underscore txt
Boop slider underscore txt let's name
this instance name the slider itself a
boob slider okay so we have boob slider
text and the boob slider we have boobies
with instance name boobies and I think
that's all we need everything has an
instance name we're good to go now we
can do some code here actually on that
layer above the head layer let's make a
new layer and call it slider stuff let's
grab the slider stuff control X on the
new layer ctrl shift V and on that new
layer as well we'll type adjust my boobs
adjust my boobies
and I'm not trying to be sexist or
anything I'm just trying to have a
little fun I want it to be sexist I can
do a lot worse trust me let's make this
single line ok now let's call it it out
first thing we're going to do is import
FLL event that given step slider event
and that's in this list here right there
now we're going to put some text into
the boob slider because this is the
average size and they might look a
little large but let's say that's the
average sized boobs so our slider text
needs to well the slider first of all
needs to be in the center position and
because we want to be able to allow the
users to make the boobs smaller or
larger so we started in the center
position and we're going to also code
out to where this dynamic text field
says that it's starting at five so we
can go in here and say boob slider text
I'll just go txt that text equals
boob size colon 5 that's it now we're
going to create an event listener for
the boob slider of a change event so
we're listening for the change event so
boob slider that add event listener
and this is slider event
dot change and comma and the function we
want to fire off I'm going to call it
boobs resize be a fitting name for that
function let me spell it right boobs
resize close that off now make the
function boobs resize so now when
somebody grabs a slider and they change
the value of the slider we're listening
for that and we're going to fire off
this function here when it changes it's
very simple so functioning boobs resize
and this is event dot slider event you
should grab this right here void
open curly brace and close curly brace
first thing we want to do is say boob
slider text right when they change it is
going to be equal to not five but
whatever they change it to so let's add
to this string there and say plus the
event that target value and that will
allow you to access the value of what
the user changed the slider to so that's
all we need there now we're going to
scale the boobies make them resize like
we need to so now we're going to say
boobies that's the instance name on the
boobies dot scale X is equal to event at
target value
now if you left it just like that they
would get really tiny teeny and really
enormous so i'm going to divide this
value by five so same thing on the Y
scale we're going to change scale y to
the event that target value divided by
five okay now before we test oops I have
a period there this has to be a colon
okay now before we test the slide is
going to be at a position of zero i
think by default so let's make sure the
boob slider has a value right up here
move slider that value is equal to five
i will place it right at the center the
little slider button will be in the
center of the slider so now let's press
control enter and see what we have see
if we can adjust some boobies here okay
it says it's just my boobies boob size
equals five and let's make moves eyes oh
nice let's boob size eight nine ten
giant melons little mosquito bites you
can make them go away too if you go to
zero gone put one to all those little
values will change the size of any
object you wanted to and not only sizing
what volume let's say this was a player
in those boobies with the volume of the
track playing the slider can control
that volume okay so that's a pretty good
demonstration of how you can use your
slider component</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
