three JavaScript programming video
lessons you'll be learning to create
custom dynamic dialog boxes this way you
can use the same box over and over for
many different types of dialog and if I
had to guess I would say that 100
different people have asked me how to
make custom dialog boxes mainly the
custom confirmation box so in the first
video here we'll show you how to create
custom alert boxes in the second video
of the series we'll show you how to make
custom confirmation boxes and then in
the third video we'll show you how to
make custom prompt boxes and then we'll
also discuss other things that you can
add to your dialog boxes like all kind
of form elements multiple-choice
questions whatever you can dream up
before we begin let's take a look at the
finished product of what you'll be
learning to create let's take a look at
the default JavaScript alert box and
says you look very pretty today okay now
here's the custom alert box that I
created gives you the advantage of you
being able to style every aspect of this
box you being able to write whatever you
want in the heading the body and the
footer of that box and these buttons can
say anything you want them to say the
box could be any size that you want it
to be and it can be positioned on the
page anywhere that you want it to be and
another cool advantage is that you get a
white overlay it's basically a div that
lays over the web page and disables the
web page until the user interacts with
your dialog window so they cannot
interact with the web page or any of the
content on it until they interact with
your dialog window now we're going to
begin with what would be your existing
web page and I just slapped a button on
the page that has an on click event and
in the on click event
I'm just firing off an alert the default
JavaScript alert so let's see what that
gives us in the browser window a default
javascript alert
okay now we want to make a custom alert
we also want to make it very reusable
that way we don't have to have a bunch
of different custom alert boxes on the
page we can just
put one dialog box on the page and use
it for alerts confirmation prompts and
any other custom things that we want we
can use that same box over and over for
many many different types of dialog so
we'll start in the HTML and we'll add
the dialog box overlay and the dialog
box itself so you can see I've added
those two elements div with an ID of
dialog overlay and it starts and ends
right there on that line 13 and then
dialog box itself and the dialog box
contains a child div and inside of that
child div there's three child divs
the first one being dialog box head the
second one is dialog box body and the
third one is dialog box foot and you can
imagine what those things are within the
dialog box and we're going to
dynamically populate those things within
a function that way this box this dialog
box and this overlay can be used over
and over again for as many different
dialogues as you need on your page now
we're going to apply the CSS for this
dialog overlay div and the dialog box as
well as the three divs with IDs inside
of it so let's put that CSS in place and
I'll explain it real quick
this one effects the div overlay this
one affects the dialog box
this one affects the dialog box heading
this effects dialog box body and this
affects the dialog box foot so any
styles that you want those areas to have
in the dialog box this is where you
affect them this is all just basically
cosmetics and I'm not going to explain
all of the CSS properties but I will
explain the important ones the dialog
overlay is set to display:none by
default and so was the dialog box itself
both are set to display:none the dialog
overlay has an opacity of 0.8 that way
the user can kind of see through it and
the dialog overlay is what disables the
webpage while the user is interacting
with your dialog window and the rest of
this is basic positioning and cosmetic
stuff the dialog box has a background of
black and it has a fixed position
because we're going to be positioning it
with
javascript that way we can land it
directly in the middle of the page no
matter what the users screen width is or
whatever their browser window width is
we'll just dynamically put it in the
center using javascript now we're going
to apply the JavaScript and in this case
I'm going to create a little custom
object so we'll go into our script
element here and we'll put in the custom
object and I named it custom alert now
after that we're going to put bar alert
is equal to new custom alert so we're
making a new instance of this custom
alert object and the new instance is
named alert now I want this custom alert
to have two methods within it the first
one will be render and the second one
will be okay so let's type in this dot
render is equal to function open close
parenthesis opening curly brace and
closing curly brace now the next method
I want is this dot okay and that's going
to be equal to function open close
parenthesis opening curly brace closing
curly brace so now my custom alert
object has two methods within it that
can be called to run render and okay now
with a custom confirm box or a custom
prompt box situation you would have
different methods here at work and I'm
going to show you those in the following
two video tutorials now within this
render method we want to set up some
variables the first two variable is
going to be the window width and the
window height because I need those
values in order to position my dialog
box in the direct center then I want to
get object references for the dialog
overlay and the dialog box those are
these elements here dialog overlay
dialog box so now I have object
references for those in my JavaScript
here now what we'll do is apply the
overlay so we'll say dialog overlay dot
style that display is equal to block so
that means it's not style display:none
anymore it's style display:block
that means it's showing and then the
overlays height is going to be equal to
the windows height so actually we can
run this right now and we can see the
overlay being placed on top of the page
and disabling the page if we put that
alert so let's go ahead and put our
some alert into place while we're still
writing our function we can type in our
alert variable here
we'll just put alert dot and you can see
that we have the render method and the
OK method available to us now
so I'll click render and that's only if
you have an IDE or a code editor that
shows you which methods are available to
which objects my code editor happens to
show me when I just put a dot after an
object it shows me which methods are
available or which functions I can run
for that object so i type in alert
render method and then i put the
argument that i want so i have to scoop
that argument up here and I'll do that
in a moment but I don't have to do it
right now we just want to see the
overlay come into place and let's change
what this says let's say custom alert so
let's remove that initiate we don't need
that default alert and custom alert so
now I'm going to run this in my favorite
browser and click custom alert now you
can see the overlay came into place I
can't interact with anything on the
webpage until that overlay is removed
and since we already have a dialog box
reference here
the object reference we can go ahead and
set some of its style properties so
we'll say dialog box style dot left is
equal to the windows with / - - whatever
your dialog box window with is time 0.5
which is basically / - also it's 550 / -
so you're taking the window / - -
whatever your dialog box with is / - and
that's how many pixels that the left
position is going to be that that will
Center the dialog box directly in the
middle of the users window and then you
can set the top property and that can
also be dynamic if you like and you can
use this window to H value to set a
dynamic top position
but I just wanted to push it off the top
of the window 100 pixels that's fine for
my needs and then we finally set its
displayed to block so it's showing so
now if we run this
custom alert now we see our dialog box
but it has nothing in its head body and
footer yet so let's fix that we're going
to target the dialog box head body and
foot and we're going to affect their
inner HTML properties to put whatever we
want in there so I'm writing the string
acknowledge this message you can see we
could put HTML or string data whatever
we want in here and then the dialog box
body has to get a dynamic dialog that is
set down here because that's the
argument that we're passing through is
the actual message the dialog that you
want so in order to get that they're
dynamically as this variable called
dialog we're going to scoop that up in
the argument of that render method so
you can see down here we have alert at
render and we're passing one argument we
scoop that argument up here as dialogue
so dialogue within this function is
going to be equal to whatever message
that you want to say so that's the
string data you put within the dialog
box body and then in the dialogue box
foot you put a button with an on click
event that's going to fire off the alert
okay method now in the okay method down
here you want to make sure that you are
removing the dialog box and the dialog
box overlay or the webpage overlay make
their style that display equal to none
now everything should be populated in
our box so let's check it out custom
alert and there's everything we have all
this data that we want in the box we
press ok and the okay function fires off
the OK method within our custom alert
object now I can use that over and over
again dynamically I can put another
alert custom alert too and this will say
and you also smell very nice so now I'll
have two different custom alerts with
different messages see and you also
smell very nice this one says you look
very pretty today and that's all the
logic behind how this works now in the
next two tutorials I'll be showing you
how to make a
custom confirmed box which is the most
popular request I get and a custom
prompt box will do prompt box in the
third tutorial now a custom confirmed
box we can use this same exact dialog
overlay and dialog box we're just going
to populate its head body and foot with
different dynamic content and a
confirmed box takes a little more logic
because you're letting the user choose
either yes or no to confirm some
critical action that's happening in the
program for instance if they want to
delete something and you have a social
network let's say and they you want to
let the user delete something if they
press that delete button sometimes you
want to put up a dialog that says you
sure you want to delete that because
maybe they don't intend to delete
something and they hit the delete button
by accident
that's where confirm window comes in
handy you say are you sure you want to
delete that and then you give them a
little yes or no button so that'll be in
the next tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
