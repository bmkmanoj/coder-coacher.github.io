quickly showcase this PHP and MySQL
member system tutorial that you can get
to it by going to develop PHP calm and
hit the flat not the flash tab with the
PHP tutorials tab and you'll see right
there is the member system tutorial and
you take it you go through all the steps
and you'll have yourself your own little
member system it's just the foundation
and I'm not going to be offering too
much support in the forums for expanding
upon this system maybe a little here and
there and you should have at least basic
PHP and basic MySQL knowledge here we
have a PHP and MySQL member system
tutorial it's been on my site for a
while but I just wanted to bring it to
light because a lot of people seem to be
interested in looking and looking to
build something like myspace or YouTube
or Facebook to where members can join a
site they can upload things and then
their profiles are displayed and this is
what this tutorial is all about is the
foundation of a site like that in PHP
and mysql and i'll just read you the
first paragraph its have you ever wanted
to understand how to set up and create a
portal community social network client
database or something to that effect
this tutorial will show you the
foundation in PHP and MySQL and is
packed with great knowledge for all
programmers with this foundation you can
build something like this site develop
PHP custom created to your own needs
something like myspace YouTube or
Facebook now keep in mind myspace
YouTube and Facebook are way more
advanced in developed PHP and there's a
lot more coding that you would have to
learn but if you want to learn the
foundation of how to get started in a
system like that understanding how to
code it from scratch then this is the
tutorial for you and there's you know
there's 12 11 simple steps and scripts
that you'll go through and you'll copy
and paste all your scripts you'll create
all the files you'll run the system and
you'll see that it works if if you set
everything up correctly and I've had a
few people test this out they say it
works fine I've tested it out several
times it works great and
that's about that and so what we're
going to do next is take the PHP and
MySQL member system you can take this
system and you can make your PHP and
MySQL site but soon i'm going to start
the tutorial a series on how to create a
social network something like myspace
YouTube and Facebook all in one hundred
percent flash flash homepage flash
profiles flash edit areas everything
okay so if you guys want to learn how to
make something like a social networking
site dating site coder site like develop
PHP is where people can join and
interact all over the site then you can
set up a forum to that would be like
developed PHP that would be like
developed PHP's forum but you won't be
able to integrate everything the way I
do especially in the home page you know
you have to have custom coding knowledge
to bring in all the newest tutorials to
the home page all the newest forum posts
there's eight random members chosen out
in my database every time you refresh
the page so you have to understand these
fundamentals and the foundations if
you're going to make a really cool
unique site otherwise you just got a
cookie cutter website that's just like
every other freaking website out there
and who wants that who wants to even
hang out on a site like that so if
somebody else made a YouTube that works
exactly the way you tube does they're
going to fail because YouTube already
did it if you make a myspace that works
just like myspace does you're going to
fail as well you won't have as much
success as myspace is what I mean so you
might as well venture into something new
and build your own cool custom community
or portal social networking site that
does new and cool things and that's what
the flash integration that I'm about to
introduce into social networking is
going to be all about so hold on tight
kids we're going to have a fun ride
right see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
