actionscript 3.0 sound programming video
textbook in this first lesson we're
going to start with the simplest way to
get a sound or song to play in your
flash file which is to import the sound
file into your library then simply apply
it to your timeline without having to
use any code at all to accomplish it I'm
working in flash cs4 professional but
it's important for you to keep in mind
that since we're using actionscript 3.0
we can be using flash cs3 cs4 or cs5 and
all of the same code will apply and all
of these same methods will apply it's
just that the user interface between cs3
cs4 and cs5 is a little different like
where the properties menu is located and
you know the toolbars and everything is
just in different locations throughout
those different programs ok let's create
a new flash ActionScript 3 file and I
think the first thing that anybody that
works in flash will encounter when it
comes to sound would be putting it on a
button so I'm going to grab the
rectangle tool I'm going to draw out
rectangle primitive I'm just going to
adjust the the curvature the edge is
there I'm going to right click it
convert it to symbol which is a button
symbol so you can convert it to a movie
clip or button I'm going to choose
button okay now you can double click on
that and now you're working inside of
the button and you're up over down and
hit States and here's where you can add
another layer you can put some text up
here now I'm going to go into the
overstate on this base layer let's just
name this base let's name this text on
the base layer press f6 to give it a
keyframe on the overstate f6 give it a
keyframe on the down state as well and
on the text layer I'm just going to
press f5 on the down frame that way it
extends on the overstate I'm just going
to change the color to something
brighter and now let's add another layer
this one we're going to call sound this
is where we're going to put our sound
file to play and we only want it to play
on the down state when somebody clicks
down on the button but you can have it
play on any state that you want you can
have multiple sounds play
on different keyframes if you want so
let's create a keyframe on the downstate
by pressing f6 there now let's go to
file import to library and we're going
to look for a sound file that we have on
our computer it could be a wav file or
it could be an mp3 file for this one
we'll bring in a WAV file and I would
advise using mp3 files for everything
just because they're a little more
compressed so now that sound is in my
library so if you open your library
you'll see it so highlight that down
frame and you go over here to where it
says sound if that's not open you just
hit that little arrow you go to swoosh
fast or whatever your sound file is
named now when you press control enter
click your button so that's the simplest
way and I think the first time people
mess with sound and flash is to put them
on buttons now it's also important for
you to realize at this point that you
can edit this sound flash will actually
let you edit the sound once it's applied
in this fashion to the timeline like
that you can go to effect you can make
it fade in fade out fade to the left
right whatever and you can also edit it
so let's say I didn't want it to be such
a long swoosh I can do things like grab
this bar here drag it in and now the
sound will have a different effect it'll
be more of a sharper sound okay so
that's the simplest way to get a sound
in library to use on your buttons and it
couldn't be a WAV or mp3 file all right
so let's close this one I'm not going to
save it let's start a new one start over
now let's say we have an animation I'm
going to create a quick simple animation
on the timeline okay so I just animated
on the timeline using this little red
ball and this is what I have it's just
little red ball bouncing around very
simple I'm using one hundred and thirty
frames I'm going to create a new layer
there I'm going to go to file import to
library this time I have an mp3 file
which is stupid red ball and I made it
in fruity loops so now we just highlight
that keyframe where we want this
to start playing we go to stupid red
ball in our library now let's press
control enter I am a little stupid red
ball that Adam made demonstrate oh
yeah that's how it goes and you'll see
that look I am a little stupid red ball
that Adam made demonstrate I am a
little stupid okay so if you wanted that
to stop you would just put a new layer
there keyframe here open the actions
panel by pressing f9 type in sto P your
stop command now if you run it I have a
little stupid
red ball that's Adam made some demos
great there you go so that could be
a long mp3 file it could be a tiny
little sound whatever you want so that
is the most basic way to get a sound
file applied to your flash animations or
website but being the most basic way to
apply sound also means you have limited
control over the sound and limited
access to the properties of that sound
those are things we're going to explore
more as we get into the sound
programming video textbook so we'll see
you in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
