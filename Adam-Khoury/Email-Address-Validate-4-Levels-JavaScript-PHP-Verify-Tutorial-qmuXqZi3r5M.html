four different levels of email address
validation and verification so that
everyone is aware of a wide variety of
approaches to accomplish the task of
email address validation and that
happens when somebody is submitting an
email through a webform or giving you an
email for some reason and you want to
just make sure that it's a real email
address or that it's properly formatted
okay first let's take a look at level
one which is validating email address
format on the client side using
JavaScript and I wrote two different
functions so you guys can reference
different ways to do it now this is a
very low level approach and you can see
that the address variable represents the
email address that the user would be
putting into your form and then we wrote
an is valid email function that we run
that address through as an argument you
see right here is valid email we run the
address variable through as an argument
now I'm just using alert to easily show
myself if it's true or false
if it's valid or not but you can put
console dot log right there if you want
to be an extra special dork now
basically all I made this function do is
start with a result variable that is set
to false by default and if there happens
to be an @ symbol and a dot within this
string then we're going to make a result
variable equal to true then we just
return the result to our calling code
which is this code right here so this
alert is going to read either true or
false now we should get a true because
we have the @ symbol and the dot in
there so let's render this in our
favorite browser and we get true ok now
what if I was to go ahead and remove the
@ symbol and then run that again in my
favorite browser it says false so it
failed the validation for the format of
that email now that's just a very low
level email address format validation
now I'm going to change out this
function for one that uses a more
complex regular expression to check the
format of this email
so you can see we have the same name on
the function and we're sending address
string through it again
now here we have a variable that
represents a regular expression and if
you look online you'll find thousands of
examples of different regular
expressions and honestly when you're
validating in JavaScript this way it's
never really solid because people can
shut JavaScript off in their browser
software and then your form won't get
validated at all
so that's why we recommend doing the
validation the serious validation in PHP
or your server-side scripting language
now let's take a look at this one let's
run this in our favorite browser we get
true now this one's a little more strict
because let's say I remove all the
characters before the @ symbol we should
get false now because this regular
expression is set up to not allow or not
validate an email address that doesn't
have any characters before that at
symbol because email address has to have
characters before that at symbol so what
if I was to remove the domain part of
the address run that and that returns
false as well so if we put the domain
part back we should get true C so that's
just a little better when you want to
validate the format of the string for
the email address that the users
submitting to your form but like we
mentioned you really can't rely on
JavaScript for that you can just do this
as a way to prevent the form from being
submit before the data gets sent to the
server side you can do a little check to
make sure that their email address is at
least formatted correctly and that's
really all you're doing in the
JavaScript part and we're going to have
the code available for all of these
examples at the page with this video
renders at my site so right under the
video you'll see all kinds of different
code examples the first function that we
had in place then you'll see this
function and then the PHP examples as
well so if you can't really see the code
in the video you'll be able to go to my
site and just copy-paste it if you
really want to take a look at it now for
level two
three and four I'm gonna lead you to
code examples that you can just grab and
try for yourself I don't even have to
write the code examples out because
somebody else already has so if we go to
php.net which is the official manual for
the PHP scripting language I have a link
that I'm going to give you guys that
will send you to the validation examples
and these are using the filter bar
function so you can see it says example
number one validating email addresses
with filter bar and this link will be in
the description of the video so you can
just scroll under the video or to the
side of the video somewhere wherever the
description of the video is and you'll
see links there so this shows you how to
use the filter validate email option of
the filter bar function now you can also
just google search online for PHP
regular expression for validating email
and you'll get tons as results thousands
of results different people showing
different regular expressions that will
validate an email address within your
server-side code in PHP so there's
different approaches but if you're using
PHP 5 and above you can just use filter
var which is nice and easy so let me
repeat that you can web search for PHP
regular expression for validating email
addresses and you'll get tons of
examples you'll see thousands of regular
expression examples and little functions
that you can put in place within your
applications but when you're checking
the format of the string that is the
email address you can't really see if
it's a real email address that exists so
level three and four that's what we're
going to be discussing now
okay so level three is PHP SMTP email
validation I'm gonna put the link in for
that and I found a nice little script on
Google code code google.com/analytics oh
you can come and check it out for
yourself now it says a PHP class that
allows validation of email addresses via
SMTP email syntax can check whether an
email address has a valid format however
in order
check if the email address actually
exists you'll have to query the email
domain for the existence of the email
address and that's what this helps you
do it it helps you actually see if the
email address that the user is putting
in exists on that domain now finally
level four and I'm gonna give you guys
this link as well so you're gonna get a
bunch of links so you can research all
these different things now here at
develop PHP com which is my site in the
web intersect social network training
series we show how to actually you send
an email to the address that the user is
putting in and there's a link inside the
email body that they have to click to
verify that they own that email address
so that's a way to really check without
a doubt that the email address exists
and that it is theirs so because
sometimes people can put an email
address of their friend and then their
friend is going to be the one that's
associated to whatever form that's being
submitted and that's that's not right
you want to make sure that the person
submitting the form actually owns the
email address that they're submitting
through your form and they really the
only way to do that without a doubt is
to send them an email and say hey if you
recently use the form here click this to
verify that you're the owner of this
email address and blablabla so that's
what this script shows you how to do and
it's part of the signup form and email
activation process for the social
network training series that we did so
now you've been taken through level one
which is simple client-side JavaScript
email address format validation all the
way to level four which is a definitive
way to make sure that the users
submitting the form actually owns the
email address that they're submitting in
your forms okay so really that's all the
various ways to approach email address
validation and verification when dealing
with web development I'll see you guys
in the next tutorial bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
