discuss how to detect mobile devices for
all of your web applications and
websites this is the hugest pain in my
butt and I'm sure if you're developing
like I do for clients or whatever it's a
huge pain in your butt to because every
client you got it's gonna be like I
gotta make sure I got a mobile version
of my website so people earn their
iPhones and Google Nexus --is and
everything can find me and my products
and I make more money
my name my name my name money now it's
best to make a mobile website in xhtml
forget flash just make your mobile
website in XHTML using JavaScript and
CSS to make it look cool or whatever and
basically what it's supposed to be if
you're gonna make a standard mobile
website is to have it be like a
scaled-down smaller version of your
website at least until mobile devices
display just like a brand new computer
monitor with resolutions like 1400 by
900 you know that's gonna that's gonna
be a while so you still have to make a
mobile version of a site now before we
get into these scripts for detecting and
redirecting and showing alternate
content and all that stuff let's take a
look at the browser configuration window
of a modern of most modern devices that
are handheld or mobile devices
have this kind of browser configuration
window let's look at what the check
boxes say support JavaScript allow
JavaScript pop-ups support HTML tables
use foreground and background colors use
background images support embedded media
support style sheets that's CSS
stylesheets
that right there it pretty much gives
you everything you're gonna need to make
an awesome look in mobile standardized
mobile website all right now let's look
at these scripts okay so these are the
four methods that I would recommend for
serving up alternate content or changing
up a stylesheet
depending on what type of device person
is viewing your website with
in the first one second one are using
PHP a server-side language and that is
preferred over the JavaScript method
because JavaScript could be shut off so
somebody can shut off JavaScript in
their browser or many times in their
handheld mobile device so really the
server-side language cannot be shut off
so it's a more solid method so let's
look at number one detect user agent and
redirect using a server-side language
like PHP ASP ColdFusion markup etc
whatever you're comfortable with now
let's go check that out let's develop
PHP here's method number one this is the
URL so you can go there and copy and
paste that script if you want to
experiment with it and here you can see
it's titled mobile device detection and
read the Russian script using a PHP
homepage so basically this would be your
home page and there's some if and else
statements in there is an if and else if
statement that looks to see if it's the
iPhone and this one looks to see if it's
the Android and it's going to send the
person to that page if that happens to
be what they're viewing the site with if
they're on regular Internet Explorer on
their computer or Firefox then this
default content down in the page will
display so that is a PHP index dot PHP
homepage that's all equipped and ready
to send people to another home page if
they happen to be on their mobile device
okay and read all the content in here I
give you some nice tips and everything
ok now number two which is using PHP
once again to detect user agent and
serve up an alternate stylesheet to
eliminate the need for having multiple
home pages and for this method you have
to have good CSS experience to be able
to pull that off now here's the page is
the URL if you'd like to get to this
script to play around with it
and this one's titled how to detect
mobile devices using PHP and serve up
alternate CSS stylesheets and there's
the code and just copy and paste right
there for your index our PHP file so
this is a home page that is set up to
serve up a default CSS if the person's
not using an iPhone or they're not using
the Google operating system Android if
they happen to be using the iPhone
they'll get iPhone dot CSS as the style
for the website if they're using the
Android then Android dot CSS is to stop
because you see right here where we
define the link for the stylesheet
which is simply echoing a stylesheet
variable that changes here according to
what people are using okey dokey on to
method number three which is using
javascript browser detection and the
Navigator object to redirect or change
your styles up so let's go and check out
that page there's the URL and you can
see it uses JavaScript in the head of
the HTML document and what it does is it
does pretty much what the first PHP file
that I showed you did it just redirects
to a new home page if they happen to be
using that device if not if they're on
regular Firefox or in an explorer on
their computer or whatever they'll see
this content here which is the default
content in the page so that's how it
works now let's take a look at the
fourth method which is do not detect and
just serve up a link or button to the
mobile version of your website so
basically what you could do is when
somebody comes to your website it could
be the standard version that order just
a regular version of your website that
they see at first maybe you can have a
nice size button there that has maybe a
mobile phone or mobile device on it
indicating to them that they can click
that and go to the mobile version of
your website that way you don't have to
do any work really for detection
so four methods that I would suggest if
you want to really detect and serve up
alternate content to people using
handheld or mobile devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
