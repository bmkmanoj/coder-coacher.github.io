easiest way to make a responsive and
mobile-friendly website layout okay
we're going to begin with a normal
layout that has no media query logic so
you can see I have a 100 or 1,000 pixel
width container centered if I get down
to mobile size or smaller screen you can
see no changes apply and that would be
way too big for a mobile mobile phone
screen because then they'd have to
scroll this way a lot to see the whole
thing and that's not good you don't want
to have any horizontal scroll really for
smartphone users ok so now watch how
easy it is okay now watch how easy it is
for me to go in here and just add a CSS
media rule it's going to change up the
default styling this default styling
here can be changed up inside of this
rule so our media rule is targeting
screen type devices with the feature of
max width of 768 so all screens that are
768 pixels and less will get the changes
applied let's take a look let's shrink
down to 768 and you see what happens and
I think I can make the padding 1% to fix
that vertical scroll at that size let's
see yep see the I mean horizontal scroll
you see the way I had the padding set
before there was a horizontal scrollbar
here at the bottom you want to make sure
there's no horizontal scroll when you
get down to that size you can see I'm
changing the size of the font the text
right here changing the h2 to 0.9 am
changing the P to 0.7 am that way my
content fits in there and it's not the
words aren't so giant on the tiny
smartphone screen so you can see that is
the simplest way because you'll have
your default CSS and this can also go in
your external stylesheet so you can have
your default CSS and then at the bottom
of your stylesheet you can
put a media query and then change the
default styles you can change the body
styles and any kind of elements that you
want to target you can also make some
elements display:none so they just don't
display at all for smartphone users
maybe you're displaying Google ads or
something that are 728 pixels wide or
wider maybe 900 pixels wide and that
won't do on a smartphone screen you'll
have to make that display:none or change
to responsive ads sizes or you can put
like a 300 pixel wide ad so any elements
that you want to make appear only for
smartphone users you could put here and
make them display:block and then up top
just make sure they're display:none
so desktop users wouldn't see them at
all so what I'm saying is desktop users
can see one container and smartphone
user can see you know altogether
different container by using
display:none and display block for
instance if I want this to not display
I'll put display:none for smartphone
users then P elements won't display see
it's there for a desktop but when he
gets to a small screen the P element
just goes away so that's how you can use
the display property if you want now I
don't want anybody to focus on the
particular adjustments that I made
because you would have completely
different CSS for your existing website
or a website that you're building and
you would have totally different changes
going on for people with smaller screens
now if you want to target to where it's
only going to happen if the device max
width is 768 now if we take a look at
that and we try and resize it you'll see
that no changes are seen but it would be
seen if somebody comes to your document
on a smart phone they would see the the
little blue mobile version because width
and device width are two totally
different things so I'll just leave this
on max width now to explain that further
I'm going to lead you guys to a document
that developed PHP that will explain
the media rule to you in-depth if if you
guys if some of you want to know the
nuts and bolts behind the media rule in
CSS and this page really goes in depth
about the syntax of it it shows you some
examples the media types query tokens
that you can apply media features that
you can put conditions in place for so
this page might prove handy to some of
you guys that want to really understand
the nuts and bolts and I'll put the link
to this page in the description of the
video along with the page that houses
this code example so there's different
ways you can set up media queries and
I've seen some developers they'll have
one media query for their normal desktop
users then they'll have another media
query for the small screen users but it
really you can just put your default CSS
for desktop users on top and then under
that just put a media query that will
change that default CSS to CSS styling
that's more compatible for smaller
screens that's it and you can have as
many media queries that you like inside
of your styling now I have some handy
tips and tip number one is consider
using percentage widths instead of pixel
widths you'll have different size
smartphone screens so you don't want to
have pixel width because different
people on different smartphones will see
things differently so you want to have
percentage widths and make sure that the
container is centered using margin zero
pixel Auto so you put margin CSS
property with zero pixel Auto and then
it'll Center that container and if you
have a percentage width it will take up
a percentage of the screen and it will
be equal for all people to view it tip
number two is separate your links and
buttons far enough apart for a
comfortable finger use you want to make
sure that people with fat fingers aren't
hitting multiple links at the same time
when they're clicking you can give your
buttons or links some padding that will
make the button a little bit bigger
itself give the user something more to
click on and between the buttons you can
give them margin space a little more
margin space than you normally would
because you know how a mouse pointer is
just that very precise
tip that clicks but a finger is a lot
different that's why you can have links
a lot closer together on a big giant
screen a desktop screen because the user
has a mouse usually and actually a lot
of the desktop screens are turning into
touchscreens so you just might want to
keep this rule this tip as a general
rule for all future development projects
and tip number three will make sure
there is no horizontal scroll at all so
all of your content should fit
comfortably within the tiny little
screen and make sure that the user does
not have to pinch and zoom a lot to
interact with your content or read it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
