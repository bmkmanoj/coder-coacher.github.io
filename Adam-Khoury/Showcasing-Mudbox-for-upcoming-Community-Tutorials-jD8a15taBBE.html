and show you some things that I've
created with it because i'm going to
start delivering some tutorials on how
to create things inside of mud box and
so let's look at some things that i've
created in Mudbox or that I've sculpted
and taken into flash and animated
actually I taken them in from mud box
into the Swift 3d animated them then
brought them into flash for displaying
on web pages this one is a demon scope
that a demon head looks really cool look
at those awesome effects the shadows and
reflections swift 3d renders out it's
great but what's great about Mudbox
here's another version of that demon
what's great about mudbox is you have
the the ability to do organic polygon
model sculpting mesh model sculpting
look how organic and in detail you can
get with your with your sculpting and
your your 3d characters it's it's sick
man but let's see this guy is really
cool
it's a guy just a model I created of a
head with his eyes closed he kind of
looks like the dude from what's that
video game hit man it looks like the
Hitman guy I did a good job on that one
let's see what else we have is him in a
white background got a goblin it's
pretty cool little Goblin I didn't
finish his teeth what else there's a
little robot that wasn't made in Mudbox
though this was made in Mudbox it's a
stingray that is funky fresh so you can
do really nice organic sculpting and
bring it into 3ds max Maya Swift 3d
because it renders out object files I do
believe and for importing into Swift 3d
i use i create you bring them into maya
then Maya will render out as dxf and
then dxf files or D of X DX f I think
it's dxf dxf can be imported into Swift
3d and that's that's how I get the I put
the disks under them in Swift 3d I
animate them and then I bring them into
flash but Mudbox is where you can get
the I think that's all of them
I've got a few more somewhere but that
shows you the you know a good example of
what you can create inside of mud box
and I'm going to be showing you in the
first set of tutorials the interface is
getting familiar with the program and
then we'll really delve into making some
really cool organic sculptures 3d models
and you can bring them into Maya 3ds max
Swift 3d any modeling program any any
program that deals with 3d objects
models object files and things of that
nature so we'll get to some tutorials on
my box real soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
