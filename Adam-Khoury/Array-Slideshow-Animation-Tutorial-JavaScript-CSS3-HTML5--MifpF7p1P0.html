program
array-based animated slideshows into
your page elements using javascript and
css3 first let's take a quick look at
the finished product of what you'll be
learning the program what happens is
every two seconds the words fade in and
out using an array and once the array
gets to the last word the end of the
array then it just goes back to the
beginning of the array and starts over
and it's basically just a slideshow and
you can put any kind of HTML content you
want into any element on the page
okay we're beginning with the bare bones
of an html5 web document mine is named
example dot HTML you name yours whatever
you want I have a style element in place
inside of the head element and I also
have a script element in place inside of
the head element and then my body tag is
empty right now
so let's start with that let's type in
my dog is then here we're going to put a
span element because I want it to be in
line with the rest of my sentence my
little slide show but you can use a div
I'm going to give this span an ID that's
equal to WS s that's short for words
slideshow so in this span element is
where all the magic is going to happen
now in the CSS in our document we're
going to put a rule that is targeting
that WSS ID on the page and let me bring
these down a little bit opacity is zero
to start out with that way it's
transparent 100% and then I put the
WebKit and then the standard syntax for
the transition property and we just want
to make sure that anytime the opacity is
changed for that element that it happens
in an animated fashion using this
transition property and I just put
WebKit to make sure it targets other
webkit-based browsers that might not use
the standardized transition syntax yet
but most browsers use the standardized
transition syntax already this line is
just in place as a fail-safe so really
in the future this line
right here would not be needed and
that's all the CSS we need and really we
only put this in place because in our
JavaScript is going to be changing of
the opacity for this element on the page
and when JavaScript changes the opacity
we're not going to make the animation
JavaScript based the animation is going
to be css3 based because we have already
instructed this element anytime it's
opacity changes that it's going to be an
animated transition when it does change
it's not going to be a sudden change in
values it's going to be a transitional
change in its opacity so one line in
JavaScript can trigger that change now
let's go into our JavaScript and make
the program happen and we don't need
much JavaScript at all it's very
lightweight first thing we'll do is
assign some variables for the program
I'll put var WSS underscore I and this
stands for the index which usually you
would see that as I but I don't want it
to interfere with any of your other
stuff you have might have going on on
your page so I just put it WS s
underscore I this value will be
incremented in the program when it runs
you'll make that starting value 0 and
we're going to use this value to
traverse through the array now the next
variable we're going to create is the
word slideshow array we'll make that
equal to an empty array and then we'll
start putting some values in it I'll put
the first one was cute the second
element in that array is going to be the
word happy and here's three more
elements in that array so my slideshow
is going to start at the word queue and
it's going to traverse through this
array until it gets to the word loyal
and then it's going to start over the
front of the array again and it'll just
keep looping like that
so right under where I assign this array
I can put my first function I'm going to
have two little tiny functions the first
one will name function word slideshow
next open close parenthesis opening
curly brace and go down a couple of
lines and put in your closing curly
brace and you can just copy the
structure for that function go down one
line and put another function in place
and this one you want to name WS s slide
and before we get too far into it let's
put one more variable call
LM up in the top of the script okay now
all we have to do is go into the HTML
and anywhere after the element that
you're targeting which in my case it's
this ID of WS s I'm going to put in a
new script tag right here and make sure
I close that script tag or that script
element actually let's give this LM
variable at WS s prefix there so let's
take that variable name and after the
element on the page is loaded that means
when it's ready in the DOM and we can
then script to it we're going to type in
WS s L M is equal to document dot get
element by ID we'll target that ID on
the page which was WS s this ID right
here for this span element now I'm doing
that so that way my program knows which
element to affect and I don't have to
keep assigning which element to effect I
won't have to keep referencing a new
document object each time that these
functions run because it's assigned
right here or you can do it in onload
event the window dot onload event you
can assign some variables in the window
dot onload event and then start up your
animation but I'm just going to put it
down here in the page under the target
element now all I have to do is take
this slide function and that's going to
initiate the whole process so right here
we run the slide function and the slide
function is going to trigger the next
function and then they're just going to
kind of bounce off one another all right
the first thing in the slide function is
we're going to target the WSS underscore
element variable which is the object
reference for the element that we're
targeting on the page the element that
the slideshow is going into so we target
that and we make it stat innerhtml equal
to the array whatever
array index we're at within our
increment of this I variable and
incrementing of the I variable is going
to happen right here so we can say WSS
underscore I plus plus
that's where we're going to do the
incrementing of the index so basically
the first time it runs this is going to
be WS s underscore I is going to be
equal to 0 so it's going to target cute
the second time it runs it's going to be
a 1 because it gets incremented and then
we're going to have happy display and
then the third time it'll be playful so
on and so forth when it gets too loyal
we're going to make it go back to the
beginning now there's just two more
lines we need down in this slide
function let's pop those into place and
what this line does is it also targets
the same element style property and the
opacity setting for that element and
remember when I said we're going to
change the opacity for that element
there's no JavaScript animation
happening here we're just simply
specifying for the opacity to turn from
zero to one and when it happens css3 is
going to handle the transition using
this line here for the opacity property
and that animation happens over one
second in a linear fashion and it has a
zero second delay now the next line is
to make the next array element come into
place so what we're going to do is run
the WSS next function and that's what
makes the slideshow occur you can change
this to a 5 or a 10 if you want so that
means when this function is called to
run right here these lines of code are
going to execute and then this line of
code tells this function to run two
seconds after this line is read by the
compiler so once this line is read by
the compiler the program waits two
seconds and executes this w sss next
function okay so remember when I told
you we increment the I variable inside
of the next function next thing we're
going to do in that function is we're
going to target the element style
opacity and make it equal to zero
because down here it was changed to one
that means everything is displaying so
when it's a transition occurring we're
going to make it go to zero again and
then we simply need an if condition to
make the I index incrementer or
incremental variable go back to zero
once it reaches the end of this array so
pop that logic into place real quick so
we say if the eye index number gets
greater than our array and our array is
right here dot length minus one and our
array length is 1 2 3 4 5 so this array
length minus 1 is 4 so if WS s I is
greater than 4
in our case then we're going to make the
incremental variable back to 0 again and
that's what makes the array loop and
then the very last line of the program
is we make the WS s slide function run
one second after this line of code runs
so when the compiler reaches this line
of code the program waits one second and
then runs this function again so
basically these two functions are
bouncing off of one another this one
when a compiler reaches this line the
program waits two seconds to initiate
this function when the compiler reaches
this line the program waits one second
to initiate or execute this function
here so this is bouncing off of each
other that way and I have a 1 second
time value here because my animation is
1 second and my numbers might not even
be precise you might have to tweak the
numbers to where it's more logical but
let's take a look at it in our favorite
browser so it starts with my dog is cute
you can see the animation occurs and it
looks decent to me it looks like it's
changing the words right where it should
with in the transition animation so when
it gets too loyal goes back to cute you
see now all we have to do is just put an
h1 heading around all that stuff and my
span is within that heading now so I'll
see it a little bit bigger
okay I just want to give a few final
pointers to people who are interested
all of this can be packaged up into an
object-oriented class file in JavaScript
that way you can be more reusable and
the numbers can probably be tweaked to
where they make more sense or it makes a
better animation I don't know and what
else this this array can have as many
items that you want in it and the script
will still work dynamically without you
having to adjust any of the values so
you can put as many elements that you
want you see I only have five you can
have a hundred or a thousand elements in
that array and yes this can be HTML
content where you're adding images or
whatever you want so for example if I
was to add an HTML element there like
the underline what was the first one
cute so you can see now you can stack as
much HTML as you want within this string
so if I take a look at this now the word
cute should be underlined but not any of
the others you see so you can see how
HTML let's wait for it to come back
around
so you can see how the HTML is passed
through there no problem so you can put
images whatever you want in your
slideshow and if you want you can just
put these down like one line here or put
them something like that and then put
them each on their own line if you want
to put a lot of HTML in there and
structure it like that that would be a
good structure if you wanted to add a
lot of HTML into each one of these array
elements but since mine is just four
words I'm going to leave it just like
that I wrote it just this afternoon
hastily I wrote it hastily so they can
probably be refined all right so that
shows you how to create any kind of
slideshow you want really using
javascript and css3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
