we're creating in this fireworks cs4
tutorial it's a nice menu bar completely
designed in fireworks and programmed in
fireworks to make all the buttons have
rollover effects and active without even
using Dreamweaver without opening
Dreamweaver at all we'd set it all up in
fireworks
hello everybody Adam at flash building
here with another fireworks cs4 tutorial
and this lesson comes courtesy of Chris
Truman he's one of our new forum members
from Canada and he states that I'm new
at this and I have my site all mocked up
in fireworks and I'm using one of the
pre-made menu bars in the common library
but I can't figure out how to bring it
to life with rollovers and then export
it properly so it'll be functional in
Dreamweaver for cs4 please help PS I'm
trying to use menu bar for and I wrote a
couple of replies and I just told them
that I would go ahead and make a
tutorial on because it's a little
involved and so I wanted to get it get
it down on video for you guys so
everybody can benefit from it and so
first thing we'll do is open fireworks
so we're in fireworks cs4 and he said he
was using menu bar number four from the
common library so let's go ahead and
create a new document 1000 by 200 that's
good
and let's see this in place here now if
you don't have your common libraries
available you can go up to window common
libraries they are press f7 in the
common library down in the menus folder
menu bar folder he's working with menu
bar number four he says that's a
nice-looking one too okay so one thing
to note is that with these menu bars
from the common library all it is is
graphics if you double click inside of
it you'll see this text fields that's
just a rectangle that's just a rectangle
and so let's double click to get back
out into the main state and then so
you'll see that this symbol houses all
those elements and you could very well
just draw a rectangle out and that can
be your bar and you can make custom
graphics custom texts any shapes any
sizes any style and I'm gonna go ahead
and fit canvas and so I just wanted to
mention that just so you don't you guys
don't assume that you have to use these
common library menus you can design your
own custom menus with your own custom
looks but using these in the common
library they're really nice looking for
the web but you can use custom ones so
let's go ahead and fit canvas first
thing and now I'm going to show you how
to make rollover functionality because
if we press f12 right now and render
this in the browser it doesn't do
anything it's just graphics but he wants
to know how to bring it to life so
that's what we're gonna show him how to
do within fireworks just exported all
ready to go in Dreamweaver
okay so
let's go ahead and save this file save
as let's go to the desktop let's make a
new folder called Chris Truman site
double click inside and let's save this
as menu bar for menu bar for underscore
file save it's at PNG file okay so now
that's in the root the root document or
the root directory the root folder of
our website and the first thing we want
to do is set up a couple of states and
since this is just graphic so let's go
ahead and double click inside of this
grab that little rectangle out press
control X on that double click back and
then there's the symbol again and right
on top of the symbol we're gonna put
that rectangle back so it's not nested
inside of that menu bar symbol anymore
it's on its own
just control-c control-v and i'm just
gonna set it up to where each one of
these has grabbed both of these by
pressing shift as we select them press
ctrl-c ctrl-v move them over so this
will be the ordinary normal state that
the people would see if we press f12
render it out so that's what they would
see ordinarily when they come and they
open the web application or the website
now we want to make it to where there's
an overstate and these would change the
way they look when the person's mouse
goes over it and you have to add the
behaviors to it and it just doesn't
happen automatically so you have to add
behaviors add the links you want you
know things like that so that's what
we'll do okay so first I'll show you how
to make just these buttons a regular
have rollover effects and link to some
page or some site whatever you want to
do I'll show you how to make the links
and then once that's all set and we've
achieved our goal and we have exported
files for Dreamweaver and ready to use
on a website with navigation and all
then I'm going to show you how to expand
the size of the stage a little and make
it to where one of these buttons has a
drop-down menu nice rollover drop-down
menu and I'll show you how to set that
up and I'll discuss it when we get there
but first let's achieve our primary goal
so what we want to do is go into States
and States is like frames if you're used
to working in fireworks cs3 or other
previous versions then you would see
this or recognize this as being frames
but now they renamed it to States I
guess it makes more sense to them I
don't know why they did that kind of
ticked me off
it's more for the web friendly jargon
now the lingo is more web friendly to
call it States because a lot of people
are using this for web stuff now instead
of just animations and such but it's
just like frames for making animations
and this is how you make an animated gif
you can just put a bunch of states in
there and there they act like frames and
they run press play and you see all your
frames out okay and then you export it
as an animated gif but you guys know how
to do that so anyhow let's make one more
new state and I'm state1 so now we have
state one and state two and state one
you see it's the only one with items on
it so let's copy those items press ctrl
C one state to press ctrl V and it
doesn't like look like you went to the
right spot let's put it in the right
spot I need to go over
and maybe I could have duplicated that
better or whatever but now they're in
the same exact spot all the elements
state - we want to change these four
buttons the way they look so let's go
into the fill and change it from black
to a nice blue and then also let's
change the edge
change the edges - well let's just
change that to white so you guys see a
good dramatic effect then we'll change
this edge from not so dark to a little
lighter maybe
yeah that way we'll see a difference but
I want you guys to see a major
difference so just change this to white
okay so now we have state 1 it's the
normal state state 2 it's going to be
the rollover state it's very simple and
you can even name those if you want to
do believe yep you can rename those to
normal and rollover let's close that and
now we want to go into the layers and
lock all the graphics on that layer 1 on
the web layer now we're going to add a
slice you can use the slice tool or the
rectangle hotspot tool and I do believe
both will give you the same
functionality if you use the polygon
slice you can make any custom shapes
it's pretty cool but for this we're just
going to use slice the regular slice
rectangle slice and draw it out we'll
drag it out over that first button put
it where we want it to where the mouse
will be active when it's over that move
it into place now let's click
well let's go ahead and close this
now these slices where all the magic
happens the rest is just graphics but
the states are very important as well so
let's this first slice let's go ahead
and click it in the center and that dot
let's add simple rollover behavior now
let's test its press f12 publish it out
now none of these are active up but that
one is look at that and it's working in
the browser just like it would be on a
website if you want to add the link to
where that would go
you highlight the hotspot or highlight
that slice put the link let's say HTTP
colon slash slash www dot slash building
comm target let's make it blank so it
opens a new window you want to stay in
the same window you use self and let's
put alt flash building whatever ok so
now that's the alt the link is in now
let's press f12
so we see when I go over it it has the
alt tag comes up use the flash building
and then if I click it opens a new
window straight to flash building so
that's it my brother you got your
functionality right there and if you go
into that folder well let's go ahead and
show you how to do the other three
highlight that one press ctrl-c ctrl-v
slide it over into place using your
arrow key or you can just grab it and
drag it control-c control-v to it to the
next one control C control V and the
next one
that looks good now let's see what
happens
now they should since we ctrl-c and
ctrl-v copied and pasted or copy
yep copied and pasted then we we kept
the simple rollover functionality for
all of those but they'll all be going to
flash building all you have to do is go
down here and change your link let's go
ahead and change this one to develop PHP
comm this one and then you change the
alt tags and everything I'm go to Adam
Cory calm you changed at all you know
Adam Cory usually these would be going
to pages within your site so those last
one if it was a page on your site you
just make it contact say you want to go
to the contact page contact up PHP or
contact HTML
and then alt tag would be contact us now
let's press f12 contact us and there's
no page it should not bring up anything
this one since there's no page in our
site called contact it's not gonna bring
up anything this one's gonna open a new
window
- Adam Cory calm Oh check out this
opening it's cool
dad's funky fresh you can transform it
too
okay this one can open up develop PHP so
you see it all works beautifully that's
how it's done my friend so you all you
do is you go to that folder is the
Christian site and inside you have a
menu bar file so what we want to do is
export it now file export no not export
wizard no file
export see it's gonna export HTML and
images and everything you need let's go
into that Chris Truman site right there
it's exported as menu bar menu bar done
when you bought for word unsaved now
let's go back into that folder and look
and see what we have
looky there let's just go into the list
of you look at all that beautiful stuff
you got now now you go into this HTML
file and you open that with not
Dreamweaver eight open with let me just
open Dreamweaver cs4 and I'll I'll go
and target that file
now doctor to open desktop Chris Truman
site and there's that HTML file let's
open it up and inspect it there you go
buddy now you know how to publish out in
Dreamweaver you just press f12 you see
there's your site I'm ready to go and
you can piece the elements together or
you can make one huge page in and
fireworks there and I think I'm gonna
leave it at this and if you guys enjoyed
this tutorial and you'd like to see more
on setting up fireworks web layouts to
be active and ready to go when you
export out of fireworks you can
manipulate them further than Dreamweaver
then just rate this video high comment
on it tell me in the comment section
that you want to see more and I'll show
you how to expand this down and make
that drop-down menu I was talking about
and that's pretty cool too you may drop
down menus with as many items as you
want in them and we use CSS to cleverly
lay it on top and like I said if you
want to see more if this is interesting
to you just let me know by commenting
and rating the video high okay guys
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
