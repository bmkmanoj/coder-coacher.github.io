lesson we're going to discuss the
required attribute that you can place
from the input tag for your forms so
here's the finished product of what it
renders if I try to submit this form
without filling in my user name it pops
up a little tip that says this is a
required field and you'll notice that
the form did not submit the form will
not submit and it will not process
unless that field is filled in okay so
here's a very simple example of an html5
document it's the old regular stuff
we're all used to from HTML 4 it's an
input type text with a name you name and
the ID is you name and here we have a
submit button with type submit you can
see we wrapped our form elements in the
form tag this time just to show you how
it won't submit the form alright so
right here in the input that you want to
be required whatever fields you just put
in required and that's it press ctrl s
then you file preview and browser and
check it in opera because opera seems to
render it real nice the other browsers
might not yet wife I press submit there
it is and you can see it didn't process
the form now let's run it without that
ctrl s file preview and browser opera
I'm going to press submit and you see
this it's submit the form you name
equals nothing
let me type something in and submit it
you name equals that editor that so if
we have our required attribute set there
and this is Abilene by the way to true
or false so once you place that word
right there basically you're setting the
boolean to true for that input field to
make it required now let's file preview
in browser opera and now if I press
submit I get that thing in submit and it
doesn't submit the form that's nice and
then by type in it will submit the form
and send my variable of you name with
the value that I typed in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
