my desktop background image can be seen
by viewers and many people ask me where
I got it or how I made it so in this
lesson we're gonna demonstrate how to
create stunning color spectrum web page
backgrounds or desktop wallpaper
backgrounds so here's my desktop
wallpaper that everyone asks about and
since so many people ask I thought a
tutorial would be appropriate that way
you can make your own any style you want
any colors you want first let's go to
file new put the settings you want in
for your file press ok now make sure you
have the gradient tool selected and you
can change the color of your gradient
before you even draw it you see mine
goes from black to white now I'm gonna
go right about here click down hold and
drag all the way up to the top and then
let go
okay so drawing from the bottom up gives
us a gradient going from white to black
now let's go to filter distort wave and
then you can preview the different types
you have sine triangle and square I'm
gonna choose square you can also play
with these things to get different
effects so if I change this from 5 to
something like 15 my little preview
window changes and I wanted something
more like that you can also play with
the amplitude so once you play with
everything you get it looking how you
want it and you press ok then we're
gonna double click the layer let's name
it colour spectrum BG ok now double
click the layer again now we're going to
go down here and the Styles - gradient
overlay let's set the blend mode you can
use either multiply or linear burn we'll
both give you a good look I'm going to
use multiply and I'm going to click the
gradient and I'm gonna choose the
spectrum and I can change the colors all
I want okay now let's change the angle
to a zero
so you can see what happens when you
change the angle the closer you get to 0
the more it goes vertical and you can
play with the scale
and there's also the style setting' but
you would want to leave it on linear for
this if we put it on radial you can play
with all these on your own just gonna
leave it on linear and if you play with
the opacity
it'll take those hard colors down make
them kind of pastel sort of like that
put them all the way back on 100 and the
colors full as okay now anytime you want
to adjust that you can just double click
your gradient overlay for instance if I
want to change my blend mode at any time
I can go to linear burn and you can play
with all of these blend modes to see
exactly what it'll do for you
