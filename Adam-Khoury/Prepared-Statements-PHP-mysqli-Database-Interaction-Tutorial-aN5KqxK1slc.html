prepared statements using PDO in this
exercise will demonstrate how to prepare
statements using the MySQL I extension
our goal is to create a prepared
statement that will insert users into
this people table so we'll show how to
prepare the statement and then execute
it multiple times the first thing we'll
do is create a variable that represents
the MySQL I database connection handler
so say MySQL I is equal to new MySQL I
class in between the parentheses we'll
put in the parameters for connecting to
our database and then the next line
we're going to put in a little if
condition in place just to catch any
MySQL connection errors if you happen to
put the wrong information in here now
we'll create a variable that represents
our SQL syntax and then let's put a
little note to ourselves above that so
you see for the values parameters
there's little question marks so the
note reads the question marks below our
parameter markers used for variable
binding now let's create the statement s
TMT is equal to MySQL I variable and we
run the prepare function prepare open
close parenthesis semicolon and then
we'll put our SQL syntax right there so
this SQL syntax is going to be your
template of sorts for your prepared
statement now we can just grab that
variable and on the next line we're
going to bind these parameters to
variables so we'll type in St MT and
we'll run the bind param function / M
we'll just put a little note that says
bind variables now the first parameter
represents the type of data so what I'm
going to put is string string string s
represent string because I'm going to
have three variables so my next
parameter is the first variable is going
to be U which represents the user name
in the database the next variable is
going to be G which represents gender
column in the data
and the next variable is going to be C
which represents the country column in
the database so you see we have SSS that
means string string string each one of
these variables are strings and here are
the different options that you can apply
there you see I'm using the S which is
string and there's the I if you want to
have an integer type data or the D if
it's a decimal number and then B is for
blob type data so that's why I have 3
s's in place now what we're going to do
is populate the variable data so the
username will be ant on gender will be
male the country's from is Sweden now
all we have to do is execute the
prepared statement so we'll put the
statement variable here and then we'll
run the execute function and put a
little note right there to ourselves
execute the prepared statement so at
that point you're going to get an insert
now we're prepared statements come in
handy is let's go ahead and run that
again now when the second insert occurs
there's going to be resources saved
because the system the MySQL database
system doesn't have to analyze or
optimize the query because it's already
been optimized in the prepared statement
and analyzed so now in the demo you'll
have two inserts there now the next
thing you can do on the statement
variable is close the prepared statement
you can run the close function then
we're going to target the MySQL I
variable we're going to close that as
well so that shows you the basics of
working with prepared statements now I'm
going to run this on my server after I
put in my database credentials and then
I'll check my database for the results</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
