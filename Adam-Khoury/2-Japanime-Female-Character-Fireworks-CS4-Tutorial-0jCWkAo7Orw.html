continuing and are creating our cute
little sexy Japan and my style character
female character and we gave her a mouth
nose and tongue and some eyebrows
okay now let's give our eyebrows start
right about here and using the pen tool
once again let's go right about there
make a little arc then click down here
on that anchor point and then click down
here on this anchor point and then just
bring up I just a little bit make your
arc that's where it looks right and
press control-c I don't think we want
any edge on that there we go
control C control V modify transform
flip horizontal or use your little tools
up here and then we can get it into
place on this side
so look about right
yep
okay so there's some eyebrows let's put
them further over usually these kind of
characters have eyeball eyeball spread
far apart okay so what I did on the the
face so far was I just gave it an inner
glow of 21 6% visible 30% softness and
it has a little gray edge but it's not
going to remain that way so I want to
make it have a little more of a peach
peach color to the face
right about there that has a really nice
fleshy tone to it and it also set with a
radial gradient radial and you can move
the radiant grade the radiant the
gradient wherever you like you see you
put it on top of the head like that I'm
just gonna keep mine or Center right
there okay now we can create the nose
and the mouth which this should be
pretty simple okay so to create her cute
and sexy little mouth we'll grab the pen
tool let's just start right about here
in the middle and click down and drag it
just a little make it straight drag it
just a little bit and then come around
here click down and drag that just a
little bit let go come around to here
click down and drag that just a little
bit let go and then when you come back
and select it but when you see see how
my when my mouse gets close to this
Anchor Point it finishes the arc
perfectly for you you don't even have to
click down and stretch the arc it does
it for you so you just click and there's
a nice little shape for the mouth let's
bring it up just a little bit so it's
not so tall
that works okay now for the nose we can
just bring out an ellipse
I'm about like that that looks good and
we're going to make it a solid color of
this color right here so we can just go
to our color selector and with the ink
blotter just go right there
so now we have a little ellipse that we
can't even really see but we're going to
put an inner shadow on it go to filters
with it selected shadow and glow inner
shadow let's modify that to where the
shadow is coming from the bottom so make
it 90 on the angle and we also want a
little more spread on it right about
there
bring this down capacity down to about
32 34 36 that looks good bring this up
actually seven looked right maybe six
five and the color wants to be this
peach here so we can dab that peach make
it a little darker see drag that down
okay and there's a little nose
let's see if we make it a little bit
taller might look better that works it's
cute little nose
just to shadow a little bit more that
works for me
she's cute once we get a hair on her
she's gonna look really cute okay so
let's take the mouth and make it a
little bit smaller and what we're gonna
do is give that an outer glow actually
before I do that I'm gonna see if I can
actually get a tongue in there so zoom
in a little press ctrl-c ctrl-v put
another copy of that right on top of
itself there and now what we'll do is
grab the a doughnut so we can make an
Arctic nice little arc to cut that we
want just make this solid bring the
opacity down a little bit right about
there so we highlight the doughnut and
the mouth copy there go to modify
combine paths and punch now this one
will just make solid
deep red
let's bring its opacity down a little
there we go yeah now she's got a proper
tongue and now I'm gonna give this an
outer glow glow white
and get nice and bright not too much
spread on it
right about there okay we're getting
there now now we can do the the funnest
part and what it really bring her to
life is the hair and I'm not sure what
color hair I'm gonna go with for this
next one but maybe maybe red red would
look pretty cool maybe even
some crazy green
that orange right there would look hot
okay we'll see next lesson we'll make
some hair and we'll slap it on there and
then maybe even go so far is making a
whole character and then I'll slap it on
the website and user is one of my little
characters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
