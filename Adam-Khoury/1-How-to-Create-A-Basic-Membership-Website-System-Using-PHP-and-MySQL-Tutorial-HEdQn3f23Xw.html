learn PHP section of develop PHP calm
and down at the bottom there's quite a
few people that are waiting for me to
rerelease my how to build a basic
website membership system using PHP and
MySQL this is one of the first tutorials
I've ever put up on the site maybe about
two years ago and it's been there for
about a year and a half but maybe about
six months ago not even that long ago I
took it all down and a lot of people are
requesting for me to please place it
back up and the reason why is because I
made a long 30 part series that was
involving flash and ActionScript 3 in a
header file that was the login mechanism
and logout mechanism and it was it took
care of some other things but a lot of
people were having trouble with dealing
with flash and ActionScript 3 in regards
to PHP and MySQL so I think the fact
that we had a flash header in that
series that was calling out to PHP and
MySQL is what was making a lot of people
have problems with that series so this
one is going to be a lot more basic and
it'll be better for extend ability for
you because you'll have a better grasp
of what's going on because there won't
be any flash or ActionScript 3 involved
and we're just going to stick to PHP
MySQL and CSS and of course HTML and
it's not going to be anywhere near 30
parts ok now after your database is
created you have two options you can
create your tables in that database and
manipulate the database using PHP
scripts which is a little more advanced
or you can just work in PHP myadmin with
this series I'm going to opt to go into
PHP myadmin because I think it's a lot
easier for beginners to grasp what's
going on using phpMyAdmin and also a lot
of people had problems with the create
table script that we had in the last
series because there either their
connection data was wrong or the syntax
was wrong in the script various things
will make it not work if you go into PHP
myadmin
it's sure to create the table and work
for you
so you can knock out those kind of
problems occurring with the create table
script and everything like that will be
one step past that with no worries okay
so once we're inside we're going to
click on the left on the new database
that we created click it and it's going
to say create new table on the database
oh I'm going to give this table a name
that's inside of our new database and
let's call it members number fields 12
you can give it as many fields as you
want to hold as much data as you need
but I'm just going to show 12 for this
example which is going to hold their
email the password there their bio their
sign update their last login date or
whatever press GO and now we can start
populating each field to say what it's
going to be labeled and to also signify
which type of fields they are and have
default values or whatever the first one
is going to be ID and that's going to be
integer type and we're going to make
sure it's auto increment that way each
new person that joins it auto increments
that ID number and you don't have to try
and keep filling in new unique IDs it'll
do it automatically this is going to be
the primary key or the primary index now
the next one is going to be user name so
make that one say username
make it varchar' 255 I'm going to make
all of my varchars 255 because that
happens to be the limit on a varchar'
field anyway set yours to whatever you
think the max value would need be for
that field and the next one is going to
be but the max is 255 bytes so 255
characters or bytes
next one's going to be country then city
actually let's put state here state or
province whatever you want to have it be
City it's going to be the one after
state and we're going to have bio which
is going to be there about me section
where they can describe themselves then
we're going to have the email field
where the email is going to be stored
then their password field where their
password will be stored and it's going
to be hashed for security maybe at the
end in the last video of the series I'm
going to discuss discuss security pretty
in-depth so you can know what to watch
out for in your website let's make this
one last login that way you can research
or it on your own in your own time to
become fully aware let's call this one
account type and let's call this one
email activated because we want to make
sure they activate through email so once
we have all of those labeled let's go
ahead and finish their types country is
going to be varchar' 255 state is going
to be varchar' 255 city same thing and
bar chart means an assortment of
different characters whether it be
spaces punctuation symbols letters or
numbers that just means it could have
all kinds of various characters bio is
going to be text because we need that to
be a little longer than 255 bytes and I
think text is ten thousand bytes its
length and value or its length is ten
thousand bytes I believe I could be
wrong about that but if you need more
than ten thousand bytes ten thousand
characters or what-have-you use medium
text or long text long text will give
you the most but text is usually good
enough because it gives you a good ten
thousand I think ten thousand bytes that
can be gone into that field
ten thousand bytes that can be placed
into that field
email is going to be varchar' 255
password is also going to be varchar'
255 and remember that's going to be
hashed so sign up date is going to be
date time that way it records the date
they join and the time of day now this
one is going to be date time as well
this is going to be updated every time
they log in again after they log in the
first time you want to update this field
of last login to show when the last
login date and time was account type is
going to be eaten um and email activated
will also be eaten um now for eating
them you have to set values so you put
in actually down at the bottom usually
it shows you what kind of values and
format you need to put in that so this
one I'm going to have account type I'm
going to leave that ABC we'll say a is
for normal users B will give for users
who are have a little have maybe more
privileges than the a type and C they'll
have all privileges so they can do all
things on the site so you can have
different levels of account types to
give people different options of what
they can see when they log in what they
get and things like that email activate
is going to be a similar thing but
that's only going to be two values and
they're going to be sort of like bulan
zero and one zero meaning false one
meaning true so when they join it's
going to be zero so let's give that
default lets see where its default right
here
default as defined zero so we're going
to have a default value of zero so when
they join they're going to be set to
zero there and when they act when they
get the activation email in their email
inbox they click it they get activated
then we make a script that changes this
to a one that way they're fully
activated they can log in and do all the
stuff on the site they need to do now
last thing here is we need to do is set
the email field to unique let's go over
here to email set that to unique because
we only want to have one of each email
we basically you don't want duplicates
of emails in your database if you're
going to have this two kind of system
you don't want somebody to join with the
same email five times okay I think we're
all set everything looks good so now
we're going to go down to the bottom and
press save and there is your table but
pretty much at this point we're done in
phpMyAdmin and we should not have to
return unless we want to go back in and
do custom things maybe add field so
whatever
okey dokey so creating the main storage
mechanism for the whole site it's pretty
much set up and what we're going to do
is continue in a part two where we're
going to create the script that's going
to make sure that we can connect to that
database table because if we don't
connect to that database table
successfully then we can't go any
further in the system so once we make
sure we connect move at a nice pace
because we're sure that we're connected
and we can just script everything out in
PHP using MySQL queries we're going to
use the little CSS and HTML to structure
out the website make it look the way we
want okay so if you're enjoying this
series meet me in part two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
