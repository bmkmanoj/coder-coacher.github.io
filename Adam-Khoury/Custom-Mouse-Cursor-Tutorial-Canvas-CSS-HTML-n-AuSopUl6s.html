to be a little stand-alone quickie
alright alright we'll show you how to
get custom mouse cursors in your whole
page or maybe just a portion of the page
or just a specific element especially
handy when you're trying to change the
cursor the mouse cursor in the canvas
because sometimes you'll have video
games running in the canvas or some kind
of interactive application you might
want to change the mouse pointer to
maybe a crosshair for a gun or something
like that so people can shoot the stuff
okay we have the bare bones of an html5
document and you'll see the normal mouse
pointer the way that it looks so what
we'll do is welcome to our style element
or wherever your CSS happens to be and
we'll put the star symbol the asterisk
that will target every element in the
document and we'll put the cursor
attribute and URL for the cursor file
that we want to use and then we'll put a
comma and default to make it default and
I'm going to use my crosshair dot cur
file which is short for cursor and the
dot curve extension is for cursor files
now let's take a look in our browser and
you can see that we have the crosshair
has replaced the mouse now people can
shoot things on my web page so if you
were to look at this in Firefox you
probably wouldn't see your custom cursor
because the body height the body has no
height because there's no elements on
the page but if you had a regular page
that was already full of content you
would see the custom cursor but since my
page has nothing on it yet I'll have to
put in body height 100% of the viewport
height now if I preview this in Firefox
now I see the quarter see if I remove
that and then refresh in Firefox
no custom cursor so that's the only
reason I'm going to put body height 100%
of the viewport height but normally
you'd have a page full of things on it
already so you wouldn't have to worry
about that too much
so let's say if we put a button and then
the button text will be clicked me take
a look at that you see the hotspot for
the custom cursor is directly in the
center now you can also move that
hotspot by putting if I put 0 0 this is
the x-axis and this is the y-axis that
means it's going to be in the top-left
corner now the hotspot see see I was
clicking the button from the top-left
corner now so using these two numbers
you can move where the hotspot is for
the custom cursor according to the
numbers that you want to put in place
for the x and y position of the hotspot
and then if you wanted let's say some
certain elements to have the normal one
then you can take cursor property and
just put it on default and then when we
go over the button it turns back to the
normal arrow so the rest of the page
will be the custom cursor and then over
that element it'll be the normal arrow
now let's change this button to canvas
element and let's put in style rule for
the canvas and we'll make it to where
that cursor only shows up on the canvas
let's get rid of that and we won't need
that anymore let's take a look now when
somebody's playing the game and they go
with their mouse into the canvas area
that's when the crosshairs will show up
as the custom mouse cursor inside of the
game or interactive application that I
have going on in my canvas now you can
go to certain websites
that offer little applications where you
can create your own docker files and you
can design them to look like anything
you want that's how he created the
crosshair and some browsers might even
let you use a dot PNG file or a dot PNG
image or a jpg image but it might not
show up in all of the different browsers
so we already tested this in Chrome and
Firefox let's see it in Internet
Explorer say so it even works in
Internet Explorer with the docker file
so you can either look for free dot cur
files online or just use an application
that lets you create cursor files I
think you can create them in paint and
maybe even Photoshop I'm not sure about
that but you can try but there's
definitely tools online that will let
you create a dot cursor file and I think
there's some tools that will let you
convert like a PNG image to a cursor
file also let's just look around online
and see what you can find and that's
about it
so have fun creating your custom cursor
files so you can change that regular
arrow pointer to whatever kind of image
that you want or graphics for your games
and interactive applications or if you
just want to have a different mouse
cursor on the screen for your whole
entire webpage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
