learning how to create 3d rotation tilt
menus those are animated menus that tilt
when your mouse goes over it and when
Mouse goes out it goes back to normal
view and the buttons inside are
accessible clickable and they can
control movie clips that are on the main
timeline next to this movie clip next to
this menu and we had a forum thread at
develop PHP and everybody was saying
that it'd be so easy to do this in cs3
you don't necessarily need flash cs4 and
I wanted to show how easy it was to do
in flash cs4 that's why I put together
this tutorial and I would like to see
somebody code it out to where you can do
this in flash cs3 because it would take
a lot more ActionScript and a lot more
work I just wanted to kind of prove my
point and also give you guys a cool free
flash source file that you can download
and use for your Flash projects okay
let's rock and roll here we are in flash
cs4 professional we're going to create
new flash ActionScript 3 file and once
it pops up you can adjust your stage
properties to whatever you need them the
sizing and everything I'm just going to
leave it default sizing and first thing
I'm going to do is drag out a rectangle
primitive think about that big be any
size you need
give it a little bit of rounded edges
there
let's get rid of that stroke
so it just has a feel it's change the
fill colors or something we like
that will do now let's convert that to a
symbol let's call it my menu in the
library and to make sure it's a movie
clip symbol it's okay now let's give it
an instance name of my menu underscore
MC all right now we'll double click
inside of that and we're going to
convert the inner symbol to a movie clip
let's just name it inner menu click
enter menu symbol it's going to be a
movie clip symbol that's okay we don't
have to give it an instance name now
we're going to double click inside of
that one and we're going to create some
buttons there's one let's give it the
color we want I'm going to skew it or
gradient transform it I'm gonna give it
a gradient fill and then transform the
gradient around
that looks good I don't want it rounded
so I'm just going to set these back to
zero
okay now let's give them an edge to
now let's convert that to a symbol let's
call that button really call it whatever
you want
oh let me backtrack on that let's
convert that to symbol make sure it's a
button symbol if you want it to be a
movie clip and use it as a button that's
fine but I just want mine to be button
symbols so and then library its name
button it's a button type symbol okay
now let's give that an instance name of
BTN one underscore BTN
so that's button one control C control
shift V after you highlight it and that
will copy and paste it in place and do
it again control C control shift V copy
and paste in place now let's change
those instance names on the second and
third buttons - BTN - underscore BTN and
BTN three underscore BTN that way they
all have different instance names and we
won't get an error now we can code those
out before we start some code though
we're going to go double click or just
click on the my menu symbol here so
you're in that timeline and here is
where we're going to do the tilts
animation this is going to be a very
simple 3d rotation animation so let's
name the top layer I just created a
couple of layers here by selecting or
hitting the new layer button let's call
this a s3 let's make that a big a and
name this layer labels
that's where we're gonna put our frame
labels so let's go ahead and do that
press f6 make a new keyframe
put in the label name here we're gonna
put tilt because this is the frame where
we're gonna want our animation to begin
when they menu tilts and then we'll go
to a maybe frame 12 whatever you
whatever speed you wanted to tilt you
can set your frame separations and also
your frame rate frames per second 65
that's a little high let's go back down
to 30 okay
so 30 frames per second for our movie
right here we're going to give it a
label of normal so we have tilt then
normal let's press f5 to extend these
keyframes out so here with our symbol on
the tilt keyframe we're going to press
f6 on layer 1
let's name layer 1 menu because that's
where the menu resides so here we press
f6 and then here we'll press step 5
it'll bit so we can extend the keyframes
don't press f6 yet so right here in this
keyframe you're gonna create motion
tween
now here you're gonna press f6 it
creates a new keyframe there and on this
keyframe we're gonna go and press the
symbol and click the 3d rotation tool
actually let's go ahead and make some
keyframes here first for normal and not
let's not do that just yet
let's go ahead and skew it or tilt it so
with the 3d rotation tool selected then
you can add the tilt that you want so
let's tilt it just a little bit like
that and now let's press f6 here and
then at 6 here
so now on this keyframe the last
keyframe let's grab that 3d rotation and
roll it back so there we go
and then you see the animation when we
drag through there all until this will
happen on normal this will happen okay
so first we need stop actions before we
can leave this timeline but this
timeline is just about completely
finished here being assembled and let's
put a stop action here press f6 sto P
and I just added these to stop actions
you just saw to make sure that when the
person enters it just doesn't go and
play the tilt on its own we don't want
it to do it until a certain event
happens the mouse over so and also we
want it to stop at the end of this tilt
animation until they remove their mouse
from the menu and then it tilts back
that's how it works so let's put all the
code in to make it happen now and we're
going to start on scene 1 actually first
before we do that on scene 1 let's go
ahead and put a new layer and call it
text and this can be another element
that you want the buttons to affect but
for this demonstration I'm just gonna
put a dynamic text field and name it
status so we can know what button we
press that way you guys can do things to
other movie clips accordingly when these
three buttons are pressed and the movie
clip that you can effect is on the main
timeline with this menu okay so status
understood txt give it a color of black
dynamic let's make it a little bit
bigger right there so what will happen
is when you press a button after the
menu tilts and then you press a button
it will give a message to this status
text field which will be the equivalent
of allowing you to manipulate any movie
clip you want and do anything you want
to that movie clip and animated movie
clip whatever you have you want things
to fly out from the side of this menu
from the tilt menu after you press a
button you can do that okay so we're on
the main timeline there are text let's
make another layer and just call this a
s3 now let's open our actions panel by
pressing f9 type in some code let's make
sure we get the name of that movie clip
my menu underscore MC now we can connect
to that thing in the code my menu
underscore MC that add eventlistener and
this is Mouse event dot rollover
and the function that we want to name
that's going to buy off on rollover is
going to be rollover a menu let's make
it make some good sense okay so now we
just write that in function right here
we're building a function that's going
to fire off when the user roles over the
mouse or rolls over the menu with their
mouse and this is : void open curly
brace close curly brace this is Mouse
event so you put in between the
parentheses event colon Mouse event okay
so the function nest is all set up here
now we can put in what we want to happen
so we just take this instance name and
you want school MC my menu underscore
and see that go to and play tilt
because there's an animation there so we
have to instruct to go to and play if we
just say go through and stop that won't
the animation won't occur make sure
these are in-between double quotes
because it's a frame label the frame
label name of tilt that we want to
connect to that we made it inside of
that movie clip now let's just duplicate
that whole function and rename a couple
of things for the out mechanism when the
mouse rolls out roll out menu
that function name would be here and
this would be normal because that's I
think the instance name we gave those
let's check tilt and normal yes so
that's what's going to happen on
mouse-over we go to and play tilt and
onmouseout we go inside that movie clip
and play normal so let's test that out
now first control-enter that's pretty
cool huh it's a nice animation
and the buttons you can see are still
active they can be clicked but we
haven't coded those out to effect this
text field yet but sitting on the main
timeline okay so here this text field is
what we want to affect with these
buttons so let's go and dig into those
buttons dig into the movie clips say
we're on scene one we're going to double
click on this then double click on this
now we're inside the the inner symbol
where that base rectangle shape is in
the button sitting on top now let's make
another layer let's call it a s3 so we
can code out those buttons now to affect
anything we want in our movie at any
level
okay so let's highlight this
ActionScript 3 layer press f9 and let's
code it out
now we know our buttons are named BTN
one underscore BTN and BTN - and bt and
threes all the same so we'll just make
one function then we'll copy and paste
it two more times keep life easy and
this is going to be Mouse event
dot click when the button gets clicked
we want a certain action to happen we're
going to name it
keep it simple click 1 so now let's
create that function that will fire all
when the user clicks one of our buttons
function click 1 or when they click that
particular button click one this is
event : in Mouse event : void open curly
brace close curly brace and inside we
want to instruct the movie clip the
parent movie clip the parent timeline so
we're going to claim movie clip parent
if we try to effect this timeline
there's nothing happening in this
timeline so we have to affect the parent
timeline with the skew or the tilt is
occurring that go to and play oh
actually no we're gonna just instruct
that text field I forgot this has
nothing to do with the animation this is
just an example of how you can affect
other movie clips in the main timeline
that are next to your menu say you want
things to fly out when they click a
button so here we're gonna say that
status underscore txt that text and
let's just print out a message
equals
and the message can be clicked button
one very simple okay and see if that
looks right let's just try it out
yeah it works okay so now all we have to
do take that and duplicate it two times
and change this to three change that to
a three change this to a three and
change this to a three change this to a
to change this to a to change this to a
2 and that to a two now click or hit
control enter on your keyboard and
you'll see that all three buttons are
now activated and they will do certain
things that you want and that tilt menu
acts accordingly you can still access
the buttons even though they are deep
inside of this movie clip symbol as long
as you code your stuff out right okay
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
