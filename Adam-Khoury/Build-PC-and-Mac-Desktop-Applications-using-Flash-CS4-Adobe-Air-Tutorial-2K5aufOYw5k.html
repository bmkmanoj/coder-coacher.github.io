be showing you how to create your first
desktop application we all know what a
desktop application is we've all
downloaded them from the web a hundred
times and installed them on our hard
drive and we use them from our computer
that's what it's just a program that you
can create that you can put on the web
that people can download and use and
install on their hard drive and use on
their machines whether they're connected
to the web or not just like a test any
desktop application game or anything
like that comes with installer package
and everything I'm gonna show you all
that stuff how to create the installer
package how to get the file settings set
up on a basic level just for this opener
tutorial and then we'll delve into more
advanced things later on so the first
thing we're gonna do is create a flash
file Adobe AIR ok so now once order in
an air file you'll notice we have air
settings button here edit that we can
use the first thing we'll just go ahead
and drag out the background here
rectangle primitive
making a nice light color
okay now I'm gonna drag out a button
component just make a very basic
application let's call it develop PHP
data stream I think I'm gonna make my
own little nice application using data
streams from my site people can put on
their machine if they want it's gonna
have to be really cool though if I do it
okay so now let's pop a little code in
here that's going to connect to this
button the first let's give an instance
name to this button dev PHP underscore
BTN so here's the little application
that we're going to let people download
and put on their machine and you're
watching me make it so you can see
there's no security risks in the program
that I'm creating here let's see let's
make a new layer for the ActionScript so
now we have an instance name on that
button develop PHP right there and we
can also let's make it have a label so
let's grab that instance name and change
the label on that button
programmatically label is equal to in
between double quotes will put develop
PHP that way when the file renders it'll
say develop PHP and not the word label
on that
okay now we're all good to go we can
let's see untitled let's save this as on
the desktop or anywhere you want you
create a new folder let's call it air
test
and inside of that let's name this file
develop PHP data stream see
okay so say you have your application
all done it does great wonderful things
and you want to deliver it to people and
have them be able to download it and put
it on their computer and use it there's
all kind of cool applications you can
make especially in flash and they can
connect to the web that's the special
thing here so what we'll do is click the
air settings edit button here watch how
easy this is well just for this simple
demo I'm not gonna fill out much here
everything I'm just leaving default
system Chrome that's fine now I'm gonna
press publish air file now it's looking
for a certificate sign in the air file
with digital certificate and I don't
have one so I'm gonna create one
publisher name is Adam Corrine
organization unit one organization named
flash building country u.s. password
confirm your password
you can change the type well dig into
more about all these options and let it
to Taurus but I don't want to take up
too much time here I'm gonna show you
just the basics so now we're gonna save
this as let's go to our desktop that air
test folder press ok now it'll put it in
that air test folder as my cert dot p12
it's a p12 file that's okay
so I self signed certificate has been
created okay now we put in our password
right here the one we just created
you can remember password for this
session and press ok air file has been
created okay now at this point let's
press ok there that's it you've done it
let's see let's go to air test that
folder right there double-click inside
of it and you can see all the things
that it gave us here's our my cert our
certificate we created the SWF the fla
source and here's an XML file now here
is the Installer this is what you would
put on the web to let people download to
install on their machine so say they
download it from the web let's go ahead
and copy it they download it from the
web and they put it under the desktop
and they double click it it gives you a
nice flash based flash player based
installer let's see yeah yeah we'll go
over all these other settings to get all
of the publisher and the system access
and all these settings just the way we
need them in later tutorials
for now let's install it to our machine
I trust me
okay so and shortcut I yep we'll add
shortcut to desktop the icon and we'll
start the application after install and
I'm just gonna put it on my D Drive no
programs on C Drive okay so okay
continue it installs the application and
it opens it up in a nice window and you
can set the parameters for these windows
and now they have the application and
let me just close it and show you
there's the little icon say develop PHP
data stream it's a program on my
computer now away from the web you know
but it can connect to the web and let me
show you I'm gonna hit this little
button booyah baby opens up any site any
page that you wanted to it'll connect to
any scripts that you need it to and you
just have to be a trusted publisher what
people have to know you and trust you
you know and people know me and trust me
so if I make an application I think
people would use it but I'm gonna have
my everything top-notch I want to show
you one more thing
and everybody kind of knows about it but
let's go to our control panel add or
remove programs and just to show you how
nice it works well before I do that
let's go to the Start menu see how it
says new program installed and there it
is develop PHP data stream I can open it
up
okay so now we can go here to our
control panel and delete it remove it
from our system remove the program
completely develop PHP data stream
remove and there's a ton a ton ton ton
ton of settings and scripts and ways
that you can communicate with a person's
computer in their system and also the
web concerning your your err files your
air applications and you know ZBrush
thought you guys know ZBrush ZBrush is
100% flash application so whoever made
it made it in flash and the Installer I
think everything's flash on it they
might have even made it with an air type
application okay so that shows you the
basics just the very basics of creating
your first desktop application that
people can download and install on their
machines have a ball with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
