Fla file that you can download at
develop PHP comm if you go to our flash
tab you'll see this one in the list you
can download the Fla file and the Fla
file itself is the lesson this video is
not this video is just to show you the
application we're creating and kind of
explain things that we're going to be
doing we're going to have the easing
effect on the pages so if you scroll
down through you see I have five pages
set up and we're gonna have easing
effect on that and we're going to have
an easing effect on this menu system
here and we also have these buttons or
movie clip animated button symbols and
you'll see how those work once you
download the Fla and you can download
the Fla file and rip it up and make it
your own
tweak it out in the ActionScript code I
have let's see I've got everything well
commented so you should be able to
understand where to change things and
what to do to get to make it your own
and yeah we'll look at this thing live
now
if you need any assistance on any of
this just join the forum at develop um
if you want to tweak this thing out you
can't figure out how to or anything have
any questions at all just join the forum
up there and ask away
okay so we'll look at this thing in
action here on the in the browser and
you can see that they're easing effect
is on the menu system and it's also on
the pages so when I click a page it
eases back and forth real nice like a
slide set and if you had some nice sound
effects you could put them on these
buttons and a double sound on the
buttons would make nice dynamics when
your mouse goes over it makes one sound
and when the marker finally follows and
makes another sound like buh buh-buh-buh
see what I'm saying and then you can
even put a sound on the the pages
flipping through like or whatever
whatever you wanted to do to make it
cool and dynamic and futuristic this is
just basic stuff each page itself could
be made into a movie clip that where
when you click it when when it comes up
the page can have an opening animation
so you can turn each one of them pages I
made into a movie clip symbol itself and
when the button is pressed have
ActionScript start that movie clip up if
you need help with that just join the
forum that's pretty easy to add to the
function and the ActionScript already so
what else do we have there's a mask that
masks these each page and each pages I
can just can also be an image gallery
actually so you can just have five
images in there or twelve however many
you want and they can come in
dynamically or you can load them right
in on the stage
that's pretty much it we just wanted to
show you how it worked and how cool it
looked we don't have any sounds in here
but you can put some pretty cool sounds
and these buttons and stuff and that's
about it we'll see you next lesson
remember you can download this fla at
develop PHP comm and you'll see all the
code and everything you need commented
in really good to manipulate this thing
to make it your own we'll see you next
