those only interested in learning from a
free source file so if you expect to sit
here and see me code out for 30 minutes
a bunch of code on how to create a
custom video player in ActionScript 3
that's not going to happen you have to
go to develop PHP and download the
source files and then you can learn how
to do this thing because I've commented
everything out real nice and let me go
ahead and render out the file for you
you can see it when you press pause I
put a nice pause clip that plays that
shows on top of the video that way the
user knows that it's in pause mode and
when you press play it resumes and then
if you press stop it'll go back to the
beginning of the video you press play
again and it start and I programmed it
to where if it gets to the end of the
video it goes back to the the beginning
of the playhead that way they can press
play again no problem and watch it so
this is the basics of building a custom
video player in flash ActionScript 3 for
cs3 and flash cs4 and like I said you'll
get to all the understanding you need if
you just download my code download the
source files I'll have a little video in
the package and everything so it'll be a
fully working application you can
download and you'll see how I set up the
net stream and I put intuitive comments
I tried to make the comments as
intuitive as possible so you'll
understand what's what each line is
doing underneath the comment and I tried
to separate the code out nicely so you
can get to the code blocks to see what
each one is doing and manipulate it for
your needs so if you'd like to learn how
to create custom video players in
ActionScript 3 for flash cs3 and cs4 I
recommend you head over to develop PHP
comm
hit our flash tabs you'll see all the
tutorial source files that we have
available there and we feel it's just an
easier way to to educate as far as flash
goes rather than make you watch 30
minutes of me coding out on YouTube you
know you can get to all the code in in
five seconds if you download it so
that's that you guys want a program
custom video players your own players in
flash then this is the tutorial for you
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
