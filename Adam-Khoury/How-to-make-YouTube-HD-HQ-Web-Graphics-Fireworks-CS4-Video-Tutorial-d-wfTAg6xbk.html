be creating in this fireworks cs4
tutorial nice web two point O graphics
for HD and HQ tubes and you can see I
made them for my channel and you'll see
them on my channel and I made them
really big so i can get the details i
wanted and then I shrunk them down
created bitmaps and then shrunk them
down and set them into the place I
wanted them to be and I noticed YouTube
had similar graphics such as these so I
wanted to incorporate you know kind of
same kind of feel and look that they
were going for on my channel design ok
and this fireworks cs4 tutorial I'm
inside of my youtube channel raw PNG
file for the my background on my youtube
channel and I noticed YouTube's has some
cool HD little HD symbols little
graphics and I want to try and recreate
that for my channel align it thought I'd
record it and show you the workflow some
of you guys might get something out of
it and so what I'm going to do is draw a
rectangle and I'm going to bring up the
roundness a little so we have nice
rounded corners then I'm going to bring
out an ellipse because I want to create
a sort of bulge top effect
on my rectangle
see 207 to 24 this over one week is 208
both even numbers well it looks great
okay so see ctrl-c ctrl-v that will copy
and paste that one and you'll know when
you're in the middle of an object with
another object usually when they line up
so that one's lined up there
ok
we're going to do the same thing to the
sides
you
so if we can make this edge looks smooth
too beautiful ctrl-c ctrl-v perfect now
there may be other easier ways to create
bold edges effect on your and your
rectangles but I like doing it this way
cuz i have direct control over how the
edges look and how everything comes out
and let's see how we have all five
symbols i'm going to go to modify with
all by symbols selected combine paths
i'm going to union so it makes it one
symbol of one path and you select many
items that multiple items by holding
down the control key of the shift key
rather so i can select that one and that
one and that one and so now what I want
to do is copy another version of this
symbol right on top of itself so
highlight it press ctrl-c ctrl-v now I
have a copy and I'm going to make it
white so I can see it real good there or
let's make it grey now I want to scale
it go to the scale tool the transform
tool and scale it
and let me get about like that
come down a little more there we go now
this one let's see YouTube's is black so
I'm going to kind of mimic that and then
I'll modify it to make it my own okay so
this one see we're going to punch this
one out with a donut so let's bring out
a donut i'm using a donut because i want
that kind of specific arc on my cut here
so let's make this black and i can see
exactly what I'm going to get
in the opacity down that's just about
right ok so now put it into place bring
the opacity back up you highlight both
symbols when you want to crop and the
one that's going to do the cropping when
to both highlighted you go to combine
pads and punch so now I actually here
before i do that and show you another
little trick press ctrl-c ctrl-v with
this gray symbol highlighted that way
you had two copies of it now do now
punch modify combine pads punch now with
this one well this one on top let's just
turn it white so we can see it and with
this one we're going to turn it black
but we're going to go and give it a
filter effect of inner shadow make sure
it's white not too thick around two and
adjust the angle to where it's coming on
the bottom it's coming in on the bottom
so you can see what kind of effect that
gives us that's pretty nice this thing
we're going to give this a gradient of
linear
I'm going to bring it over here and
mimic the light effects that YouTube
uses on their graphics on their logo and
every almost everything they have let's
see especially their web two point O
graphics this one we're going to turn
white and we're going to bring the
opacity down but not all the way but
almost all the way right about that and
then let's see it looks good now all we
got to do is get our text in there so
yeah we'll put it in our text and do
some touching up now with the text let's
put a just so everybody knows it's mine
put HD going to put HQ + HD because my
videos are all HQ and HD nowadays right
in the center go to the text i want turn
it white when you see it first and i'm
going to go to franklin gothic it's
really similar to YouTube's text and now
i'm going to size it the way I want it
get up
bring these closer together
that's good
see
and that's so close
bring the font size down okay so we got
HD Plus HQ I actually now i'm just going
to make it say HQ and HD separately i'll
make two of them spread these back apart
a little bit
in that up
so we'll make the first one say HD now I
notice they had a an effect on the text
where it was text let's get a little
bigger 110 118 that's great okay so
let's get first of all let's bring this
light this layer this object on top so
you can press ctrl shift up arrow key
and that brings that object to the top
so it looks like this is laid into the
symbol and this is a lighting effect on
top so now this we're going to go to the
fiddle options and instead of solid
we're going to make that gradient and
you'll notice that YouTube uses that
effect to give a depth and actually in
their gradient I think they had it was
something like right in the center and
then dark on both edges
something like that so that's what kind
of looked like make that a little bigger
maybe 124 okay that looks pretty good so
if I have that symbol and I wanted a
little smaller I have all the elements
here let's grab all of them you can just
drag over them if you want them all and
I'm going to group them press ctrl G and
now i'm going to copy it control c
control v i'm going to ungroup this one
i'm going to change this to a queue now
i have HQ and HD and so let's grab all
of these once more group them to know if
both of these are grouped ctrl-c ctrl-v
make copies and now let's modify no
filters adjust color brightness and
contrast it's going to say this
operation will convert vectors to
bitmaps and that's exactly what I want
because I don't want any distortions
when I scale down and I'm not going to
I'm going to leave these as zero first
okay so now they're bitmaps now I can
just scale them down and put them into
the section designated for them all my
profile man those look juicy don't they
I pretty much nailed it and now you know
they can't get me for directly copying
their graphics because I made these mind
I just use theirs as reference
but not they would I mean
I'm going to put these up here
maybe is a little smaller
and that is that and now you'll see
these on my profile hookin it up I'll
hook it up fat like
there we go HD and HQ bring it up a
little bit but that's pretty much it
oops that shows you how to make nice web
two point O graphics similar to what you
see around YouTube and other snazzy
sites ok we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
