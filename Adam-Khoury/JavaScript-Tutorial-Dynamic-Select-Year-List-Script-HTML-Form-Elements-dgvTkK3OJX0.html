demonstrate how to render year select
lists using one line instead of many
many lines we will render the options in
a simple loop since years are numeric
and incremental
let's start with the bibbidi Bail Bonds
of an html5 web document and inside the
body element I'm going to add my select
element make sure we go down a couple of
lines and close that select element a
select elements or drop-down lists that
you use in your forms so the first thing
I'll do is give it an ID that's equal to
year and I'll also give it a name
attribute of year now normally in a
statically programmed year select list
you'll see it set up like this with
maybe up to a hundred or more of these
year options what we'll do is render
these dynamically these values for these
numbers that way we can use one line
instead of 100 so let's open up a script
element here make sure we go down a
couple of lines and close that script
element now what we want inside of the
script element is a for loop a very
simple for loop so we say for open
closed parentheses open a curly brace
and go down a couple of lines and put in
the closing curly brace now there's
three parameters that we have to put in
for a for loop we have to establish the
variable so we say var I is equal to the
year that you want to start at say 1900
so that's the first parameter is the
incremental variable and usually you'll
see that start at something like zero in
loops but since we have a specific need
we're going to start that at 1900 then
we put semicolon and we're going to add
the second parameter which is a and
evaluation to see if I is less than 2013
and if it is this loop will continue to
run and then the third parameter is I
plus plus which increments the I
variable so loops are set up to keep
incrementing as long as the condition
meets true so when this loop first runs
the first time I is going to be equal to
1900 so of course the loop is going to
continue to run until I reaches 2013 so
that's how many times this loop will run
so the last thing we do inside of our
loop is we want to write all of the
option elements so we say document dot
write open closed parenthesis and
semicolon and in between the parentheses
is where we write the option element so
we'll put single quotes will encapsulate
it in single quotes that way we can have
double quotes inside of the element so
we just open an option element
and we make its value equal to let's
just leave that blank for now then we
close that option element and for the
innerhtml
is where we put the value for the number
that we want which is going to be I and
it's going to start at 1900 so all we
have to do is concatenate into this
string by placing single quote single
quote and inside your single quotes put
in plus sign plus sign and between your
plus signs just put in I now what that
does is concatenate the I variable into
your string just as if it was written
there so you can also copy that and put
it here in the value press ctrl s so if
we run this in our favorite browser you
can see our select list goes all the way
from 1900 to 2000 which should go to
2013 so let's fix that you can just
basically turn this to 2014 and now it
will reach 2013 and here's another
little tip could actually render the
year the current year dynamically in
JavaScript right here so you wouldn't
have to actually write in the year you
can dynamically get the year to render
there and then you would never have to
touch this scrip again so when 2020
comes this script will say 2020 right
here so as a programmer you can die and
then at 2050 this script will still be
running the way it's supposed to
allowing people to pick current years so
that's just another little tip if you
don't want to have that number static in
there like I do written as 2014 you can
have JavaScript render a date variable
there for the current year whatever year
it is currently okay so that shows you
how to write it in one line instead of
using a hundred lines or however many
year options you're going to give the
user</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
