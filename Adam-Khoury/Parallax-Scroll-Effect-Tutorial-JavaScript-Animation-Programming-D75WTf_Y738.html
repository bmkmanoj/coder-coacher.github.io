before we begin the lesson let's take a
look at the finished product of what you
will be programming so let's start to
scroll this page when creating parallax
effects the programmers goal is to make
different layers move at different
speeds it sometimes programmed according
to where the users mouse is on the
screen sometimes it's programmed using
the scrolling mechanism of the page and
that's where we're going to be targeting
in this tutorial so you can see how my
content moves at one speed and the layer
behind it moves at a different speed
during the scroll mechanism of a page
and it's a similar concept to Disney's
multi-plane camera where different
layers will move at different speeds to
give the viewer a better sense of depth
and realism in their animations and what
we've created here what you're looking
at on this page is going to essentially
use just one line of JavaScript to
produce this parallax scrolling effect
we're going to start with a blank HTML
file it's named example dot HTML and all
it has is a rule for the body that's
going to add a background image to the
body of the page and let's see what that
renders very simple nothing's happening
yet because there's no content to even
scroll there's just a background applied
to the page and you can set it to fixed
or scroll now I'm going to add all of
the content to the body of my page now
here I have a script that's going to
dynamically render 50 lines or 49 lines
and you don't have to worry yourself
with that script because it's there as
dummy content you would have your actual
page content there now if we take a look
at what that renders we have our
background with a bunch of dummy content
and now we can scroll that content 49
lines of it I'm going to go up into the
CSS and I'm going to put a rule for the
content layer div right here to position
it absolute on the page now right above
my content layer div I'm going to add
parallax layer 1 that's another div
that lives right above your content
layer now I'm going to put the CSS
properties in place for that new element
go up into our CSS and pop in this new
rule we're going to position that
element fixed that way we can move it
dynamically easily in JavaScript now the
background for this element is going to
be an image that I created that is
opaque you can kind of see through it a
little bit and that was that big opaque
circle that was my parallax background
that you saw scrolling when I showed you
the demo now that's set to no repeat so
that that little circle doesn't repeat
in that element and we're positioning
the background image within that element
so that little circle that's the
background image of that element you can
position that circle to live anywhere
you want within the element you can see
my element has a width of 100% so it
fills the entire width of the parent
element that it's within and then we
have the height set to 800 pixels and my
little circle my transparent circle that
I made in fireworks was only about 550
pixels so I just pushed it down off the
top of the element the background circle
200 pixels I pushed it down off the top
so 0 pixels is the left 200 pixels is
the top positioning for this background
image for this element now if we take a
look at that you can see now we have our
transparent circle here that's the
background of the div but when I scroll
it's just staying in place it's not
moving it because we have no parallax
function yet now let's go into the
JavaScript portion of our document and
let's type in window dot add event
listener open and close parenthesis
semicolon the first parameter is what
we're listening for and that's scroll so
anytime the scroll event fires off the
next parameter we give at event listener
is the code that we want to run when
that event fires off and I want to run a
function called parallax and then the
final parameter is used capture and I
want false for that so basically any
time the page is scrolled parallax
function is going to run so let's take
the name of that function let's go right
above our event listener there and let's
type in function
parallax open close parenthesis opening
curly brace and closing curly brace now
the first thing we want to do inside of
that function is get an object reference
for this element the parallax layer 1 we
do that easily by saying document that
get element by ID now here's the one
line of logic that you're going to apply
to make the parallax layer 1 move
accordingly so I'm going to take this
object reference my next line I'm going
to type in parallax layer 1 dot style
dot top is equal to a certain number of
pixels and we have to dynamically
determine the number of pixels and the
first thing we can do to determine that
is type in window dot page Y offset plus
pixels so that that will be a string
that has a number and the PX but now
you're not done there because what will
happen if you run this let's test it out
and start scrolling see how it Scrolls
downwards and at the same speed as the
content you don't want that so to make
it scroll with the content or seemingly
with the content you can put minus here
to make this a negative number now test
and you'll see that it scrolls with the
content you see now is one last little
bit of logic we're going to put
parentheses around this number and we're
going to say divided by four to make it
scroll at a different speed 1/4 of the
speed of the content I'll run that in
your favorite browser scroll the page
and now you have parallax scrolling
effect because the layer behind is
scrolling at a different speed than all
of the content okay so really
essentially it's this one line of code
that's just repositioning the top
position for that layer and that's how
it's moving it up and down scrolling it
with the rest of the content but we're
doing it at 1/4 of the speed so if I was
to change that to a 10 it's going to
really scroll slowly so let me roll my
scrollbar and you'll see that the
relax layer rolls very slowly now
compared to the rest all right now I'm
throw-in one last little bit of logic
just in case some people have trouble
figuring out on their own you can have
multiple parallax layers so I'm going to
put a parallax layer two right
underneath parallax layer one I'm going
to copy the rule the CSS rule for
parallax layer two or for parallax layer
one and I'm going to change it to
parallax layer two that one's also going
to be position fixed the background is
going to be the same you can make it a
different background altogether and this
one I'll make height of a thousand
pixels and I'll push the circle down 400
pixels and I'll push it over to the left
maybe 600 pixels now we have to parallax
layers but we're only moving one with
JavaScript and let's see what happens
you can see now we have to parallax
layers here's the other one sitting
still now let's make both of them move
so let's go into our JavaScript let's
take this back to a4 so that our
original the first parallax layer is
moving at a good speed so now let's just
copy these two lines actually let's copy
this one first control C control V
change this to layer two this to layer
two then copy this line and put it under
that one and change that to a two and
change the speed now to be a eight now
let's go to file preview in browser
Firefox or whichever browser you want so
you can see here is parallax layer one
here is parallax layer two let me scroll
and I'll show you you can see how
they're moving at different speeds
each parallax layer is moving at
independent speeds as the page is
scrolled you see
you can put as many parallax layers as
you want in there so if you didn't
before now you understand the logic
behind parallax effects and you can also
refer to Disney's multi-plane camera and
how Disney invented parallax effects for
animated movies you can search the
YouTube search bar right now for Disney
multi-plane camera and you can watch a
pretty cool video all about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
