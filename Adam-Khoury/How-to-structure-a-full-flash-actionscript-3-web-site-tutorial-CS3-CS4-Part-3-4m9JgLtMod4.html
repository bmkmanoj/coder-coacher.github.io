name so now what we're going to do is
the homepage is going to be the first
thing loaded when people come in so
we'll leave it right there in that frame
but then when they come to it after
visiting other pages when they come back
to it we want it to fade in actually
let's make it fade in from the beginning
so make it go 10 frames create motion
tween and on the beginning one just
press highlight it the movie clip and
come down here where it says color and
go to alpha make the alpha 0 now you
have a page transition sort of let's
make the background okay that's the
background layer that's right i forgot
about that so we'll name this background
and now we'll stretch this out the
background layer will stretch it out to
about 60 by pressing f5 on frame 60 and
it won't make a keyframe it just
stretches out the frames so they display
all the way through that background will
show okay so now you want to label right
here let's see let's put this right here
so I just grabbed the key frame one and
moved it over to keyframe two and i'm
going to put a label here and key frame
by pressing f6 and now down in the frame
label i'm going to type home now i'm
going to put another label right past
that i'm going to call it about me or
about i'll call it about that way
that'll be a frame label there and
stretch it out so you can see it says
about so now we have home and about and
now we want our actions panel we want
our actions layer press f6 right here
where this movie clip comes to full
alpha the whole movie clip
and you want to press f6 then f9 and
press or type sto p open parenthesis
close parentheses and then semicolon
that's a stop action that'll make the
file stop when it hits right there so
it'll go shipping and stop and so on the
first frame you see I have no stop
action so right when they come into the
site we we fade in the homepage and
that's pretty much how it works we're
going to do that to all the pages now
and the way you do that is you can just
make a new keyframe here on about and
then make it go all the way about the
same length and don't create motion
tween yet because we're going to
actually let me put that in yet you want
to remove the homepage there or I'll
show you a little trick you can go into
your library grab the homepage movie
clip and duplicate it and call it about
now it's a movie clip called about
that's duplicated in our library now we
can go and select this one that is on
our About section here and swap it swap
it for the one that says about it's
about movie clip now when you change
this movie clip and get that picture out
of there because we're on a different
page and we'll make this say about
welcome to my about page
and you can have anything you want
inside of these pages and so on the next
page i'll show you how to add another
movie clip from another one of our
tutorials so now you see i change this
but look home page is still the same so
now that's how you duplicate movie clips
inside of your library and then swap
them on stage that way they have the
same position the same elements and then
you can go ahead and change them out so
we'll go ahead and make another keyframe
here we'll set up the next motion tween
make sure they're the same distance go
back to the start of the tween and go
down the color select it on stage go
down to color and alpha 0 again so that
one will fade in now okay now you see
and how it's all coming together huh and
let's put a stop action here on this one
as well ok so now make another frame
label here and this one is going to be
the surfaces
and press f5 I think the frames come out
so you can see what the label says and
let's go ahead and stop right now and
we'll continue on with the part 3 so
look for part 3 and keep it going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
