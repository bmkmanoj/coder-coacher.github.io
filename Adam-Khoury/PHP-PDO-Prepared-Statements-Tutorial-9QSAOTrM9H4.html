learn to create PTO prepared statements
in PHP and in the very next video
tutorial you can learn to create
prepared statements using MySQL I
prepared statements work for both the
PDO and MySQL I extensions in PHP so you
can just pick your flavor
okay our objective is going to be to
create a PDO prepared statement that's
going to insert people into the people
table just as a very basic example first
thing we'll do is add our database
connection which we discussed in the
previous video the next line will create
a variable that represents the SQL
syntax for the prepared statement and
you can see it looks just like a normal
insert except in the values we're
putting named placeholders so what you
see here are called named placeholders
and in the next line we're going to
create a variable named statement st MT
short for statement and that's going to
be equal to our database Handler and
using an object-oriented approach we're
going to run the prepare function and
then we'll just put our SQL syntax as
the parameter now in the next three
lines what we're going to do is bind
parameters to the prepared statement so
for the statement variable we're running
the bind per among the first argument is
the placeholder the named placeholder
that you have in place and the second
argument is the variable data that's
used when you execute the prepared
statement alright on the next line down
we're gonna set all the variable data
and then we're going to execute the
prepared statement so when the statement
execute function is called to run this
variable data is going to be put in
place in the prepared statement and
you'll have an insert into your people
table now what makes this handy is that
you can just reuse the prepared
statement if you happen to be doing some
operation over and over again more than
once
so we just change the variable data and
we just call the execute function to run
again that will give you a second insert
with different data now the next line
down we'll just echo
a little message to ourselves saying
prepared statements have been executed
and then we'll close the database
connection okay when I ran this on my
server I get this prepared statements
have been executed and then a visual
representation of what just happened is
this was what the people table looked
like before I ran the prepared statement
and now this is what it looks like with
Beth and Sandeep inserted into the table
using prepared statement now the
benefits are is that you can execute
over and over again for the same sort of
template basically what you're doing is
making a template that you can use over
and over again and it also helps with
preventing SQL injection</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
