programming lesson you can learn how to
build a basic web application it
captures keyboard input and allows you
to access the properties of keyboard
events this is especially handy for game
programming and interactive applications
but the ways you can apply it are
completely up to you in your imagination
and in the very next video we will
expand upon this programming to show how
to add conditional logic in order to
perform specific tasks in a web
application according to specific keys
being pressed by the user let's first
take a look at the finished product of
what we are building in this video
tutorial so if I press down on say for
instance my Q key and I hold down it
says key pressed is Q key code for Q is
81 and the down event fired for the Q
key now if I release my Q key right now
it changes to the up event fired for the
Q key so I'm showing you guys how to
listen for the down and the up event for
any of the keys that people press and
I'm also showing the key code which is
very handy in case that for instance
somebody presses enter it's not going to
give you a key label that's pressed but
you do get the key code so that way you
can access the space control shift and
know what number that represents them in
the key code that way you can program
conditional logic against these key
codes if you don't want to use the
actual key that's pressed so you see
each key that's pressed gives you a key
code okay so that's what you're going to
learn how to build in this video
tutorial the first thing we'll do is
start with a doctype declaration that
way it works in all browsers Internet
Explorer Firefox Safari Chrome so those
are the ones I've tested in so and I had
to make sure I put the doctype in for
internet explorer it was one of the
browsers that required the doctype so
just make sure your application has a
doctype the first thing I'm going to do
is pop in two headings you can see it
says JavaScript capture keyboard input
example if I render that to the page
you'll see what it gives me basic HTML
stuff in the next line down I'm going to
type in key pressed colon and then a
span element I'm gonna give
span element and ID of KP short for keep
rest make sure I close that off then go
down one line just put in a break tag
then we're going to type in key code and
this is where we're going to show the
corresponding key code for the key that
was pressed so we can just copy that
span tag or that span element and we're
going to call this one k c short for key
code and then the last thing in the HTML
is going to be a paragraph element with
an ID of status and inside of this
element we're going to change the inner
HTML the text that it has in it just so
we can see a status of what's going on
that's the one that you saw showing the
key up and key down event changing all
right so that's all the HTML now we can
go above the HTML and put in some
JavaScript and you might have your head
tags and all that stuff in place script
type text/javascript and then we'll go
down a couple of lines to make sure we
close off our script tag the first thing
in javascript is we're going to access a
listener of the document so document dot
on key down this is one of the events
that we can listen for within the
document and we're going to make that
equal to a function that we want to fire
off on that key down event so let's open
up our curly brace go down a couple of
lines and close off our curly brace and
in between the parentheses for the
function we're going to type in event
and you might sometimes see that
represented as a simple e but I'm going
to represent it as event because that's
what it is so within this function in
the first line we're going to create a
variable that has a name of key press
and this is how we're going to show
ourselves the actual character that was
pressed to do that we use the from
charcoaled function and we give it an
argument of event key code and the key
code you saw the numbers that were being
generated as I was typing the keys in
that is the key code so you can use the
from char code to render out what key
was being pressed and then you put
string before that to make sure it's
rendered as a string on the next
variable that we're going to need
created is a key code variable and
that's going to be equal to the event
key code which is the actual number
or the specific keyboard keys now the
next two lines that we're going to put
in JavaScript are going to be for
targeting these spans by their IDs KP
and KC
and we're going to put key press the
value of key press and the value of key
code into them so these two lines right
here do that we say document I get
element by ID KP its innerhtml is equal
to the key press variable and the same
thing for the KC which is the key code
variable now let's put something in
place that affects this paragraph tag
and changes the inner HTML inside of it
to let us know which event is firing off
so right under this line these next two
lines take care of that we say bar
status is equal to document dot get
element by ID status which is this
paragraph tag and then we say status
that inner HTML is equal to down event
fired for whichever key that was pressed
now since you understand all the logic
of the scripting that's happening inside
of that I'm just going to pop in the on
key up listener and it's function right
here and very similar things are
happening inside of that one except we
don't need to show again in those fields
what key was pressed we just want to
show in the status which up event just
fired off because actually let's just go
ahead and run and I'll show you what I'm
talking about so we run this in the
browser if I hold down the T key it's
going to say down event fired off for T
but if I let go of the T key it says up
event fired for T so that's why we put
the on key up listener and the function
in there that way you guys can program
if the need be to listen for when the
user lets go of the keyboard key but for
most applications you would just use the
on key down event
okay so we've explained all of this code
very in-depth and in the next video
tutorial that's going to follow this one
what I'm going to do is add conditional
logic to this so you can listen for
specific keys being pressed maybe you're
creating a game that you want to have
listeners for the WASD Keys to move
things around up down and side to side
that are
on your page and maybe that's what I'll
show how to do in the next lesson is
target the WASD keys you can also target
the arrow keys you can target any keys
you want and you can do anything you
want within your page that javascript is
able to handle so we'll see you in the
next video lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
