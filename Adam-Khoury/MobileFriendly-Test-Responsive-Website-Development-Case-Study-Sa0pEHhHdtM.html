website last week and while I was doing
so I thought it would be a good idea to
stop at the point where I was about to
make it mobile-friendly and record a
video on the process of making it
mobile-friendly that way people who are
still struggling with making mobile
layouts can get some insight
so my site is at the point now to where
it's ready for tablets and desktop
computers but it's not ready for
smartphones yet and perhaps your site is
in a similar state now after this video
we're gonna leave the topic of
mobile-friendly layouts behind us
because we will have it pretty much
thoroughly covered after this video so
this is gonna be a case study of making
a non mobile-friendly website layout
officially mobile-friendly and you'll
also be introduced to a helpful online
tool that reports to you how to go about
fixing all the issues that make your
site unfriendly for smartphone screens
just the act of making sure that your
site passes the mobile-friendly test can
have an impact on your search engine
optimization now that Google and other
search engines are starting to rank
sites that are mobile-friendly higher
than sites that are not okay I'm gonna
go grab my URL and I'm gonna pop it in
right here and test my site I'm gonna
analyze it to see if it's
mobile-friendly and which I know it's
not but we'll see exactly what it says
and I haven't gone through this process
for that website yet so you're seeing
this as I'm seeing it for the first time
okay so it says not mobile-friendly it
shows you how Googlebot sees the page
and it shows you a little emulation of
how your site's going to look on
smartphone screens generally and it
gives me instructions on the things that
I should fix to make it mobile-friendly
so it says the text is too small to read
the links are too close together mobile
viewport is not set and content is wider
than the screen content wider than the
screen means that the user has to scroll
horizontally and that's not cool you
don't want the user to have to scroll
sideways or pinch and zoom too much now
the mobile viewport not set if you see
that it's very easy to fix and what I'm
going to do is just go to develop PHP
because
in the source code I have that in there
already so I'm just gonna take this meta
tag with a name viewport and there's a
few different settings you can set for
your viewport tag okay now here I am in
the home page of that website the index
dot PHP file and right here with the
other meta tags or I'll just put it
under this first made a tag right there
so now I have mobile viewport set so
this little warning or non-mobile
friendly error is going to go away so
let me read FTP my home page up to the
web and we'll check it out now that I
made that adjustment I'm going to
reanalyze now there's only one so the
reason why we had the other two negative
strikes go away was because we put the
viewport and the viewport says with is
device with initial scale is 1 now the
only issue I have left is that my
content is wider than the screen you can
see my buttons or my links are all gonna
be big enough to click on all my text
will be large enough to read but I just
have to make sure that this menu becomes
much smaller and is on the side over
here or maybe we can have the links up
top and then the page content can be all
in the center you can see right now the
page content is all they would have to
scroll a whole lot horizontally and
that's why they give you this strike
because you should have no horizontal
scroll so now what we'll do is go and
put a media query in place for this
website's CSS and it doesn't matter what
particular layout style you have or what
CSS you're using the logic of what we're
about to do would apply to any website
ok here is the style sheet the external
style sheet for that websites layout so
that means it's going to affect every
page on the site and you'll want to make
sure that you go through every page and
analyze it and also view it on your
smartphone just to make sure now I'm
only going to be showing you how I do
the index page but it would be the same
for all other pages and if you're using
an external stylesheet for your layout
you might only have to put a media
query1 place and it'll be real quick and
easy now all of the changes that you
want to apply to the layout for smart
screens any device or viewport
that's 768 pixels and less will get the
changes that you put here so basically
smartphones because tablets tablets will
show your site at a bigger max width
than 768 so tablets won't be affected
unless they're turned to the portrait
mode when they're in landscape mode they
won't be affected by these changes but
smartphones will so if anybody goes to
my site on a tablet laptop a desktop
computer
they'll be served up this CSS the normal
layout CSS and then smartphone users
will get the new CSS that I put here so
basically what I'm going to do is take
the general knowledge of CSS that I have
then anyone with basic CSS knowledge can
do this all I'm gonna do is make
everything look right on a little
smartphone screen
okay I've applied the changes that I
want to my stylesheet that affects all
of the pages on my site so I'm gonna
reanalyze and I also did some tweaking
to the homepage CSS and there we go
this is awesome this page is
mobile-friendly so now what I probably
want to do is get rid of those little
arrows or make the menu on the side just
a little bit wider I'll probably just
get rid of those little arrows that are
before the link content then I'll
reanalyze hopefully that little left
menu will look better
there we go that's perfect now I'm not
really finished there's some things that
I want to tweak for instance I want to
get the logo set up a little bit
different I still have to change the
size of the copyright text but you can
see for the most part it's
mobile-friendly and now I'll show you
what I changed in my stylesheet and on
my home page and then we'll call it a
day
okay Here I am in my external stylesheet
here you can see I put my media query so
for all screens the viewports that our
768 and less they get these changes
applied
and if you want to change for instance
you see my body I have all kind of
little CSS settings in there actually
that one's not even doing anything so
let me take that out so let's look at
container container has a certain group
of CSS properties now for instance for
display table I don't even have to put
that down in the bottom where we're
setting up the layout for mobile height
100 v8 you should see container that's
the same yeah the only thing that will
change the only CSS properties that will
change for this container rule are the
width and the min width so really that's
all I have to do I don't have to put all
of the other properties in there only
the ones that I want to change or only
the ones that I need to change to make
it a nice mobile-friendly layout and
there's some more of this that I can
slim down but you can see that it's not
very much and I pause the video while it
made the changes but the changes only
took me about five or ten minutes so in
five or ten minutes I now have a
mobile-friendly layout for a site that
ten minutes ago had an unfriendly layout
for mobile now on the home page I have
some content that is only specific to
the home page so on the home page is
where I put a media query as well just
to change that content that's specific
to the home page the way it looks nice
on mobile as well and this is this
little bubbles application I have if you
guys want it you can snatch my source
code and you can view source if you just
go to Adam quarry calm your view page
source you can get that little program
if you want you just grab the JavaScript
and the CSS and then you can have these
bubbles and they automatically rotate so
in a couple of seconds I think every 10
seconds I have it set to rotate to the
next bubble so you see it's like
slideshow type thing for content and
people can click the bubbles see if I
click the bubble it then stays on that
bubble then the user can click other
bubbles if they want so I just wanted to
add that in there if you guys want to
steal that little application I don't
mind
okay so that about wraps
up our whole little series of videos
that we have for responsive and dynamic
layouts I'm gonna do a little bit more
tweaking to make sure it looks really
nice when I view it on my mobile phone
and I'm gonna actually view it on my
mobile phone just to make sure that it
looks nice and it's really important to
keep in mind that you can have elements
that will only show for the smartphone
screen users and then you can have other
elements that only show for desktop
users or tablet users and you can use
the display property and CSS to make
that happen you just put display block
or display:none or if it's not a block
level display item you can just put
display inline or display:none
so for desktop users and your normal CSS
you would put display:none if you had an
element that you only want smartphone
users to see and then in your media
query you put display block and it will
show up only for smartphone users and
vice-versa
for desktop users</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
