object-oriented programming works in PHP
will take you through creating object
instances from your classes how to put
properties in place within those classes
and access them then finally we'll show
you what methods are and how to put
those in place within your classes and
access those as well basically you can
look at an object as you would look at
any object like say a human a human has
properties that would be its eye color
height age weight and characteristics of
that object now its methods would be
what it can do actions that it could
perform like run play jump procreate and
things like that that would be its
methods so if your object was a baseball
its properties would be the weight the
size the stitch type the manufacturer
who made it and its methods would be get
pitched be hit get caught get dirty and
anything that a baseball could do break
a window
okay create a new file called demo PHP
and also another new file called player
dot PHP and player dot PHP is going to
be our class file demo dot PHP will be
the file that calls the player class
into action so let's first set up our
player class let's sleep in class player
and an opening curly brace then you can
go down a few lines and put in your
closing curly brace you can put a space
right here if you like
now there's an empty class called player
and you want to name your class the same
name as the file so if you're going to
have a class called player you want to
name your file player dot PHP now let's
create some properties and in PHP
object-oriented programming you'll
notice some assignments like public
you'll also see private and protected so
now we're going to create a public
property
the first one is going to be name so we
have our first property of the player
class now let's create the second
property public this one is going to be
named type the third property we'll name
this one hitpoints so now you've created
three properties that your player class
is capable of handling and you can use
class files for anything you want now
we're going to show you what a method is
basically all that a method is in PHP
object-oriented programming is a
function that's within your class so if
I was to type in function melee attack
which is like hand-to-hand combat or
sword - sword open close parenthesis put
the opening curly brace and go down a
couple of lines and put the closing
curly brace so now you have a function
sitting there and if you don't put
public private or protected assignment
in front of it it will automatically be
a public function but let's just go
ahead and put public so now we have a
public function which is the method
melee attack of the player class
now before we program the melee attack
and get too involved inside of our class
file here let's go back into demo dot
PHP and
call that class file into action or
we'll include it into our demo dot PHP
page so you can either include or
include once player PHP and what that
does is it brings the class file into
your script basically just the same as
if all of this code right here was
sitting directly here at the top of your
script okay so for my little demo
scenario I'm going to create a new
player now I'm going to call it p1
that's short for player one that's going
to be equal to new player open closed
parentheses and put your semicolon so
now it's variable player one you have an
instance reference to that object the
player object which is your player class
now in that class I have name type and
hitpoints so let's go ahead and assign
those properties now to the instance of
that object so you say p1 and then you
use the dash and the right bracket you
can see if you're in a good code editor
all of the little properties will come
up so I'll pick a name that's the
property in the class that I want to
assign a value to now and I'll name the
first one brutus then i'll go down one
line and i'll say p1 and then access my
type property make that equal to warrior
because this player type is going to be
a warrior
then for player one I'm also going to
access the hit points property and I'm
going to give him hit points of 100 so
Brutus is a warrior with 100 hit points
and he is an instance of my player
object now let's create player two so
let's just grab all of that and ctrl C
go down one line or two and control V
now let's call this P to make all of
these p2 so player two is equal to a new
instance of the player class and this
guy will name mysterio and his type will
be sorcerer and he'll also start with a
hundred hit points now with this little
dash and left bracket are doing it's
basically ways to just access that
objects properties and methods if you're
familiar with using Java
it does it with the dot JavaScript
accesses object properties and methods
using simple dot notation the PHP is a
little different it uses the dash and a
right bracket so if you've ever been
wondering what that character does in
PHP programming now you know it's just
like the dot notation of JavaScript
now you guessed it we're going to make
player one melee attack player two so
you can just put player two as the
argument being passed through that melee
attack method which is basically a
function residing in your player class
but when you're object-oriented
programming this is called a method and
let's also make player two melee attack
player one and then to complete this
little application down at the very
bottom we're going to show the outcome
of this melee attack between these two
players we can echo between little h2
elements player one name which is the
value of Brutus
so Brutus now has however many hit
points he's left with after the little
combat and then you'll also see player 2
which is Mysterio now has however many
hit points he's left with after the
little skirmish and right above that
I'll echo out fight results in h1
heading now since Brutus is a warrior
and Mysterio is a sorcerer in a melee
attack
Brutus should have an advantage so we're
going to account for that in our player
dot php' just to show you guys a little
bit more logic within this example all
right so we can press control s because
that's all the code that we're going to
have in our demo dot PHP and you see in
the melee attack we're having one
argument being passed to that so back in
the player class a melee attack we have
to scoop up that one argument and we'll
just call it target when you name it
whatever we want but that's going to be
the target of the attack the player who
is the target of the attack now within
the function let's create a new variable
called current HP and that's short for
hit points so we'll get their current
hit points before the attack and you can
just say target and access the hit
points property now we want to do a
random amount of damage we don't want
the damage to be consistent every time
so we make a variable named
and that will be equal to R and and the
rand function is a math function in PHP
which takes two arguments and will make
it be between 10 and 20 so a value in
between 10 and 20 so if they're lucky
they'll get a nice strong attack closer
to 20 if they're not so lucky they'll
get a weaker attack that's closer to 10
that'll give you however many points of
damage now all you have to do is change
the actual hit points for the person
who's being attacked target access the
hit points variable or the hit points
property we're going to make that equal
to the current hit points minus damage
basically what that does is takes the
damage away from their current hit
points and then it makes their hit
points property within that object
forevermore decreased now if you want to
make a little condition logic to give
the warrior more of an advantage in a
melee attack which he naturally would
over a sorcerer then you can do
something simple like an if condition
right here open your curly brace go down
a couple of lines close curly brace you
can say if this now this is a way to
access the calling object so back in
demo when this player one is melee
attacking player two this is player one
now when player two melee attacks player
one this will be referencing player two
so you see how that works it's the
object that is referencing this melee
attack method we have access to both the
person being attacked and the attack or
the attacker I'm going to say if this
type is equal to warrior I'm just going
to take the current hit points and
decrease them by 10 by saying - equals
10 and that will take 10 off of their
hit points before the damage is even put
on them so whatever damage is made by
Rand the warrior by default will have a
10 bonus basically it just decreases you
could also make this say damage actually
it'd probably make more sense but let's
say damage plus equals 10
so that will just add ten more points of
damage now simply just run demo dot PHP
on a PHP enabled server okay so you can
see the fight results Brutus now has 83
hit points and he started with 100
Mysterio now has 70 hit points and he
has so much less because Brutus was a
warrior and he got that advantage of
extra damage and what's cool about this
little program is that this could
actually connect straight to your
database because PHP can connect
straight to MySQL database and you can
save all of these attacks and how many
hit points that the user now has so they
can actually die maybe three weeks later
when somebody hits them again but
there's a ton of different uses for
creating class files and interacting
with these properties and methods of the
class files externally and in an
object-oriented approach and I'm going
to be doing a few more tutorials along
these lines that will show you a few
more aspects of object-oriented
programming in PHP</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
