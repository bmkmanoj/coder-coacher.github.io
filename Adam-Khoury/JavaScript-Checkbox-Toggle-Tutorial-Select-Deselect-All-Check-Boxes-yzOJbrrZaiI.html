tutorial this one you'll learn how to
toggle all checkboxes with 0 lines of
code this is the finished product of
which you'll be learning to create we
have it scripted to where all the
checkboxes on the page become the value
of the master checkbox and you'll see
sometimes in like private messaging
systems or something like that there'll
be a whole list of things down the page
and you can highlight certain ones
altogether to delete them all at once so
that's why you might want to allow your
users to highlight all of them at once
like that or deselect them all at once
like that ok here we are with the bare
bones of an HTML 5 web document mine is
named example dot HTML in the body
element I'm going to insert my HTML for
this example you can see that I have
four simple checkboxes here each one has
a unique ID and they all have the same
class of CB Group one that stands for
checkbox group one and above them I have
another checkbox with an ID of CB Group
one master with the words toggle all
next to it if we render this we'll see
that when we hit our toggle our master
toggle nothing happens to these guys
down here so what we'll do is in the on
change event of this master checkbox
we're going to run a JavaScript function
named toggle checkboxes we're going to
send that function to arguments this
which is going to represent this CB
group one master because this is
reference to the item that's calling the
function which is this master checkbox
and then the second parameter ascending
it is the class or the group of elements
by class name to the function group of
elements that we want to affect on the
page so up top in the head section we'll
need our scripting element make sure we
close it and inside we need this
function toggle checkboxes and it has to
take two arguments in let's make sure we
go down and close that with a closing
curly brace so function toggle
checkboxes is being sent to parameters
here for two arguments we're going to
scoop those up the first one with a name
master the second one we'll name C n for
class name now the first line inside of
the function we're going to create a
variable called c b array and that's
short for checkbox array we'll make that
equal to document get elements by class
name so we'll get elements by their
class name and we'll feed it the
parameter it needs of the class name
that we want to grab get elements by
class name returns an array of all of
the elements that are found to have that
class name on the page so basically in c
b array you have all four of these
checkboxes ready to be manipulated
through JavaScript now we have to do is
bust that array down in a for loop and
we can get to them individually so we'll
say for open closed parentheses put an
opening curly brace and go down a couple
of lines and put a closing curly brace
and as many of you know the for loop
takes three parameters first we
establish the variable I which is going
to be our incrementing variable through
the for loop so each time this for loop
runs that variable is going to increment
by one by I plus plus here so the second
parameter is the evaluation so as long
as I is less than C B array length which
in our case is going to be four so as
long as I is less than the length of the
array this for loop is going to process
so when I reaches the length of the
array this for loop will stop processing
so within the loop we can grab reference
to each individual checkbox by saying
document get element by ID and then we
represent X number and we grab the ID
for the individual checkbox and that
gets put into a local variable called CB
then we have just one more line we say
CB is equal to master checked now if we
run this in our browser we toggle all
you'll see that they all toggle on and
off according to the value of the master
toggle checkbox and let's take a look at
it in Internet Explorer
so that's a simple and effective way to
toggle all checkboxes on or off in
modern browser software</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
