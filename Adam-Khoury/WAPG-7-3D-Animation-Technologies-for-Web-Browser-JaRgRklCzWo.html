the guide we're going to discuss 3d
animation technologies for browser
software and web development 3d
animation design and development on the
web is a very broad topic involving a
massive amount of technologies tools
frameworks and software
some use cases for 3d applications that
you might want to develop for the web
our 3d video games which can look just
as good as video games that render in
game platforms like PlayStation Xbox
Nintendo and etc so you can have a video
game that renders in the browser that
looks just as good as all of those video
games another usage example our
interactive 3d environments an example
of that would be something like Google
Earth or any type of application where
you let a user navigate through a 3d
scene or a 3d environment that has 3d
models in it and allow them to interact
with them another example would be
Virtual Reality environments which would
be applications that work with virtual
reality hardware another usage example
would be 3d model viewing and building
it's possible to create software and
applications that allow a user to build
3d models and 3d environments before we
get into discussing a lot of other
technologies I want to take a moment to
focus on WebGL and the html5 canvas and
WebGL is OpenGL ES for the web and when
you're working with WebGL on the canvas
you use the WebGL context and some of
you might already be used to the context
for 2d graphics rendering and animation
now in my channel I have a good crash
course for the 2d context on the canvas
it's called the canvas bootcamp and
that's a playlist of videos that will
get you familiar with the canvas API for
2d graphics and animation so if you want
to learn all about the canvas 2d context
for animation and graphics you can go
through the canvas bootcamp playlist
right here on my channel and working
with WebGL the context is WebGL and
WebGL is fast becoming the most popular
way to render 3d graphics because it
comes native and stocked in all modern
browser software and this is the URL
that you can navigate to if you want to
learn all
all the ins and outs of WebGL from the
official website for WebGL which houses
all of the specifications the manuals
and this is what that website looks like
so you can see down here you have WebGL
one specification WebGL two
specifications and all other related
information about WebGL and this is the
information these specifications are
what book authors and tutorial makers
would use they would reference these
specifications and get the knowledge
from those specifications to teach you
with so you don't have to buy a WebGL
book or any other third-party manuals or
code references because this is the
source that anybody who writes any code
examples of references might use so you
might as well go straight to the source
and bypass having to buy books or buy
courses that might be expensive because
the people who write those courses are
just going to reference these
specifications and take information from
these specifications and then try to
sell it to you so you might as well just
go to the free source before you might
buy something that's expensive
and here are a list of WebGL frameworks
that you can explore as you get time
these frameworks would make development
of 3d applications and animations a
little bit easier than building them
from scratch they just help take some of
the rocket science out of it and three
Jas is probably the most popular among
them but several of these in this list a
very popular others are not so popular
not very widely used by a lot of
different developers now here is a list
of web 3d formats and tools these are
tools and software for 3d animation
development that you might find handy
and you can see that WebGL is listed
among them now before we take a look at
this list of game engines I want to
discuss proprietary plugins plugins are
proprietary in nature and they're not
native technologies that come stock in
the browser software like WebGL does now
I'm going to recommend to avoid
developing using software that demands
the user downloads a third-party plug-in
and that's the main reason that the
flash player was killed off a few years
ago so I think it's best to rely on
technologies that are native to the
browser software for instance something
that renders WebGL code now let's take a
look at this list of game engines that
you can explore on your own time now
here we are at Wikipedia now these game
engines are tools that are available for
game designers to code and plan out a
game quickly and easily without building
one from the ground up whether they're a
2d or 3d based they offer tools to aid
in asset creation and placement so you
can see you have the list of all the
game engine names on the left here then
they show you the primary programming
language then the scripting language
associated with that software whether
it's cross-platform or not it's 2d or 3d
orientation and the target platform
which is a very important column because
you'll see that some will cater to more
platforms than others
basically it's better to work with a
tool that
caters to more platforms than less so
actually one that covers a lot is unity
so let's go down here to unity where's
that background crap so if you develop
in the unity software you can deploy for
all of these different platforms Windows
OSX Xbox Playstation Nintendo Android
Blackberry blah blah blah and WebGL is
among those now let's quickly discuss
animation performance the animation
performance is dependent on the user's
computer hardware and software a user
with a more powerful GPU and CPU will
experience a smoother performance than a
user with weaker hardware not everyone
will experience your animations exactly
the same now this applies to both 2d and
3d animation rendering the GPU is the
graphics processing unit their graphics
card and the CPU is their central
processing unit ok within this video
you've been introduced to a lot of
different tools and software and if you
were to try and learn all of the various
tools and software errors and frameworks
it would take you several lifetimes to
try and learn all of that so my advice
would be to choose certain software or
tools that will help you get the job
that you need done and master that tool
instead of trying to master all of these
different various tools so choose
something that's really popular because
something popular is going to have a
large developer base and there'll be a
lot of examples online showing you how
to do things within that software
there'll be more tutorials for that
software a lot more script examples etc
so now you should have a really good
grasp of 2d animation on the web and a
wide array of tools to explore and
experiment with for creating 3d
animations and
applications for the web now with this
video I'm going to bring this series to
a close and it's very possible that I
might choose one of these specific tools
and software's or frameworks to create
another playlist of videos for because
each one of the tools that we discussed
in this video would require a huge
playlist of videos to train somebody how
to use them and for most developers 3d
animation would never even enter into
their tool belt because most of the
things that the ordinary or average web
developer would do are 2d usually 2d
animations every developer modern
developer needs to know how to do 2d
animations but not many would require
knowledge of how to create 3d animations
unless they were creating specific type
of applications that require 3d
animation so I'll just wish you good
luck with all of your 2d and 3d
animation design and development
projects and I hope you make something
beautiful and make lots of money okay
