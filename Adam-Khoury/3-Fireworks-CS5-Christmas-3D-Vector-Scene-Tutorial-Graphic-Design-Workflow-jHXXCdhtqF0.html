video tutorial for creating complete 3d
effective Kriss machines using Adobe
fireworks this scene you see before you
now is the finished product of the
lesson series enjoy and Merry Christmas
okay now I'm going to draw a tree going
to grab my pin tool and I'm going to go
maybe somewhere right around the top
here click down let go and go right
about here click down hold but don't let
go yet drag contour that line click down
there make a sharp corner point then
come in just a little bit and give it a
little bit of a curve there click down
here make a sharp corner point and then
we're going to make about three or four
levels just like that using that same
technique as I go down okay now when I
get down to the bottom I'm just gonna
have that last point I haven't clicked
to make a sharp corner point on that
last point yet so what I'm gonna do is
make it a little wavy line until I get
to the center wave it around a little
bit
will it stretch it we get a little wavy
and click down here in the center and if
it doesn't become a perfect center line
when you close up that shape don't worry
about it you can go to yourself
selection tool click any point that you
want and move it until you do have a
perfect line then we're going to go and
give it a white fill just for now remove
the stroke on it and move it over or to
the side press ctrl-c ctrl-v flip it
horizontally put them two together just
like that and then press shift while
you're selecting those just like both of
them you're going to modify combined
fats and union and in your union process
if it happens to have that seam in the
middle left over like mine does don't
worry about it that's no problem it's
not going to affect anything worth doing
and you can try many many different
shapes you try it very thin tall like
that or you can try and big fat wide
trees like that I'll try and mine thin
and tall like that
I'm going to go to the fill color make
it this dark blue of the land here I'm
going to scale it I'm gonna hold shift
while I scale it so I don't lose a
proportion that it has and I'll just
scale it down so about the size I want
it doesn't have to be precise and then
I'll go to the filter shadow and glow
inner shadow I'm going to make sure that
inner shadow is white
let's take a look at that and the
directions already set up with the exact
direction that we need of the trees on
the site if you have your tree on this
side you'd want to make the light source
hit it from the other angle okay that
looks pretty decent to me so I'm going
to scale it down to about the size where
it's going to live out there and then
I'm going to highlight this shape this
snowman I'm holding select as I
highlight all these things to select
them all together
snowman's shadow and then this shape
here so I have those four things
selected I'm going to bring those to
front control shift up arrow key and
that put my tree to the back you see
because I want this to look like a
far-off distant forest right around
there of pine trees so I'll press ctrl-c
ctrl-v
make a copy of that tree and then I can
shrink it or scale it up make it bigger
if I won but I'll just pepper those
through there so I have a whole bunch of
them back they're different sizes in
different locations and with these trees
you want to be careful that the ones in
the back are always the smallest the
ones that are in the front are the
largest or else it'll look a little
funny okay so that's what that looks
like now I'm going to highlight all of
those trees
and hold select as I highlight them put
them into a group so once I get them all
selected I'm going to press ctrl G now
they're a group that I can then
manipulate if I wanted to manipulate for
instance the height to make them really
tall and skinny or really short and fat
I'm gonna make mine a little shorter
actually and then I can scale the whole
thing by holding shift at the corner and
it will scale all in proportion like
that I could even drag that in front of
the moon if I wanted so where some of
the trees would be in front of the moon
if I wanted to do something like that
but I don't think I do I'm gonna leave
mine right there because I think that
looks pretty good if you want you can
darken the color of the fill color on
all of the trees while they group like
that okay now all we have to do is get
Santa going across the moon with the
reindeer so I already have mine set up
and ready to go let me zoom in on it so
you can see what it consists of and what
I did was I went to Google and I search
images for reindeer clipart and Santa's
sleigh clipart and I found some examples
of Santa driving the sleigh so what I
did was copied one of the reindeer that
I could find or really I traced it out
using my pen tool and then I just
duplicated that a whole bunch and threw
it around through and put enough to make
it look like a team of reindeer and then
for Santa was the same thing I kind of
just got a general feel for how the
sleigh should look and then it took me a
few minutes to draw it out with my pen
tool or if you could just find it
ready-made you'll be all set
or else you'll have to use your pen tool
like I had to you can make yours very
unique as well just by using your pen
tool you can use reference a mother
clipart that you see but use your pen
tool to make yours your own so I'm going
to highlight that press ctrl C go back
into the scene we're working
you press ctrl-v once he's in there I
can position him any way I like
and size him to be any size that I want
that's not a bad size right there
actually and I'm gonna rotate it just a
little bit like that so it looks like
he's going up a little bit right there
maybe I should have Santa in the middle
of the moon now let's give Rudolph is
shiny bright red nose so let's zoom in
and what I'm gonna do is just grab out
an ellipse and I'm going to put it right
here on his nose hold shift while I draw
it out I'm gonna make sure that's solid
and maybe we'll do a bright red see how
that looks
we can also give it a glow filter it's a
little bit too big let's make it too
wide and too high that looks good and
that's the perfect spot so let's go
ahead and highlight that go to the
filters shadow and glow glow let's see
what that looks like add a hundred
percent that looks pretty darn good you
can adjust that glow factor but I like
that right there that looks good to me
so I'm going to grab the nose and all of
the reindeer with Santa and ctrl G and
group that just in case so if I move
this the nose stays with Rudolph see no
matter where they go and you can really
just play with this all day and make it
awesome as much time as you put into it
that's how great it would be so I'm
going to do is select this I'm going to
just put one more set of tree or forest
over here I'm going to flip it
horizontal okay I'm very satisfied with
that so now I'll show you a nice text
that you can put a nice font rather
let's click down there and type in Merry
Christmas and I'm going to change that
to white and the font is script Tina so
if you want a nice font for greeting
cards and other fancy things like that
this one does nicely so you just stick
your Merry Christmas wherever you want
it you'd even give that a little bit of
a glow
you want that to have a glow effect to
match maybe the aurora and get that aqua
aurora color bring that down and you go
softens up those edges a little bit
and then since you have a work of art
now you can sign it bring down the size
on that I'm going to make it dark blue
put it about right there I'll add a drop
shadow make it white make it to over
here its depth make this maybe one or
two to looks good there bring it up just
a little bit and that looks really nice
and I'm going to even fold that out make
it a little bit smaller perfect now it
looks like it's kind of edged into the
snow all right there's your work of art
have fun and if you guys do anything
really fantastic
give me Lincoln let me check it out okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
