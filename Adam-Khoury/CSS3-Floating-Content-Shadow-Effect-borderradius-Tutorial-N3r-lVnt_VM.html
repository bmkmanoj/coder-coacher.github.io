homepage and I used the css3
border-radius property to achieve an
effect that I had to use an image to
achieve in the past I got old dorky and
excited about it and now I'm recording
this video because I just stumbled onto
the fact that I could do this without
images now using css3 in the mix made
buddy happy so in this very quick design
tip I'm going to share a pure css3 trick
to get a floating content shadow effect
under specific visual content okay first
let's explain what we have in this
example before we add the effect let's
take a look at it first actually you can
see I have a video that's rendered to
the center of this page and the video
element the iframe element for that
video is placed into a box called video
box and in my CSS you can see that I'm
centering that video box and giving it a
width of 560 so it has a width of 560
and it's centered by assigning Auto for
the left and right margins for my top
margin I have 100 pixels
my bottom margin is zero pixels so
that's why you see the box is 100 pixels
off the top and it's centered in the
page okay so that's all I've got here
now right under the iframe for the
embedded video I'm going to add this div
with a class of oval shadow now up in
the CSS I'm going to add this rule to
effect this element with these
properties and you can add this div to
the page as many times as you like
with the class of oval shadow if you
made this an ID you couldn't add that as
many times as you like but just make
sure you add it using class you can use
it over and over again on the page so
let's take a look at it real quick and
there's the finished effect it gives you
an oval shadow underneath any kind of
Content visual content that you might
have in the page and it makes that
content appear to be floating
now let's discuss the properties real
quick for that little box or that div
background of a very very light gray and
you can also make that a solid black if
you want and then adjust opacity
settings for this div you can make the
opacity something like 0.1 or 0.2 and
that will give you a transparent shadow
but in most cases you can probably just
use a solid color without transparency
so I'm just using a solid light gray
color because my page is white now here
is the trick this is what made the Oval
effect the border radius property you
set that to 100% so it kind of makes
like a circle effect around the whole
element and since we only have a height
of 16 pixels and the element is very
wide you can see it stretches that
circular effect and makes an oval nicely
so border radius is really doing the
magic here and we set margin top 24
pixels that way that shadow isn't
touching the content it has to have some
space away from the content to give the
appearance of floating and if you guys
like this video and you like this
concept I can take it one step further
with you and make another video now what
I'll show you to do in the next video is
to program an animation to make this
content float and actually animate to
make it actually float in midair so you
can make a cool animation effect if you
animate both of these elements you make
this visual content float up and down
real smooth and then you make this
shadow with property animate so you
animate its width property to correspond
with the animation of this element going
up and down which is a really cool
advanced visual effect that I'll show
you guys what only if you like the crap
out of this video and give me a comment
to man let me know that you want to see
it and I'll do it if not I'm just gonna
go about my merry way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
