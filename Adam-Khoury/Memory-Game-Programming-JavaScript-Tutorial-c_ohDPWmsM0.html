learn to create a JavaScript powered
memory game that you can easily enhance
and extend as your skills improve as a
JavaScript programmer first let's take a
look at a demo which shows the finished
product of the exercise your memory game
can have as many cards as you like the
card back faces can have any graphics
that you want to put on them we've
programmed it to turn both cards back
over if a match is not made if a match
is made then both cards in the match
remain flipped and when all matches are
found the program reshuffles the entire
board so that all of the cards are in
new locations so let me see if I can
make a match F and K G and H a and e DS
they're all different there's a K and
there's a K so since I've hit a match
now they both remain flipped and then I
continue playing the board C was over
there and my memory is pretty good since
I'm almost positive that a lot of you
are going to be wondering how to flip
these cards in 3d space so it makes a
real flipping animation I have a
tutorial that I put out a while ago that
shows you real 3d flipping of cards
because you really gain the most through
trial and error and experimentation on
your own
we're going to begin with the bare bones
of an html5 web document that already
has a script element and a style element
in place that way we can just put our
CSS here and our JavaScript here if you
want to externalize any of your CSS in
JavaScript
that's totally up to you first thing
we'll do is go into the body element on
the page and we're going to put in our
div that is the memory board now we'll
go up into the CSS and put in a rule
that's going to affect the memory board
so these properties are applied to the
memory board div and let's view with
that renders it's just a grey centered
box now through the JavaScript
programming of our game is going to be a
lot of little divs that are going to
represent the cards that are going to be
dynamically placed into this memory
board so all we have to do is put one
more style rule for all of the dynamic
little divs that are going to be placed
into the memory board so we target the
div the idea of memory board and we
specify this rule to target all child
divs within the memory board so when
JavaScript places them there they're
going to have all of these simple
properties applied to them and that's
all the CSS that our program is going to
require so let's just go ahead and
collapse all the style we don't need
that in our way
the first thing we're going to do when
our JavaScript is initialize some
variables so we have four variables
being initialized now this first
variable is an array that holds all of
the content that's going to be under you
hiding under your cards so each element
in this array represents the content
that's going to be hiding under each
card basically this array is used in
JavaScript to dynamically create all the
cards the next variable is an empty
array and that's for storing the memory
values and I'll show you in the script
where we're going to use that and the
next variable is another empty array
that stores memory tile IDs and then we
have a variable for tiles flipped that's
just for keeping track of how many tiles
are flipped now the next thing we're
going to do in our script is we're going
to add a shuffle method to the array
object in JavaScript because by default
array objects in JavaScript
no shuffle method that you can easily
access so we'll apply our own shuffle
method and we'll use the prototype
property to add it directly to all array
objects and basically we're putting this
in place so that this array here that
represents all the cards can easily be
shuffled at any time we need it to
within our program and I've done
tutorials about how to add your own
shuffle method to the JavaScript array
okay now that we've initialized some
variables and we've added a shuffle
method to array objects in JavaScript
now we're going to put the function in
place that's going to be for generating
a new board and there's really not much
to it the first thing we do is we make
the tiles flipped variable back to zero
each time a new board is generated then
for the output we create an empty
variable then the next line we take the
memory array which is this array right
here and we run the memory tile shuffle
method on it which is the new shuffle
method that we added to the array object
through prototype so all you have to do
is run this one line whenever you want
to shuffle that array basically you're
shuffling cards then we run a for loop
over the length of that array so
basically you're looping over all of the
cards and you're going to add to the
output variable all of the little divs
representing those cards so each little
div gets an ID of a dynamic tile number
so the first div in this loop will have
an ID of tile underscore 0 the second
div in this loop will have tile
underscore one and so on and so forth
then we give each an on click event and
we're going to put a new function in
place called memory flip tile and that's
going to be the function responsible for
flipping the tiles over and we're going
to send in two variables or two
arguments this which is going to
represent whichever div is being
accessed
so our memory flip tile function will
have access to this calling object and
the next variable we want to send
through is the data for each of the
cards so basically in the first pass of
this loop this a is going to be passed
right here it's going to be the value
within
that element in the array all right so
each little card when clicked runs the
memory flip tile function that we're
going to write right now and then after
your for loop you simply place all of
those little cards you put the output
into the memory board by saying document
dot get element by ID memory board that
innerhtml
is equal to all of the output we just
generated within this loop now at this
point before the flip tile function is
put into place you can go down into your
HTML right under the memory board you
can put in this line that will make the
new board function run that generates
the board now you can put it under the
element like I have here or up in your
JavaScript you can add a window dot add
event listener for the load event of the
window and make the new board function
run in the add event listener for the
load event for the window so if you want
to put this new board function to run in
the load event of the window that's
totally up to you or you can just do it
like I've done it here and we're doing
that just because the page has to have
access and know where the memory board
div is before we can populate the board
when the page is loading now if we check
that in our favorite browser we'll see
that we have the dynamic board generated
all the little cards are in place and if
we click them now nothing happens
because we don't have the flip tile
function in place yet and that's what
we're going to put in place now okay now
we're going to put in the function
memory flip tile that every one of those
little cards has to reference when
they're clicked and remember this
function is passed two arguments here
dynamically and the first argument
represents the actual div that's being
clicked the second argument represents
the content within that array element
okay so let's go under function new
board go down one line and that's where
we'll place our memory flip tile
function and don't worry I'm going to
explain every single line within that
function so nobody's in the dark about
anything in the way it starts is very
simple we grab those two arguments
coming into the function that were
created right here for each div so we
scoop up those two arguments so we
have the card or in this case I called
it tile and then we have its value so
for the first if condition we check to
see if the tile innerhtml is empty and
the memory values length is less than to
the memory values array which remember
starts off empty so only if the tile
innerhtml
is empty and the memory values dot
length is less than two then and only
then do we run all of the code within
the function because you can see all of
that code is wrapped within that if
condition and that if condition closes
right here so none of this code is going
to run unless this if condition returns
a value of true so when the user clicks
any of the cards to flip them this if
condition evaluates for true and if it
returns true then we make the card style
background to white we change it to a
white background and if we look at that
in the browser you can see when it's
clicked it gets a white background and
we're also going to place the value into
the inner HTML of that tile so that way
when it's flipped it also gets the value
shown now we're going to run an if
condition that's going to evaluate the
memory values array length to see if
it's 0 and if it is zero which it starts
empty by default we're going to push the
new value into the memory values array
for the card that the person is clicking
then in the memory tile IDs array we
push the tiles ID or the cards ID the
one that the user is clicking so that
way our memory values array on our
memory tile IDs array both have values
that represent the cards that the user
is clicking now if the memory values dot
length is not 0 that means it might have
one in it already then this else
condition is going to fire off and then
this code won't run but all of this code
will run so we say else if the memory
values length is equal to 1 that means
if there's already one card flipped over
and the user is clicking a second one
now then we're going to take that new
second card that clicking and push that
value into the
values array and we're going to push
that tile ID into the memory tile IDs
array then we're going to run another if
condition to see if both cards are a
match in this little condition is set in
place to check if both cards are a match
so we say if memory values array element
1 is equal to memory values array
element 2 then we're going to plus 2 on
the tiles flipped variable because we
know we have a match so those tiles are
going to stay flipped over so we have to
add 2 to the tiles flipped variable then
the next thing we do is clear both of
the arrays and get them ready for a new
matching sequence so you're clearing
both of these arrays to get them ready
for a new matching sequence since the
user just made a match and the last
thing we do here in this else if
condition is we check to see if the
tiles flipped variable is equal to the
whole memory boards arrays dot length so
you're checking to see if the tiles
flipped are all the tiles basically
you're checking to see if all the tiles
are flipped over and all matches have
been made then you're going to run an
alert that says board clear generating
new board when the user clicks ok then
you're going to clear the memory boards
innerhtml completely and then generate a
new board so that new tiles dynamically
get placed in there at random positions
it'll be a completely new shuffle
now this next else condition is the last
little bit of logic within our program
and it's connected to this if condition
right here so remember that if condition
was seeing if the match is made so this
else condition of course is for if the
match is not made so if the user flips
over two cards and there's no match and
we run this little bit of code in that
case if the user has flipped two cards
and no match is made so basically what
I've done is I put a set timeout here to
make those two cards flip back a little
bit over half a second and if you want
to leave those two cards flipped over
for a longer amount of time you can just
put this on like two seconds but I
wanted it to be just a little bit over
half a second so I put it on 700ml
seconds half a second is 500
milliseconds so I have it on seven so
after seven tenths of a second we're
going to flip those two cards back over
and it calls a function called flip to
back
so the function flip to back is sitting
right here and basically this function
what it does is takes those two cards
and flips them back over and you make
sure that you clear both of the memory
values array and the memory tile IDs
array after you flip them back over now
since we have a finished program let's
run a test in our favorite browser so
I'll click one of the memory cards it's
an A and I'll click another one
it's a J since there's no match they
quickly turn back over there's a D is an
E is a G there's an H there's a K is an
F there's a K there's a K now since I've
made a match they both remain turned
over all right so I've got to the point
to where I've made all the matches
except for one so let me go for the last
match and then JavaScript alerts board
clear generating new board okay and now
all the cards are in different locations
so the user can't just repeat what they
did last time if you enjoyed the video
