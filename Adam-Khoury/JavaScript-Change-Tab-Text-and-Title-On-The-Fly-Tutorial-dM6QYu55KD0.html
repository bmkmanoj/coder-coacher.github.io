is just a simple and quick developer tip
about how to use javascript to change
the tab text in the browser software
just like YouTube is currently doing to
have a little play symbol in it all the
way at the top of the browser software
it's pretty cool they're good to show
you right now it's very easy let's view
a live example so you can evaluate
whether or not you like it and want to
learn more about it
so at youtube.com if you're in a modern
browser and you press play in the video
you see that a little arrow appeared at
the very top of the browser software in
the tab in the title of the page and
then if I press pause it goes away
because the multimedia is not playing
anymore and that's some pretty smart
programming by the guys over at Utah by
like hey I'm going to show you now we're
gonna start with the bare bones of an
html5 web document mine is named example
dot HTML you can see the title of my
page starts by default as multimedia
page and that's all we're gonna be doing
in this tutorial is showing you how to
change the title during runtime of the
application basically changing the page
title anytime you need to and that
effects the tab text so first thing
we're gonna do is just for a developer
purposes let's put in a button let's
close that button and let's put the word
play in its inner HTML and then that
button we're gonna give an on-click
event listener so on click equals
whatever javascript that i want to run
and in this case i'm gonna run a
function called tab text which i haven't
created yet but i'm going to create that
in just a moment now I'm gonna put
another button in that says pause now I
can send my text whatever text that I
want through this function in between
single quotes like that and I'll just
take the default text right here of the
title put it in between my single quotes
and do the same thing down here in
between single quotes now when the play
button is hit
I want a little arrow to appear so all I
have to do is put in the HTML symbol for
the arrow that points right and then a
space now all we need is this tab text
function so let's put that in place
because when this button is clicked it's
gonna fire off a function called tab
text in our JavaScript so let's type in
function tab text
open closed parentheses put an opening
curly brace and put in the closing curly
brace now the one argument coming into
this function is a string which is going
to be whatever string we want to change
the title with so we could just put text
and then we're going to say document dot
title equal to text and that will
effectively change the documents title
to whatever text you want at anytime
that you want it doesn't have to be in
the on click event of this button it
could be on the on click event of your
multimedia player button just like
YouTube is doing and it could be any
event you could have just mp3s on the
page and if you want it to be just like
YouTube's you would simply start it
start the page off with that arrow
symbol on top like that so now if I run
this in my favorite browser software I'm
gonna see the arrow symbol because the
video is playing when the page loads by
default and when I press pause you see
my little arrow symbol went away I press
play again my arrow symbol comes back
that's exactly how YouTube is
functioning and keep in mind that that
arrow symbol might not look the same in
all browser software in the future it
might but not currently some browsers
don't render it as cleanly as chrome is
rendering it right now and so map some
older browsers won't render it at all
and I went and got the symbol for that
arrow at develop PHP if you go to the
HTML library you'll see HTML symbols and
I went to the arrow symbols and then on
that page is a ton of arrows and I have
the little play symbol down here it's
all the different triangles you can use
in different positions alrighty I hope
this has been a helpful tip bit for you
if you happen to have multimedia playing
on any of your pages videos audio
whatever</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
