exercise we will show how writing just a
few lines of JavaScript will allow you
to render browse and discover the
thousands of HTML code symbols and icons
that are available as numeric codes flat
icons are all the rage right now in web
development so let's go exploring here
is an example of what will dynamically
render on your page when you run these
few lines of JavaScript so we just set a
low range and then a high range so I set
9 9 8 5 and the high range was 101 74 so
I get all of those symbols rendered to
the page and you can set a range between
any two numbers that you want to see all
of the symbols all at once or just sets
at a time okay get any old example HTML
file ready in your favorite code editor
and the code editor doesn't really
matter we're going to type in a div and
give it an ID equal to icons and then
we'll just go down and make sure we
close that div because inside of this
div is where we're going to render a lot
of divs nested inside of there or you
can render it into a table which might
be cleaner looking to you it doesn't
matter to me
I'm just going to use divs to keep the
code as little as possible but you can
expand it into a table set up all right
now I'm going to pop in some CSS and
what we're doing is we're targeting the
icons div then we're targeting any child
divs that are within the icons did so
here we're going to dynamically render a
whole lot of divs through script or if
you want to make it a table you can
render a whole lot of table cells and
table rows okay so this rule targets any
child divs that are inside of this icons
container and then this rule targets any
be tags that are inside of those child
lives so if there's any bold tags that
are inside they're going to get these
properties applied so the CSS is very
simple now we'll go into our icons
container
we're going to type in script make sure
we close that script element and then
we're just going to set up a for loop
and that's how we dynamically and
magically render all of those icons with
just a couple of lines of code so we say
for VAR I is equal to 9 9 8 5 and you
can start at any number you want it can
be 0 or even a higher number then 9 9 8
5 and the next parameter for the for
loop is going to be while I is less than
10,000 175 semicolon and the last
parameter is I plus plus so basically
what this for loop is set up to do now
is run from index 9 9 8 5 all the way up
to 10000 175 now we're simply going to
document dot write and in between
parentheses we'll write what we want to
magically render to the page so first
we'll put the opening div tag and we'll
go down one line or a couple of lines
and put the closing div tag so we're
going to get a whole lot of divs written
to the page dynamically now let's say
what if we were to just write I in
between there let's just put the I
variable into the div and see what
happens you see you get all of your
numbers okay now watch how easy and
slick this is first put a set of double
quotes and then we put a plus sign to
append the number the eye index number
to this string that we're about to put
here ampersand pound symbol so we're
going to have ampersand pound symbol
then the dynamic number then we append
to that another set of double quotes and
finally the semicolon and that's what
gives you the special HTML code to
render the symbol and I'll render this
in my favorite browser and you see we
see all of those symbols all I have to
do is put them in between a B tag and
then I'll get the styling that I want
because that CSS will now apply to
anything that's in the B tag so let's
check out what we have now you can see
them much bigger much clearer now and
above that we can also just write the
the written version so people can
visually see what the HTML code is that
renders that symbol and to do that you
pretty much do the same as you did here
but you just put an amp to make sure
that it's not going to render as the
symbol it will just render as the string
needed to render that symbol so there
you go now
you could run through any range of
numbers that you want I'll go from nine
thousand to twelve thousand and see what
symbols we get it's going to be a ton of
them look at all that but most of these
symbols will render in all of the
popular browsers nowadays where you see
symbols look at all these cool symbols
but a lot of them are icons that you can
actually use for web here's some dice
one two three four five six and dice and
you can use that for web games or
whatever that have dice rolls you don't
have to have any images you can just
give the entity representation of the
numbers one through six more arrows a
little Menotti and Satan symbols
religious symbols freemason symbolism a
lot of brainwashing and there's also a
lot of scientific symbols and if we
start a zero and we go to something like
five hundred you can see where it starts
it starts with letters and punctuation
the first bunch is missing and then you
have all of the letters on the keyboard
all of the characters that are on a
keyboard come first and then you start
getting into some symbols and then a lot
of lettering for other languages and
Latin and stuff and then the higher you
get the more you get into all the cool
little symbols
