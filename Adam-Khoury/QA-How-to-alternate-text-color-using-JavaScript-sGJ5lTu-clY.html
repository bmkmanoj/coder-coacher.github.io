question comes 21 hours ago from wins
the Drude sorry for the off topic but I
have a question how do I color every
second character of a string into red in
JavaScript
for example bar a equals this as a
string I want the first the third
character and so on to be colored in red
now there are a few different ways to
skin this cat in JavaScript I'm going to
show you an approach that will allow you
to not only select every other letter in
the string and color it but you might
have a requirement that you want every
third letter you might not just want
every other letter in the string you
might want every third letter in the
string to be colored or maybe you only
want every fifth letter in the string to
be colored okay so start with a blank
HTML file and let's pop in a style
element and we're also going to pop in a
script element for our JavaScript and
that's all we need for this quick
example now in our CSS we're just going
to put two simple rules so anything on
the page with the class of color one
will be red anything with the class of
color two will be black and you can swap
those colors and change them to whatever
you want now let's make the magic happen
in JavaScript the first thing I'll do is
put the string that I want to effect and
you can see my string says
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious now I
need to make an array out of that string
so what I'm going to do is type in bar
and name my array chars and that's going
to be equal to the string variable that
split method and we're just going to
split by every character so we can just
put in a set of double quotes there or a
set of single quotes now I'm going to
create a new variable that's just going
to be the result I'm going to be
compounding HTML into the result
variable now since we have an array we
can run a for loop over that array so
let's say for open close parenthesis
opening curly brace and closing curly
brace now let's set up the parameters
for our for loop we need var I is equal
to zero semicolon in the second
parameter while I is less than charge
length semicolon the last parameter is I
plus plus we increment the I variable so
now in the for loop we're going to take
the result variable
and compound to it so we'll type in plus
equals and that will append to it every
time that way it won't get overwritten
things will keep appending into it and
let's just put a set of single quotes
and semicolon so I'll put a span element
and I'll make sure I close that span
element now within it
I want the character to be displayed so
we can append to that string by putting
a single quote plus sign another plus
sign and a single quote and then in
between the plus signs we type in charge
opening bracket closing bracket and in
between the brackets you simply put the
I which is going to represent the array
index so the first time this loop runs
you'll have the s second time the loop
runs you'll have the U third time the
loop runs you'll have the P and so on
and so forth so now I'm going to put in
that span class is equal to CL r1 that
should make all of them read because we
still need a little bit of logic now
underneath our for loop the result
variable is all finished so it can be
written to the page so I'll put document
dot right and in between h1 heading I'll
just put the result this should result
in all read so let's test it in our
favorite browser okay now all we need is
the logic to alternate colors and that's
very simple to do and I'm going to use
the mold doulas operator to show you a
pretty neat trick
now before we append anything into the
result variable in the for loop let's
put an if condition it says if I mul
doulas to is equal to 0 then we'll take
this control X and we'll put it in the
if condition right here then we'll just
type in an else condition and put CLR 2
here so we have CLR one in this
condition and CLR 2 here let's see what
that does
there you go your first letter is read
your second letter is black or really
you can make the second letter the other
letters any color that you want
now what if I go and change this to to
a3 let's see what happens now let's
refresh so you see the first one's red
and then it doesn't color another one
red until it gets to another index in
the array that's divisible by 3 let's go
two-five now refresh so you see how that
works now there's lots of different ways
to do this in JavaScript in a loop but I
prefer using the modulus to see if
things are divisible by a certain number
and then and only then color them we
also use this logic for grid programming
if you're ever programming a grid and
you want boxes to be or elements to be
gridded out on the page while you're
looping those things out to the page you
can put a line break or whatever you
need to for the next row in the grid
using this kind of logic so you can use
grid logic for alternating the colors
within your strings which gives us this
effect ok wins the Drude I hope that
answer was sufficient for your question</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
