source file package that you can
download from develop PHP com you can
learn how to create your own custom
flash actionscript 3 mp3 playlist boom
box so it plays a full playlist of songs
and it's an animated boom box and let me
go ahead and publish out and you can
take a look at it
get a song that jumps a little bit so
you can see the speakers driven by the
sound amplitude real time so if you turn
the of your pan that's the sound slider
to the right you'll see that only the
right channel is powered and the visual
is act accordingly slide the pan to the
left the equalizer and the speakers act
accordingly it's really cool you see
that equalizer going back and forth and
the speakers are activated or not by
where the sound channel is and let's see
if we press pause we have a nice pause
and play toggle button that you can
learn how to create forward and back
buttons to play the next songs it gets
the track 8 goes back to track one and
it's important to know that you can put
up to an unlimited amount of mp3's in
this player you just define the number
of tracks you want it to play in the
code say if you had 24 tracks in your
folder you just define that number in
the code and this player will suck it
right up automatically and we have a
nice volume slider here and a clickable
playhead so if you have it in play mode
you can click the playhead anywhere and
it'll jump to that song or that part of
the song and you can also drag the
playhead and I made a cool ghost knob
effect to where it shows them where the
playhead is even while they're dragging
that when they let go it snaps to that
point of the song so they have the
option of dragging the playhead or
clicking the playhead anywhere and I
added a feature of the song id3 data
artist title and artist the artist an
artist and song title scrolls by in an
animated fashion and under a mask so it
looks like it's in a window and that's
pretty much all the features you can
download this source package free and
inside the package you'll see this where
you can get the understanding and see
when you open it up in flash cs3 or cs4
you'll see it has one layer called
boombox and on that lay
there's one movie clip inside the movie
clip is where you'll find the script all
the code I put nice comments above all
the code so you can learn and adapt and
modify and so if you have any questions
with what any line of code is doing in
this application you head over to the
forums and develop PHP and we'll help
you out we'll start a conversation about
this application and will enhance it
modify it get you the understanding you
need whatever needs to take place all
right we're here to teach so we'll see
you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
