clicked or whatever kind of event you
want to listen spore you can make sounds
run on those events and traditionally
you would use a fast click sound or a
quick little beep really you can use any
sound you want mm click hmm now you can
find and download tons of free bleeps
and click sounds for your audible menu
systems by doing a little searching on
the web right now now try your best to
find a very short length sound file mp3
files that are short beeps or fast
clicks are the best four button sounds
and once you get some cool button sound
effects downloaded you're ready to begin
this simple lesson you really don't want
to use a song file to demonstrate this
to yourself and I also have a tutorial
from a couple of years ago that shows
how to create your very own custom
button sounds in fruity loops i will
link to that tutorial right here so just
click this box if you want to learn
about creating custom button sounds for
the web using fruity loops that
tutorials a couple of years old but it
still applies today now first before we
get our hands dirty with the code let's
take a look at the finished product of
what you'll be learning today and what
it shows is just how to put button sound
effects when these buttons are clicked
and this example also shows how to make
the the active state readily available
in CSS that way you get a little
brighter state when the button is
clicked and held and you let go you see
so the sound fires off when the button
is first clicked then if the user holds
the button it'll stay in the lit up
state like that or if they just do fast
clicks they'll just see a quick bright
flash and you would want to get a sound
effect that's a little more smooth I've
got one that's really obvious and kind
of annoying on my buttons you would want
to get one that's just like a real quick
eeep or take a small tick or click just
so it's not annoying to your user and it
comes across as more elegant rather than
annoying we're going to start with the
bare bones of an html5 web document the
first thing we'll do is add the four
buttons in
side of a nav tag so we'll use the html5
nav element go down a couple of lines
and make sure we close that nav element
and inside of it we're going to put for
a elements make sure each one of those
is closed as well and for the href
attribute just for the lesson code I'm
just going to put a pound sign and you
can put the URL to the web address that
you're going to navigate to using that
button now what I'm going to do is use
the onmousedown event for my button
sound trigger you can use on click or
onmousedown you can also target on hover
if you want to target the hover event
you can make some other different sound
fire off when the users mouse hovers
over the button and then a totally
different other sound fire off when they
actually click it you can put multiple
sounds within your menu system targeting
different events so in the label of this
one we'll just put the button label to
be home and I'm going to copy that three
times this one will be about us services
and contact now we're going to put the
JavaScript functionality that we want to
happen right here in the onmousedown
event so what we need is the javascript
in place to bring in that html5 audio
object through script so we'll go up
into the head element and we'll put in a
script element make sure we close that
script element and the first thing
inside of it we're going to type in VAR
bleep and that's going to be equal to
new audio element or new audio object
instance so bleep is a new audio object
instance and we want to set the source
file for the bleep so I'll say bleep dot
source is equal to and in between the
double quotes I'll put the path to that
sound file bleep dot mp3 so this in
effect should preload that sound file to
your webpage now all you have to do down
in the onmousedown event is target the
bleep instance and run the play method
open closed parenthesis so bleep play is
all you have to do so now let's test
this in our favorite modern browser so
you see we have all of our buttons here
or all of our links they're going to be
buttons in a second when I throw in some
CSS you can see that we have the sound
effect
already attached to them which is what
we want so that's the JavaScript
functionality at its core right there
and you really don't need to go much
further to understand what's going on
now but now what I'm going to do is pop
it in some CSS there's a little bonus
for you guys in case you're new to CSS
so in the head element above our script
element I'm going to put it in a style
element make its type text/css and make
sure I close this style element now
inside I'll put my CSS and I'm targeting
here let me lay out the properties like
this so you can see them better but I'm
going to collapse those properties back
up when you guys grab the code at
develop PHP if you're going to snatch
this code that will all be in one line
and it'll still work just fine what I'm
going to have to do now is put the nav
ID of nav one here for this nav element
so nav ID is equal to nav one now all of
the CSS will be applied to my elements
that are within that nav and the nav
itself so the nav itself I give a margin
top 24 pixels so it's a little bit off
the top of the page all the child a
elements inside of nav one we're giving
these properties now for the hover state
I'm making it turn a green color and
then for the active state which is the
state when they actually click I'm
making it turn a brighter green color so
the active state is the one that you
target if you want to target the actual
interaction event the actual click
that's the active State now let's run
this in our favorite browser and see
what we get perfect okay that's the
first example all complete you guys
should be able to wrap your head around
what's going on pretty easily now but
I'm going to make one more example just
to show people who who like loading Ajax
content in or loading content into the
page through JavaScript without
reloading the whole page for those users
you want to go about this in a little
bit different sort of way so I'll make
that example real quick and explain
everything so what I'll do first is
collapse this style element so we don't
really need to look at add anymore and
it's really just for cosmetics okay so
what we're going to do here for this
next example is put a function called
play beat
sound open/close parentheses opening
curly brace and closing curly brace and
here in the arguments area for that
function we're going to place in the
variable name of num now inside of that
function what we're going to do is run
bleep play so we can put bleep dot play
semicolon right there and now let's
target the on click event for let's say
a group of button elements so instead of
a elements we're going to have button
elements let's call this section one
instead of running bleep dot play we're
going to run the play button sound
function and we're going to send one
parameter which is one it represents
section one now let's take that button
and put it in there maybe two more times
change this to section two section three
and in here we're going to send a two
and a three that way this function knows
to also actually let's name this load
content that would make more more sense
we're going to name this function load
content instead of play button sound
function load content and inside of load
content let's make a comment that says
play button sound now and then right
after the button goes beep you're going
to load content into a div on the page
so let's put that div into place
underneath the nav element let's put a
div close that div let's give that div
an ID so that way we can target it and
put HTML content into it dynamically
let's just name this div one and inside
we're going to type default content in
now after the button silent fires off
and you hear the beep you need to load
content into div one so we're going to
say var div 1 is equal to document
element by ID and the ID we want is div
1 we're just getting an object reference
for this element here in JavaScript and
then we can say div 1 dot enter HTML is
equal to loaded content for section and
then + num and that will display which
section is supposed to be displayed
within that
give this is all just for demonstration
purposes but this is how people
dynamically load content into the page
after it's loaded and you don't have to
refresh the page you can just reload a
section of the page with new content if
you want all right so everything looks
pretty good to me now let's see what we
get
let's run this in our favorite browser
see we get the button sound on our menu
system and we're dynamically loading in
new content into that div according to
which button is pressed
okay so those are two different
scenarios and in this example you don't
need any of this CSS because we're using
button elements you would target those
differently in CSS to style those so
you'll get these two different code
examples the first example which showed
a more traditional way from going page
to page on a website like normal
navigation and then this second example
shows loading page content dynamically
using JavaScript or Ajax and being able
to make the bleep play fire off within
your load content functions okay we hope
you've enjoyed this lesson on creating
button sound effects in your html5 and
JavaScript applications if you guys have
any questions or comments leave them
