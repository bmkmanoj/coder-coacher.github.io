developed PHP com forums requested to
see how I design something in fireworks
so this is a fireworks video tutorial
made this special fahim I hope that that
is okay with you so what he wants to see
is how i created the background my new
PHP syntax validator and i'll show you
what he's talking about if you go to the
develop PHP calm forward slash syntax
validator you'll see this online PHP
syntax bowel data are working on these
talking about that background with the
hatch design and really it's just a
small sliver of a rectangle that I'm
repeating across the page and repeating
a design across the page like that is a
really smart way to program a website
because all the browser's all the users
browser has to download is that one
small sliver and it can repeat that file
all throughout the page making it a very
fast loading process let's create a new
document and I'm just going to make mine
400 x 500 just to start out with and I'm
going to draw out a rectangle and I can
make it whatever size I want want to
make it a little higher than that
actually just so it comes down my page
pretty good length alright so there's a
rectangle and actually you can fit
canvas on that and what I did was I put
a gradient on it so i went to gradient
down here and it's phil selector you go
to gradient linear i don't want it so
dark on top so i'm going to make that
linear top color a little bit lighter so
i can just go down here and pick any
shade i want between this light and dark
so i'm going to go right about there
maybe then we'll go down to the texture
here and the one I use for that was the
thing was the crosshatch this one here
here we'll use crosshatch three I think
that's the one I used so there's your
cross hatches and you can see when you
put the cross hatches or any kind of
texture on your shape if you have a
gradient on it many times it will fade
to black or fade to white where you
can't see that cross hatch when you get
down to the when it fades into whatever
color you're fading into in this case
I'm just going to fade to white
we can even fade to something not so
white may be right about there now what
you do is you take your cross hatch
bring it down a little make sure it
fades in real good so just on top you
can see the hatch is pretty good that
should work right there and I simply
completed the design with two rectangles
on top I put one it was about like that
and not had a solid fill of that color I
think and that had no hatch and then the
next rectangle was right about here
somewhere and it's about that thick and
that one I made white and I gave it a
couple of shadow filters I went to drop
shadow make sure this one's all the way
down to 70 and I made it maybe three
something like that I think those are my
settings and then I did the same thing I
added drop shadow but going the other
way going up so I change the angle going
this way to 90 degrees I pulled this one
down a little and that's about what I
had then once I put that there I then
adjusted the opacity on it I brought it
down to about right there something like
that now the last thing you have to do
is just change the canvas size so just
click on the side somewhere out here to
where you see this pit canvas button and
all that stuff and you change the canvas
size I'm going to make mine 24 and then
I'm going to look real close and see how
my hatch is line up so I don't get some
wacky design I want it all to be smooth
when it lays across the page and repeats
press ok so let's go ahead and zoom in
there and see what we have going on now
it looks like those hatches are going to
meet up just right let me try that out
so I'm going to go to file export wizard
continue the web exit and it's important
to save this as an optimized web type
file jpg is preferable i went up to
about 86 with mine on the quality of my
jpg it made a 2.29 kilobyte strip and
you can see that strip right there
export you put it wherever you want to
put it I'm just going to put it on my
desktop
save let's minimize bio works and here
we are on our desktop and I'm going to
open Dreamweaver so to get that strip
laid across the page I'm just going to
create a new HTML file I'm going to save
it to my desktop it's on my desktop
where the background file was now I can
go to the page properties here in
dreamweaver and i'm going to show you
the code that this produces but if
you're using dreamweaver you might as
well just use these nice tools that
dreamweaver gives you for adjusting the
CSS and a couple of other things about
your page so let's go to background
image go to the folder where you have
those things and pick that image that
you just made now you see repeat you
want to repeat x that way it repeats
horizontally it won't repeat vertically
apply ok and there's your background my
frame all you have to do is make sure
you have those files both on the web if
you want to use that background for your
page you have to make sure that that
background file is up on your website so
the page can call it now let's look at
the code you can see the CSS is very
very simple it's just affecting the body
tag with a background image and
background repeat' and you can see the
image is right there so that would be
the path to the image on your server
when when it's online or whatever and
repeat is set to repeat x and that's how
simple it is my friend and there you
have it that's the same exact background
I had and you can look really close up
my hatches and you'll see that they line
up perfectly there are no spots with the
hatches kind of overlap each other or
have a bad design in them they match up
perfectly as they repeat across the page
oh yeah I almost forgot a real important
part in your fireworks design here
you're going to have a gradient so you
gotta go get that color that's on the
bottom part of the gradient mine's not
exactly white so I go back into
Dreamweaver and in the page properties
the background color make sure that I
assign that color code I think it was f
0 f 0 f 0 f 0 i think i'm not sure if
you need a pound sign there let me see
look nope that's not what I wanted
there we go now the design the
background of the page no matter how
tall it gets will blend right into that
graphic that you put in there alrighty
dude that's how it's done I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
