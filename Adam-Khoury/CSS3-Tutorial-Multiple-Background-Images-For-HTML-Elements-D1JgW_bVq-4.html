multiple image background settings for
your HTML elements this is something
that wasn't available to us in the old
version of CSS but now that it's
upgraded we can now do it excuse me man
that was disgusting whoo you guys should
smell that oh okay before we jump into
the code real quick I just want you guys
to see the structure of my folder here I
have my index page which I'm going to be
coding in just a second and then I have
power bird PNG atom PNG file those have
no background on them and then backdrop
dot jpg
okay let's once again start with the
bare bones of an HTML file in the body
tag what I'm going to do is go in and
just put an h2 tag to supply a little
heading to the page and then I'm going
to open up a div tag and I'm going to
give this div an ID that's equal to
whatever I want to name it you name
yours whatever you like
I'm just going to name mine my div close
the opening tag and then put the closing
tag for that div now up here in the CSS
we're going to put in the pound sign to
target that ID of my div that's on the
page now we can put in a background
image attribute and you can also use
shorthand for this so let's take this
curly brace put it down a couple of
lines and let's put this down one line
here let's indent that just a little bit
so let's say the background image is
equal to and let's browse and let's grab
that backdrop okay very nice now we're
going to put a background position let's
make this left and top and that image is
600 by 400 so I'll make sure I set those
properties in this div but I'm going to
set one more background attribute of
background repeat' and I'm going to set
this to no-repeat because I don't want
that image to repeat all right let's put
it in the width that was 600 pixels and
then my height for that image was 400px
okay so if I press ctrl s and I preview
this in a browser I should have that
image fed in as a background to my div
which is all good now if you want to add
multiple images to this using CSS you
can just put a comma separated list so
I'll take that and I'll copy it now
right in
of it I'm going to place my new image
that I want to assign and this is going
to be a PNG and it's going to be equal
to Adam dot PNG now I just go in here
and I can put another positioning
attribute for that and all I have to do
is separate it by comma again so I'm
going to position that one in the center
comma so you see the positioning for URL
of Adam dot PNG is set to center the
positioning for backdrop dot P jpg is
set for left-top now let's take a look
at what we have so you can see that CSS
is now allowing us to put multiple
images as backgrounds in and it'll layer
them right on top of each other okay and
I'll explain towards the end of the
video a little tip of why I think this
is a really helpful thing especially
with JavaScript programming and pre
loading things but there's really tons
of creative things that you could use
this for now what if I wanted that to
repeat across the whole div I would put
repeat comma and then no repeat for the
backdrop press ctrl s press f12 to
render and browser you'll see that atom
dot PNG repeats all through that
background now you can do the same thing
with the last file so I'll show you how
to put three but you can really put as
many as you want this one was power bird
and I wanted this one to be oriented to
the let's put this one on top so right
after Center let's put top so you can
see how they're stacking the one that's
in the furthest back layer of the
hierarchy is this one this one would be
in the very front this one is in the
middle and the same goes for all of
these settings no-repeat let's make sure
this one is set back on no-repeat and
then let's make the power bird no-repeat
as well comma there okay let's see what
we got now there you go so the power
bird is set to the top you can set them
to the left if you want you can do all
of this with shorthand CSS if you were
to put background and then you put your
URL say that one
then you just put no-repeat and the
position for it would be Center and then
you put your comma and then the next
image URL backdrop no-repeat and then
your position which would be left top or
top left now if I was to remove this
like that you'll see that it renders the
same okay so you can do it with
shorthand or longhand CSS whichever you
like I just wanted to show the longhand
first that way you guys really
understood how things were being stacked
in there and it really stacks the same
way shorthand now this is why I think
this is really helpful let's go ahead
and render this out to browser now you
can see we have three images there now
what if I was to take this one the
backdrop and put it in the front of the
line let's put the comma there and we
can change all of these things around
let's make this top left and then this
one would be the center actually it
really doesn't matter where these are
because you're not going to even going
to be able to see them what we're doing
is pre loading them to the page so if I
was to render this out you'll see you
can't see those other two so what you
can do is have a div that has a
background on it or whatever like a lot
of people they will put for their header
bar it'll have a background in it you
can put extra background images that are
load into the page and they'll be ready
if the page needs them for JavaScript or
whatever so this kind of goes in line
with the last lesson we had for building
the search field and the search button
remember how we were pre loading images
using CSS this is a really really clean
method to preload images and they would
be hidden the whole time but they'll be
available to your page whenever the page
needs it you don't have to preload with
JavaScript and you don't have to preload
by putting a hidden div on the page with
a whole bunch of image tags in it so
this is a really clean way to preload I
think you can preload a whole bunch of
images behind that image nobody will
ever see them loading in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
