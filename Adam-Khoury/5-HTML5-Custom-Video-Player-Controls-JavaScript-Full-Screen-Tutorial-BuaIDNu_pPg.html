customizing the html5 video controls in
this lesson we will focus on programming
a full-screen toggle button into our
custom video player using javascript
we're going to start with the same code
that we left off with in video number 4
we're going to go into our HTML we're
going to add a new button so let's just
grab this and this is going to serve as
our fullscreen button so in the inner
HTML of that button I'm just going to
put brackets for now and I'll change
this later with some out for some
graphics but for now just to get a
programmed I just want some brackets in
there and it'll look like kind of like a
screen box or whatever and I'll change
the ID to a full screen button full
screen BTN now let's highlight that id
press ctrl C to copy it now let's open
up our JavaScript now here in the top
where we're initializing all of our
variables let's go ahead and add that
one more fullscreen button now let's go
into the initialize player function and
make sure we add an object reference for
that so let's copy that put it right
there and right there now let's also add
a click event listener so we can borrow
the code for the play button and put it
right under the volume slider and this
will be for the fullscreen button so
fullscreen button that add event
listener and the event that we want to
listen for is click and the function
that we want to execute whenever that
button is clicked is toggle fullscreen
that's the name of the function we're
going to create okay so we can collapse
that code back up because we don't need
to see that anymore and let's go down to
the bottom and let's add our new
function toggle fullscreen and I'll
explain every line in this function for
you real quick
so what there is is a method called
request fullscreen and what you see
highlighted right here
that's the standardized syntax for it
that everything all the browser software
and all the crap like that we'll be
using in the future but right now since
this is all like experimental technology
until 2014 we have to put some if and
else condition statements in here to see
if that method is available for the
video object
so we're saying if the video object that
requests full screen method is available
then we're going to use the request full
screen method on the video element and
that will make a go full screen else if
the vid dot WebKit request full screen
method is available then we're going to
use the WebKit request full screen
method which is for Chrome and possibly
Safari and possibly some other less-used
browsers else if the video element Mo's
request full screen method is available
then we're going to run that method on
the video element and it's that simple
this will not work in all browsers yet
and I tested it in Firefox and Chrome
and it works but it's not going to work
in all browsers yet and maybe in 2014 it
will be standardized throughout all
browsers this requests full screen
normal syntax
I'm not going to refine this function
for you and it might be extra logic that
you have to add to it but I'm not going
to do it for you I just wanted to show
you the base logic about how this could
be done now I'm going to test this in
chrome now when I press full screen
button here it goes full screen and
that's nice now I have the normal
default controls back I think that's
more of a default browser behavior so
when you click it you can go back and
forth you can also hit escape once you
hit escape it goes back to so really
that's all the functionality you need
right there for Chrome now let's check
it in Firefox preview in Firefox
to the fullscreen button it goes into
full screen but there's no controls but
I can just press escape at any time to
get back to normal view</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
