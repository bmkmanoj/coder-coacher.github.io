here and I'm going to be releasing my
two tier drop down menu code let me show
you here there it is when you go over a
menu item that you want to give another
drop down on like that you can easily
code that in i show you how i'm going to
release the source code so everybody can
get to it the source code is made very
basic and it works in all browsers
firefox internet explorer chrome safari
all the major browsers anyway i've
tested in all of them and there's no
problems with it works really nice and
it's really simple to understand and
adapt for your needs change the colors
of it the styles and what we did was
remodeled it off of YouTube's pulldown
menu here so you see it looks very
similar my text is just a little
different and we added the functionality
of a two-tier drop down a second tier a
second tier menu that's what that is now
let's discuss the code yeah let's close
all tabs okay so in the HTML part of the
file which we're using a link to a style
sheet so you won't find the styles
directly in the HTML we're doing it's
smart way and linking to an external
style sheet where all the styles are
defined and it's important to have your
doctype claimed you want to use this
menu I noticed if you remove the doctype
the menu doesn't work in some browsers
it doesn't work so you want to make sure
you have your doctype claimed okay as
transitional so in the body section what
we have here is a table and the table is
holding let's go ahead and split the
view this table is holding everything
you can see here all of these little
boxes you see how these links don't have
the boxes that's because they don't
render a drop-down menu
the company divisions in legal all three
render a drop down menu company and
legal render a second-tier so let's look
at the code again so here we have the
menu let me just show you those last two
buttons first there's privacy and
contact you can notice that they're just
standard link sitting in a standard
table column and here we have another
table column let's start at the top in
the table the first table column in the
first row there's only one row in this
table in the first table column there is
the div tag in the div tag is the main
container called DC now in this main
container you have first you put the
link and then you put a span in between
the span is where you would put
everything that you want to drop down
that's how we have it set up see you
have sub category one and what I did as
opposed to the one tier drop-down menu
which is a little more simple all we did
was add another div here call the DC
underscore tier two and we put that on
this subcategory I don't know why that's
spelled like that sub category two so
sub category two renders will pull down
another pull down a second tier and
that's in between a span that's inside
of div class DC tier two and in that
span is where you have all the items
that you want to come down in your
second tier and really it's that simple
and then you can see for the company
pull down drop down here subcategory
three and four so here sub category one
sub category two sub category three and
subcategory for you'll notice sub
category 2 is a little different from 1
3 &amp;amp; 4 it has a div around it and it also
has a span inside of that div which
renders out the second tier
okay now let's take a look at our style
that CSS sheet which is connected to our
HTML file now in the top section lines 1
through 22 there in between you'll see
DC and that stands for drop content and
I labeled it drop content main container
characteristics so this is sets the main
the characteristics of the main look of
the drop down the background it has how
wide it is where it is you can adjust
where it is right there what it looks
like right here and these you don't want
to mess with unless you really want to
back round color but the z-index just
leave it like it is and that the index
leave that just like it is leave your
position relative so you really don't
have to mess with that these this is
where you would define kind of what it
looks like and then down here is the
span div and this is the drop menu
buttons characteristics the way the
buttons look that are in the drop-down
and the next one and this is what it
looks like in regular mode and when they
put their mouse over you can see i turn
it white and you know you can mess with
those characteristics here but when they
hover over it and this is just in its
regular mode the button in his regular
mode this is the button in hover mode
right here and that's where you can
change that stuff and the tier two
characteristics are here now the tier
two characteristics are I just made it
look just like the first menu because I
did really didn't want a difference in
looks really shouldn't have a difference
in looks but if you want you can have it
look different from the first tier maybe
have it all different colors that's
where you can manipulate all this stuff
where it is what it looks like and such
ok so now down here at the bottom this
is really not necessary for the whole
thing but this is where you can place
the styling for your the way your links
the way your text looks the way your
links act if they hover they underline
on hover or if they're always underlined
you can change that stuff here and
that's really simple standard stuff and
Dreamweaver will show you if you're in
Dreamweaver to show you options if you
just press space right there see shows
you all the little options you can use
put that back okay and that's everything
so that winds up giving you this see the
two-tier that's the second tier right
here like I said you can make that
different colors it can be wider you can
have more padding you hold all your menu
buttons all of these could have more
padding you can add padding different
colors position you can make it come
right off of the end of the word there
instead of offset like I have mind set
to the left a little bit so it's not
coming off right directly from the sea
but you can make it come directly like
that 90 degree angle with that see right
there and as well as all the rest at
pull downs so that's how easy it is and
this works in all major browsers so
don't worry about it not working in one
of them because I've tested in all of
them all the new major browsers anyway
that most people are using online okay
so I'll put this source code of the
developed PHP and it's going to be
living right here you click the CSS
course right under pure CSS dropdown
menus made easy it's going to be pure
CSS dropdown menus made easy to tears or
maybe drop down to tears menus made easy
whatever you'll see it right under that
one okay see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
