here today's lesson I'm going to show
you how to create your own custom button
sounds from scratch because you don't
want to go around using all these
regurgitating button sounds that you get
online that everybody else and their
mother uses because that's not cool and
how do you think all those button sounds
were created in the first place let's
we'll be showing you today how to create
custom button sounds and we're going to
be using fruity loops studio 9 to create
it so first let's create an ActionScript
3 file I'm working in flash cs3 but you
can be in cs4 or cs5 or any of the old
flash versions and let's create a button
so let's say we have a button here let's
make it per button now let's give it a
round it
there we go that's good now let's right
click it converts the symbol button
symbol and if you'd like to make your as
a movie clip animated movie clip button
you can go to develop PHP which shows
you how to make use sound anywhere in
your action script because movie clip
buttons are ActionScript based mostly so
you would have to put the sound within
your ActionScript which is very easy but
for this lesson I'm gonna show you how
to just do it on a regular button type
symbol but if you wanted a movie clip
symbol you wanted to add that sound to
the button through ActionScript that
little lesson I showed you right here
it's in the flash section at the Vela
PHP comm you sound anywhere in your
ActionScript can be applied but like I
said for this one regular button symbol
press ok now we have a button symbol
let's go inside of it let's give it
let's press so on the overstate press f6
put a keyframe on the down state let's
also put a keyframe now in the overstate
let's make it a different color
maybe I don't know a lighter burr there
we go and now let's give it another
layer on this layers where I'm going to
put the sound
so I want the sound on my down state
which is click so we'll put f6 press f6
on the down state and now we're all
ready to get a sound made up and let's
see let's make one more layer and let's
put this and text my boat on make that
white make it the better font
I don't like Times New Roman lesser
Arial is good okay my button so now
we're gonna put the sound right here
let's even name this layer sound name
this one text this one bass alrighty now
we go into fruity loops create this
sound from scratch okay so here we are
in Fruity Loops studio 9 and I'm gonna
show you how easy this is
let's close all this up get back to
where we'd be when the file or when the
program opens okay so this is what
you'll see when the program opens
something sort of like this what you
want to do is go into packs and I'm
gonna go into shapes citrus and I'm
gonna use this citrus shape 8 right
click it send to selected channel and
you can see up here the kick channel is
selected which is the kick drum I'm
going to go to send to selected channel
i right clicked it send to selected
channel you see and now i'm going to
make this one bar so you can make this
however many bars you like I'm gonna
make it 1 bar and let's go ahead and
open up the piano roll you go up here
it's a piano roll and now once you apply
it I'm gonna bring this volume down just
a bit
right about there now right when I click
in here it's going to I'm going to hear
the sound
and I can then manipulate it its tone so
let's anywhere in this spectrum you want
I make my nice high button sound even
higher than that that's good now you can
see it place that sound within that
channel so if you press play ok now we
go to file and let's export mp3 file
let's just name it beep and this is
going to be on the desktop safe start
okay now the file is on our desktop
let's minimize this and I'll show you
the file on the desktop and there it is
open it and your media player and you'll
hear it see okay
now let's go back in the flash and here
in that frame on the downstate of this
button is where we want to add that
sound so all we have to do for that is
going to file import to library that
beep mp3 and you can see there it is in
my library so I'm gonna go to this
downstate this keyframe here I'm gonna
go down to the bottom into the
properties panel where it says sound I'm
gonna put beep from the library now I'm
gonna press control enter test it out
pretty cool huh so any kind of sound I
want and then you can further edit that
sound say I didn't want it to be so long
I can take this bar right here drag it
in and it'll only be a short beep now
press ok control enter pretty cool huh
so that's how you can create your own
sound so you don't sound like everybody
else with their button sounds online
and this is how sounds get created from
scratch somebody uses an audio tool to
create certain sound effects and then
everybody on the web uses the same
button beep sounds I don't think that's
really cool I think it's better to make
your own sounds I wanted to ask you guys
within this video if you guys are hip to
learning how to use fruity loops to do 9
to create your own musical compositions
because I'm pretty dang good in Fruity
Loops studio I've used fruity loops
since way back when and I have a whole
sound recording studio on my computer so
I have the USB keyboard I have the
lexicon Omega tower so I can run live
guitars and microphones and bass guitars
and drums anything I want I can run
straight through my lexicon Omega tower
and it can go USB into your keyboard so
if you guys are hip to learning how to
create songs or musical compositions or
whatever using fruity loops to do 9 I'll
start a whole little playlist of how to
use fruity loops to do 9 and sound
equipment like the keyboard or guitars
or whatever to record your music and all
you need is a tracking program so if you
use Fruity Loops studio actually Fruity
Loops studio can do tracking as well but
maybe you want to use something like
audacity for tracking or you know Pro
Tools or anything like that I can show
you the whole in and outs of how to make
songs and music on your own you know
custom compositions so I just want to
extend that offer to you guys and you
can let me know in the comment section
below the video if you'd like to learn
how to use fruity loops to do to do more
things like make music I'll show you how
to use the whole program and all the ins
and outs of it but for this one that's
pretty much it you can see how simple it
was to make a custom button sound and
fruity loops has a huge Sound Archive
there's just not the shapes and
everything there's all kind of sounds in
here drum kits pianos organs whatever so
just let me know if you guys want to
learn more about it and I'll show more
about it but otherwise
so you create custom button sounds from
scratch so you don't have to use
everybody else's regurgitate button
sounds okay peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
