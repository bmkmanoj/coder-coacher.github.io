flash into actionscript-3 how to create
a progress bar in progress text to let
your site visitors know how much of the
swf is loaded into the browser so they
don't see a blank area on the screen for
any amount of time if you guys have any
trouble seeing our movements anything we
click on our ActionScript code or
anything like that you can go to develop
PHP calm and check out our flash tab
there you'll see the video tutorials we
have available that's developed PHP calm
you can also join our forum and post up
questions if you have any okay so three
layers we have here our actions load bar
and load text and movie content now on
the movie content layer you notice we
have two keyframes here already made and
what we're going to do is select key
frame two and put all of our content
there if you already have content down
in your on your stage on keyframe one
and maybe you have a whole bunch of
layers down through here just make a new
keyframe on key frame on frame 2 and
drag your content into keyframe to
effectively clearing out keyframe one
all the way through there okay so I'm
going to go into the library and drag
out a big giant image I have there to
give me something good and beefy to load
up and now i'm going to select the load
bar and load text layer and keyframe one
now on keyframe one there is we're going
to build our progress text in progress
bar and we're going to select the text
tool and throw out a dynamic text field
there and center it up on stage best you
can
and we're going to make sure the
instance name for that is my little text
down in the properties inspector and I'm
going to make sure it says dynamic text
there make sure it's black to see it on
a white canvas whatever font you want
make sure it's Center aligned make sure
a single line I think multi-line will
work here but single line is what we're
going for and that's it for that now we
can build our little progress bar and
that's going to be a movie clip so we're
going to start building that movie clip
with a rectangle primitive drag that
onto the stage and resize it go down to
the properties inspector in the width
put two pixels in the haight put eight
pixels so you'll have a little sliver
there rectangle primitive sliver right
click it and convert it to a symbol and
we're going to convert this to a movie
clip symbol with a registration to the
left and we're going to name it whatever
we want here because this is what it's
going to be named in our library and not
in our ActionScript code so it doesn't
matter what you name it there and press
ok now we have a movie clip symbol we're
going to give that an instance name of
my load bar so now we have my load bar
and my load text and this is going to
grow to be 200 pixels wide so we're
going to have to have some position
referencing where it's going to grow to
when it's fully extended so we know it's
in the middle so let's just drag out for
position referencing sake another
rectangle primitive tool we're going to
make that 200 pixels wide this way we'll
know exactly where this thing is going
to wind up after it's fully grown so we
can Center it
that looks about right now once that's
there oops once that's there grab your
movie clip symbol again and make it
perpendicular to that underneath it then
highlight the or select the one we
pulled out for position referencing and
control x and that'll get rid of that
move this guy up a little bit and now we
know it'll grow right under that dynamic
text field right where it should be in
the middle okay so now that it's set up
we have instance name their instance
name on that we're good to go so now
we'll show you the ActionScript code to
make this all possible and keyframe to
this is the one that corresponds to
where all of our content is here's the
code for that it's a simple stop action
now show you that one more time ok now
the keyframe one where all the dynamics
is happening that drive this text field
and this movie clip is this and if you
have any you can pause it right now and
type all this into your actions panel
and by the way you get into your actions
panel by pressing f9 and that opens your
action script panel and press f9 again
to close it but you would pause it right
now type all this into your key frame
one on the actions layer and if you have
any questions about what this code is
doing or you can't see it fully you can
just go ahead and join our forum post up
a question there or watch the video like
I said on the on the main site back at
develop PHP calm and you'll see it real
clear and big okay that wraps everything
up when you save this file and publish
it load it up to your web server you'll
see you have preloader or loading
indication functionality for your site
visitors ok we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
