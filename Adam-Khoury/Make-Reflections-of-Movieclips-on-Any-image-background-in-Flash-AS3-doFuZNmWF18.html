we're going to be making in this
tutorial file it's a gradient reflection
using caches bitmap in flash and you can
do gradient reflections of in movie clip
on image patterns this flash
actionscript 3 tutorial I'll be showing
you how to render out cool reflections
using caches bitmap you render out cool
reflections on top of an image pattern
so here i'm in fireworks here and
there's my image pattern right there i'm
going to control c select it and press
ctrl c back a flash and make sure i'm on
my background layer here what i have in
flash are for backgrounds or for
background sorry about that four layers
and on the layers there's actually
there's nothing on the layers right now
I just named them actionscript-3 this
one's mass clip this one's my images and
this one's background and make sure I
have background selected and press ctrl
V and import that as a movie clip okay
we'll get that on 0 now we're at zero
zero so that should take up the whole
background the whole stage now let's put
in my image let's go back into fireworks
grab an image control C
and so you know that's a form where are
we here we are in fashion now the my
image layer make the show that's
selected and press ctrl V and that will
also come in as a movie clip and you set
it on the stage wherever you want it I'm
just going to put it right in the middle
because it's the only thing I'm going to
demonstrate with okay so now we have
that let's give that an instance name of
actually that's not even the one we have
the instance name let's just press ctrl
c ctrl shift v so i highlighted that
movie clip i just brought in i press
ctrl c and ctrl shift v to paste in
place now while it's still selected i'll
go to modify transform flip vertical so
now its flipped vertical so we're going
to make a reflection on our pattern back
there
and we're going to be using a gradient a
movie clip a gradient rectangle movie
clip and we'll make that right now and
this one will give an instance name of
this is important to instance name that
one my image so will give an instance
name of my image and now on top of that
the mass clip we're going to draw out a
rectangle rectangle primitive hope is
avg sorry about that no finish hey hey
I'm not even going to edit that out okay
here we go let's make a rectangle now we
have a rectangle let's get a the edge
making sure we have no edge and or no
border okay thank you my virus
definitions are now updated everybody
knows okay where was I ok now I'm going
to make sure this has a gradient fill
the gradient fill make sure the gradient
is set the correct way so we'll go to
gradient transform and now we'll grab
the little circle there and transform
the gradient around bring it down to
where it fits in there nice and snug and
I will go over here and now we go into
the color palette I don't know where
your color palette menu is located but
you got to bring up your color palette
you select that and you bring up your
color palette and in the color palette
you can set one edge to alpha I'm going
to set the black edge outflow 20 see you
there now right click that symbol on
stage the rectangle we just made it
gradient and convert it to a symbol make
it a movie clip and call it a mask and
then press ok and now give it an
instance name of mask underscore MC or
mask whatever you want masts going to
score MC and now we're going to type in
the code to make it all work the way we
want it to so when I type in this code
it should make this into a gradient mask
reflect reflection of this image right
here and you can also do all of this
dynamically through code but this is
just a good manual method of doing it
and I'll show you right now okay you
type in my image dot cash as it map
equals true so it catches bitmap on the
my image and we're also going to do it
on the mask underscore MC and we already
have it so we can just copy and paste it
here and then one more line to dash to
actually set the mask so you say my
image dot mask equals mask underscore
emcee and that's it let's see if it
works just publish out there it is
I have my gradient set the wrong way so
let me reset that gradient let's see
let's go inside modify transform flip
vertical and now public that's the
effect i was going for and you can set
any kind of alpha you want there so
watch this if i go in here and i set the
Alpha to go back to my color palette and
I make the clear more dominant you can
also even make this a little opaque the
one that was fully colored a gradient
edge that was fully colored you can make
that sort of bring that alpha down a
little bit too and see different effects
you see what I'm saying so it makes nice
reflections you can set them anywhere
you need on top of image patterns it's
easy to make reflections on a on a flat
color but when you have something like
an image pattern you're going to have to
do something like this okay so we'll see
you next lesson and maybe we'll expand
the upon this too to make things a
little more dynamic and not so manual
okay bye-bye him
