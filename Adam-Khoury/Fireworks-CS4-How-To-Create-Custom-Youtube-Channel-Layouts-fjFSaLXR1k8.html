to show you some more stuff just kidding
ok in this fireworks cs4 tutorial
brought to you by flash building will be
showing you how to create some custom
layouts or I custom layout for your
YouTube channel and this is one
gentleman who requested us to show that
and I've had it requested about 20 times
so it's high time that I showed this one
and his channel is set up real nice for
doing this because you can see how the
you tube header has its predefined space
and color shown to us really nice as a
good contrast there and then his tables
also have a good contrast on the black
there so it'll be easy for us to map it
out and what we're going to do is try to
sync the layout right into where the
tables are on the page and the header is
and have everything kind of sync up nice
so it looks like a nice custom website
but it's a be YouTube integrated you
know alright let's get into fireworks
here enough talk let's do this ok so
we'll go to fireworks and let's go ahead
and open a new document and let's make
it the width that we want I say a nice
safe with is 1600 not sixteen thousand
sixteen hundred and a good height would
be I don't know 1200
that's okay now if you're going to have
nothing but one giant photo back there
that size might not work for you because
of the the restraints or the limits on
size of the file it could be that you
upload as background okay let's go ahead
and get started here okay so the first
thing we want to do is go to our page
and press print screen on our keyboard
that's the key right above insert it's
right next to F lock and scroll lock
print screen and then minimize that
press ctrl-v and fireworks and it will
paste it right in now we want to dissect
that the layout right out of the out of
there so we'll go to you can use your
mouse wheel and ctrl to zoom in and out
on your scene there and you might also
want to go to view tooltips make sure
you're showing tooltips that way when
you use any of these tools here you'll
see tips okay so an example of that is
if I pickett if I grab the rectangle
tool see those little numbers that are
next to my mouse there my pointer that's
tooltips if I didn't have that on view
tooltips is off you'll see it doesn't
show me the sizes of anything or the
location or the tool tip for that
certain tool the shape tool so let's go
to tool tips because I like to see those
and now we're going to go and make sure
we have the image highlighted and grab
the marquee tool
and zoom in to where we can see it about
a hundred percent if you need it smaller
you don't have to zoom in all the way
but we're going to dissect this out by
going right above the browser and then
around the layout to where it's about
even on both sides of the you tube
header it looks about even maybe a
little wider 986 that should be good and
try to make sure your rectangle is
centered there and press ctrl C and then
I usually hit the text tool to get out
of the marquee and then hit the pointer
again press ctrl-v and there's our
little cutout now we can get rid of this
thing back there control X on the big
image that we use print screen for now
we can take this one and move it around
and you'll see if we zoom out fireworks
shows us when we're dead center see that
when you're dead center that line shows
up fireworks cs4 does that if you're in
cs3 you might not see that but fireworks
cs4 is it's a much better tool than cs3
I think so now what I'm going to do is
since that's centered I'm going to zoom
in a little i'm going to make sure where
the browser ends there on top is just
out of view so i'm going to tap my up
key arrow up key until the browser is
just out of view the exact pixel and
then move back out zoom back out by
pressing ctrl and zoom with the wheel
mouse wheel and now we can bring the
opacity down on this a little maybe to
about fifty percent
and then lock that layer that that guy's
on right there okay now the reason I
chose 1600 as the width is because my
monitor is 1400 wide so I and I assume
that there's a little bit wider out
there it's probably a lot wider than
1600 but it's probably not many people
viewing the web at that aspect ratio so
probably won't have to worry about
having it too much wider than 1600 or
1400 for that matter maybe 1450 but if
you were just going to have graphics
right around your layout and not too far
off into these sides or on the outsides
then you wouldn't even have to have it
16 wide it could be maybe right here to
here maybe twelve hundred or a thousand
change you know I just wanted to note
that or make a little point about that
so you guys don't think that it has to
be 1600 wide it could be a thousand wide
if you wanted just so it lay around your
tables it okay
so let's make sure this guy is locked
it's a little opaque and that's what we
want so now let's go to a tool the
rectangle tool let's drag it out right
around our boxes there so on the youtube
channel you can see that the layout of
the boxes so let's just go ahead and
drag this down so about right there
should be good so you get that right
right about there
and now we can send that to the back by
going up top here and send backward or
the hot key is I think it's control
shift down arrow key yeah control shift
down arrow key and control shift up
brings things forward okay so now we
have a little layout around our our
boxes there are tables that are the
youtube channel and now we can also
define where the header is so if we go
up grab a another rectangle let's just
make it the whole width of the 1600 and
then we're going to match it up to right
where the you tube header is and I'll
show you why I did that let's move that
out the way let's change the canvas
color to a neutral gray let's bring that
back up top you'll see that the you tube
header
is always white and you can't fight that
you cannot fight that you have to work
with it so you bring that up top right
to where it matches up there you see
that you can just see the header peeking
out when I do that make sure you can't
see it peeking out and then make that
white you could do something like that
and then send that to the back
there we go
and so now you'll when you lay your
background in you upload your background
you won't see the YouTube default little
curve in a Tedder and everything it'll
be more integrated into your channel
okay now we just need one more little
thing so we make sure we don't mess up
art our layout and the information that
YouTube has bring out a bar for your
links up top your videos favorites
subscriptions you want to make sure
those links are are viewable so people
will hopefully click on them to check
all your stuff out and then yep you just
add this one or send that one to the
back as well ctrl shift down okay so
that's pretty much all we need to keep
our YouTube data layout intact so we can
get rid of this thing now let's unlock
that layer and say bye-bye to our little
guide cross control x there it is now
what you have is now you can take this
rectangle
oops make it a little bigger come on
by hitting the transform tool
ok
so that's the start of it and that's how
you can set up a sort of template for
how your your layout would be would need
to just show the data so you can take
this thing and let's put a little
roundness on it there we go
let's bring it down just a little bit
okay and now we can also put roundness
on these edges like I have on my channel
or not so let's see if we make the
channel let's make the background the
background black because that's how is
this setup black and he has blue for the
tables blue and black
ok so in fireworks you can pretty much
now do whatever you want you can go in
here put a little bar make it white the
way your links show through real nice
and i'm not going to show you you know
go that far in this tutorial on how to
make GUI graphics and make everything
look cool that'll be in other tutorials
but i just wanted to show you how you
can get your layout set up to where you
know you can pretty much do anything you
want here now you can take a giant
rectangle and you just want to make sure
that the size of your output file is not
going to be too large to where YouTube
won't accept it you know what I mean
let's get this guy down a little here
and so you have some kind of large
rectangle you can put any kind of
patterns you want on it
send it to back
and I work with the white the default
white background at YouTube which I feel
makes for a more integrated look and
feel with their header but you can
choose to do what I did there and make a
nice white bar that covers the top or
whatever you want so now in this let's
go to change the color to black and you
put anything you want put a hatch design
on it gradients so you wanted a gradient
coming from the top gradient linear
there you go
and that's how you would set up a custom
YouTube layout you put a cool bar up top
there to separate the the header from
your design make sure it comes down and
not up because you really can't work any
for any further up because that's where
their header is but you can off to the
sides and it's I should say something
about that let's see if I can get this
thing we don't want it so high maybe
four actually now the way it looked
before it was cool see so you can really
separate the design and really make it
really cool and like I said just a
second ago YouTube's header doesn't go
up this foot or off to the side this far
so you can have little icons and stuff
up here off to the side because the
youtube header would be right here and
that's how it works okay we'll see you
guys next lesson and I hope that was
helpful and i'll be doing some more
tutorials and fireworks i'm showing how
to make some cool graphics and and other
cool things but for this one i just
wanted to show you how to set up the
layout to work with the tables and the
header and these links up top here you
want to make sure i see a lot of people
that you can't see their links up top
there when they put their custom designs
in and that's not koo alright see you
guys next listen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
