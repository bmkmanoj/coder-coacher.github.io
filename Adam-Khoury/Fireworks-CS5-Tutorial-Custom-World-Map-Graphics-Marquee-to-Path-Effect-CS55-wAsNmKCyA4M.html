adult fireworks tutorial I found myself
in need of rendering a more digital look
to our world map for an application and
building and this is the result you see
here so if anyone is interested in
seeing how simple it was to render this
way juice up your fireworks graphics
editor and come along can follow the
workflow overall okay first thing is
open an image you have of a world map
which can be acquired through photo
exchange websites or clipart exchange
websites or whatever you can just look
for world maps or continents okay let me
get my properties bar up here so you can
see what's going on and as everybody
knows you can highlight an image or you
can just grab your magic wand and click
some kind of shape that has a different
outline than everything else around it
and press ctrl-c and ctrl-v and what
you'll have there is a cutout you can
also adjust the precision of the marquee
and everything like that when your magic
wand tool is at play but you can't work
with or treat this object like a raw
graphical path and that's really what
you want to have to apply the most
graphics editing to it so let's just
press control X we don't want that so
let's highlight the image again and now
what we're going to do is grab the magic
wand tool and I'm going to highlight all
of these and you can adjust your
tolerance and your edge to make it just
the right cut out that you need but what
I'm going to do is press shift and hold
as I select all of these and if there's
some small ones I can zoom in by
pressing ctrl and mouse wheeling so I
can get those small ones too you don't
want to forget anybody so just highlight
all of those and if you have to mess up
and lose all of your selections you can
just press ctrl Z and it will back up
one step for you okay now when it looks
like little tiny maggots are wriggling
along the edges of all of your
continents that you want selected then
you go up to select convert marquee to
path and this is the magic part here now
we can just take the image that we used
and let's turn our canvas first to black
so you can see what's going on and we
can take our image that we used as a
guide
and control X and now you can see we
have here let's see let's remove that
edge so you can see exactly what's going
on there that's a hundred percent so you
can see I have effectively punched
everything out and now the beauty of
this is then you can just you can put
any kind of gradient fill if you wanted
to have maybe a gradient fill and you
can give it ages easily so as you can
see I can easily give it edge and fill
color no problem and I can also take
that and give it filters and everything
I need to and you can also go down here
to the textures and apply any textures
that you want that's why it's handy to
use this method instead of using the
regular magic wand then control-c
control-v to copy the selection so in
this wood in this case what we've done
is we've just made the selections and
then we went to select and convert
marquees to paths while the selections
were still wriggling like little worms
there
okay now I'll show you how to make it
look exactly the way I made the other
one look so it has a nice digital effect
to it first thing is let's go to the
canvas size and let's make that a little
bit larger than it is now so we have
room to work maybe 900 by 550 okay
then I'll give me a little bit of
cushioning around it now we highlight it
and we can give it an edge any color we
want and what I did is I went to the
edge options or the stroke options and I
chose dashed and I chose dotted texture
was it was one of the dotted ones here
wherever those are let's do two little
dots I think that was it and I brought
it down way down something like that and
I had the color very dark which like I
said you could give it a gradient fill
if you want that's always an option
so once I had that I just gave it an
inner glow I went to filter globe inner
glow and I made it the bright green
made it spread really good put it down
to two and then down here a little bit
and then that's what I wound up with now
let's copy that select it copy it by
pressing ctrl C then ctrl V to paste the
new copy of itself on top of it so you
can see if I move it out of the way
there's two of them now I'll press ctrl
Z to put it back what I'm going to do is
just press up once and over to the right
once I'm going to highlight that one on
top control C control V do the same
process up once over once now I can
highlight all three of those press ctrl
G to group them and now it's all one
group that you can move around and then
I took a rectangle and I put it behind
everything well really when you place
the rectangle it's going to be in front
of everything and let's just make that
solid actually let's give that a
gradient radial then I can adjust that
radial gradient like so and then I'm
going to make the green a dark gray and
then this black and then I like that
press control shift down arrow key and
it'll put it to the back and there you
go and then finally what I did was I
highlighted my little group there I went
to filters and I drop shadow on it and I
just did the shadow to be facing this
way I made it about 4 made it more tight
and all the way visible like I said
using the select convert marquee to path
is a good way to take those magic wand
selections and instead of grabbing the
actual bitmap that's under the selection
you can make the selection into an
actual native shape and fireworks to
whatever you want with it
okay I hope you enjoyed this one we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
