lesson I take the first preloader
progress bar and text tutorial that I
made just a little bit further by
implementing inside of the ActionScript
i implement a complete listener for the
for the loader info and that complete
listener allows you to have a function
ready to give you a little more control
over what the file does when it reaches
100 percent so when it reaches 100
percent i have it set to it says current
frame plus one which is just a fancy way
to say go to and stop frame to and so
when its frame 2 is where your content
is and the content this is very
important is one solid movie clip it's
called my whole site and it doesn't need
an instance name I just instance named
it till you see what it was but it's my
whole site and once you double click on
that you go inside there'd be your your
regular timeline just like your regular
site would be structured out but put it
inside of a movie clip because it
preloads a whole lot better and it's
better for all around organization of
your file so on your main scene all you
have is your preloader code on frame one
and then on frame to all you have is the
the entire contents of your file so it
makes your main scenes timeline very
organized neat and then inside of the
whole the whole site movie clip here is
where you structure out your giant
timeline and layers and all that good
stuff so let's take a look at this thing
in the browser and here it is a develop
PHP and I'm going to refresh and we'll
hopefully see it working okay there it
is working and you'll see that the
dynamic text is reading I made it extra
extra bulky I put giant pictures inside
of the Fla file to make it
really sorry about that the video
started playing but I made it extra
extra bulky so that way we could see
some good progress here on the page and
you can see that it goes exactly to 100
and then enters the file and what I did
was I set up some graphics to where
there's kind of faded out boxes in the
back and then the load bar it's a mask
that shows the blue the bright blue
boxes so you can close that out but that
way you can see it working you know it
works and if you take this file and you
download it which you can download from
develop PHP calm and the flash tab under
the flash tutorials you'll find this
lesson and you can download the file and
then once you get inside of it you may
just want to use this file as your
beginning structure or maybe you don't
want because I have the library pretty
packed up but you can remove all the
items from the library that are in the
main site movie clip here and then start
with your own movie your own flash site
on the file content frame too and let's
see show you that graphic I was talking
about so there's the light gray bar and
right there if I make it to where you
can't see the mask you'll see the bright
blue bars boxes so there's the bright
blue boxes there's the dark gray boxes
and the mask is a magenta or pink symbol
there i made it bright pinks as you can
see it real good and that's what grows
over these blue bars to reveal and show
them so this one will help you guys if
you have a bulky full flash website
and you need to preload it give you you
some indication of what's happening tell
them something's loading into the
browser okay we'll see you guys next
