again with another video tutorial in
this adobe fireworks graphic design
lesson you can learn how to create
ribbon wrapped seals to give your seals
and added enhancement that not many
others would implement okay first thing
we'll do is create a new fireworks
document and here is where you can mess
around with the width and the height if
you need to be inches or centimeters or
pixels and you can also set your
resolution here if you need a high
resolution image for output for a print
design you know what I mean so what I'm
going to do is just make one that's
maybe 600 high and 900 wide I'm going to
leave my resolution 72 because mine is
going to be output for the web optimized
jpg for the web okay okay okay I i got
my canvas size wrong supposed to be 900
wide x z just make it five hundred hi
doesn't matter what size i make mine
because i'm just going to make my seal
really big and then I shrink it down
when I want I'll I'll flatten it I'll go
to modify flatten selection and then
I'll shrink it down to the size it needs
to be on the web page but I'm going to
make it really big okay first let's draw
a star or you can use an ellipse if you
just want a circle really whatever shape
you want I'm going to draw a star for
mine I'm going to hold shift as I draw
so it stays uniform and then I'm going
to mess with the points I'm going to
grab this little dot right here so I can
mess with the points add more subtract
them i'm going to put maybe that mini
and then i'm going to drag this up to
about right there and that looks good to
me i'm going to move this around i'll
see the center line so i'll have it
centered in my page there or in the
canvas and if you go into layers you can
see there's that auto star shape or star
auto shape now what i'm going to do is
grab an ellipse and i'm going to draw an
ellipse inside when a hold shift while I
draw that and let's see how the size of
this is this is a 430 let's make it for
30 by 4 30 for the star so the circle
can be an even number I'll pull that
down 388 388 and if you don't have those
tooltips I'm going to make it even
smaller 370 you don't have those
tooltips showing you the size as you're
dragging you can go to view make sure
tool tips is selected and then you'll
see little sizes like you see online
their 360 360 2 i'm saying now we can
take that and just put a dead center
right there and we can make it whatever
color we want i'm going to make my
ingredient linear and my colors are
going to be instead of white i'm going
to put this yellow then i'll put this
orange on the bottom actually i'll make
this yellow a little more orange by
mixing it there and then i'll make this
orange on the bottom a little bit darker
not much actually i'm going to make it a
little more yellow on top like I started
with so indecisive okay all right that
looks good it's got a little gradient ok
now I'm going to grab the text tool and
I'm going to type in F and lowercase W
capital F lowercase W can see the text
i'm using or the font rather is adobe
fan hide estd let's make this a little
bigger 114 in writing just good very
good and we'll put it in the dead center
we're not the dead center but will
Center it on top of this little circle
now I'm going to take a nail lips and
I'm going to draw that right into this
other ellipse and I'm gonna make it
shaped a little different like about
like that that's good okay okay okay and
I'm gonna make the gradient on that
linear and let's say white to white and
on the white on the bottom we're going
to make the opacity a little less and
pair your call now I can add some
effects to this star I can go to filter
and I can go to inner glow and I can
give it inner glow of black and i'll
just change the color of it so it's not
so dark actually let me give a i'll give
that star a gradient of satin i'll
change the satin from white to
like a dark gray and then on this side
black that looks very good okay so I'll
go back to my inner glow filter bring
that down to two and that down to two
actually believe that at three bring
that all the way up leave it down ok now
we'll bring this down a little bit so we
see the whole thing there ok now we're
ready to put our ribbon on our seal and
the ribbon is going to go across it and
it's going to say certified on the
ribbon ok now let's grab the pen tool
and you're going to have to just draw a
ribbon in so i'll start may be right
around here i'll click down and i'll
hold a little i'll drag up just a little
bit then i'll let go you can see i have
it still holding on there I'll go right
about here twist it a little bit not
twist it but bend it a little bit and
then continue this way you see what I
did now when i get to about here on the
other side it looks about even and you
can even hold shift see how it snaps
when i hold shift down it snaps too and
even coordinate on the other side I'll
hold down i'll click down now and i'll
make the ark i want both that ribbon you
see right about jail and then i'll click
down here and then i'll drag a little
bit just to make a little rounded edge
there then come down to about right here
and i'll do the same thing make a little
edge by holding and dragging a little
and then i'll hold ship come around to
the other side and looks like right
about there will hold down and then you
want to match the arc that's on top then
you just click down here make a little
curve and then meet this line right
there so what I'll do is give this a
fill of black and since this one side
looks better what I'm going to do is I'm
going to draw in a rectangle right now
I'm going to chop that thing in half
I'll hold both of them see how I have my
rectangle on top of this shape I'm going
to select both of them by holding shift
the way they both select it i'm going to
go to modify combined paths and punch
i'm going to grab this one ctrl-c ctrl-v
go up here to my flip horizontal tool or
you can go to transform modify transform
flip horizontal and then I'm going to
put it in place to where it matches up
right about there I'm going to take the
edge off the white edge of both of those
and make sure it's in place right I'm
going to highlight both modify combined
pads and union alright that looks good
enough now you can deselect everything
grab your pen tool again and start may
be right about here we're going to draw
a line from here so right about there
and then we're going to come down here
click and hold down and we're going to
bend in if you see mine you can't see my
line because my line is actually white
but I can still see my shape there so
I'm going to click down here to make a
tight curve or a tight corner rather and
then I'm going to go right about here
click and hold and curve that line a
little bit then I can click here here
and then there whatever I want because
i'm going to send that to the back
anyway so you see this one we're going
to give this a gradient of linear and
we'll just switch that will make this
black I'm gonna make this one a little
lighter so where it's lighter on the
bottom ok now let's just send that to
back control shift down arrow key so now
you see that sent to the back now let's
take that control see actually this
means that grading it down just a little
bit right about there ctrl-c ctrl-v what
that does is copy and paste another
copyright in place but don't move it you
can just flip it perfectly you can see
where your y coordinate is 328 so you
can just take and put it on the other
side make sure you're still at 328 and
move it in
so where that dot matches up here with
this one on this edge see that dot
matches that edge of the ribbon this dot
here matches that edge so you'll know
you'll be perfectly in line now what
we'll do is put a gradient in place make
it look really rounded on the edge of
the ribbons here so where it looks like
it's really wrapping around actually I'm
going to make this a little bit smaller
a little less wide just a little bit
wider than I want it to be that looks
great I'm going to zoom in a little bit
by holding ctrl and then Mouse wheeling
so I'll zoom in just a little bit and on
top of this ribbon shape I'll grab my
pen tool I'm going to draw in a shape
that kind of matches that but I'm just
going to make it square it off it
doesn't have to be perfect I'll go right
about here to there then down to here
then write about to there especially
when I shrink this it's not going to be
very noticeable so everything's really
i'm making it i'm drawing it really big
right now but when I shrink things you
won't be so noticeable that there's a
little square there but what I'm going
to do to that little squares I'm going
to go to the gradient i'm going to add
bars to it and then i'm going to adjust
that gradient to where that line you see
how that borrowed line is the direction
it should be going this way instead of
straight up and down now what I'll do is
make sure this one's black on the edge
which it is we can bring that in just a
little bit to actually right about there
and that looks pretty good so now let's
go back out to a hundred percent let's
move that into place where it looks like
it should be and then let's bring the
opacity down to about 32 on it now you
see what that did let's bring it down a
little even more that makes it look like
there is a sort of like a fold there in
the ribbon so if i take that ctrl-c
ctrl-v flip horizontally it's at 273
i'll move it over to this side 273 y
position and now it looks like both
edges kind of have like a little bit of
fold to them now I just need to put the
word certified right inside
space here so to get the word certified
curved I'll just grab the pen tool I'll
start right about here and i'll go right
across to write about there and I'm
holding shift to keep it nice and
straight and then right about here I'm
going to click down and hold and I'm
going to bend up until I match the curve
of that ribbon and then I can just hit
the pointer tool now i'll hit the text
tool and I'm going to type in certified
i'm going to make sure that's white and
bring it down in size and i'm going to
stretch out the word a little bit space
the letters a little better that looks
good to me make the size a little bit
bigger and now i can just attach that to
that so i'll select this line that i
made the curved line and the text with
them both select it i'll go up to text
attached to path and then i can just
grab it and move it down i'm using my
arrow keys to move it down with it
selected and we can even grab this
little spear or that ellipse and give it
an edge if you want black or you can
remove the edge and just give it a
filter effect of maybe glow or something
like that make glow black zero down to
four one hundred percent oh that looks
nice okay so there you have it that's
how you can create seals that have
ribbons wrapped around them or really
you can create anything you want with
ribbons wrapped around it just anywhere
you want to have a fold or somewhere
where it's coming up you just put a bar
gradient like that now if I take this
whole thing control C and I go and I
make a new file you know you would want
to save the raw one that you're working
on back over here save that as an
editable P&amp;amp;G so you can go to file save
as and just save that as a fireworks PNG
file so you'll always have it and be
able to edit it and junk like that and
the new one you can just flatten you go
to highlight everything go
modify flattened selection and then you
can make it the size you need save for a
web page maybe like that who knows
that's a hundred percent and that looks
pretty dang groovy and people can still
see your folds in your your little
ribbon and your effects on your little
lips there and everything now what you
would do on that is just fit canvas and
you go to file export wizard and here is
where you can select an export format
I'm going to select the web takes it and
then I'm I can choose any format that I
want if I had a high resolution file
that was set for print design I would go
and you know render out his tip 24 if I
wanted it printed or even tip 32 for a
higher quality P&amp;amp;G 32 with no background
you can have this have no white
background have it be a clear opaque
background with P&amp;amp;G 32 if you want it
and then you just press export you name
the file whatever you want and that's
how you export it but I'm going to use a
JPEG and I can have the quality at 80
that's fine look how small that file is
six kilobytes nice then I just export to
wherever I want call it whatever I want
jpg and that's how you do it and if you
want no background or not you just go to
canvas here and set it to no background
and then you'd have no background on
that and that's it my friends we'll see
you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
