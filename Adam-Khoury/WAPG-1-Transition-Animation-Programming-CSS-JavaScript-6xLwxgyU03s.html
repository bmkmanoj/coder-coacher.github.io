guide in this first video we'll briefly
take a look at animation technologies
then we'll begin transition programming
because transitions are a great place to
ease beginners into the more advanced
material that we will cover later these
are all animation technologies that you
can apply to your projects without
referring or linking to a third-party
framework or library and in essence
these technologies are the backbone and
the core of all of the third-party
frameworks so once you get a good grasp
of working with these technologies
directly without layers upon layers of
abstraction and you really get to see
how things work and you start to
decrease your need for dependency on
third-party tools I'm going to be
exploring transition programming within
this first video so we'll get a quick
refresher on the CSS transition
properties and how they work and what
their values mean and we'll also explore
the JavaScript interfacing for
transition programming those of you
already fluent with CSS transition
syntax and all of the fundamental
concepts behind it you guys can skip
ahead but I'm going to have to give a
refresher on it just in case any
beginners are watching this is my IDE
window and this is my browser that I'm
testing in and I have an example that
HTML file with a style element and then
the development the div element has an
ID of box 1 and box 1 is given its CSS
properties here and initially its
background color is set to orange and I
use the hover and active pseudo
selectors here just to show that that's
pretty much the extent of user
interactive States that can be applied
to CSS so when I hover over it turns red
when I hover away it turns back to
orange so if you're used to working with
JavaScript the hover State kind of
simulates the mouse over and mouse out
when it comes to CSS changes then the
active State is when I click down and
interact with any of the elements now
what transitions are is a way to instead
of snapping from orange to red and then
red to blue
we can transition between the two
different states between the changes we
can animate a transition effect first
I'm going to set the long hand
transition properties then we'll show
you the short hand approach so in this
case I want to transition the property
of background color I want the
transition duration to be half a second
the transition timing function will be
linear and transition delay will be zero
seconds so let's see what that gives us
so when I hover my mouse we should see a
transition from orange to red instead of
a quick snapping from one color to the
other instead of an abrupt change we now
have a transition effect when I click
down the transitions to blue then back
and here are all the CSS properties that
can be animated these are the animatable
properties and I might have left one or
two out but this is the bulk of them and
we were just animating the background
color so a lot more cool things you can
do when you experiment with animating
all of these properties and I put a gold
star next to the transform property
because that property gives you the most
creative freedom and gives you the
coolest visual effects when you apply
animations and transitions to the
functions of the transform property so I
won't waste your time by adding simple
transition or animations to all of these
properties here but you should take the
time on your own to experiment with them
and throughout the rest of the guide
you'll see a lot of these properties
being animated in various examples and
demonstrations and whenever you have an
element you want it to have a transition
animation effect on more than one
property you can just put and you happen
to be using the longhand properties like
I'm using here you can just put a comma
and then the next property that you want
to effect such as width then go down to
the duration put a comma in there and
put the duration for that transition
we'll just put one second you can also
use milliseconds so if you have in your
when you're programming with JavaScript
if you have to use milliseconds you can
put 1,000 MS and that equals
one second and let's make that in ease
and the delay zero seconds now if I were
to make the delay if I didn't add that
second zero seconds after the first one
then both of these properties background
color and width and even if you had many
more would all have a delay of 0 seconds
but I can go ahead and put a delay on
that of 0.5 seconds and also if I was to
remove ease here then both the
background color and width would have a
linear timing function and I'm going to
explain the timing functions in depth in
just a moment okay now the width is set
up to animate or transition from one
state to the next over one second with
the ease timing function and a half a
second delay so here in my hover state I
would just put width maybe 300 pixels
and then when the user actually clicks
it will make the width 50 pixels now
let's refresh the browser hover you can
see there was a slight delay the color
background color change transition on
that there was no delay but there is a
delay in the width transition okay and
when I click down it goes to 50 now if
you want
to have many more properties for this
box one to have transition effects when
things change when its properties change
you can just list more here using commas
and then you do the same for the
duration timing function and delay okay
now we'll demonstrate how to get the
same results but using the shorthand
transition property so what we'll do is
just remove this and remove all of this
so all you do is put a space in between
each property for instance you're going
to specify the transition property then
you put a space and transition duration
will be 0.5 seconds space transition
timing function was linear and then
space the transition delay was 0 seconds
now I can just put a comma here and then
with or you can even take that down to
the next line you just put a comma here
and then you start with your width
settings and that one was a duration of
1 second so a thousand milliseconds or
you can just put one second that had an
ease timing function and also a one
second delay or I think a point five
second delay so now you're doing the
same thing you're animating the
background color giving it's specific
settings and you're animating the width
and giving it its own specific settings
and I could just add another comma here
go down another line and start with
another property and all the settings I
want for that it's very simple to set up
using the shorthand property it saves a
lot of lines of code too so let's make
sure we get the same effects mouse over
Mouse out then we click down and
everything's working just fine now we're
going to start programming transitions
with JavaScript so I'm going to remove
this active and hover state in CSS and
I'm going to remove the multiple
settings and I'm just going to
transition the width property I'm going
to put a little control on the screen or
in the code then I'm going to refresh
and then I'm going to change the width
using this control you see there that's
something you could never ever do with
CSS alone
because it's interactive now the
animation that means the user is
manipulating what happens in the
animation because the user is dictating
the change of the box width and that's
using the on change or change event
which is something that you cannot
access in CSS that's why we turn to
JavaScript and here's a little bit of
JavaScript code that I'm running inside
of that on change event box one dot
style dot width is equal to this dot
value + pixels so we're just accessing
the value of this input type number so
the setting is made up in the CSS and
then anytime the width is changed using
some kind of control or anytime in the
flow of your JavaScript that you want
you can change the width and we'll have
an animated transition effect because
it's set up here in the CSS now let's
remove it out of the CSS let's just take
these settings here control X and get
rid of the transition property
altogether refresh and then once we
change the width it's just going to
abruptly change to the new width because
we remove the transition property but
what if we go down here and we put in a
script element and we start defining
these transition properties through
JavaScript which will allow us to make
everything dynamic and interactive the
user or your program can even dictate
which properties have transition is
applied in a dynamic sense so let's
define a longhand properties and I'll
show you that first say box one dot
style dot transition property is equal
to width and remember these are the
longhand properties you can also use the
shorthand property in JavaScript so this
next one is going to be the duration and
that was I think one second and the next
one was timing function and that was
linear I know we had
ease for that which I think by default
the timing function is ease so if you
leave out the time
function setting it's going to ease by
default and the same with the transition
delay if you leave it out it will
default to zero seconds now you can see
we're camel casing when we're defining
these properties in JavaScript
remember in CSS they had hyphen between
them and there was no capitals but in
JavaScript you'll get a syntax error if
you have a hyphen there so that's why
they're camel cased in JavaScript now
even though the transition is not set in
the CSS we should still get a transition
effect because we have defined those
transition effects in our JavaScript
code now so let's refresh and see if we
have transition we sure do everything
works the same but now we're defining
things in our JavaScript code which
allows us to make all of these values
dynamic and interactive which is
something you can't do with CSS if I
wanted to do another property like
opacity I just put the comma same same
way we have the syntax and CSS is how
you would apply it to the values in your
JavaScript now to do that with the
shorthand approach you would just remove
all of that you can remove all of this
and then you set your properties here
remember those are space separated when
we're using the shorthand property so we
put width in space the transition
duration was 1 second transition timing
function was ease and the transition
delay with zero seconds make sure our
application still works the same sure
does now all of the transition
properties are very easy to understand
except the timing function that's the
only thing that's slightly complex the
delay is just the amount of seconds or
milliseconds that you want to put there
the duration is the same thing the
amount of seconds or milliseconds and
the transition property is simple to
understand you just put the property
that you want to have the transition
effect on there and the timing function
is the only thing that might give people
some confusion so we're going to go over
that real quick
the values that you can provide for your
transition timing functions are made up
of keywords and functions what the
keywords do is they're equivalent to
these two functions the steps function
and cubic Bezier and if you're from
France or another European country you
might pronounce that is cubic busy a now
when you use the ease linear ease-in
ease-out ease in out key words you're
basically calling the cubic Bezier
function with these specific values and
when you use step start step end you're
calling the steps function and providing
it these specific parameters and I'm
going to demonstrate the steps function
to you in the code in just a moment now
in order to better understand cubic
Bezier I'm going to take you to
Wikipedia we're going to type in Bezier
curve then click that result then once
we get to the Bezier curve information
we're going to scroll down to cubic
Bezier curves and click that and that
will snap us to that part of the page
that discusses cubic Bezier curves and
that will give you a breakdown of what
all of the four parameters or points
that you can specify within that
function now when we put the steps
function into place it's going to happen
is it's going to stagger the transition
to make abrupt steps within the
transition effect so if I put four steps
here and then I refresh when I change
this to a higher width you see it takes
four steps to reach that new width and
then if I change it back to a lower
width it takes four steps you see how
that works this has to be a positive
number it takes four steps in the
animation if I change that to ten you'll
see that it takes ten steps if I put
that
a very high number like 100 it will
result in like a smooth transition so
that's how the steps function works so
you can specify two parameters in the
steps function second parameter is
either start or end depending on where
you want the step to occur at the
beginning or end so that gives you a
little bit more of an explanation about
what all of these timing functions mean
the ease in out linear etc and when
you're programming transitions you can
tap into the JavaScript transition
events the only one that's universally
supported in all browsers at the moment
I think is transition and transition run
start and cancel don't have very good
support in all the browser's yet but
transition End seems to work in all of
them or most of them and these are the
attributes the data that we can access
when those events fire so let's go back
into our code here in the script portion
will type in box one dot add event
listener the type will be transition end
and then we'll write a function here to
handle it then we'll close off the add
event listener and bring this down a
couple of lines and then we can just put
any code that we want upon transition
end and just for the quick little demo
I'll make an alert pop-up and just type
in transition ended then refresh the
application and let's go ahead and make
a change and then a pop up an alert pops
up and says transition ended when the
transition ends and you can do anything
you want here for instance you can say
window dot location equal to any URL
that you want let's see if it can go to
another page so basically I'm telling
the script of the program to navigate to
Adam Cory comm when that transition ends
so let's see if that works
and there it went so you see you can do
anything you want upon transition end
within your program and it depends on
how good you are with JavaScript or how
good you are with JavaScript will
determine your creativity and what you
can do when transitions end we could
even take box one and let's just take
this code right here pop it in right
there
and bring it back to its original 100
pixels actually I can just put that in
the string there and remove the plus
sign and the number so when the
transition ends the box will go back to
its original width okay boring boring
boring boring so just keep in mind that
you can do anything you want there and
we can also access all of the properties
of the event so we can type in event in
between the parentheses for the function
and then we have access to the event
properties for instance we can get the
event property name and when the
transition ends see it says width that
gives us the property name we put that
back on one second event dot a lapse
time it gives us the amount of time that
the transition took and you can also
target the element so you can put target
and then once you have the element
object reference there you can target
its attributes such as ID so the element
was box one we can get its ID value box
one so within the event we can know
which element is actually ending one of
its transitions because you might add
this event listener to a whole group of
elements and here are those attributes
the data that you can access within the
events bubbles cancelable elapsed time
property name pseudo-element target and
type okay that takes care of all of the
syntax fundamentals about working with
transitions in CSS and JavaScript and
I'd recommend that you experiment with
animating all of the animatable
properties in CSS that way you can see
what kind of effects that those things
will give you in video number two we're
going to step into keyframe animation
programming and things will get more and
more advanced as we move along</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
