produced the audio programming training
series of videos a bunch of people have
asked us to short a program independent
audio tracks on the page each with their
own independent play button but that are
all tied together that way multiple
tracks can't be playing at the same time
before we start the tutorial let's take
a look at the finished product so that
you can evaluate whether or not you'll
ever need the same functionality for
clients that you may be working for and
the client of mine that is a musician
requested this application so it is a
real-world thing that someone may hire
you to program okay let's show you how
it works if I hit this track play button
that track starts playing and I can
pause it by unpause it it picks up at
the point where we paused it now if I
hit if that one's playing and I hit the
next one that one turns back to a play
button it stops and then this one starts
and then it gets the pause symbol and
then I can pause that one as well if I
go back to this one so you see how
they're all tied together that's what
we're building right now in this
tutorial so sit back relax and strap on
your helmet we're going to begin with
the bare bones of an html5 web document
mine is named example dot HTML and the
body element the first thing we're going
to do is add a div with an ID of track
box this track box is going to contain
all of the individual tracks so we're
going to dynamically put track bars for
each track into this track box and we'll
be doing that through JavaScript right
here in the script element and you can
also externalize this application into
its own J's file if you want to get it
out of your HTML document and when we
put the style in place you can also
externalize your style into a dot CSS
file if you want to get that out of the
document as well okay now we're going to
apply all of the CSS for the application
and as we're working in the script I'm
going to explain how this CSS applies to
the dynamic things that we're doing in
the script and you should have a basic
on
standing of CSS if you're programming
JavaScript applications for web
documents the first thing I'm going to
do in the script is apply a little
function that I'm just going to put in
place so I never have to call document
dot get element by ID in my script all
I'll have to call is this underscore and
it will save it will serve the same
purpose it's just so we don't have to
keep writing document dot get element by
ID over and over again which our script
isn't going to need it that much but if
it's going to do it more than once or
twice for three times then it's good to
just package it up into a little
function the next thing we're going to
do in the script is put the window at
event listener for the load event and
we're going to fire off a function
called audio app so when the document is
ready a function called audio app is
going to execute let's just grab the
name of that function let me type in
function audio app open closed
parenthesis opening curly brace and
closing curly brace now within the audio
app function the first thing we're going
to is assign some variables and I'll
explain these variables to you now var
audio is the audio object and all we
need is one audio object and that will
power the whole app then we're going to
specify the audio folder this is the
folder that you have your your audio
tracks in your mp3s or whatever type of
audio that you want to play then the
next variable is called audio extension
and that for my case is mp3 because all
of my audio files are mp3 files and the
audio index variable is really in place
so we can just put one two three four or
five six down down the page just for
display purposes that way each one could
be numbered is playing this is a
variable that's going to be keeping
track of whether or not the audio object
is playing or is paused or whatever so
if it's playing this is going to be
changed to true and if it's not playing
it's going to remain false and this
variable I don't even think I'm using
that one I think I put it there but I
never used it so let's just take that
away then the next variable is playing
track and that one is going to be
the variable that keeps track of which
one of these tracks are playing down
here and then the track box is obviously
this div down here in the page with an
ID of track box now the bar tracks
that's a JSON object and we have a very
extensive JSON video training series
that's free that you guys can go and
watch right now and you'll understand
every little aspect of JSON object
syntax and how to work with these
objects so I'll explain it very quickly
though the VAR Trax is a JSON object
that contains 3 tracks in my case now
you could put fifty or a hundred in
there if you want and just make sure the
last one does not have a comma all of
the ones before the last one you see how
they have a comma so you can go ahead
and stack as many as you want in here
and that's all the variables that we'll
need initially so the first track in the
JSON object has an array so it's data is
an array the second one is also an array
and the third one is also an array so
you're working with arrays inside of a
JSON object and these identifiers is
really don't mean squat
you can name those or whatever you want
I just named them track 1 2 3 so it made
sense to you but you can name that poo
poo peepee and khakha it doesn't matter
the application will still work the same
what is important is are these arrays so
what I have here is the title and that
was the actual visible title that the
user sees on the page this is the mp3
file name so you have the first element
in this array is the title that's going
to display on the page in the track bar
and then the next element in this array
is the mp3 file name the file name
that's sitting in the folder so in my
folder I have fast underscore lame mp3 I
have breathe mp3 and I have stranglehold
that mp3 within my audio folder the name
of the files this is just the title or
the words that the user is going to see
for that song ok so you now you should
have a pretty good grasp on this whole
tracks
object all right now directly under that
JSON object Trax we're going to put a
for loop that's going to loop over that
object so the logic reads for VAR track
in Trax so track is a variable we just
made that's going to represent each
individual track track one track two
track three as they pass through the
loop track variable represents the
individual tracks as they pass through
this loop this loop is going to run
three times because I only have three
tracks if you had 50 tracks your loop is
going to run 50 times and the first
thing we do is set up some variables one
is called TB and that's just short for
track bar the next one's called PB and
that's short for play button the next
variable is called TN and that short for
track name and you can see that the
track bar is going to be a div element
we're using the create element method to
dynamically or magically if you will
create a div and then we're going to
magically create a button and we're also
going to magically create another div so
you're going to have the track bar and
then inside of it we're going to add the
button and then the track name div so
now here is where the CSS comes into
play we're going to apply CSS classes to
these various new magical items that are
going to be rendered to the page so the
track bar is going to get a class name
of track bar and what does that mean
that means all of these CSS properties
are going to be applied to those divs
now the next one is the play buttons and
the play buttons we're going to give
them a class name of play button and
that's right up here so you have class
play button and they're going to get all
of these properties applied to them then
finally we have track name and the track
name div is going to have the track name
class applied to it and you can see
that's right here so all of these
properties will be applied to the track
name you could set the font styling and
all that stuff and the the margin space
for that container the color of the text
and specify the way it floats next to
the play button okay so that's applying
all the CSS to the
dynamically created elements so we
haven't added them to the document yet
but we've created them and they're ready
to go and we gave them class names now
we can affect the track name divs
innerhtml
to put the track name in place so we say
audio index that just puts a one two
three wherever it is in the list then we
put dot next to that and then we put the
tracks title the visible display title
which is this first element here or this
one or that one so you go into the
tracks object for the individual track
that's coming through the loop you
access its first element in the array
that gives you access to this now we're
going to give each play button an ID and
the ID is going to be equal to the mp3
file name so the first play button
that's going to be rendered through this
loop it's going to have an ID of fast
underscore lane the second play button
that comes through the loop is going to
have an ID of breathe and the third one
is going to have an idea of stranglehold
and you can see we're going into the
tracks object for the individual track
coming through the loop we're accessing
the second element in the array which
gives you this then through the play
button we're going to add an event
listener for the click event now when
anybody clicks any of those play buttons
this switch track function is going to
fire off so you'll need that in place so
you just go down under the for loop and
put function switch track opening curly
brace and closing curly brace you can
see in the switch track function we're
referencing the event that way we can
identify which play button is bringing
pressed so I'm only putting event there
because I want to be able to identify
which play button is being pressed
dynamically anywhere inside of this
function I can refer to event that
target and that gives me access to the
play button that's being pressed by the
user dynamically all right now right
above the function switch track we're
going to add something an event listener
to the audio object itself so right here
we're going to put that in place audio
dot add event list
for the ended event we're listening for
the ended event that means when any song
ends dysfunction the code within this
function these two lines are going to
execute so what we're saying in those
two lines anytime any of the audio files
end they come to their end we're going
to run this line which says the playing
track which keeps track of which track
is playing we're gonna make that style
that background equal to the play button
because while the song is playing it's
going to have a pause image that the
user sees so when the song ends of
course you want to make it turn back to
a play button and that's all this line
does then we say playing track is equal
to nothing because no tracks would be
playing at that point because the song
ended so you take the bar playing track
and you make it empty now in the switch
track function I'm going to be assigning
which is the playing track as the user
clicks play buttons and this one line
takes care of that we say playing track
is equal to event target ID so the ID
the play button that's being pressed is
going to be put into this playing track
variable now I'm gonna add some code
right above that and what it is is
condition statements and here's all the
code that I just pasted it in now I
didn't want to take the time to write
all of that out line by line because you
would all fall asleep and everybody
would lose interest so here's all the
if-else condition logic needed to power
the application every time the user
clicks switch track because there's some
considerations when a user clicks the
play buttons so if one song is playing
you have to switch to another to have
another song play and you also have to
make sure you're turning the pause
symbols back to play symbols and the new
song that is playing now you have to
change its play symbol to a pause symbol
so these if-else evaluations will take
care of that and I'm gonna explain every
line right now
very quickly actually before we discuss
these evaluations let's make sure it
works I'm gonna render in my favorite
browser
yep all right so what's happening in
this first grouping you'll see it says
if is playing so that means if any
tracks are currently playing this code
is going to execute else this code is
going to execute if no tracks are
playing if everything is paused or it
stopped then this code is going to
execute whenever somebody clicks one of
those play buttons if it is playing this
code is going to execute when they click
any of those play buttons so if
something's playing and the user clicks
any of the play buttons we have to run a
nested evaluation that says if the
playing track is not equal to event our
target ID that means if they're not
clicking a play button that's already
playing so if the person is clicking a
play button that's not already playing
we're gonna set the is playing variable
to true we're going to change the
current playing tracks image to a play
button because it won't be playing
anymore and then the new track that's
being assigned to play its play button
is going to be changed to a pause symbol
so this line changes the play symbol to
a pause symbol for the track that the
user wants to start playing this line
changes any pause symbol that was a
pause symbol back to a place imbel then
we just change the audio dot source to
the new file that the user is expressing
that they want to hear by clicking its
play button so we say audio folder which
you know what that is that's this
variable up here for your audio folder
so you say audio folder and you can
catenate onto that string the event
target ID and then you can concatenate
onto the end of that the audio extension
which is mp3 so basically it just goes
into your audio folder grabs the correct
file name
puts the correct extension on the end of
it then you just say audio dot play to
start it up now this else conditioned
this code in this else condition is for
when the user clicks a track that is
already playing if they click a track
that's already playing if they click its
paws symbol then we want to pause the
audio and then is playing variable gets
turned to false because it's now paused
and then we change that button back to a
play button so they can resume it again
ok so this is the last little bit of
logic to explain here now this else
condition comes into play if is playing
is not true see how we start the is
playing false so if is playing is equal
to false
none of this codes gonna run only this
codes gonna run so this is the code that
executes if nothing is playing and they
go to start up a track you just change
the is playing variable to true you
target the play button you make it style
that background equal to the pause
button because that track will now be
playing so you want to put the pause
button as a graphical interface for that
and then we can run in a similar
evaluation that we did up here
which says if the playing track is not
equal to the event target ID basically
the track that that play button is
connected to if the playing track is not
equal to that track then we're going to
change the audio source to the new track
but otherwise not so if the playing
track is equal to the play button that
the users the track that the play button
is connected to then this code won't run
the audio source is only going to need
to change if the user is clicking a
button that's not already playing and
then finally you say audio dot play and
that's if is playing is false now I hope
that wasn't too complex to wrap your
head around and there's really no easier
way that I could have explained it and
it could be written maybe in a more
logical way maybe you can take a look at
this applications
maybe I can just make this make more
sense in atoms a retard whatever I don't
care it works for me I like the way it
works it does the job so if you want to
critique my code you can go right ahead
I don't even care but it works really
nice you can use it if you want okay now
one last test
so picks up where it left off if we
happen to pause that song that's already
playing we hit a new song it just
changes to that song you can see our
graphical interfaces for the play and
pause symbols working perfectly okay so
we've explained every single line of
code in this application so there really
shouldn't be any places where you're
confused in the code and if you happen
to get confused with the code just ask a
question under the video here and we'll
all tackle your question together we'll
give you will get you an answer if you
go to my website develop PHP calm and
you click the menu the main menu and you
go to JavaScript videos you'll see that
we already have down in the list and
audio programming training series now in
here we show how to make different kinds
of playlists because you might not want
this kind of playlist that we just made
in this tutorial you might want a
different kind of playlist so you might
benefit from seeing a different kind of
playlist programming if you want so you
can go to audio playlist or a tutorial
now there was one more thing I'm
supposed to discuss with you
oh yeah the buffering when you put big
files online it could take time for
those files to start up when somebody
clicks play so for video and audio
there's ways you can listen for
buffering and there's certain properties
that you can use in your programming one
property is called the weighting so you
would have the audio dot weighting
property and if you happen to see that
it's weighting that means it's still
looking
it still doesn't have enough of the file
to start play on it yet so you can use
that
property of the audio object to program
in buffering mechanisms to where you can
have like a little circular little arrow
going around and round if it happens to
be not ready to play yet so I'm not
gonna program any of that for you but I
thought it would be nice for me to
mention it to you that there's different
properties and methods associated with
audio objects and video objects to where
you can listen for buffering all you
have to do is research in depth all of
the properties and methods associated
with the multimedia and multimedia is
audio and video because a lot of the
properties and methods for audio objects
are also the properties and methods that
use the same properties and methods are
used for the video object too so they're
kind of interchangeable the audio and
video object programming to a certain
degree okay hope you guys enjoyed this
tutorial and remember you can just pop
this into any page and dynamically it
will load all of these tracks right in
it will render all those tracks into
your little check box and this is all
the HTML that you have to manage the
rest is dynamic script and it doesn't
matter if you have two tracks or a
thousand tracks this little bit of code
right here this for loop will render
them all because right here you're
putting oh I didn't even explain these
lines the the track bar we're appending
child of play button to it so we're
putting the play button in the track bar
in this line then we're putting the
track name div into the track bar with
this line then we're putting all of the
track bars with their little play
buttons and track names appended into
the track box which is the little div
down here okay that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
