how to create the PHP and MySQL based
hit counter for our flash ActionScript 3
files maybe we have a full ActionScript
3 website we want to track different
individual sections on that website we
can do that using this lesson hello
everybody today we'll be learning how to
create a flash ActionScript 3 PHP and
MySQL hit counters for our individual
flash pages if we happen to have a full
flash website or an application that has
different sections that we want to track
ok so what we'll do is first let's read
the posts hey earlier that I saw this
tutorial and I tried it on my website I
want to know how to use the MySQL method
method for the hit counter and he helped
it be appreciated and he shows the link
for the old hit counter tutorial that I
made and in this tutorial I show how to
make a hit counter using a text file
database and PHP that way it holds the
count for how many pages or how many
views that page has and it'll increment
each time the page is accessed by a
browser and so what we'll do in this one
is show you how to have pretty much the
same method and I'm gonna use this same
file the same source while since most of
our source files are free from develop
PHP you can go to the flash tab and get
to both of them if you need to over here
at the in the main categories here
whenever they come up right there right
there in the flash ActionScript 3
tutorials you'll find both of these the
one that is the the text file database
database method and then this new one
will be here in the working with PHP and
MySQL the hit counter okay so what we'll
do is use the same files from this old
hit counter and just adapt it a little
bit to be able to work with PHP of MySQL
and I'll show you what I did to get that
to happen
and I'll have these files free available
at the develop PHP in case you want to
just snatch up the files okay so the
first thing I did is I went into the the
flash ActionScript 3 file and here's my
simulated home page here's the little
number of hits thing and if you need
insight into how this file was made the
whole video lesson is available for it
ok so what we'll do is go into the
ActionScript and I'll show you what I
changed all I changed was what you want
to do is put the path and the file name
to your hip parse file right here and
mine is not going to be active but this
is the method on how you make it mine on
page develop PHP the demo is not going
to be an active it's not going to be
actively counting hits but trust me this
works ok so what you do is change the
request code from what we had it before
to homepage and I did that just so if
you had an about me page or services
page portfolio page you can just send
those respective request codes to the
PHP parse file and it will update that
pages row in the database ok so all I
did was change that and you would put
the path and the filename for your PHP
parse file here and so that's all I
changed in the flash file that's it was
that one-line basically the request code
in the PHP file discussed this one
because here's where the magic happens
to make this functionality occur not so
much in the flash file ok so to make
this functionality occur for you you
have to understand a few things you have
to know how to create a MySQL database
on your server for your website and here
you can see in the minus QL course if
you click that at develop PHP you'll see
in the first section getting started
with MySQL mph
P a link that says creating a MySQL
database on your host server you'll want
to read that page to get the - trail
database created on your server and then
at step seven there's a page that shows
you once you get the database created
there's a script here I have that shows
you how to connect to your MySQL
database through an include vial so we
put all the database connection settings
connect to the database and to use this
connect to database file anytime you
need in your PHP scripting to
communicate with your MySQL database you
just run this little include line here
require connect to MySQL it makes life
easy so you don't have to have this
connection data in all of your PHP
scripts you can just throw this one line
in and all of the connection data is
then included and then you can run your
MySQL queries okay so now that we
understand that we all have to
understand how to create a table in our
database so let's go back to the MySQL
course and you'll create a table here
creating tables through script now you
can do this through PHP myadmin or you
can do this through a script and here I
show a method of how to create a table
easily through script and your table
would want to say won't be named let's
see I named it in this example page hits
is the table name so you would put
create table page hits instead of
members it would say page hits that
would be the table name and you have an
ID field you would have a page name
field say it's homepage or whether it be
the services page or portfolio page you
would have a field name page name you
see our script that's a field name page
name it's trying to connect to so you'll
have to have that in a database and each
page would have its own name that you
would assign it and then you put a field
called hit
count hit underscore count so you'll
have three fields ID page name and hit
count and that's it you wouldn't need
these other rows or these other fields
just three fields and so that's how you
get a database bill to connect to it and
create a table inside of it for storing
the data that we need okay so now that
we understand all that let's talk about
this little script here and there's
really not much to it I I'm gonna splice
in this little edit right quick yeah I
have no variable name set here for this
SQL query which is needed SQL equals the
MySQL query select that way when you run
the MySQL fetch array results set on
that you can just run the result set on
that variable see that variable sitting
right there
and if you didn't have that script it
wouldn't work so I just wanted to put
this little edit in so I can keep going
I just changed the parse file the hit
parse file from the original tutorial to
course to communicate to a minus QL
database this time instead of creating a
text file database or communicating to
the text file database to increment the
hit count and then return the value so
what we do in the first section here is
we include our connect script and I put
you don't have to put it in a folder if
you have your connect to MySQL script
sitting in the same directory as your
flash file then you wouldn't put a
folder name here but most people put
their connect scripts and things like
that in a folder so I just put scripts
is the folder name and inside of it is
to connect file so if I mean if you want
the connect file sitting in the same
directory as your flash file and
everything then it's no problem you just
don't put this folder Association just
the file name okay so on line six we say
if the post request equals homepage
which it is from our file in flash when
we want to check the home page hit then
we take the posted variable and we
to a local PHP variable for easier use
down in ours in our connection to our
MySQL database our query now we're going
to query the database twice the first
query is to update the hit count of that
page so you say update page hits set hit
count equals hit count plus one and
that's how you can easily increment a
number variable or a stored number in
your database use incremented by one
incremented by five whatever and then so
you hit count plus 1 where page name
equals page name and in this case it's
going to equal home page so as long as
you have a field in your database a row
with the name a page name of home page
then it will increment that page and
that's what you want then the next line
is select the hit count we're going to
access the value of what the new hit
count is and send it back to flash for
display select hit count from page hits
which is the table name so we're
selecting the field hit count from table
page hits where the field page name
equals home page limit 1 and I use limit
1 here because we only have one result
set coming from this query so we can
effectively limit it to 1 to keep things
efficient alright now here line 14 is
where we run the while loop on the MySQL
array that comes out of that query and
we just put the the row variable into a
local variable here so we get the hit
count that we selected from this query
put it in a local variable here and then
outside of the while loop we simply
print back to flash the PHP count bar is
now new num which is the new number we
access from the variable after we
incremented it and that's how the whole
system works and I think that is pretty
much it I'm gonna wrap up these source
files the PHP script the flash file so
you can see
how all of code communicates back and
forth to make all this happen and that
you have to have PHP enabled on your
server and a MySQL database really
simple one and this is not very hard it
should only take you about 20 minutes to
bang out a little project like this okay
we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
