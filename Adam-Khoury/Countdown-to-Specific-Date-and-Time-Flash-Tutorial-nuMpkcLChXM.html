actionscript 3 lesson i'll be
demonstrating how you can create your
own custom countdown time and date
countdown tutorial here and i have it
set to countdown to Christmas 2008 so
let me press f12 and publish out now in
the browser you'll see the seconds are
counting down and if that was to reach 0
then this minutes would turn into 56 and
this would continue and there's 51 days
17 hours 57 minutes and 40 seconds left
until Christmas 2008 and it says 51 days
and if you look in your calendar it
might look like it's 52 days but if you
add the hours in the minutes to it it
all comes to smack dab midnight the
morning of Christmas 2008 close this out
and inside the file or you can download
from develop PHP you go to develop PHP
click the flash tabs the flash tutorial
tab you'll see this one in the time and
date section of the ActionScript 3
tutorials and you take a look at the
code after you download it on frame 1 is
where we're assembling a lot of the time
mechanism and the countdown and on frame
too it's looping it says go to and play
by the way you press f9 to open your
actions panel to see these see the code
and says go to and play one that means
go to and play frame one so every time
it hits frame too it's going to go to
and play frame one so basically it's
just set to the loop really fast between
frame one and frame 2 and frame 3 it
says yay presence that this only occurs
I have a conditional set here frame 12
where if it ever
now is greater than or equal to
Christmas this file will snap to swf
will snap to frame 3 automatically and
it won't show the timer because it's
already christmas or past of 2008 so in
the code what's happening here is we're
creating a date object for christmas
tarp and i set the values in for
christmas and for some reason it indexes
the month one month before so if you
want December you put 11 if you want
November you put 10 I don't know why
that's how I had to do it 25 is the day
and this is the year and then you build
the date very object for now which is
today and the time which it is at this
very second and since this this file is
set to to loop in between frame 1 and
frame to that means every 12 frame at 12
frames per second that means it's always
going to be hitting this code and
changing these numbers changing the date
because the seconds will be changing
according to what time it is at that
very moment ok so then down in here oh
right here is a conditional that I made
to snap to frame 3 if it's if the now
time present time happens to be greater
to or equal to Christmas sorry greater
than or equal to Christmas then it snaps
the frame 3 and the countdown is not
showing any more because it's already
christmas or past it and then here we we
set up the the difference time between
Christmas and now and then we set up the
difference time
minutes seconds hours and the days
according to the seconds and it's
rendered in milliseconds whenever you
get this variable here this number
that's created in this variable right
here is in milliseconds and then we do
some conversions here to divide it down
and then we set the remain remainder of
the division bars here right here you
have to set those remainder so you don't
have a big giant number in there and
everything's rendered out correctly and
then string all the bars together into
one line and this is the line that
displays right here in this dynamic
checks filled with an instance name of
time string and then right here is where
I put the values of the Christmas date
object and the now date object into text
strings just for just for viewing sake
really not necessary you can take those
right out but this is the line you would
want to display and the values in that
line you can see right here hours
minutes seconds days right there and I
just string them all together into one
line that way it renders about just in
the one line just to make it easy for
the tutorial but you can get those in
two separate lines if you want if you
only want it to show the days four hours
or whatever you could separate those out
but here is where it displays now and
you can see this time is moving so
actually if you ever wanted to just
display the time now the time and date
now you could use that one line of code
there create the now object that now
data object right here
and then just render it out like I did
right here it's that easy those two
lines of code would do that okay so
that's pretty much it i was going to
make it counting down to 2012 december
two thousand twelve and which would have
been cool and you can easily make it do
that by going up into the date and
making this 2012 and then December
twelfth whatever that day is supposed to
be the end of the world all these idiots
believe here there it is that's how many
days are left till December 12 2012 or
whatever that day is that all the idiots
believe is the end of the world and you
just change this to say counting down to
the end of the world it'd be pretty cool
okay that is the end of this let me
change this code back I'll get this Fla
all set up and you guys can download it
free just like all the others okay have
a nice thanksgiving and a merry
christmas see you next lesson
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
