not have built-in methods for selecting
or removing array elements randomly we
will demonstrate how to extend the array
object to supply it with those types of
methods first open up your favorite code
editor and get yourself an example dot
HTML document ready to go we'll put in a
script element make sure we close it and
this is where we'll place our JavaScript
now the first thing we're gonna do is
pop in an array for my array has seven
elements within it seven items so
there's two scenarios we're gonna cover
in this lesson one scenario is going to
be how to select one of these elements
or items in the array randomly but not
affect the original array and then for
the second exercise we're going to
demonstrate how to select one of these
elements out of the array randomly and
affect the array we're going to pretty
much pluck it out of the array so that
it no longer exists in the original
array much like if you were to take one
card out of a deck and not return it and
hold it that means the deck will be
missing that one card so in both
scenarios what you want to do is create
another variable and call it our I for
short and that stands for random index
in the array and this is going to be
equal to math dot random method times
the length of your array so you can just
grab your array and put my array dot
length and we also have to round that
down so we're going to put math dot
floor method to run over that equation
that way it rounds it down now what that
does that gives you a random index from
within your array for instance my array
has seven elements within it that means
there's seven index positions and the
index start at zero in arrays so we have
zero one two three four five six giving
us seven index positions within that
array starts at zero and it goes through
six so basically what this are I
variable is giving you is one random
number in between that zero
and six and then you can use that random
index which say document dot right and
for testing purposes you can just write
the value so you take my array and in
between square brackets you just put our
I the random index position and you'll
get a random value from that array so if
we run this in our favorite browser
software we get a C and if we refresh
the page we get an either next time and
it's just randomly selecting one value
from the array now if we write the array
let's go ahead and write in a horizontal
rule for ourselves here the in between
double quotes we can just put an HR tag
and then under that we're going to write
the array to the page so we'll see that
our original my array has not been
affected after we got our random element
out of it so if we run that in our
favorite browser you can see
abcdefg is all still intact and no
elements were plucked out of the array
but we were still able to get a random
element he came out randomly so we're
selecting one random element each time
the application runs or each time those
lines of code run now let's say you want
to take a random element out of the
array so it no longer exists in the
array now in order to do that all we
have to do is add one more line and one
more variable in this variable I named
our s which was just stands for random
splice so you're just randomly splicing
an element out of the array and you do
that by running the splice method over
your array object and you feed it two
parameters the first parameter is the
index that you want to go into the array
and start selecting from and the second
parameter is how many elements you want
to select or splice out and in our case
we just want to splice one element out
starting at a random index position and
then down here where we're writing let's
just write the RS because that is the
random spliced element that we want now
let's run that in our favorite browser
and you can see the difference so now
look in our original array here you see
that it's missing the D
ABC efg you see the D is missing from
the array because it was plucked out let
me refresh that and now the F in this
instance has been plucked out so each
time you'll see the selected random
splice is pulled out of the array and
then in the first example we showed you
guys the original array was left intact
with no elements removed and this way
adding the splice method shows you how
to actually remove the element from the
array so it doesn't exist in the
original array any longer and then you
have access to it in this rs variable
now I wanted to run through those
examples first but it might benefit your
applications to add it to the prototype
of the array object that way you're
extending JavaScript's functionality
more at its core or you can choose to
just write a simple function that will
handle doing it if you want to put these
lines that we just demonstrated into
some kind of function that's reusable
but I'll show you how to put it into a
function that's reusable but it will
actually add it to the prototype of the
array object so let's type in array dot
prototype and then you put the name of
the method the new method that you're
adding to the array object and we'll
name this one R and splice because it's
a method that will randomly splice an
element out of an array
we'll make that equal to function open
close parentheses opening curly brace
and go down a couple of lines and put in
your closing curly brace now what you
want to do is take these lines this RI
and RS control X and get them out of
there put them up inside of your new ran
splice method now you want to change it
a little the random index variable needs
to be this so you change my array to
this because this identifier is going to
refer to my array because my array is
going to be the object instance that's
calling this method to run so you can
just put this to refer to my array
within this R and splice method and
instead of my array here you simply
change that to this and then at the
bottom we're gonna return our
and that's it now within your
applications you simply establish your
array and then you can run let's save
our result is equal to my array you
target whatever array that you want and
then you say dot R and splice semicolon
and then you can write the result to
yourself on the page and then you'll
notice that you'll have the same
functionality that you did before but
now all of this code is now within its
own method that you've used to extend
the array object that means all of the
arrays in your script can refer to this
R and splice method it can use that
method over and over again so let's take
a look at this in our favorite browser
and we'll see that we have our original
array is missing the e and it's been
spliced out randomly from the array this
time to G refresh and this time the F
has been spliced this time the a all
right so you see with this method it
affects the original array it will
actually take the element randomly out
of the array now if you wanted a
different method you can just copy that
method put another one under it and just
put R and Val and then you'll just get a
random value if you want by referring to
the random index and then you can say
var and Val which is short for value is
equal to this and then you just put
random index position within the square
brackets and then you return Val now
this one will not affect the original
array it won't change it this one
changes the original array and actually
plucks the item out of the array so it
no longer exists in the array after that
so if I run result equals my array dot
ran Val then we'll notice that the
original array stays intact
abcdefg and the e was randomly taken as
a value out of the array so you see
there's different ways to go about it
but this approach just shows you how to
extend java scripts functionality in a
custom sort of way when you feel there
are functions or methods that you want
in place
javascript does an offer by default
within its built-in core functionality
you can see how easy that was to add an
R and splice and I ran Val method so
that's two more methods that the array
object in JavaScript didn't have before
now I can easily use them within my
scripts okay I hope you've enjoyed this
lesson on extending the array objects in
JavaScript to give it different methods
and different kind of functionality that
you might need within your application
when the core JavaScript programming
language is lacking those kind of
methods</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
