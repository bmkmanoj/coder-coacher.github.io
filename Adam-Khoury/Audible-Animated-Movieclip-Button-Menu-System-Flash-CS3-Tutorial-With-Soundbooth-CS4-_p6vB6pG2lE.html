showing you to create in this video
press ctrl n to the render it out let me
check it out and I'm gonna stick my mic
inside my headphones real quick so you
can hear it but I suggest clicking the
link in the description of the video to
hear it real nice and to see it on the
page at the Bela PHP I'll put the link
to the source file download and
everything and the demo right there on
the right in the video description at
YouTube
okay I'm gonna stick my mic into my
headphones so you can hear the menu
because that's really what it's all
about and it's about animated movie clip
buttons I show you how to create those
from scratch there you have it you guys
are gonna like this one have fun okay
before we even begin creating a new file
in flash and assembling things we're
gonna need some sounds that are gonna be
used for the buttons or the items or
whatever movie clips so let's go into
soundbooth and if you don't happen to
have sound booth you can use audacity
that's AUD I see ity audacity it's free
100% free it's a nice tracking and
recording added sound editing tool and
all that good stuff and that's audacity
but I'm in soundbooth cs4 and so what
I'm gonna do is make the sound my voice
clip for the home page and now you can
just click record open record dialog
and there's a record dialog and I can
see my levels check check check one two
in the house check check and then I can
go to record here now once I press
record it's gonna be beginning recording
my voice track and I'm just gonna say
home page home page press stop it
renders in the track let's close and
press play to listen so what I'm gonna
do is go to highlight this whole section
in the beginning and go ahead and cut
that out then this whole section at the
end let's edit and cut that out and I'm
just gonna show you how to do the first
sound and then I'm gonna do the other
three sounds for my other three buttons
my three items in flash and on my own
and I'm not going to be recording that
segment but you can do all your yours
the same way as I'm doing mine here okay
so there's my clip now I'm going to
press control a to highlight the whole
thing I'm not sure if that's necessary
but go to up to effects and dynamics and
then in the stereo rec preset go to
ambient or pick any of these that you
like I'm just gonna pick ambience for
mine and it's gonna take a second and
load in there loaded it into the track
now let me stick my mic in the
headphones you can hear what I got okay
so that's the sound of minions I'm gonna
go file export no no no save as file
save as save it as an mp3 mp3 and let's
just run desktop and let's call it
homepage mp3 homepage that mp3
and that's how you make all your soups
that's how you make all your sounds they
say
make you know you select the settings
you want there and there it is opted on
my home page burn up my home page Durer
popped it onto my desktop so now that
example I'm done and I'm gonna do the
other three sounds from my other three
buttons and three buttons I have are
going to be home so this one that you
just heard that home page sound is going
to go on that button my videos page my
audio page and then my feeds page and
will make a sound for all those Anatomy
okay so I created or bore my voice clips
and I put them right there you can see
one says feeds audio videos home page
and now I'm ready to assemble my menu in
flash and I'm gonna press ActionScript
create new ActionScript 3 file and let's
see if you work in ActionScript 2 you
know how to code pretty well the same
methods can be implemented in
ActionScript 2 you just have to
translate my code alright so let's just
leave the let's make the size of the
stage a little less high maybe 200 550
by 200 it's great so the first thing I
want to do is begin assembling my menu
and it can be any kind of look that you
want any kind of buttons image icons
movie clips animations whatever
and when the users mouse goes over that
item we're gonna make the sound clip
play and then it goes over another item
like that sound clip play very simple to
do surprised nobody's really done a good
tutorial like this before okay so I'm
gonna give it an edge I'm not gonna give
it up leave it blank and so we have
roundness of 18 and now I'm going to
give it a gradient I just like gradients
but I like subtle gradients so I make
mine very light let's go to a light blue
even lighter than that
but right there okay now I won't have
the white on top to make it look like
like it's coming from the top okay that
looks good now we can just convert that
to symbol I'm gonna show you how to make
rollover movie clip buttons from scratch
here
now that YouTube allows me more time
call this BTN in the library
registration table left is good movie
clip okay now we have a movie clip
symbol and it's not a button so I didn't
I named it BTN but I didn't make it a
button you see it's a movie clip and
let's just give it an instance name BTN
one and now inside of it actually let's
also give it a filter bevel so I want to
give it a little bit of depth
but not so bright
and see we get the angle a little better
you know which way do we want it to be
it looks good to me I like that and then
I'm going to also give it a maybe a glow
we'll do an inner glow of black
that's great maybe not so blurred out
nice and thin
nice and light that's great a little
more blurred out okay
so that's a my button it's a movieclip
button and now inside like the
properties yeah as an instance name of
BTN one and the main scene now let's
double click inside of it and assemble
its timeline to make it an animated
rollover button to where when the users
mouse goes over it just doesn't snap to
a different state and a different look
it'll gradually tween to a nice
different look in a in a nice animated
fashion and then it'll when their mouse
goes off of it away from the button out
from the button then the nice out
animation will play and that's the
beauty of movie movie clip rollover and
roll out buttons you can also make quick
state I have a tutorial that shows you
how to make a click state inside of your
movie clip buttons I developed PHP and
the flash dad that tutorials doing it
for a while and there's other movie clip
rollover buttons tutorials there and
source files ok if you don't know yet
I'm going to show you how to rig up an
animated movie clip button timeline so
what we'll do is add a couple more
layers we'll name this one labels this
one actions
and so I'm not sure we need anything
there yep actually there's gonna be
voice clip I'm gonna put the voice clip
on that one voice clip later let's put
that right above the base name this one
bass cuz that's our button bass now
let's right click the button bass
convert to symbol movie clip and let's
just name it bass in the library press
ok
registration top left is good make sure
it's a movie clip press ok and it
doesn't need an instance name or
anything I just wanted to make it a
movie clip so I can have a better tween
on it and what I'm going to do is have
it grow larger in size or you can have
it tint or do whatever you want so let's
say I wanted to go let's hit frame 2
over select frame 2 and press f6 make a
keyframe then let's go out to about only
about 12 make another keyframe then
right next to that one 13 make another
keyframe then let's go out try to match
up the length there
I guess about 24 and then make another
keyframe there by pressing f6 then right
click the center and create motion tween
right click the center here between
those two keyframes create motion tween
and you can right click anywhere in
between those keyframes and it would do
that okay so it looks like those are
even so all we have to do is right here
give it the effect we want I'm gonna
make mine
get a little larger
not much right about there is good and
then
if I want the same exact size in the
same exact positioning I can just go to
this highlighted on stage the next
keyframe press ctrl X remove it
highlight the one that we made the size
adjustments on ctrl C go back to the
frame where we removed that one just a
second ago
press ctrl shift V now it has the same
properties as the the frame right next
to it so you can see the effect now as
we go through the timeline it's going to
bulge on over and then on out it's going
to shrink back
that's an animated movie clip button
normal buttons they snap to different
frames and they don't give you a nice
animated flow in your button so the
voice clip let's just make the labels
real quick f6 here f6 here at 5 here on
the actions layer we're going to make
keyframes now right here f6 and here
we're going to press f5 to extend the
frames out keyframe 1 press f9 type in
sto s topo2 sis semicolon that's a stop
action to make another one Co P stop
action on frame 12 so the logic is when
the users Mouse this is how it's going
to we put the stop action here so this
movie this timeline this little
animation just doesn't loop and you know
do that animation in the loop right when
the user opens the browser or the file
in the browser it's going to stop
and that animation won't happen until
the users mouse goes over this button so
let's give it the correct labels here go
down in the frame label and type in over
let's go over section and here's our out
section plays the out animation and it's
that easy
and we'll put a voice clip here let's
see
so let's go get that first one that we
made that was homepage and that's gonna
be on frame two so let's make a new
keyframe there's several different
methods there's always several ways to
skin a cat in flash though is I'm gonna
add it straight to the timeline here the
sound and you can do it through code if
you wanted wherever you're programming
your buttons on scene one in the main
timeline or wherever you're programming
your buttons from you can add sound
there but I prefer to do it this way I
do it I do it multiple ways but this way
is good it's clean it's easy so let's go
to actually that's fine let's make
another keyframe here
nope not a keyframe let's just press
that five
now I'm gonna go to file import to
library and I'm gonna go to my desktop
and I'm gonna get that home page sound
right there at home page mp3 sound that
I was showing you that I made in the
beginning
ever Swift 3d importer that has nothing
to do with what you would be doing the
sound is in there
that was just my foot 3d importer
debugging okay so right here we're gonna
add that now it's in our library so if
we select a frame any frame in our flash
file that's a keyframe you go down here
and you can add a sound to that keyframe
it doesn't have to be a button it could
be anywhere so let's see what happened
is yep so in the overstate on the out
state there would be nothing I think
that's it now on the base layer inside
of this movie clip the base movie clip
we made I'm gonna add my icon right
there so I'm just going to put it right
on top let's go into fireworks grab our
Home icon ctrl C like I said these icons
are cool because we're using icons is
cool because everybody in every language
would understand what this button meant
no matter where they are in the world
what language they speak they will know
that that's the home button
okay so inside of that is the just a
little more that's good
so now let's see what happens you see it
makes the home and the button get bigger
that's what I wanted so that's why I
laid it in there now when I make my
other buttons it'll be pretty simple I
think that's it because I'm just going
to duplicate this and I'll show you how
I do that
so we'll see now I'm back at the main
team in the main timeline here that I
started on and I'm gonna highlight that
button control C control shift V paste
it in place placed a copy on top
I like the others both of these press
control C control shift V now we have
four you can make as many as you want
try to get those even thanks good
actually here spread them out a little
more
and if you want to even spread
distribute the wits you go to modify
align distribute wits and they all have
an even spread now okay so all you have
to do is duplicate two symbols in the
library and then we can do some swapping
and I'll show you the method I use for
that it makes life easy go into the
library BTN we're gonna do duplicate
right click it select duplicate BTN copy
is fine okay let's do it two more times
duplicate okay BTN duplicate okay that
one's BTN copy three so now we have four
separate copies of the same button now
we're going to base let's go to the base
duplicate that one same amount of times
okay
duplicate okay duplicate okay and this
saves you from having to reconstruct
more the button same style in the same
timeline button many times if you
already did it once why do it so many
other times for all your other buttons
so all you have to do now is hit this
one swap it for BTN and copy this one
swap it from BTN copy to this one you
swap for BTN copy three then you go
inside and if I was to edit that icon if
I go into that base movie clip and edit
that icon it would change all of those
icons so I don't want that so I'm gonna
swap this one out now for the base
copies base copy swap going to this
button do the same thing to this base
swap the base copy to go into this
button swap the base copy three instead
it's that simple
now I can go into these buttons
and change out that icon press ctrl X
remove that you'll see all the other
stayed in place that's what we wanted so
let's go to fireworks and get our video
clip symbol symbol for our video button
and see where are we here we go
press ctrl V import is the movie clip
oops
drag that into place
and now that one will be independent see
oops
we gotta swap that out here
so swap the base here base copy so our
base can be swab our base copy
and I find this easier than making the
button all over again the same way so
now you can see we have a copy I'm going
to do that but the other last two
buttons here
okay now that I've got all of my buttons
independent I can go into each timeline
now and swap out that track now we have
the the icon swapped we're good to go
there let's swap out the little voice
clip so we go up to file import and this
one it's going to import the library
this one is the videos voice clip and
all you have to do is go down here swap
that up or videos and now the videos
voice clip is going to play on this
section of timeline instead of the home
page voice clip and let's do the same
thing for these other buttons right here
I'll go up to file import you don't have
to select that keyframe or anything or
highlight it you can just import to
library at any time before you even
started the buttons you could this is
audio longer just sitting in your
library and you can refer to them at any
time and put them in any keyframe there
and so just to mention right quick for
you guys I didn't put a stop action here
you notice that what we're gonna do is
loop around so when the users Mouse goes
out from the button it loops back to
frame one and it hits that stop action
there so it's the equivalent of going
back to the original state
and that's the effect you want you
wanted to loop back around to this first
frame when the users a mouse goes out
from it if you didn't want it to you
make a stop action there if you wanted
more states or whatever you want to do
in there like I said I have a tutorial
that shows the click State so it extends
this out a little further so now I think
that one swap we're good to go there and
let's do the last one
import you know what I didn't swap that
last one to import the library feeds
make sure we swap it right here you
highlight this frame go down here to
sound feeds and I think I have to swap
this one still don't click that go down
to audio okay now they're all set now we
can finally code these bad boys and
everything should be good to go they're
all independent and have independent
timelines because we did our swapping
trick in the library there okay so let's
make a new layer name it actions
and this is where we'll put the
ActionScript code is a lot of
ActionScript code is like to keep the
actions on a separate layer independent
from the elements that's why we create a
new actions layer we're gonna put in
code that's gonna affect these things oh
let's make these button to see this
wouldn't worked if I kept them all the
same instance name down here it's very
important their instance names but
before
okay so we have button 1 2 3 and for
instance names great now we can program
so what are we gonna do is highlight
actions frame key frame 1 press f9 open
the actions panel this is where you
program things into your flash files and
it's gonna connect to these items on
stage you see they have instance names
we're gonna use those instance names to
program these items and to talk to them
communicate with them and make them do
things when certain things occur and the
first thing is let's take BTN one and
give it an event listener add event
listener and this is going to be open
parenthesis and type in Mouse event just
put my T first on those dot rollover all
caps on this underscore over roll over
and now let's place the function name
that we're going to create that's going
to be button over and we're going to be
using Universal button functions here
once again just to show you how to code
a little meaner leaner leaner and meaner
now let's add BTN one let's just grab
all this add an event listener for the
out function when the users Mouse leaves
the button now BTN one now has change
this to out my BTN now has event
listeners four over and out now we're
listening when the users mouse goes over
and away from that button that's all
that's those two lines are doing now we
need a function it's going to fire off
and this function is going to work for
even if you had 50 buttons it would work
for all 50
the way I set it up say BTN over open
parentheses close parentheses open the
curly bracket close the curly bracket
now you have a nice function nest of BT
and over and inside this is going to be
an event colon mouse event claim it here
now we can use the target of the event
target of the event would be instance
name BTN one so it's very nice so you
just say event makes things easy event
target that way you don't have to name
each one make a function a BTN over
function for each one it's a pain in the
butt dot go to and play
the older frame
Oh event that target that go to and play
over what that saying is BTN one if that
happens to be the button that's rolled
over at that moment he goes to any place
it's over stayed inside of it which is
more on that right there warn't no porn
no okay so let's make the out function
this is so easy let's give it a little
space let's say for UT BTN out name it
the same is here because we have all
this in there now let's play the out
date that one's gonna go and play the e
this section no you know okay so all we
need some more button listeners for
button to button three and button for so
button to button three and button for
now I have separate listeners you could
also build an array that button array
and add event listeners through the
array to make even meaner leaner code
maybe I'll show you that one day and so
I think that's everything all four of
them have the button over and button out
we using event target so no matter which
button it is it's gonna use the event
that target of the name and make it go
to and play that button so let's test it
out press control enter hopefully no
mistakes
cool
that's hot yeah I'm really surprised
nobody showed tutorial ins before adding
voice clips and and cool sounds to your
buttons in this way I'm gonna stick my
mic into my headphones right now so you
can hear it and it's not going to be
real clear I would suggest that you
click the link in the description right
now of the where the video is just look
to the right there and I put a link to
all my source files usually and you can
see how the sound is how it's supposed
to be and how the animation is supposed
to look and everything pretty cool
pretty cool okay that's pretty much it
that shows you a pretty advanced menu
system that has modern a modern twist
modern feel to it and a personal feel if
you want to get your own maybe you have
a beautiful voice or your female
beautiful pink buttons or something you
know nice I'm not saying all females
like pink but if that was your style
nice red red buttons with a nice hot
female voice oh man that would be great
you know that's just what I envision you
know but anyways I saw one of my
homeboys website had a menu system with
his voice on it so I just wanted to show
everybody how to do it and I don't know
if he had a tutorial or anything for it
but I just wanted to create one
yeah so that's it we'll see you next
lesson I'll have this source file for
download so you can check everything out
and get to the inner workings of and see
how I structured it out head to develop
PHP under the flash tabs see you next
