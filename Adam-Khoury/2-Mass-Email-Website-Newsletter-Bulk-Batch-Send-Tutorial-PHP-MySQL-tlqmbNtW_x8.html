newsletter and bulk email blast tutorial
and what we did in part 1 was listen to
me blab a whole bunch and just Yammer on
about the logic and the flow of the
application and how everything is going
to work in part 2 here we're going to
get our hands dirty so let's go ahead
and get our hands dirty so here we are
in PHP myadmin
from my existing database and if you
guys don't have a database set up
already that you're working with and
connected to already then you can go to
develop PHP which says MySQL I cores
here and what you want to do is click
let's see creating a MySQL database on
your web host and you go through all of
that stuff make sure you read everything
really good even all the links that it
sends you to and you will be able to set
up a MySQL database and connect to it
and then you'll be at the place where I
am and out so what I am inside of my
existing database so I'm just going to
add another table for the newsletter
because it really doesn't require a
whole database just a little table so if
you have one that's already existing go
ahead and use that and just add a table
to it if you don't have a database setup
- ql database setup go to that link i
just showed you how to develop PHP and
follow all that stuff very closely or
you can have your hosting provider help
you out if you're feeling lost call them
and tell them you want to set up a -
feel database and you're just having
tons of problems alright let's go to
number of fields here so we're going to
create a new table on the database -
called mr. magic Adam and this is the
one I used for my custom CMS tutorial
system where I showed how to build
something like Joomla WordPress so
that's why you see modules and pages
there new table going in is called
newsletter and that's going to have
let's say I think I need one two
three four five fields press go and then
it's going to list all the fields out
for you to designate what they are first
one is ID so let's make that ID if it'll
let me type ID the second one is going
to be name third one email and swear the
email is going to be stored in that
field
and the day time that the person signed
up for your newsletter and received
which is going to be enumerated field so
let's go ahead and make that field you
see how they all say varchar' here we're
going to make that one say enum and
we're going to give it some default
values single quote zero single quote
comma single quote one single quote so
we have two default values in there zero
and one and they're separated by a comma
and they're both wrapped with single
quotes and that's how it tells you how
to set it up down here you see it's very
easy
now you go date time field you're going
to make that date I'm find the date time
type and set it to date time type and
the email varchar' to 55 is good
varchar' to 55 per name as well and
finally the ID field it's going to be
integer type so select int and then go
over here to extra auto increment and
then slide on over to primary so you
highlight thee or select the radio
button there for the primary field so
you have primary auto increment integer
type ID and everything's ready to go
we're not going to have any default
values for well let's put a default zero
in the received field and that's it now
press save
don't press go because it allows another
field and say but what you want to do is
press save it will create that table for
you
now with that table created let's click
on that newsletter let's look at it real
good okay we have an ID field so each
person this is going to auto increment
each person that comes in to be
subscribe to our newsletter is going to
have a unique ID that's going to auto
increment so the first guy is number one
second guy number two third guy's number
three so on and so forth and but they
won't be aware of that number then their
name email and the day time that they
subscribe and whether they have received
the latest email campaign the newsletter
the latest newsletter or not and I might
add another field here to this if we
require it but you'll see me do it I
won't leave anything out and so that's
pretty much all you need for storage and
the only reason why it took me so long
is because I was explaining what all
these fields are and how to set them I
could have done that in 20 seconds and
been done so that's not bad time you in
there 30 seconds to a minute and you got
your storage mechanism set okay
okay now that we created our MySQL
database we have to be sure we connect
to it before we start coding out any
kind of applications we got to make sure
we're connected to that bad boy so it's
going to Dreamweaver and these files are
going to be available with the tutorial
you can download and get to the files
set it up the way you need for your
system so what you'll do is you go in
here and you get this connect to MySQL
dot PHP file and you change these four
lines the DB host the DB username DB
pass and DB name and you can get all of
that information I can't help you with
that exact information and nobody can
accept your hosting account
administration the people who own your
hosting account and yourself if I was on
your server I could get the information
no problem because I know a way to go
and get it where to look if you don't
and you got to ask okay
but if you look around you can probably
find it visit the help files and search
for MySQL connection info or whatever
something like that anyways this is your
connect file now I'm going to open a
file called MySQL quick tests that I
have I'm going to put this all on the
server just to be sure that I'm
connected to my database so I'm going to
FTP everything into a folder called
newsletter so say my site is on the root
directory inside of that root directory
I'm going to have a folder called
newsletter that's going to hold this
whole application pretty much so I'm
going to FTP a boulder called newsletter
which I have right here in my data you
can see right here there it is
newsletter and inside of it I have
connect to MySQL my MySQL quick test and
my index file on the index file is going
to be the form for gathering their
information okay you'll just want to
disregard this index file for now
the one we just described are connect to
MySQL which you saw in full and MySQL
quick test which also saw in full
there's quick
and there's connect to MySQL and we're
using the MySQL family of functions and
not the new and improved MySQL a family
of functions in order for this tutorial
to be more universal for more users but
this works in PHP 5 and PHP 4
universally don't worry about it
okay so let's go to add these to the
webserver and test ok Here I am at my
live server online I'm going to go to
that directory newsletter and yeah it
says forbidden I'm going to go to the
file inside of it called MySQL quick
test dot PHP you see their success in
database connection happy coding so
everything is good and I have all that I
need to connect my database my storage
apparatus
okay now with our database set and our
storage apparatus ready we are ready to
move on in this first section here and
we just finished create the MySQL
database table and connect to it
I'm sure that's working so now we'll
move on to create a form for gathering
their names and email addresses and
write a script to send their info to the
MySQL database I'm going to combine
these two into one little file which is
just going to be a smarter way to work I
think and help you with clutter you can
combine both of these things into one
file the form and the parsing mechanism
error handling everything one one file
and we're going to be covering that file
and creating it in pot three so stay
tuned and make sure you guys comment and
rate this video high if you want to see
me continue or else I'll feel like
nobody has any interest in learning this
type of thing any further and just move
on to something better okay so you guys
give me some feedback okay bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
