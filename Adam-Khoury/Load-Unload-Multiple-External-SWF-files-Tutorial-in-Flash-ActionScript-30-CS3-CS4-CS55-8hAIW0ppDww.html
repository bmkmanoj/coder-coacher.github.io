we'll be creating in this tutorial
publish out and we're loading and
unloading external SWF files into our
main flash file and giving it a little
hacked in loader animation behind it
hello everybody in this flash cs3
professional tutorial I'll be working in
ActionScript 3 and you can be in flash
cs4 working in ActionScript 3 for this
tutorial as well we're going to teach
you how to load and unload multiple
external SWF files into your main file
using nav buttons so if I publish out in
here now you'll see I have just a blank
page type thing with four buttons on it
like nav buttons navigation buttons and
they're not programmed to do anything
yet so I'm going to show you how to do
is take an SWF file loaded into this
blank area here on the page the body
section and we'll load the first one in
by default so the user doesn't have to
press any buttons to see that one by
default when they come to the page then
we'll load the program will add the
programming to to make these buttons
load in a new SWF but before they do
they'll remove the current one that's
there so say if you're viewing the demon
SWF and he's in the body section and you
the user presses stingray it's going to
remove the demon using remove child and
it's going to add the stingray to the
display so that's what we'll teach you
how to do right now so let's go to flash
here and here's our file we have a layer
and on the layer is nothing but just
some static text fields and here's our
four buttons and these are button
instances if you see down here and they
have no instance names yet I'm going to
name them in a second first let me show
you where our SWF files are living okay
and if you notice this file is called
the main file and what we're going to do
is look at the structure of a folder see
their Fla there's our SWF for main file
that a seronegative content
there's an HTML file here we have a
folder called SWFs and that's where all
your SWFs should be located double click
inside of that and there's all my SWF
files my external SWF said I want to
load in and so the ones I want to load
in on my page are eyes closed
stingray demon and strongman and you can
see they all have the right names for
that stingrays their strongman their
eyes closed is right there no eyes
closed right there that's the proper one
and then demons right here so now that
we have those names we understand what
our SWFs are named there what we'll do
is we'll go into our flash file and I'm
going to name all of these buttons
exactly what the SWF is named and I'm
going to I'll show you why in a second
you'll see why it's easier to do it this
way
so that one's eyes closed this one we're
going to get an instance name of
stingray so I'm just highlighting it on
stage then I'm going down to the
properties panel and typing in an
instance name for each button for the
corresponding SWF name the name of the
SWF and our folder here that's what I'm
doing there so this one was demon that
SWF so I gave it a name of demon this
one a strongman SWF so I give this
button an instance name of strongman so
this button this button this button this
button all have instance names
corresponding to the name of the SWF
file that it's going to load into our
our main flash file here so that's what
we just did now that these have instance
names I think we can start our
programming and that's pretty much it
for the stage elements I have four
buttons they're my little page and then
an area down here that's blank for where
the SWF s will load in now we'll create
a new layer highlight the layer one and
insert layer
and then rename that actions or
actionscript 3.0 and highlight that key
frame and press f9 now we're in our
actions panel we can code out some
things some elements on earth or we can
put the code in to control the elements
on our stage here so we'll press f9 and
first thing we want to do is claim a
couple of variables for where we want
the SWFs
to to live on the page the x coordinates
and the Y coordinates you can see if I
click this little movie clip guy here he
has X&amp;amp;Y coordinates and we want to make
sure that our movie clip is living in
the correct spot so start out with a bar
of exposition so let's call it expose
and this is a number and we'll say maybe
110 see how that works out give it a
value of 110 semicolon now the next line
is going to be the Y position so you can
just copy that whole line go down one by
pressing enter and press control V paste
that of the line in for the original
line in this one we'll make 180 this one
will call Y position now these are
variables that we can then use in our
script down below and they have these
values set in them
now we'll set up a variable for our SWF
movieclip instance so we'll claim this
as a movie clip and it has the variable
has a name of SWF and we'll be using
that below and I'll show you how and why
and a little bit let's claim another
variable here for our loader object
this is loader equals new loader object
okay
so oops parentheses close parentheses
semicolon okay
now we're going to load in the default
SWF so we're going to have to claim the
variable name for the URL request for
that SWF it's very simple to do you just
go var give it any name you want I'm
going to name a default SWF : URL
request equals new URL request you are
requested let me just put in open
parenthesis double quote double quote
close parenthesis semicolon and in
between the double quotes we'll type in
the folder name the SWF folder remember
there's a little folder called SWFs with
all the little SWFs in it slash eyes
closed that's going to be the first one
we want in there and we'll just put this
one in static because it's going to be
our default so we say SWFs remember that
folder SWFs inside of it
eyes closed SWF that's pretty much what
I claimed there so this default this w F
has a value of what we just placed in
for the folder the directory location
and the file name okay so now the next
line is going to be loading the loader
object with the default SWF URL so we'll
say loader dot load open parentheses
close parentheses semicolon and in the
parenthesis in between just put that
default SWF there
and so now the loader object has set
that URL for that SWF file so now we're
going to place it in the correct
location we'll use the x position and y
position values here so we'll say loader
X position equals expose we'll put that
value of 110 there and now say loader
dot y position equals y pose okay and
now all we have to do is add child to
stage or to the flash display panel or
the display list sorry all these
technical words I hate them okay so you
add child you add loader to the display
list and let's just go ahead and section
that off because that's pretty much that
loads in the default SWF so if I was to
publish out now hopefully I'll see an
SWF sitting there and there is that's
eyes closed
and you can see none of our buttons are
programmed yet but we accomplished the
first task by bringing in an external
SWF into the designated place where we
want it inside of our main file now
let's continue you can see here in our
in the format developed PHP I've got
three threads here where people are
asking how to do this so that tells you
why I'm making the tutorial and when I'm
done with it I'll post in these threads
saying here's the tutorial for you okay
so we go back into flash and here we
have loaded in our default SWF
successfully that's good so now what
we're going to do is create a universal
button function so we don't have to code
so much will keep the clothes lean and
we'll put event listeners for all four
of these buttons and we'll use the same
function to the reason why we gave them
instance names of the actual SWF name is
going to come into play here in just a
minute when I show you what we're going
to do and you'll be like ah that's why
he did that okay
okay now let's create this Universal
button function so we'll call it buttons
Universal function just write ourselves
a little comment there above it and type
in function will call it button click
because it'll be for all the buttons
open parentheses close parentheses :
void and open the curly bracket over the
curly brace now here inside of the
button click function it has to be an
event mouse event so we'll give it event
: Mouse event alright now let's go down
a couple of lines and put it in the
closing curly bracket curly brace to
close off the function so now we have a
function nest here and inside the
function we'll put the first bit of
logic inside this function that we need
is to remove this SWF the default SWF
that we loaded in here and all other
SWFs that might be sitting in that spot
at that same time so this line of code
will do that effectively you say remove
child and we'll just remove the loader
open parenthesis type in loader closed
parenthesis type in loader closed
parenthesis and semicolon now each time
this any buttons clicked on stage
we're commanding the loader to be
removed off the stage so no matter what
SWF is displaying it's going to be
removed first thing in that function now
let's type in the rest or program in the
rest of the function to add the new SWFs
to that spot so let's type in bar we're
going to do pretty much what we did up
here
add a new URL request and we'll call
this one new SWF request new SWF request
that way we know what it is really good
no ice tub Europe and we can identify it
really easily it helps if you name all
of your variables
you know intuitive things just common
sense you know it helps you to identify
what's going on in your code so here is
going to be where we're going to add a
little tricky Ness we're going to use
the event that target that name of the
button that's why I put the the instance
names to have the direct name of the SWF
that I want to load in so here we're
going to type in keep that there and
put in double quote to close that one
off and a couple spaces and a double
quote quote to close that one off now in
the middle we can add by putting in a
couple of addition signs there to add
event let's grab that we're going to add
the event dot target whatever buttons
click that means that name the name of
the button that is the tricky part
you notice our button is eyes closed and
stingray and demon they have instance
names here or sting rate so what that
means is right here it's going to have
the word stingray dot SWF and that's
what you want because that's what it is
okay that makes sense
I hope it does because that's as clear
as I can make it okay so each button it
gets pressed is going to load its
corresponding SWF by using its instance
name to get that URL that SWF out of the
folder and load it up if that makes any
sense okay so now the next thing we want
to do is load the loader like we did for
the default right here so let's take
that and put it right there and when you
load this SWF instead this dynamic one
that's going to be set for the buttons
now the next line we want to also
position it like we did last time so
we'll just take those and put them here
so now it has correct X&amp;amp;Y positions and
now we just add the loader add child to
the displaced and
the loader doesn't have to change
because it's already established up here
and we can just swap what's in it by
removing the child out of it and adding
a new child to it and this is how we
make it dynamic here using the event
that target that name to get all the SWF
step looking for so now the last thing
the only thing we need left is the
button listeners for all four buttons so
let's go one line down outside of that
function and let's type in BTN listeners
and we all we need is four of them so
let's say eyes closed is the first
button the instance name on it dot add
event listener and this is the mouse
it's just open closed parentheses put a
semicolon go back into the parentheses
in between a put mouse event dot click
all capitals and the the universal
button function which is named button
click so you take that put it there now
this has it's going to run the button
click function every time that eyes
close button is pressed so now we have
that let's just duplicate that line four
times so three three more times and keep
it to where it all has the button click
Universal function they're set for the
listener and just change the the names
the next one is stingray I think button
after that is a stingray demon strong
man those are the the instance names on
the buttons
demon and strongman and that pretty much
wraps it up see that wasn't too hard and
I'll show you guys little loader trick
that I use
after we experiment here see if we got
everything working okay there's the
default there's a stingray so it
unloaded the default and added the
stingray SWF that when unloaded and
loaded that one unloaded and loaded so
you can see they all unload and load the
the ones that they should and when the
button is clicked again you can add if
and else statements to make this
programming a lot more powerful and I'm
not going to do everything for you I
just want to show you the basics on how
to get these things in loaded and
unloaded and I will show you how to get
a little some insight into progress
loading if you want to know how to load
or make a little animated load bar
before each if your SWF s-- happens to
be really bulky and large if they take a
little while to load in you might want
to put in an animation a load animation
preload or animation type thing and I'll
show you how to do that now let's get in
close that out back in a flash
okay so let's say behind or if each one
of those W FS are bulky and they take a
little while to load in you might have
some dial-up users or whatever you might
want to put a an animated loader symbol
behind them and I'll show you how to do
that really quick and this is kind of
like a cheat and a hack but it works for
me and you can use my little trick here
if you want and I'll show you some more
resources for getting preloader set up
for each SWFs after I show you this so
I'm going to import to library on my
desktop I've got a little loader
animation this is just an animated gif
that I made in fireworks and it made gif
and let's go into the library now let's
bring it out to stage and load animation
there it is okay so you see is just a
little loader animation now I'm going to
put it and like I said this is a hack
this is not the correct way to load
things but you're going to see it works
actually you'll see it on the page and
let's see
so you see the loader back there for a
split second right before each SWF comes
in so this was on the web if those took
maybe 20 seconds to load in that little
load animation since this is on my local
machine
of course it's not taking any time to
load those in because they're they're
already there and available to be loaded
in automatically but if you had it in
the web they would take time to download
the files to the user's system so you
would need a little loader behind those
that's a nice little trick there because
the SWF comes right in on top and covers
that little loader so you don't have to
do much work that's a really nice simple
hack method for putting progress loaders
it's really not going to read the
progress but it will let even dialup
users know hey something's coming into
this spot just hang on okay and now for
the official method if you're a big dork
and you want to know how to really
listen for the load progress you go into
your Flash help file and you type in see
this monitoring loading progress and you
just click on that first one there now
you click on the second one that comes
up after you press search press search
click on the second one it says
monitoring loading progress read all
this scroll down and you'll see where I
got all the know how to load up the SWF
it's right there
and here they have a complete listener
set up for when the load the load object
is completely loaded and ready to be
displayed
here's that function so you use this
code in place of of my code here add
that event listener and you add that
little function that tells you to add
there and it what you can do is add a
loader animation just like the one I
loaded to the stage there this one but
now with the code that they give you in
the help file if you use this complete
listener function you can just say
loader animation that visible equals
false and that little
will disappear but as you can see my
little method works nice because my well
that's the wrong file to the right vial
here sorry about that you can see that
my method works nice because each SWF
comes in and it covers that little load
animation like I said it's a hack but it
works and I'm all about whatever works I
don't care about standards not at all a
lot of people piss and moan about web
standards I could care frickin less as
long as something displays right and all
users can see it universally in all
browsers I care about those kind of
standards but as far as you know if
everybody can see it in every browser
and it displays the way you want it does
the job it's supposed to do you have
completed your job successfully
to hell with web standards but if
somebody in some browser has trouble
seeing your file then you have failed
and that's you know that's what I mean
okay so these kind of hacks are cool but
they're not official</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
