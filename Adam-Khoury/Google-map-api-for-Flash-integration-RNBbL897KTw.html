google maps api the new api for flash
integration if you don't already know
about it i know a lot of you guys
probably already know about it but some
of you guys might not yet and it's a new
feature from google and so i wanted to
show you about it if you're on the home
page of Google well with the API you'll
be able to add any kind of google map
into your flash applications anywhere so
what you do is on the home page of
Google you type in google code then you
go to the google code site here then you
click api and developer tools and then
you click api's here on the product and
you scroll down here until you find
google map api's for flash and it says
new you click that and then you click
which one is it
home
and they show you an example and if you
right click it you can see it's
flash-based it's an SWF and you can drag
it around just like the regular google
map and it has all the other features of
the google map and if you click over
here how do I says how do I start click
down here it gives you a setup
instructions and click tutorial and it
shows you actually down at the bottom of
this one they've got a nice big one
integrated into the page here I think I
passed it up there it is and it seems
pretty simple to do I am I integrated it
into one side already and it was pretty
simple to do and Google gives you all
the codes you need you can see all the
code right down through here all and
there's a bunch of ActionScript that
they set up for you and they even show
you how to load it into an HTML page if
you just want to have it as one solid
swf or you can just actually load it
into your into your swf if you have a
full flash page so you can see that is
the new Google Maps API for flash
tutorial I hope you guys get some use
out of that and it's a really cool
feature to google is putting out and I
would recommend all you guys just keep
on top of what Google is doing for flash
integration there's also articles on how
how Google and Yahoo i'm not sure where
the articles are on the web but google
and yahoo were working on getting swfs
to be fully indexable in the search
engines so that's a lot of cool stuff
Google's doing and the google maps api
for flash tutorial is a really cool
feature here they give you all the code
you need and they give you examples
so that's about it I just wanted to show
that to everybody and we'll see you next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
