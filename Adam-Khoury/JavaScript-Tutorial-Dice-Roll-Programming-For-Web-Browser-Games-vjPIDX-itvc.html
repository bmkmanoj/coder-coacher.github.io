you can learn to script dice rolls for
web-based games that involve dice your
dice can be standard six-sided or have
as many sides as your game requires for
instance if you're programming dice
throws for role-playing games you could
require dice up to as many sides as 100
maybe even we're going to start with the
bare bones of an html5 web document
first thing we'll do is apply our HTML
and CSS so in the body element I want a
div I'm going to want another div and
these divs are going to hold pretty much
represent the dice we're going to use
CSS to float them so they're little
boxes that sit side by side horizontally
then we're going to want a button and
this will be put in place to give you
something to click to actually roll the
dice and the value for what the user
will see on the button is roll dice now
that button has to have an on click
event
equal to a JavaScript function that
we're going to fire off we'll name that
roll dice open closed parentheses so
every time this button is clicked the
dice will be rolled then we'll put an h2
element in place we'll give that h2
element an ID of status will instruct
JavaScript to show things in this status
element when you roll the dice now since
these two divs are going to be floating
we're going to put some style in this h2
element of clear left because those two
divs above it are going to be floating
left and the button that's above it is
also an inline element so just to make
sure the h2 element is under is living
underneath all of those other elements
we're going to clear left because these
two divs are going to be set to floating
now this first did we're going to give
an ID of died one and we're going to
give it a class that's equal to dice and
that's just how we're going to style
these boxes up the ID is what we'll use
to communicate with this element in the
JavaScript so let's just go ahead and
copy those two attributes and their
values and place it in div two and make
sure we have died two as the ID of that
one class you can leave exactly the same
now up in the head element let's go
ahead and open up a style element and
make its type text/css
and make sure we go down a couple of
lines and close that style
and inside of it we're going to add one
rule that's for affecting these two divs
with the class of dice so any divs on
the page with the class of dice we're
going to get these CSS properties
applied and I just set it up to make
them a little gray box now inside of the
divs we're just going to add a zero as a
default value for each die then if we
render this in our favorite browser this
is the output that you get now what we
need is the roll dice function in
JavaScript to actually make the dice
roll let's go up into the head element
right under our style element and we're
going to pop in a script element go down
a couple of lines and be sure we close
that script element now we need this
function roll dice so we can just really
copy all of that right there and type in
the word function and paste in roll dice
with your parenthesis open curly brace
and go down a couple of lines and put in
your closing curly brace now the first
thing we want to do when the person
rolls the dice or when the rolled dice
function is called to run and in our
case we might have things in it that you
might not have in your game but we're
going to have it in place for developer
reasons so you can see all the output of
what's going on so first we're going to
target died one and died two and get
them into local variables the object
references for those elements are now in
local variables called die one and die
two because we used get element by ID
and we also want to get this status h2
status as a local variable now we want
to run two lines of code that are going
to determine the value for die one and
the value for die two and we're going to
name those d1 and d2 and to get those
all you have to do is run some code that
allows you to get a random number from
one to six so that's the code I applied
it uses math.random times six plus one
but that would be in decimal form if you
run math dot random by itself you'll see
that it returns a decimal value so we
multiply that decimal value and we use
math dot floor on math dot random to
make sure we don't have a decimal number
it's going to be a whole number
and since we're rounding down that's why
you see +1 here on the end so basically
this code will give you a random number
that is from 1 to 6 if you need to be a
random number from 1 to 20 you just put
a 20 right there
so d1 and d2 are going to hold random
numbers from 1 to 6 now we want to
create a variable that's going to be the
dice total so let's save our dice total
is equal to d1 plus d2 so if the user
roles a 3 and a 4 it'll equal a 7 as
their dice total now the next thing
we're going to do is put the value for
those individual die values into the
actual dice the graphical interface that
you have for your dice on the page that
is if you're even going to have a
graphical representation of the dice
roll your game might not even require
that you have a graphical representation
to show the user what the dice look like
you just might want to show them the
total roll so we target the element die
1 and die 2 and we affect their
innerhtml property to make them say
whatever value these come out to be
it'll be a random number from 1 to 6
then the next thing we're going to do is
update that h2 element that's our status
that tells us what we rolled so we can
say status that innerhtml is equal to
you rolled and then we insert the dice
total we just concatenate that into the
string using plus signs so the dice
total variable remember we got right
here by adding d1 plus d2 and that's the
way you can show what the dice total is
now I'll add a little bit of bonus logic
for you here it's an if condition that
evaluates to see if d1 the value of D 1
is equal to the value of D 2 if it is
you're going to append to the status
innerhtml a space and then the word
doubles you get a free turn so this is
how this little if condition is how you
can evaluate for doubles and then do
things within your program if your
program does something special if
somebody gets doubles this is where you
do it right here ok now let's press ctrl
s and run this in our favorite browser
let's roll dice all right I got Snake
Eyes the first roll will slow up I roll
the two doubles you get a free turn so
let's roll dice again I roll doubles
again this time I rolled in a
there's a 10 a 4 and a 1 that equals 5
okay so you see how it works these will
always be numbers in between 1 &amp;amp; 6
randomly and that's how you can simulate
your dice rolls and you just treat those
values like dice in your software here
okay now let's quickly talk about if you
need a random number in between 1 and
100 like I said before you put 100 right
there and then that way you'll have more
like D&amp;amp;D dice or 20 like a 20-sided die
so I'm just going to leave this as 6 and
you guys know in the back of your head
that these can be dice of any value so
if you have like a 20 sided die like
this little guy or you can program it
like casino dice like the big white ones
or the big red ones all right so I hope
you found this javascript programming
dice rules for web games tutorial
helpful and maybe it'll get your wheels
turning on things that you might be able
to create that'll render in the browser</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
