extended in this lesson we're going to
be discussing the Swift 3d PS which is a
plugin created by electric rain that's
especially made for Photoshop cs4
extended that gives the user a powerful
3d modeling program that's directly
integrated into the workflow and your
workspace so I'm going to show you how
to maximize your workspace to have all
the 3d menus and interactions you need
for working with 3d objects in Photoshop
and then we're going to tap into the
plug-in so the first thing we'll do is
go to window extensions well first let's
go to workspace and let's put it let's
select advanced 3d so that will change
what we have here in this tab section
we're going to go up to window now and
extensions and once you install the
Swift 3d PS plug-in it will
automatically be in your extensions
pulldown here so you just click Swift 3d
PS and there the little window comes up
now a good spot for this is right here
right next to the 3d tab you see the 3d
tab there you just stick your Swift 3d
PS tab right in there that way you can
go in between them if you need to and
now your workspace is all set up smart
for working with 3d objects and now you
can save this workspace you go up to
window workspace where my save workspace
and let's just call this let's save
everything
it's called this
Adams ps3 D
workspace now you'll have it always
saved that way when you close the
program down and you open it back up you
can just choose your workspace here from
this tab again Adams PS 3d workspace
this is one I made earlier I just wanted
to show you guys how to get your
workspace set up now you can go to file
and new just create a regular web
document okay okay the first thing we'll
do is add a new layer above our
background layer which is locked and on
this new layer let's add a gradient now
you can manipulate the colors of the
gradient and how the gradient is going
to be formed linear radial click radial
and let's make it blue try and match
that Photoshop symbol color right there
right about there okay it's a little bit
too light then here we want to make this
one black now let's just draw it up in
the bottom to the top there we go so now
our background doesn't look so plain
okay now we're going to create let's go
ahead and lock that layer so we don't
interfere with what's going on there and
put a new layer above that and actually
we can let's just go ahead and delete
that layer because we can launch this
from a new layer see launched from the
selected layer or launched from new
layer so you have the option to make a
new layer and launch from that selected
layer which that's what we'll do or you
can just launch from new layer and it
will automatically create a new layer
for you so let's launch from selected
layer so here it is opening up
okay so when the plugin comes up if you
use the working in swift 3d you'll
notice all the familiar tools and mostly
all of the tabs and interfacing that
you're used to from the standalone
version of swift 3d but if you're not
used to working with Swift 3d rest
assured that it's one of the easiest
tools that anybody could use for 3d
modeling and rendering creating custom
3d models okay so let's just show you
how to get little text logo 3d text logo
into that layer that we have waiting in
Photoshop so let's click the Create text
and now let's put a light on the scene
because you'll see there's no lights on
on the scene yet so we can add lights
here we can roll them around on this
trackball to get just the lighting and
shading that we will that we like you
can put more lights to put one here and
one there now let's change our text to
say all you have to do is click the text
and make sure the text selection is set
right here and then you can manipulate
the text let's make it say Swift 3d
and let's change the font you can use
all of your system fonts that are
available there we go
should I think that's all uppercase if I
use that one
that's a good one I don't need anything
fancy okay now actually maybe we can
find one there we go now let's add a
bevel to it out around it drag it
straight on to the item you want to give
a bevel you can see we have viewports we
have a front viewport here left viewport
bottom viewport let's say I wanted to
change this to the top viewport so now
I'm seeing it from the top if I want to
see it from the front bottom it's just
like that one
so that's how that works and you can set
one viewport to be the only viewport if
you wanted well I'll be going
I'll be showing you guys a lot more
about it so now we have a bevel on it
now let's go ahead and put another text
tool in or text object
let's make this one say PS or Swift
three DPS let's give this a different
font there we go let's give that a bevel
- how to round it there we go
it's beautiful okay so now we have both
of those items in the viewport we can
give them materials as well so what I'm
going to do is select both of them by
holding shift as I select and then I can
use this trackball here to change the
perspective that's on those I'm going to
give these a material I'll be showing
you guys a lot more about all of these
things I just want to show you a quick
example of how we get that layer in
there how it works let's make this and
see what color orange
on the sides a little bit darker on the
bevels as well then for the PS make that
the blue nice Photoshop blue look darker
on the sides and on the bevels
okay so now you don't have to really
worry about the environments background
color too much that gray background
color but if you wanted to change it you
could double click that and in Photoshop
it's a it's not going to bring in that
that background environment the
environment background element anyway so
it really doesn't matter but the ambient
light color does have a little bit to do
with the way your objects are shaded
alright so that looks good to me
so now let's press ok and here we are
back in that layer in Photoshop we can
use all of our 3d tools on this layer
now to twist it around get a different
perspective scale whatever we need to do
to it we can also change our view ports
here we can get to the front viewport
like we had in Swift 3d and we can roll
it around very cool the way it works you
want to get a little bigger a little
closer to us to get the scale tool and
then there's a lot of tweaking you can
also do to these models get these jagged
jagged edges off but I just want to show
you guys a quick little demonstration of
how this all works it's really cool and
it makes making cool 3d logos in
Photoshop and you can also do nice
custom 3d models and have a little bit
of fun with that
okay we'll see you guys in the next
lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
