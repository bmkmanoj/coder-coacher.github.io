for all of your support I'll try and pay
you guys back by delivering good video
material and I'd even make out with you
if you just supply me with your home
address and a good time for me to stop
by
so in this two-part video lesson series
we will be demonstrating how to design
and then program elite custom form
fields dare I even say epic form fields
and I have to say epic because that
gives the little kids here on YouTube a
chubby so I got to throw that in before
we begin let's take a look at what we're
going to be creating from scratch so we
all have a very clear idea of our
objective and our end result if you go
to the YouTube channels if you see
somebody with a new YouTube layout with
the new channel layout mine has it if
you want to just go to mine you put your
mouse inside of this search field you
can see how it looks in its normal state
you can see how the button reacts when
you mouse over it and when you focus in
the search field it changes to a
different kind of look and feel it gets
a little darker it's very simple to
create graphics like this so that's what
we're going to do we're going to show
you how to go into a graphics editing
program and create graphics like this
there's also an example that develop PHP
up at the top here I have my own little
custom search bar okay so that's the
kind of thing we're gonna be making
custom search bar and really you can
make any field in your forms let's say
you have a sign up form you can do this
to your signup form fields okay you can
do this to your contact form fields in
HTML whatever you want you can really
get creative and design any type of form
field for user data intake okay so in
this first video we're going to design
the button and the field then in second
video we're gonna do the programming to
bring it all to life and it's all very
simple programming it's any anybody just
starting out could probably fathom all
of what we're gonna be doing now I'm
working in fireworks cs5 but it really
doesn't matter what graphics editing
tool you want to use you can be in
Photoshop Illustrator GIMP paint I don't
even care as long as you're good in that
program at doing what you so you can
render things correctly if you want to
use fireworks and follow my steps
exactly
cool - okay open up a new document in
your graphics editing software make it
whatever size you want to make it I'm
gonna make mine
twelve hundred by five hundred let me
bring up my little properties bar here
maybe I'll make my canvas just a little
lighter than that yours might start
white but if you want to follow my steps
exactly you can just make it a dark grey
like that now it's important to keep in
mind you can make these any size you
need them and then once we can get into
the programming part in the HTML and CSS
we Pat it to move the field around the
cursor to place it anywhere we need to
inside that field so I'm gonna start
anywhere I want to here and just draw
out a rectangle that is about that long
I'm gonna make it 24 actually I'll make
mine a little bit bigger maybe thirty
high and 250 wide now if you want those
tooltips like I do you can go to view
tool tips and then you'll see those
little numbers as you're dragging
ceiling any little numbers it's also
draw out another rectangle while we're
at it make that one the same height 30
and just make it 30 by 30 actually make
it a little wider than 30 make it about
36 by 30 but really you can make these
any size you want you can really
customize them to look any way you want
you can tell that the one that developed
PHP is nice and big and fat the one at
YouTube is really really small and
skinny alright so what I'm gonna do is
highlight this big one first I'm gonna
move it away from that other one I'm
gonna highlight that one and I'm gonna
give it a noun this let's take a look at
that
that looks perfect so it has a roundness
of 35 let's see if I round this out to
35 if it's kind of equal it might round
it more cuz it's smaller no that looks
about right okay so now what I'm gonna
do is grab out another rectangle shape a
little one and I'm gonna draw it over
here
over this guy so I can cut off his end
you see his curved end I'm gonna put a
rectangle over it and I'm gonna cut it
off and I'm also gonna put a rectangle
over this one and cut that off as well
so they both have flat ends okay and
I'll even make these different colors so
you guys can see what's going on real
well let's make them that pink or
whatever so I'm gonna highlight this one
this pink bar and this little guy over
here too
by holding shift as I highlight them and
then I'm gonna go to modify combine pads
and punch and then this one I'm gonna do
the same thing
highlight the pink bar then highlight
this orange bar and then I'm gonna go to
modify combine paths and punch okay with
this shape I light it let's change its
fill color to a grey like that now I'm
gonna give it an edge of a lighter grey
kind of like that
now I'm gonna highlight again and I'm
going to filters now I'm gonna give it
an inner shadow coming from the top and
right when you do that you can already
instantly see the emboss effect or the
inlaid effect that it has but let's go
in and make it a little more you know
not so blurred so it's a little tighter
in there so we can highlight that go to
the inner shadow make it something like
I don't know three and then bring this
down to two or one if you want and then
take a look at what you got now that
looks like a really smooth slick 3d
inlaid search field just like the one at
YouTube or develop PHP now you take this
and you slide it over right over the top
of that bright line and then you make
sure you can even zoom in by holding
ctrl you make sure that this guy is tall
enough to cover both of those lines this
and this you see mine is not tall enough
it needs to be two pixels higher so I'm
gonna go 32 on that all right now
everything matches up real nice I'm
gonna work on this button now I'm gonna
highlight it I'm gonna go to gradient
I'm gonna give it a linear gradient and
on the top we're gonna make it maybe
this color gray maybe even a little
darker like that and then total black on
the bottom and you can make yours
lighter any shade that you want it's
just fine now the rest is very simple
you just grab whatever you created there
by highlighting everything press ctrl-c
ctrl-v make another copy bring it down
just a little bit and this one you want
to make a little bit darker so I'm gonna
go to his fill color go into the color
palette and just drag it down to be
darker so that's what it's gonna look
like when the person focuses their mouse
in the field
now before it gets focused on you want
to have some text in here so you can
just type in holy crap that's huge let's
still pick one ten okay let's go down to
twelve maybe yeah twelve looks good and
don't make it so bright no not that dark
a little bit lighter than that yeah
let's go over right here okay now I'm
gonna type in search website then you
just move that into place where you want
it move it over just a touch right there
now what I'm gonna do is draw out a
doughnut so I'm gonna go into shapes
grab a doughnut and I'm gonna try my
best to mimic the one that YouTube has
it's just something like that
and then I can just take my pen tool and
go right about here - there - there -
right about there and then close off
that shape and then I'm highlight both
of them together and I'll go to modify
combine paths and I'll Union them this
time so I'll have one shape okay now I
can go ahead and shrink that down scale
it down put it where it's gonna go you
can zoom in by holding ctrl and then
mouse wheeling and then you can scale
some more that looks so good put it into
place
and then make that one a little bit
darker and then the one here we're gonna
make a little bit light so let's just
ctrl-c ctrl-v make a copy drag it down
once it looks like it's in place real
good you keep that one light and then
just make this one a little bit darker
very simple maybe a little darker than
that there you go now zoom out to a
hundred percent and that's what you got
you can make that any size any shape you
want so when the users mouse is nowhere
near this field it's gonna look like
this version on top and when the users
mouse goes into the field to start
typing this version of the graphics for
the field comes into play on the focus
event and when their mouse mouse is over
the
button here it's going to change to this
state alright so that's pretty much
everything we need and these are going
to be separate little pieces in our
graphics export so what we're gonna do
now is export each one of these four
pieces has its own little individual PNG
file so I'm going to press ctrl C with
that highlighted and then I'm going to
go to file new and in fireworks it'll
have the exact dimensions of what I have
in my clipboard already in the width and
height there so that's good but you
would set yours to those exact
dimensions for that shape so once in
what I'm gonna do is go to canvas no
canvas color so we have no background
and then we just paste that right in
make sure everything is fit into the
canvas well okay and then we file export
wizard continue continue and then exit
and then you go to PNG up here 30 to
make sure your mat is none and then I
make sure you have PNG selected here
before you press export and you'll know
by what's set here so you export and now
I'm just gonna make a folder on my
desktop so let's go to desktop new
folder let's call it my website doesn't
matter now I'll double click inside of
it and let's see I'll just put
everything actually I'll lay it out like
it was your website you would have an
images folder in your website directory
right just like you have your style
folder and all that stuff images folder
let's put them all in there so you put
them all in your images folder for your
website all of these graphics that we're
creating right now and we're gonna name
this one s be norm it's search actually
search field so SF norm that stands
research field normal it's in its normal
state save so now you have a PNG with no
background for the normal state of your
field now what you're gonna do is the
same exact process for these other three
items okay you see what I'm exporting
now it's the dark version of that
so I'm gonna call it SF lit even though
it is darker all right let's call it
focus that makes more sense
SF focus because that's actually the
HTML event attribute that we're going to
access to change it so let's press save
now that one's in there now I've got my
little button here and I removed those
fields and I can just go down a fit
canvas and it'll be a nice perfect snug
fit and I go to file export same thing
continue continue exit PNG 32 matte none
make sure we're on PNG export and let's
call this SB 4 search button norm save
let's remove that one control X let's go
over here and grab this one ctrl C and
put it right there into place make sure
we fit canvas to make sure it's all nice
and snug in the canvas and file export
continue continue exit PNG 32 Nomad
export and then this one SB over we're
gonna call it over because we're gonna
be accessing the HTML mouse over event
the on mouse over save okay in this I
don't need to save that file at all and
this file you'll definitely want to save
this one you're working on with your raw
graphics you want to save this as my
search build raw graphics PNG so it's an
editable PNG or whatever graphics
software you're in if you're in
Photoshop Illustrator save your RAW
files so you can do changes later if you
need to ok so if you want to see how I
bring these graphic elements to life
using HTML CSS and JavaScript to make it
just like develop PHP s or like
YouTube's or whatever or like anybody
else's we'll be covering that in the
very next video for this one we showed
you how to make all the graphics the
next one will show you how to program
these things to bring it all to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
