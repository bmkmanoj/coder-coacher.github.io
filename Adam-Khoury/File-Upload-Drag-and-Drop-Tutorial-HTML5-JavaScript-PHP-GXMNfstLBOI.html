here once again with another programming
tutorial for you after we did the first
drag and drop tutorial many of you
expressed that you would like to learn
more on that topic so in this
programming exercise you can gain
insight into building file upload
applications with popular drag and drop
features like YouTube Facebook and other
highly successful websites offer along
with the regular file upload mechanisms
it's very easy to do with the new html5
drag and drop features using JavaScript
and it's all vanilla JavaScript and PHP
code so you don't need to use any
third-party frameworks or any bulky
libraries and I also get to introduce
you to David Correy our brand new
bouncing baby boy
it's pretty simple to integrate this
functionality directly into your
existing file upload forms where you
might offer a progress bar using Ajax in
PHP and we have the file upload progress
bar meter tutorial with Ajax in PHP
already existing at the site and I'm
going to link you guys to that that way
you can go ahead and integrate this kind
of functionality into that sort of
script and I'll give you some tips for
doing so so you can fire up your
favorite code editor and the code editor
is unimportant because we're not using
any special features that any specific
code editor offers so you can even be a
notepad wouldn't matter and I'm also
going to offer you the code and that'll
be linked in the description of the
video that way you can get to the code
that we use in this video you can also
watch the previous video because that's
pretty important to watch the previous
video because you'll get more insight
into the drag-and-drop functionality and
I'm also going to link you to the file
upload progress bar meter tutorial with
Ajax in PHP and that way you have
something to integrate this kind of
functionality into and we're going to
start with this very basic code you can
see we have a little bit of styling for
the drop zone and then we have a
function in JavaScript called drag drop
and we're referencing the event as an
argument going into that function then
down on the page we simply have the div
that is the drop zone now we're using
the drop event and the drag over event
and in the drag over event all we're
doing is setting return false that way
nothing at all occurs in the drag over
event then in the drop of nth we're
running that function drag drop and
we're passing the event as an argument
okay so the first line inside of the
drag drop function is we're going to
event dot prevent default we run the
prevent default method on the event and
this I'm putting in place just to
prevent any weird default behavior that
may arise in specific browsers because
we want full control over what happens
now the very next line I'm going to
introduce you to the files property of
the data transfer
object and we discussed the data
transfer object more in the first
tutorial but we didn't show the files
property and what the files property
does it gives you a list of all the
files that are associated in the
drag-and-drop operation so what we're
going to do is alert the event data
transfer dot files and we're accessing
the first file in the list and normally
it would just be one file that you're
allowing users to upload when they drop
it into the drop zone if you want me to
show you what I'm talking about at
Facebook when you drag a file from your
computer and it can be a video file an
audio file upload form that you have or
just image files whatever what we're
building here will allow dragging of
videos audio images and any type of file
really so I'll drag this image and you
see how Facebook
it changes the little post area to a
drop zone and actually while I have this
open I want to show you the URL to my
new page this is the new page that I'll
be using at Facebook to keep people
updated on Facebook about the new
tutorials that we produced and this is a
a public figure page for teacher and the
URL is facebook.com forward slash Adam
quarry teacher so that's how you can
find me on Facebook on the new page
where I'll be posting all of my
tutorials now once the user drops the
file into the drop zone you have access
to the file using event data transfer
dot files and we're accessing the first
index in the files list basically this
is the file object so on the next line
what I'm going to do I'm going to show
you how to access the name of the file
so we'll just alert or you can console
dot log the event data transfer files
dot name property and that will give you
the name of the file and in this case we
have my files
father and son jpg so it'll alert father
and son JPEG then in the very next line
we're showing you how to access the side
is the amount of bytes that that file is
and then I'm simply going to write a
note here for you this is where to begin
uploading the file with Ajax and upload
progress bar to PHP script and here's a
link for the tutorial but don't worry
I'm going to put that link in the
description of this video and it's also
going to be at the page on develop PHP
comm where all of this code example
resides so I'm going to go ahead and
give this a test in my browser and see
what happens let me get that image so
here is my computer and here would be my
simulated web page online I grab the
image and just drag it into the drop
zone so the first alert shows us that we
have access to an object that is the
file to be uploaded then the next alert
was the file name which was father and
son JPEG and then the next alert is how
many bytes the file is so you have
access to the name the bytes and other
information before the file even uploads
now all I have to do is lead you to this
file upload progress bar meter tutorial
with Ajax and PHP and then you'll be on
your way to integrating this drag and
drop file upload functionality into your
existing file upload forms and if you
don't happen to know how to upload a
file with Ajax yet you can learn it with
this tutorial that I'm about to show you
right now so if I go to develop PHP comm
and you can just type in here file
upload into the search bar and it will
come up its third one the file upload
progress bar meter tutorial Ajax PHP if
you click that you'll see that in the
JavaScript videos under Ajax programming
that's where that tutorial lives and in
this tutorial we showed how to build a
file upload progress bar feature and
we're using Ajax to send the file data
to a PHP script and read the files
upload progress as it's uploading so if
your upload
or if you're allowing your users to
upload very large video files or audio
files this is a perfect mechanism for
that and even when people are uploading
images nowadays a lot of the more elite
websites will give a progress bar to the
user that's uploading those images so
here in this tutorial you can go ahead
and watch the video take the code and
here's all the JavaScript for handling
the file upload via Ajax and PHP and
here's the PHP script that actually
uploads the file to your server and puts
it in whatever folder you want now I
already tested this drag-and-drop
functionality I integrated it into this
tutorials code but what I did was I went
under the abort handler function and I
just put one more function in that was
the drag drop function and in that
function I just set another ajax request
to upload the file I was just doing it
as a test but it would make more sense
to use the same upload file function and
then you can pass the file or the event
to the upload file function and you
would just have to change this upload
file function a little bit if you want
to pass the event into this function
directly as an argument and then you can
evaluate if the event
data transfer object is available and
you can make some if conditions within
that function but I'll leave that up to
you
that could be your homework but I
already tested it on my own live
webserver and it took the file that I
dragged into the drop zone and it just
uploaded it and it had the progress bar
and everything it was beautiful
so I hope that gives you some insight on
how you can start allowing your users to
just drag files from their computer and
any folders directly onto an area of
your web page and your webpage will just
suck it up and upload it to the server
automatically so I just want to
reiterate one more time the event that
data transfer files property you access
the first file within that list by
putting a 0 between square brackets here
that gives you access to the file in
question then you can do anything that
you've ever done with it before using
javascript because that is a file object
okay I hope you've enjoyed this exercise
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
