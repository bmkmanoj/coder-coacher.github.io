Swift 3d version 6 tutorial and I just
wanted to point out for because maybe
some people might have questions and say
why is Adam so gung-ho on swift 3d I'll
show you one reason right here is Adam
Cory comm and this whole site was pretty
much designed the whole thing was
designed in Swift 3d all these
animations and what's so cool about
Swift 3d is that it allows you to put
your custom animations inside of flash
and then you can have people control
those things you see it's very very cool
and even though I know I need to update
this site but I built it in just a
couple of hours in Swift 3d and I was
able to get a really cool effects out of
it and a really nice design now this one
we're going to be dealing with some text
because text is one of the coolest
features I think in Swift 3d for making
logos and doing a lot of cool things
that your clients will really dig now
the first thing you'll want to know is
how to make your text look good I'll
show you some little tips and tricks for
things you can do to your text that not
many people pick up on right away when
they open to a 3d because it takes some
experimentation so let's click the text
and you'll see it throws the word text
into the view pane there I'm going to
change that to say fresh then I'm going
to change the font any font you have in
your list will show up here most any
fonts will show up here I'm gonna go to
that jungle life I like that one right
there okay so now I'm gonna press alt
and the right mouse key push back a
little bit and now you can see it looks
kind of beat-up like that so you really
want to doctor it up a little bit so
we'll go to bevels and let's put an
outer round bevel on it
take that point zero five and make it
point zero two there we go see that
cleans it up just a little bit get the
smoothness all the way up and the mesh
quality all the way up now if you take
some materials say we took a reflective
color any color green we put it on the
face there you'll see it puts it on the
back and the front so if we look at it
from the back now it's green on the back
and it's just dark over here because
there's no lights hitting it back there
it's green the same color green is on
the back and the front now we can take a
different color or maybe a lighter green
and put it on the bevel itself and then
you can put another color on the edge so
if you look at it from the left again
you'll see that edge has a green on it
too now but if you wanted to you notice
that when I dragged materials onto the
whole word or when I drag the material
onto any letter the whole word color
changes if you wanted to have each
letter be its own individual thing if
you tried to go up here to arrange and
ungroup it you can't because it's really
just one thing but if you go here to the
text 2 characters tool you click that
then you have your individual characters
where you can then put different colors
on different letters you see there and
change it up any way you need to all
right so let's say I take that let's get
some purple on the inside too okay so
say I take that and now I want to
animate each piece I could simply go to
arrange ungroup and now I could spin the
whole thing around or I can choose to
and and let me mention real quick that
when you export these things the
background isn't there that gray
background isn't there so if I took the
into Photoshop or fireworks or flash
it's just going to be the model itself
the pieces that make up the model and no
background so you can put glow effects
on them in those various programs and
then do things further in those programs
so let's take these and animate them
let's go to animations and let's make
them just rock back and forth
let's go down here to this one give it
that one that one and that one now for
the others I'm going to put a totally
different animation on that would be the
s and the R so actually let me get those
colored differently there let's animate
click the frame rate up to maybe 17 or
18 and let's turn the animation off
actually this press ctrl-a and rotate
everything now let's go to preview and
export generate all frames so see there
you can achieve some really cool things
in a really short amount of time and
there's a whole lot more you can do with
text and here's one last little thing
I'll show you about the text if I
highlight any of these and I want to
edit those in the extrusion editor or
the you can always edit them in the
advance modeler but I'm going to go into
the extrusion editor let's see if I
highlight that one go to extrusion
editor it doesn't show up so if I want
to edit that with the extrusion editor
to make an animation on the points and
everything make it kind of bulge or do
whatever I wanted to do I can go to
right here text to paths so if I click
that with that letter highlighted or you
can do it with the whole word if the
whole word is connected you can do them
individually piece by piece and go to
the extrusion editor and you see there's
that F move this out the way
so if I go to animate right now it's
going to animate just this so I can go
out to maybe frame I don't know maybe
frame 10 I'm going to take this dot and
I'm going to move it just that dot one
pixel up then I'm going to go out to
frame 20 move just that dot one pixel
back down I'm going to go back to the
middle frame there on ten I'm going to
bring this all the way up so it kind of
bulges let's make this go out here let's
go way out here make this go down a
little bit let's make this go over here
okay now let's press animate again go
back into the scene editor you'll see
you have something different going on
with that one you see how the F is
bulging all by itself
so even if those other animations
weren't on it you could make that bulge
happen now think how cool it would be if
you tie this word to a sound amplitude
mp3 player and flash because all of this
can go straight into flash as a movie
clip and you tie your amplitude to the
word and as the beat pumps your word
goes boom boom boom boom to the beat of
the music come on this is why this is
handy maybe not many people just have
the vision to come up with these things
but you got to if you want to do you
want to do good make money want to be
some of the best designers making the
best programmatic things so now let's go
into the preview and exporter actually
let's tilt that in control a tilt it
this way this time so we can see that F
real good doing its thing let's move the
seam right there let's go to preview and
export rest or generate all frames and
now when we press play you'll notice you
see what the f is doing it's kind of
pulsating like the other ones aren't
because I gave it a custom extrusion
animation so those are some things
dealing with the text
not many beginners pick up on right away
and it takes you a little bit of
experimentation and maybe some reading
if you have the manual or whatever okay
we'll see you in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
