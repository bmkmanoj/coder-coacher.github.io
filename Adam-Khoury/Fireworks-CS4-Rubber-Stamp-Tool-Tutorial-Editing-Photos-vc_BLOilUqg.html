stains in the driveway here using the
rubber stamp tool in fireworks cs4 so
let's grab the rubber stamp tool and if
you click down on this tool you'll see
three options if you click and hold grab
the rubber stamp and now there's two
options down here one is source align
and the other is use entire document I'm
just going to select the use entire
document for this little example I'm
going to show you another example using
source aligns in a second so now I have
my opacity for the rubber stamp to be
about 90 in somewhere 90 right in that
range you can put it at 100% whatever
you need you can adjust these settings
the feathered edge I want it all the way
up and the size I want all the way up
because my picture is very large okay so
the resolution is very big I'm only a
25% here okay so I'm going to click down
in the region that I want to put into my
rubber stamp you see my little target
reticule here it's going a nice clear
area that you want to copy through there
click down and what it did it's going to
take that circle that area in that
circle and use in the rubber stamp so
when I move this circle away anywhere I
click down now it's going to use the
stamp to place that imagery or those
pixels on that region where you click so
let's click down and I'll show you what
I mean let's get these dark spots here
see I click down and they begin to
disappear and it's just like displacing
pixels from one spot that looks okay to
another spot that doesn't look so okay
and you can click and hold and drag and
it's like a paintbrush almost and you
can see how the reticule snaps back each
time if you're using the use entire
document setting so it's very Photoshop
II and Photoshop isn't the only
program that can edit photos nicely and
render them out as TIF files for
printing whatever whatever you need it
exports as any kind of file if you use
the export wizard you can get any kind
of file you need so you can see how that
little area is gone so I'm going to do
the rest real quick not on video because
it would you know it's just wasting your
time you already know how to do it
because I just showed you and now let me
get that the rest of this is done real
quick and then we'll continue and I'll
show you how to use the source aline
method okay so as you can see we have
easily and effectively cleaned the
driveway and now i'm going to show you
the other method using the stamp the
rubber stamp tool let's highlight that
grab it and you can use source aligned
instead of using entire document and
let's get this all the way up to 100
edge all the way up opacity all the way
up okay so what i want to do is take
this line see this line sitting right
here and put a third line going through
here like this right in between these
two white lines and i'm going to use
this as my well you can use wherever you
drag your mouse basically that's what
it's going to use so let's click down
here and now if i go right here let's
say right about there and i'm gonna drag
along actually let's zoom in a little so
you can see it better not too much i'm
gonna drag along here
right there and just make sure my little
crosshair my little blue cross says up
there stay on that white line and I'm
golden it's just gonna copy a ride on
through there so photoshop's not the
only very useful program for
manipulating photos I hope you know
everybody underestimates fireworks and
never really digs around to see what it
can do look at that say we have another
painted line in there let's go ahead and
finish it up
there you go if you wanted to have
another one that was let's get the stamp
on there again let's stamp this one
right here another line that was right
here say just go right there you just
click down with the target and then you
start to drag where you want it and
that's how it works okay
so utilize your rubber stamp tool for
doctoring up images if you need to
because fireworks is a really easy cool
program to work in
okie-dokie is you see a nice clean
driveway now with new painted lines
magic all right see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
