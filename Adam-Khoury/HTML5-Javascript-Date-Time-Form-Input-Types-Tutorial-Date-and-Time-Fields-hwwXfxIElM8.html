JavaScript lesson we will demonstrate
usage of the new date and time form
input types as well as tying them to
JavaScript for your Ajax processing
needs this is the finished product of
what we will achieve in this video
lesson so if the user clicks in the date
field you're going to get a nice
calendar pop up that they can choose
their date from very easily then go
through the months and the years and
choose the exact date they need for
daytime local is a similar type thing
but it adds the time to the value that
would get passed through your form and
daytime is similar to daytime local but
it adds UTC and you also have a month
selector so when they go down into the
interface and they go through the months
they can select the whole month so it's
2012 the 4th month if I was to pick May
that's the fifth month so that's the
value that gets passed to your form then
we have just the standalone time
selector and then we have a week
selector so you can go through the
months of any year and grab a whole week
and then they can pass that through the
form if you want to allow the user to
select whole weeks at a time then when
we press submit
we process all of those values using
JavaScript and you can use Ajax to pass
these values to PHP and save them in a
MySQL database or whatever and I'm going
to give you guys links to a reference to
a nice Ajax post tutorial that is
integrated with a PHP script already so
you can see each of the values for those
six fields are listed right here and
that's what get passed through your form
processing let's once again begin with
the basic structure of an html5 web page
and build our tiny little application
let's go under that h2 tag which just is
a header and I'm going to type in date
colon space and I'm going to put an
input tag and the input type is going to
be date the name is going to be equal to
field 1 as well as the ID attribute
field 1 this way when you process your
form with PHP the normal way without
Ajax you can pick up the variable value
of that field using the name attribute
in the post variables and if you're
using Ajax actually you can also pick up
this value using JavaScript using the
name because you can get element by ID
using JavaScript or you can get element
by name but I'm just throwing them both
in there so it'll be a little more
versatile for you guys now I'll close
off this input tag and I'll add a couple
of break tags let's make sure we put in
the closing slash there for the break
tight okay okay now if I save this file
and I go up to file preview and browser
let's preview this in opera because
opera is going to render this thing the
best the other browsers you might
attempt to use to render this with might
not display it yet but come 2014 all
browsers should display because html5
would be a web standard so you have to
pick the browsers that you're going to
test these scripts with as you're
developing with them before 2014 comes
because before 2014 comes some browsers
just won't render it the way you think
it should and you won't see the new
magic of html5 at all okay so the
browsers that you test these things with
it's very important at this point in
time okay okay
okay now that that thing is rendering
correctly I'm going to add five more
fields that are going to be similar for
in taking date and time much like the
demonstration that we had in the
beginning that shows you the finished
product of what you were going to be
creating so what we'll do is just name
this one field2 field3
feel for fill 5 bill 6 same over here
field2 field3 field 4 field 5 field 6
all you have to do is change the type
this one is date time - local this one
is date time and that would be the UTC
version then we have the month selector
for allowing the user to select a month
then we have then we have the time
selector and then we also have the week
selector to allow the user to select a
week from that little calendar that
helps at bay you can just change the
labels of these here to correspond with
those so here you can just put week so
on and so forth as you go up ok so now
we have all our fields in place and they
have a proper name and ID attribute for
each one and we give them the proper
type attribute which is the most
important part of what we're doing
now now the last thing in the HTML that
we're going to add is a button now what
this button is going to do you can see
this is the button type of input so that
will render a button on the screen and
what it's going to do is in the on click
event of that button when the user
clicks it we're going to run a
JavaScript function called process data
which I'm going to write right now in
just a second and I'll show you what
that is comprised of so on click we
process data for each of these six
fields so we can send all of these
fields that we desire as arguments
through that function and that function
will process all those fields get the
values and we can post to Ajax or we can
just post the form have the form be
submit after we check all of those
fields and validate things whatever
processes you want to run in JavaScript
I'll just show you how to access those
values in JavaScript so you have them to
play with okay let's go up into the head
tag and apply our JavaScript for the
page it will open a script tag and close
it right here
now we'll construct a simple function
that will pick up all of those values
when the user clicks the submit button
down there so we have function process
data remember that's the same name is
the function in the on click event so
this function executes when this button
is clicked and you see these fields
these six fields they get picked up as
arguments to the function right here so
f1 f2 all the way through f6 you can
access those fields and values within
those fields using JavaScript okay let's
add the lines that pick up those field
values and put them in a variable name
that we can more easily use within our
script you see there we have our v1
through v6 so value 1 through value 6
and we get those values by saying Bar V
1 is equal to document dot get element
by ID F 1 which is this first argument
which is essentially field 1 and you do
that for all six so you have the values
packed up into nice little variables
right there that you can then write and
alert to yourself to see those values so
let's pop that alert in right here and I
also added a couple of code comments for
you guys there you can see how we're
using alert in JavaScript to pop up a
little window that just for testing
purposes is going to show you the values
of all the
fields and the backslash-n is gives you
line break in your little pop-up
dialogue that comes up in JavaScript now
the code comments are you can use Ajax
in PHP to send the values to your server
storage mechanisms like if you're using
MySQL or maybe a flat file storage
mechanism you can send these values to
that to process the form using Ajax
which is a more modern technique of form
processing and if you need an ajax with
PHP integrated video tutorial you can go
to develop PHP comm this link right here
or you can probably just go into the
search bar develop PHP comm and type in
Ajax tutorial and I know it's definitely
sitting in the JavaScript video tutorial
section of develop PHP so if I might
develop PHP and I go down to the video
tutorials sections JavaScript and jQuery
it's right in there see
Ajax posts a PHP file if you need to
learn Ajax in PHP communication there
you go right there
okay let's see what we got let's go
ahead and save this ctrl s and file
preview and browser opera but I can
select all these dates or whatever fill
in all of these fields and then submit
and then there's all the values within
JavaScript ready to go for your form
processing if you want to use Ajax and
if you just want to use regular form
type mechanism you put a form tag in
here opening and closing form tag make
sure you supply it with the action
attribute to your PHP script that's
going to process all the data and then
that way you can process all this
information in normal old form type sort
scenario without Ajax but if you want to
use Ajax I got it all set up for you
right there go
okay so we hope you enjoyed that lesson
and we have a few more along these lines
of form input mechanisms and controls
selectors and things like that coming up
real soon
I'm gonna do a few today actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
