this tutorial we're going to be showing
how to use html5 and JavaScript to
create slider interfaces so instead of
having people type in numbers or values
you can put a slider on the page it
might be a better choice of interface
for you who knows and here's the
finished product of the application that
we programmed in the video lesson so you
can see we have a nice slider we're
listening for the values and showing the
status of what the values are of the
slider as it has changed and that value
can be sent to PHP using Ajax and then
you can put that value wherever you want
in MySQL database or the text file
database whatever you got going we will
begin with the basic foundation of an
html5 web document and write some code
to add the slider interface to our page
as well as tie it to JavaScript for our
application programming needs keep in
mind that 2014 is the release date for
html5 when it goes standard and it does
not work in all browsers yet I test my
html5 scripts in Google Chrome usually
but you can choose any browser that
currently supports html5 tag use and the
first thing we'll do is add the slider
to the page so let's go into the body
tag we're going to add the input tag
because using the input tag in html5 is
how we add the slider we just use a
different type so when you select type
instead of text like it normally is
we're going to type in range the minimum
value for the range is zero so you can
just type the zero and put a space and
type in the max the max is going to be
equal to 100 in this case you can have a
minimum of 0 and a max of 20 if you want
the next one is going to be value what
is the default value that's going to be
showing by default and I'm going to have
it set to 50 so my slider knob will be
directly in the center of the of the
slider control then you set this step
this step is equal to so in my case I'll
set it to 10 you can set it to 1 5 10
whatever you want now the last thing
we'll do is use the on change event so
whenever it is changed so somebody picks
up the slider and they move it to a
different value that is when this event
will
I are and we're going to execute some
JavaScript we're going to call the
JavaScript function that's going to fire
up slider change because that makes good
sense and between parentheses we're
going to type in this dot value and that
is how you pick up the value of what the
user changed your slider to this dot
value picks that up then you can just go
ahead and close off your input tag then
we'll go down one line and put in a
couple of break tags and to make them
validate you got to put in the closing
slash there on your break tags now if I
press ctrl s to save this right now and
then I press f12 in Dreamweaver to
render it in a browser and mine is set
to the Google Chrome by default you can
see it has a slider on the page that I
can move and you can see it increments
by 10 because of the step that we set to
10 here now we're going to add something
that's going to help us see the value
just for testing purposes like a little
status of where the slider value is so
let's type in here slider value equals
and then a span tag so you type in your
span tag we're going to give it an ID
equal to slider status we close the
opening span tag and the closing span
tag put in place and the value by
default was 50 remember I put a value a
default value of 50 so we'll add that
there then if you run this in the
browser by pressing f12 you'll see that
it says slider value equals 50 but when
you grab the slider and change it it
doesn't affect that so let's make it
affect that using JavaScript now go into
the head tag of your document and you
type in your script opening tag and your
script closing tag and in between those
is where you type in the JavaScript
function so let's type in function and
grab the name of that function called
slider change function space slider
change open closed parenthesis open your
curly brace and go down a couple of
lines and close off your curly bracket
there are your curly brace then here
we're going to put Val and Val is just
going to be a very of
name that we're going to assign for this
value of the slider so when on change of
this slider it's going to send the value
of the slider that the user changed it
to to this function called slider change
and that vowel that word vowel right
there is a variable that's going to hold
that value and that's how we can access
that value within this function right
now so now we're going to add a line
that targets this span tag right here
with the ID of slider status we're going
to make it change to whatever the new
value is of the slider when the user
changes it document dot get element by
ID we target the slider status tag here
and we affect its inner HTML property
and we give the inner HTML a value of
whatever thou hold'st at that time
whenever the user changes it so now
let's press ctrl s press f12 run it in
the browser and let's change this thing
see what we have now now we have an
actual application using javascript and
html5 to enable the slider so what you
would want to do here is really this is
just an example to show you how to get
that value and listen for it status but
you would want to use Ajax post to send
the adjusted value to PHP or MySQL
storage that way you can store the value
of what the user changed it to so let's
press ctrl s press f12 so if I'm the
user and I'm on your site using your
application or whatever and I change
this value to my new desired value right
when I change it you can have it update
something in your database or whatever
using Ajax if you need an ajax tutorial
there's a nice Ajax programming tutorial
using raw JavaScript at develop PHP com
in the JavaScript video tutorial section
so remember you can set your minimum and
maximum values here and then the default
value using the value attribute and then
you set your steps so if I was to set
the
- - I would have a lot more steps to my
slider okay okay so this has been a
video tutorial brought to you by develop
PHP calm and my name is Adam I'll talk
to you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
