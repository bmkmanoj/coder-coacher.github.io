with another short training series for
up-and-coming web programmers in this
video lesson series you'll be learning
how to create your own custom WYSIWYG
rich text editor that you can apply to
all of your custom PHP and MySQL web
applications WYSIWYG stands for what you
see is what you get and applying a rich
text editor allows your users to format
the text using HTML and JavaScript in
this case and for any of you guys that
would like to know how to do this using
flash and ActionScript 3 we already made
that lesson a couple of years ago and
you can click here on screen right now
to view that lesson series if you'd
rather see how this is done using flash
and actionscript 3.0 this will be a very
short training series in JavaScript as
the method we use makes things very easy
for us and we'll discuss programming it
some design tips and some PHP parsing
tips after we get the thing built now
this content will no doubt anger many
want to be super dorks out there who get
mad because my code is so funky fresh
and the way I teach is so simplistic so
I had my friend Tupac record a message
just for them in their comments if I may
I'll play it now as a preemptive
rebuttal to their comments y'all niggas
ain't even on my level I'm at my little
homies ok before we start getting our
hands dirty with the code I want to show
you guys the finished product of what
your going to be learning how to
assemble throughout this series what I
have here is one text field and then I
have a text area here you can see in my
title field I can put whatever I want my
title to be there then here I can type
some text now let's make these last few
words bold let's change the text size to
5 and let's change the text color to
teal and let's also add links right here
let's add one link I want that to go to
www.petland.com
text color adding horizontal rule you
can add
ordered lists and unordered lists as
well yeah links and images now there's
more you can do with the WYSIWYG but for
this tutorial series that's as far as
we're going to go with it and there are
also nicer formats for allowing people
to choose color or size and things like
that but I just made it very simple
using prompts you see this prompt window
that tells you how to apply a
hexadecimal color or you can type in any
color that you like
I felt that gave the people who are
going to be using mind more freedom over
what kind of colors they can apply you
can see I made this teal just by typing
in teal let's say I want to make this
one silver that selection is now silver
see now let's press submit data and you
can see here you posted and this is the
PHP script that's the parse file it
shows the title that we posted and all
of the data within that text area now
let's make sure you guys know that this
also works I'm in Firefox right now
let's show you that it also works in
Internet Explorer and Chrome and let's
press submit data
let's try Internet Explorer change the
color of that to turquoise and let's
change its size to two okay it's going
to become smaller see submit data and
there you go so it's formatted and it
also has tags in it now which are HTML
tags helping that keep that format okay
so that's how it all works now you've
seen it working in Internet Explorer
Chrome and Firefox and most other
popular browsers that are out on the
market today they use a derivative of
those engines anyway so once it works in
Firefox Internet Explorer and Chrome you
can rest assured that it's going to work
in most others ok we're going to start
off with a very basic simulated project
that might reflect something that you
have going on your server where you have
an HTML form with just a couple of input
fields and a text area and I just have
one input field here that's for the
title you can see it's name is title and
it's ID is title and then my text area
is setup right here and that's where the
end
body it's name is my textarea it's ID my
textarea all right very basic stuff that
anybody could use Dreamweaver to just
pop out these fields or whatever it's a
very basic application that parses to a
PHP script called my parse wild PHP so
this is what it looks like and when the
person presses submit it's going to
parse to this PHP file right here which
is setup very basic at this point in the
game there's no filtering or anything
going on we just want to see what the
person posted to make sure that things
are working correctly at first so I'm
just echoing out you posted the post
data title and the post data my text
area so you can see this is what I have
here is a very basic working application
and we're just going to add to this and
expand upon it that way you guys can
take your existing applications and
apply these WYSIWYG techniques to them
and in this first video we're going to
focus on this index page or really the
page where your form lives where the
user is filling out the form and
composing the text and everything now
the first thing we're going to do is go
into the head tag of the document and
we're going to apply a JavaScript file
it's going to be an external javascript
file it's going to hold all of the
functionality for your WYSIWYG that way
this page doesn't get bogged down with a
lot of code in it when you can
externalize things and make it a lot
neater so most of the JavaScript that we
create for this application is going to
be within a folder called WYSIWYG in a
file called WYSIWYG j/s a JavaScript
file which we have not even created yet
we're just getting ready to link to it
now the next thing to do is add to the
body tag on load equals iframe on and
that's a function that's going to be
within that WYSIWYG dot J's file a
function named iframe on is going to be
within that WYSIWYG file that we put up
and that's going to be for the iframe
that we apply to replace this text area
okay and it's going to initialize it to
be in design mode when the document is
fully loaded now let's take our target
text area and let's get it all separate
by itself there what we're going to do
is underneath that we're going to place
in an iframe it's name is rich text
field its ID is equal to rich text
as well and you can see I have some
styling which is inline CSS which you
can choose to make your CSS styling
external or put it in the head of your
document I just have it in line for
simplicity but maybe in the end when you
want to neaten things up and externalize
all files you'll put this CSS for this
iframe within an external CSS file
whatever but you can use inline styling
if you like
now let's pop in a comment here that
says hide but keep your normal text area
and place the iframe replacement for it
so you can see I already replaced the
iframe replacement for the text area now
let's make sure we hide it and we can do
that simply by saying text area space
style display:none so I'm using some
more inline CSS styling here to make
this text area not display at all in the
page this text area is really just going
to be for transferring this rich text
fields data into when the form is
finished and submitted so when the
person presses submit that's when you
take the HTML the inner HTML from this
iframe and you place it within this text
area and then that process is to PHP
let's close off that comment so you can
see with the one line and a little bit
of CSS styling you can totally replace
your text area with an iframe that's
going to be our rich text field now we
don't want the form to just parse to the
my parse file dot PHP
when this submit button is pressed so
we're going to replace that submit
button the normal submit type button
with a type of button let's not submit
but it still looks like a button and
what it's going to do is on click of
that button it's going to run a
JavaScript function within our WYSIWYG
J's file called submit form so you can
just remove this button and replace it
with that one so like I said you don't
want the form to actually parse to the
PHP file without JavaScript being
involved in this case so we're going to
put a button there that's not a submit
type it's just a regular button type
this can actually also be a link who's
on click event can be to fire off this
JavaScript function called submit form
now let's see what we have in design
view here that's good we have an iframe
that's going to be content editable now
what we want right above that iframe is
like a control bar that's going to hold
the little bold button italics button
the button for making links etc it's
going to be like your WYSIWYG control
panel for formatting things so right
under entry body let's add a space pop
here insuline 10 a div with some buttons
in it
regular little HTML form buttons so you
can see here is my div that I just
placed in and it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 buttons you can see what they're
going to do this button is going to be
bolding things this button is going to
be for underlining this one is going to
run a function called I italic this
one's going to run a function called I
font size so on and so forth all these
buttons are set on click to run a
JavaScript function that's going to be
all within our WYSIWYG KS file so now if
you go into design view after putting in
that div that holds your little control
buttons you'll see this and let's make
sure we put a line break here before the
submit data button where's that right
here let's put a break that way it goes
under there let's put two breaks press
ctrl s to save okay so that wraps up the
functionality we need on our page that
holds the form in the next video we're
going to create this WYSIWYG KS file
which is going to hold our I bowls and I
underline and all these little functions
here and also the function that we're
going to need to submit the form and the
function for iframe on which turns this
iframe into content editable or design
mode on okay so stay tuned for part two
and you'll see that this WYSIWYG that J
s is all so simple you guys won't have
any problem comprehending what's going
on inside of that file and then the last
thing we'll do in the third video I
guess is we'll discuss taking that
posted data from the text area and make
sure we talk about replacing the HTML
characters to HTML entities will talk
about filtering and stripping things and
making sure it's safe to put in a
database and also display and trust that
data to display upon your website all
right so the next part is creating the
WYSIWYG
jas file which holds all of the
functions that are defined on this HTML
page or in this form and we're going to
be using javascript to actually submit
the form this button is just going to be
a firewall a function called submit form
within that function submit form is
going to be a line of code that's going
to actually submit the form after we
take this rich text field out of the
iframe data the inner HTML text and put
it into this text area that way you can
be easily transferred right along with
all the other fields in this form all
right so we'll see you in part two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
