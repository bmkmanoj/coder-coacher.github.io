the parameters for creating radial
gradient and repeating radial gradient
backgrounds for HTML elements we will
start again with the bare bones of an
html5 web document and in my head
element I'm going to start a style
element I'll make its type text/css make
sure I go down a couple of lines and
close that style element and just like
in our linear gradient tutorial we're
going to add nine div elements to the
body and they each have a different
class gradient 1 through gradient 9 now
let's quickly add a CSS rule that's
going to affect all nine of these divs
by targeting the div element in CSS so
this will style up these divs in this
manner it will make them float:left have
a width of 32% across the screen the way
three boxes will fit in the browser
window no matter how wide the browser
window is each box will have a height of
125 pixels margin of 4 pixels the font
color will be white and the font size
will be 30 pixels in the background for
each of those boxes will be a light gray
until we give them a gradient background
so what we can do is just collapse that
and get it out of the way ok on the next
line down you can place this comment in
for yourself you place the radial
gradients in text and then as a reminder
to yourself you can place these
parameters in this order position shape
or size and then color stops that's
where you put all of your colors and
your stops separated by comma and in
front of all your colors you put the
shape and your size and if you want to
specify a position that goes before your
shape and size so it goes position shape
or size and color stops that's the
easiest way to think about it I think
and there's also some keywords that
we'll be talking about for position that
we're not going to be using until the
radial gradient syntax is standardized
in all browsers while we're using the
prefixes we're not going to use any of
those keywords but we can just use
numbers and the bottom left top right
and all of those keywords to put the
gradient to start the gradient where we
need it to be
now let's target this first box gradient
one will type in div dot
divided into class gradient one open
curly brace close curly brace will
designate the background property and
this is where you would put your radial
gradient syntax right there and then put
semicolon now let's just remove those
things in between the parentheses and
let's talk about the prefixes for all
the different browsers since I'm going
to be testing in Google Chrome I'm going
to use the WebKit prefix which is also
the prefix that you use for Safari if
you're testing in Internet Explorer you
put MS here if you're testing an opera
you put au there and if you're testing
in Mozilla Firefox you put Mose and then
after we get done with our examples
we're going to add all of the prefixes
so it works in all browsers but pretty
soon like we mentioned in the other
video you're going to be able to use
radial gradient syntax like this without
any of the prefixes and some browsers
will render this just like it is like
that but I'd recommend that you use the
prefixes for just a little while longer
that way you can be sure it works in all
of the browsers okay so let's get our
WebKit prefix back and in the parameters
in between the parentheses we're going
to add our parameters and we're just
going to have two colors just show a
very basic radial gradient so let's type
in magenta or whatever color you want to
type in you can put pink and blue
whatever and black let's take a look at
what this renders in the browser we're
testing it so in box one we get a radial
gradient that goes from magenta to black
the reason why I made these boxes
stretchy is I wanted to show you guys
some things that the shape of your box
will determine whether or not your
gradient will be elliptic or circular
and you can also designate it force it
to be circular and I'll talk about that
in a second
so even if it's this shape even if your
box is this shape it'll be circular if
you set it to be that way but if your
box is a square even with this setting
it will be circular now let's talk about
these colors real quick magenta
just like the linear gradients you can
use the hexadecimal colors and even the
same for black you can use hexadecimal
colors you can also use RGB HSL or RGB a
or hsla so you can use colors by name
like
magenta or you can use its hexadecimal
value or you can use its RGB value or
you can use its HSL value now one of you
guys asked me a question on YouTube
about the colors and alpha transparency
settings you can also use the word
transparent here to make it a full
transparent color so that's what that
looks like and if we refresh our browser
view we see that we get a transparent
color there but maybe you don't want
that full transparent maybe you wanted
only half transparent 50 percent
transparency okay here we are at YouTube
for the last video that I put up for the
linear gradients and this is the
question that one of you guys asked from
user please stay tuned
they wrote very cool can you use alpha
values in place of the transparent or
opaque and this is the question that I
want to answer here yes you can use RGB
a or hsla colors now HSL colors are new
in css3 I believe
RGB a or RGB colors have always been
around you can use red green blue color
values to get any color you want and you
can also put a fourth parameter that's
the a that stands for the Alpha setting
of the color so you can set it to have
half transparency if you want or any
transparency setting that you want you
can make it just slightly transparent or
almost all the way transparent or 50% so
you can use HSL a or RGB a color values
to get the Alpha setting if you don't
want to use the transparent keyword to
make it fully opaque now let's copy this
whole CSS rule and we'll add another one
for gradient box too I'm just going to
go back to my named colors and I'm going
to add another color after magenta and
in between black turquoise and make sure
I separate all of my colors by comma let
me make sure I spell turquoise correctly
or I won't get any results check that in
the browser now I can add another color
in there if I want but yellow and what
will happen is each color will take up a
relatively even amount of space alright
so I'm just going to keep it simple with
three colors
now we'll talk about setting the shape
so let's grab that one and we'll make a
new rule for gradient three and right in
the front we're going to put the keyword
circle and by default if you don't
designate it to be a circle it will be
elliptic if your shape allows it to be
but if you put the circle keyword in the
front for specifying the shape then it
will force it to be a circle render that
in browser so you can see in box two
it's not using the circle keyword and
that is elliptic mark three no matter
the size of the box it remains circular
and you also notice how the gradient
grows the wider the box gets all right
now let's talk about some positioning
and that would go in front of your shape
where you specify your shape or size
that's where you put your positioning is
right in front so let's copy that rule
make another one called gradient four
and this one right before we specify
circle we're going to specify the
position and I'll make it start from the
bottom so I can just put the bottom
keyword render that now you can see that
my gradient begins at the very bottom
edge and then spreads out from there all
right now let's take this one make
another one for gradient five and let's
talk about placing it in two corners so
let's say I want it to be bottom left
corner render that now my gradient
starts in the bottom left corner and you
can also use top right or top left
bottom right bottom left but there might
be a time where you don't want it to be
exactly in the corner maybe you want
this gradient to start anywhere in the
box that you want it to start and that's
where we can use positioning by pixel or
percentage instead of using these top
right bottom left keywords okay now I'm
going to show you a different way to
affect the shape or size and the
positioning so let's copy this rule
gradient five and let's make a gradient
six rule now let's remove top right and
let's target the center by saying 50%
space 50% and instead of using the
circle for
eight we're going to use numbers for
size and that will also allow you to get
a circle or an ellipse if you want so
for example sake I'm just going to make
it 100 pixels by 100 pixels
now let's render that into gradient box
six now let's take those numbers for the
sizing you see how we have it size at
100
make that half of what it is and then
refresh the page keep your eye on box
six you see the whole gradient got a lot
smaller now what if we make that 200
width and height refresh our page and
it's a nice big gradient now that forces
it to be a circle so instead of having
the word circle there I can just put the
exact numbers that I want and if those
numbers match it will be a perfect
circle but if I make this one a 100 and
this one only 50 I will get an ellipse
or oval shape you see I get an oval
shape because the height is only set to
50 now if I change that to 20 it'll be
in even more dramatic change see very
skinny but I'll just leave that one on
100 pixels and 100 pixels so now you
know this is the width and height of the
gradient and this is its positioning so
50% 50% puts it directly in the center
now what if I change that 50 the first
50 to a zero and that would be my
x-coordinate my horizontal plane so
watch what happens to where this thing
is resting when i refresh you see on my
horizontal plane this way i just set it
to zero so it snapped to this edge if I
set it to maybe 10% save this and then
refresh this page you'll see it come off
of that edge ever so slightly into the
box a little more refresh you see so let
let you put it anywhere that you want it
in that box using these two numbers you
can use percentages or you can use
pixels here if you want if I want it to
be 50 pixels
exposition and then a 100 pixel
y-position
I can do that refresh the page so now
it's sitting 50 in this way and 100 in
this way
say it 100 and the 50 50 X 100 Y so if
you wanted to have this being a moon
sitting up here somewhere
that'd be very easy to accomplish I
would just want to put it X maybe 70%
and then Y of maybe 20 so let me try
that so I have 70 and 20 refresh my page
and see now it's up here in the corner
like it would be a moon in a scene that
shows you how to position it anywhere
you want it and there's also some key
words like far this corner that will
allow you to position it as well but you
can use these numbers and these key
words will allow you to get any
configuration that you need you can
either use ellipse here or circle
keyword to specify the shape or you can
specify the shape by direct sizing with
numbers so you have a lot of different
choices they give you a lot of different
choices okay now let's talk about
placing color stops for this one I'm
just going to copy the rule for gradient
3 going to go under gradient 6 and make
this one say gradients 7 because this
one's pretty much set up the way we want
and we're just going to go into the
colors and we're going to add stops now
I can use percentages or pixels here you
can also use eeehm when you're using
numbers you can use e/m values pixels or
percentages so I'll say magenta 40
pixels the turquoise will make 74 pixels
and the black will give a stop at 80
pixels so now let's check out box 7
render that in the browser so you can
see that allows you to specify how big
the radial is going to be and how tight
it's going to be next to its neighboring
color so basically if I wanted to make
this a very hard line I can just match
those two numbers where the black meets
the turquoise for instance if I just
make the turquoise match that 80 and
refresh that now you can see I have a
very hard line
because I match those now what if I want
to make the same effect happen to the
magenta where it meets the turquoise I
can just add another turquoise right
here watch turquoise and make this one
go to 40 to match the stop for the
magenta now if i refresh the page we
should see that our magenta where it
meets the turquoise is also all another
hard line say so you have two hard lines
now because you're making your color
stops meet exactly so it makes a hard
line if you want to soften these up you
just spread your colors out a little
make this one sixty so let's make the
black something like 96 and then the
turquoise will make close to that
something like 88
now let's render that refresh you can
see those settings allow your magenta to
dominate a little bit more and you can
see the range is from forty to eighty
eight and then the space where your
turquoise meets your black is very
narrow and you can spread that out a
little more if you just spread your
black maybe put it at 120 of the black
you'll see it spread out a little more
to where it's not so tight there refresh
see tada
so that allows you to make the colors
within the gradients stop anywhere you
want now we'll quickly discuss creating
repeating radio gradients and then we'll
be done so let's just copy rule number
seven and let's create gradient eight
for this one we'll remove the shape on
the front there and in front of the word
radial we're going to put repeating -
radial gradient let's use percentages
for this one let's set this one for 70%
magenta turquoise 80% then the black
will go 90 percent and you have to use
the color stops in there to have the
repeating radial gradient occur now when
you're using repeating radial gradients
you want to start with a certain color
and make sure you end with that color or
you'll get a very hard line where
magenta meets the black where it tries
to loop because what will happen is
these colors will just these three
colors will loop over and over again
now we're magenta meets the black you're
going to have a large line unless
you put magenta here on the end as well
so now let's take a look at what all of
that renders you can see we have a
repeating radial gradient now the
magenta turquoise and black just keep
going now what if I didn't want so many
rings in there what you can do is just
make these smaller numbers basically if
I make this a 30 this 40 and this a 50
you can make these any numbers you want
you got to be careful because sometimes
colors will overlap one another if you
set these numbers in such a certain way
to allow that so now let's see what we
have so you can see there's not so many
rings inside of our repeating gradient
here let's make this 50 60 and 70 nope
that has to be 60 you can see a little
better how it's repeating through there
and messing with these numbers will
determine whether you have a lot of
rings repeating in there or just a few
okay let's show one more little quick
example that will just make the one that
we just made we'll turn that to gradient
nine here and in front of the colors
let's make it circle shape instead of
elliptical refresh the page so you can
see the same ellipse here is a perfect
circle here okay so using these examples
it shows you how to position them size
them so you can get the radial gradient
to start anywhere you want within your
element you can make the gradients any
size you want any shape you want as many
colors as you want in them and you can
also make them repeating if you want and
we already discussed having transparent
colors here you can either use the
transparent keyword to go full
transparency or you can use RGB a color
value or hsla color values okay there's
one more little tip I want to show you
if you go up into the div and let's give
that a border radius and this is where I
think these radial gradients would come
in most handy let's just say a hundred
percent basically make it circular check
our page and refresh so you see what you
have now
if you make those perfectly circular you
have a nice orb especially that first
one shows you how to make a nice 3d
shiny orb you can make a cool round
buttons or oval buttons and you can also
use the ellipse gradients the ellipse
keyword if you want to make sure it
stays in ellipse to put these on you
know like rounded rectangular buttons
they would also look nice on rounded
rectangular buttons I'm just going to
remove this border radius here now I'll
add all the prefixes for the other
browsers I'll just copy this whole
background property ctrl C I'll move
this one down one line and make sure I
move this closing curly brace down as
well so I've got WebKit let's target
Mohs that's Firefox let's target MS it's
Internet Explorer and oh opera now the
last one you want is no prefixes because
this is the one that will come into play
when all of the browsers use this
setting and they don't rely on their
prefixes any longer so when any of these
browsers stop relying on this prefix
this is the rule or this is the setting
that's going to be applied and for
instance WebKit when you use all of
these together like this WebKit this
whole line isn't even going to be used
in Google Chrome this one will be used
in Google Chrome and you can check for
yourself I think this already works in
Google Chrome so if I remove all of
these I should still see my background
one in Google Chrome
even without the prefix okay but by the
time being you want to leave all those
in there you get WebKit moze MS OH and
then the standardized approach the
normal approach I'm going to do that
same thing for gradients 1 through 9 and
I'll also have all of this code
available on the page of develop PHP
where the video renders if any of you
happen to have the need to copy and
paste it so this is what you should end
up with
wraps up linear and radial gradients in
