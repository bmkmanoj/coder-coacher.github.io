here and a develop PHP I have a poll
question for the members of the site and
the question reads what kind of
tutorials would you like to see more of
here and the options were raw 3d
modeling 3d flash interaction or html5
and it seems that 3d flash interaction
has won by a landslide so in order to
give the users what they want that's
what I'm going to do so in this first
tutorial I'm going to show you how you
can use a 3d flash engine something that
works within flash and is a 3d engine
that will allow you to make your 3d
models Mouse interactive to where you
can have 3d models in your flash scene
that the user can manipulate with the
mouse and it's just going to be the very
basics and getting your feet wet with it
and so what we're going to do is use
swift 3d for this and we're just going
to create a simple cube or box and with
that box I'm going to change the
material I'm going to put a custom
bitmap material on it I'm going to use
this circuit board again generate
preview okay it's good now what I'm
going to do is go to file and I'm
working in Swift 3d version 6 I'm going
to go to file export scene to paper
vision paper vision 3d which paper
vision 3d is a 3d engine so what we'll
do is save this to the desktop its name
is digital cube and that's good so it's
going to be in a folder it's going to
render everything I need out to a folder
called digital cube so let's grab that
so here's digital cube and here is the
paper vision engine which you can
download from Google code Google code is
where you can download the paper vision
engine from but for this example if
you're working with Swift 3d Swift 3d
renders it out already
see there's the org folder and there's
the no chump folder and those folders
are inside of the paper vision engine if
you just go and download the core for
this example of being using Swift 3d
Swift 3d will actually render out the
org and no chump folders that are part
of the paper vision 3d effects engine
all right so you'll see what Swift 3d
has rendered out is an ER main
ActionScript class file and an Fla
called digital cube and here's that
material it rendered out for us that
circuit board and then we have the Dae
file now inside of the org folder you'll
see a whole lot of class files see so
what we're gonna do is open this Fla I'm
gonna open with flash cs3 because I like
cs3 better still there we go and now
you'll see what it gives you two layers
one is the instructions layer which you
can see the instructions that Swift 3d
gives you and then you have your
optional 3d navigation buttons which are
these guys down here and that will allow
the user to maneuver the 3d objects
using those buttons so let me just go
ahead and press f12 to publish the file
and I'll show you how it works
actually let's go ahead and get rid of
that top layer let's delete this layer
because we don't really need it it's
just the instructions and let's render
out again by pressing f12 now you can
see the user can just drag their mouse
over the object and manipulate it any
way they would like you see or they can
use these buttons and they can make it
go back
I'll forward all in 3d space it's pretty
cool huh
now if you wanted to have it to where
those buttons aren't there you could
also get rid of that so let's go ahead
and get rid of those objects to just
highlight it first control X now you
have nothing there let's go ahead and
change our background to black and let's
press f12 again and there you have it
so now those control buttons aren't
there and it's just an object that the
user can run over with their mouse okay
so that's the basics of it now within
this folder if you dig into these class
files you can see exactly how flash
using this paper vision 3d engine will
allow Mouse interactions and all kind of
interactions with your 3d elements okay
so if you want to dig into it further
you can just open up all the class files
and see how they communicate with flash
and communicate with the paper vision 3d
engine and I think I'm going to make
another video and I'm going to showcase
all of the different 3d engines that
work with flash like paper vision 3d is
there's a few others that you guys might
be interested in so what I'm going to do
in the next video and it's going to be a
real short sweet one just showing you
where you can get to and all about the
other 3d engines that work with flash
and that develop PHP I'm going to have
the link to where you guys even if you
don't have flash you can still download
this source package and play around with
the SWF file and dig into all of those
class files and dig into the paper
vision 3d engine okie dokie so you can
get to this file I'm going to link to it
in the description of this video so you
can easily get to the source files to
download this package that will have all
of this stuff in it that makes all this
possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
