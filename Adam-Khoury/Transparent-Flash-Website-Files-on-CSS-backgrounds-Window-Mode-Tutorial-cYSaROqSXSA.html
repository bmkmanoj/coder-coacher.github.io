gyro mud is one of our first few members
that join develop PHP it's in our
requested tutorial section he's
pondering how to make an ethyl a file
that publishes with the transparent
background and he says my but the pretty
websites that one could make with that
knowledge that's funny he's how funny
guy and yeah you could make some really
pretty websites using the transparent
settings in flash and i'll tell you how
to set that up and what you do is if
you're in flash cs3 or flash cs4 or
flash 8 or flash MX whatever you're
working in you can tamper with the
publish settings to get that right so
let's say we're in a new action script
2.0 or 3.0 file and we go to the publish
settings let's just go down here too or
let's go up here go to publish settings
HTML window mode transparent windowless
that's okay and now when you publish
your flash file will have no window I'm
going to go ahead and set my stage with
two and i'm going to show you two
applications where this is very handy
and actually the youtube programmers
themselves I think should adjust
something and I'll show you where and
why and let's say this was 800 say we
had a big flash a big flash site and it
was 950 x 800 and then on top say well
here let me show you a practical use for
it so here in fireworks i have say I set
up this custom background that I want to
use is the background of my web page but
on it I want to make sure that the flash
file has no background because I want to
stick buttons up in this curved section
going along this curve and I want to use
the CSS background as a visual holder so
what I'll do is go to file save this as
let's say we save it as a JPEG and let's
put it on the desktop and save it as my
BG ivg that JPEG save it's on the
desktop okay so now we'll go into flash
and i'll show you how to lay some
buttons on top so say you go into window
common libraries grab some buttons and
see where some buttons circle bubble
rectangle bevel that's good that's fine
yep an orange one right there okay so
let's say I had some buttons let's go
inside that button let's get rid of that
text delete the layer go back out ctrl-c
ctrl-v now I'm going to try and place
the buttons to where I think they would
go along that curve line we'll see
ctrl-c ctrl-v ok so if I publish out
actually let me file and save this to
the desktop save as go to the desktop
save this as no BG
now I have no BG and I'll publish out
makes an HTML file now let's open at
HTML file and see what happens no BG
there it is open with dreamweaver 8 yes
i have dreamweaver 42 and yes it's great
ok so in the design mode you don't have
to be you can be in either mode I think
just go to the page properties and let's
set it background and set that
background image on the desktop that was
named my BG press apply ok now let's go
ahead and send to this this flash file
by clicking here next to it and hit the
center align center now it aligns
centered my flash file onto that
background so let's press the f12 and
dreamweaver you see there there's no
background to that and now my buttons
and now all i have to do is go back into
my flash file and put these buttons
where I want them to go along this line
here and that's a that's one application
for using this type of thing or this
type of let's see
well you get the drift all you have to
do is move those buttons around to where
they you know in the flash file you
would move your buttons down I don't
have to show you how to do that you
would know how to do that and then you
publish out again get the HTML file put
the background back on that's how it
works so you can see there's no
background in the flash file but here
inside the flash file you can see the
background is clearly it's set to white
but we set the transparent settings in
the published setting remember I went to
HTML set the window mode transparent and
not published out and it gave us these
soberness removal rate and gave us the
settings inside of our HTML in the code
you see right here w mode transparent
and then in the embed part w mode
transparent and that's how that set if
you didn't want to transparent that
would say window I do believe and that
is application number one
and here is application number two for
setting your window mode to transparent
in your flash applications you'll see on
youtube and this is its kind of sad and
i may be wrong but I get in the getting
then again I may be right i think i'm
right because on youtube the
billion-dollar website their menu here
when you pull it down if you're on a
partner channel like mine there's more
space here and that's all well and good
the menu shows just fine that more
button is visible but say I go to my
buddy scrambles channel and this can be
on any browser I think because I looked
at it in an explorer too and I'm in
Google Chrome right now if i go to my
pull down you'll see my menu buttons
cover it up by the flash player the
video player and this is just an SWF a
flash file sitting on an HTML page and
that's all it is if you two programmers
and it really amazes me that that they
have bad functionality like this on a
billion-dollar website because here i
created a website but note for just a
couple of thousand that it's a community
website anybody can join for the member
the people that live in Transylvania
County North Carolina that are into the
arts say they're a musician or they're
an artist they can join make profile all
that good stuff like myspace or YouTube
and blah blah blah but look you go over
my drop-down menu and here's the flash
file just like this would be the video
player sitting on the page you go over
my drop-down menu and it's above my
flash file that's how it's supposed to
be you go to YouTube's it's behind their
flash file not cool all they have to do
is set the window mode like I did here
too transparent inside of there it can
go into Dreamweaver with that page and
sink in to the parameter for the window
mode to be transparent if it's possible
i'm not trying to snap on youtube
program is there anything there there
flash developers but if they were to set
their window mode to transparent that
would not be so that's application
number 22 we're using the transparent
window mode and flash would be very
handy for your applications okay we'll
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
