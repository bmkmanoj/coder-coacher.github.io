and I have a special treat for all of
the members and subscribers what it is
is an xml-based compact flash photo
gallery that renders the image brings
the images in using an XML file and it
renders them in a horizontal
horizontally sectioned off lines so it's
one loop that brings all of this in it's
a but if it reaches five it knows to
break line and reposition the next row
of images a certain pixel amount below
the the previous line and this line does
the same thing when it reaches this
picture number to be loaded in in the
loop we make it reposition this next
whole line of images and then this one
the same thing and you guys will see
pretty hardcore dynamics in this one so
I recommend only advanced users download
this free package and you'll get the
source file for the flash source file
the xml file and everything you need a
full working application and i just made
a title for it up here so if you guys
wanted space to put a title of this
particular gallery so yeah it's an
xml-based loop based compact flash photo
gallery when you click on a picture I
made it magically bring in and just
cover the whole gallery with that image
and the there's a sound effect which you
can't hear but there's a sound effect a
slide if it sounded when the picture
comes down and there are titles for each
image and a close button but you don't
necessarily have to click the close
button or your users don't they can just
click the picture and it goes away again
but I just put the button there's for
visual reference works really cool it's
quick super quick I don't think I've
ever seen a flash gallery load faster
than this bad boy okay now let's take a
look at the source file and I'll I'll
guide you through a little bit of how
the source files structured but really
downloading the source file and getting
to the code will be your best bet okay I
just want to showcase this application
in this video to get people interested
in learning these types of dynamics now
there's not much code to this and that's
the beauty of it and but the code
methods are advanced so that's why i
recommend all the advanced users go for
this and you know if you're a beginner
you can you can use it all you like it's
ready to go it's a full working
application and so you can manipulate
all the pictures in it and all that good
stuff but you might not be able to
expand upon it a beginner would be it'd
be so easy for you to manipulate the xml
file let's see where is it let me show
you that gallery config.xml let's open
that the Dreamweaver
let's take a look at it and you can see
there's all 20 pictures this menu item
for each of the 20 pictures and they
have a picture number they're numbered
they have a reference for where the file
is on the server right there that thumb
tag the picture tag is why am i sending
that in twice oh there's the large
picture sorry there's the thumbnail
here's the large picture reference and
there's the name for that image so easy
to manipulate and all you have to do is
change the images in this folder there's
all the the large ones and here's all
the thumbnails it's so simple but if you
want to be able to manipulate this file
I suggest you or I recommend you be an
advanced user because I can't answer any
questions about things i wish i could
give support for all of the the lessons
we produce to everyone that requests it
but since so many people have different
understanding levels it would be a
non-stop thing which it's not possible
for me to do okay so i put great insight
into the file though everything has all
the layers are named intuitively and
everything separated real nice and if
you guys know me you know that i like
nesting everything into a movie clip on
the main timeline so that's what I've
done and there's a the animated screen
is on the main timeline here you can see
it here it comes down if we go into that
you can see my animation for it see how
it goes down
and right there is when the picture
comes in when it hits this frame and
then here's the slide back up and the
sound effects are right there on the
timeline it's very simple to do okay so
let's go back into the main scene and
let's click on the let's go ahead and
lock those back let's click on the movie
clip that is the whole gallery and this
is where the code is now inside the
gallery you'll have four layers and the
top one is whether all the action script
is and the other layers or the skin
graphics the title and title background
and the over clip for the over effects
that was that little laminated looking
thing that was the thumbnail rollover
effect okay and that's just a movie clip
and let's see let's just take a look at
the code I'm not going to take too much
time explaining this code because I took
a lot of time commenting the code out
for you so you can just look at the code
comments here that I have every section
has code comment you can plainly see
above the code so that's where you get
the understanding okay no reason for me
to just repeat what I've already written
above the code segments and you'll see
it's old loop based brings in that XML
file right here then we run a loop on
that XML data and in the loop all the
images are displayed onto the stage for
the user to click on the thumbnails and
bring in the large pic and all that and
here inside the loop is those conditions
I was talking about to line the pictures
up horizontally in the y-axis or a y
position that they should be so we have
a nice compact
set of thumbnails all laid right next to
each other and this thing is not very
big at all you can fit this on a web
page real easy along with a lot of other
text and other items so that's pretty
much it and if you guys like I said you
have to be an advanced user to
manipulate this file but to use it for
your website you don't have to be an
advanced user you saw the xml file is
very simple all you'd have to do is
change the images in this folder pretty
much all you have to do is replace the
images in his folder keep the same names
and that was that be it it would all
work exactly the same and then you go
into the flash source file maybe change
the title here and everything and you're
good to go so on the main scene you'll
see there's certain items you'll see
what's there it's very intuitively name</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
