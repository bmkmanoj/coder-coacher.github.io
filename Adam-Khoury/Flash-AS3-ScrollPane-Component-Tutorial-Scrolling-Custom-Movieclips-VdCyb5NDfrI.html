ActionScript 3 tutorial I show beginners
how to create their own custom movie
clips with whatever content they want
and any graphics for background and
attach the scroll pane component to it
if they want to save real estate on
their pages hello and welcome to another
flash cs3 ActionScript 3 tutorial
brought to you by flash building let's
get started click flash ActionScript 3
file create new and now once we're
inside and just your stage properties in
any way you like you can change the size
let's make it 680 by 3 40 you can change
the frame right here put it up to 24 if
you want it for better animations or
even up to 30 frames per second for even
better animations and let's see let's go
ahead and add a background I'm going to
add a layer actually let's just make
this layer background I'm just going to
have a rectangle in here for background
element for cosmetic sake and let's give
it a fill of white
a nice blue edge okay
now what we're going to do is add
another layer and this layer we're going
to call scroll pane and add one more
layer and call it a s3 short for
ActionScript 3 now in the scroll pane
layer you go ahead and lock the
ActionScript 3 layer and the backgrounds
later since we're done with those so on
the scroll pane layer you highlight that
one and go into your components library
and grab out the scroll pane component
you place it where you want it to be
according to its registration point here
at the top left corner that's where it's
going to start and now let's pop in a
movie clip that we're going to use we're
going to use custom content okay so
right here on the scroll painting layer
I'm just going to move over to the side
a little bit here I'm going to make a
movie clip or something that's going to
be my content so let's make it about
that wide 622 let's make it about 640
actually 660 would be perfect 660 and
remember how big I made my background
actually let's make that smaller let's
make that 540 it doesn't really would
matter what size but you'll want to set
your scroll pane sizing when I show you
that in the code here in a second in
relation to the size of this movie clip
we're going to make so let's go ahead
and give it a black background and say
you want to make your scroll content
have a black background you just make
that black make it have no edge and then
just for the examples sake and time I'm
just going to draw out some custom
little rectangles that are going to
is going to be like my simulated
thumbnails let's say these are
thumbnails in your application so maybe
this is a testimonials section on your
website or something well actually look
before we do that let's put in some text
so say I have a bunch of text clip that
bit of laughs every flap that have type
your black back reputable a bit of that
so you control V I'm just going to
control C and control V to copy and
paste in place to have a second tutorial
and the second person do the same thing
to those two drag them down into place
and I'm going to do all four so now I
have all four highlighted control C
control shift V and drag those down into
place as well get these over here drag
them down and yours can be whatever
content you want alright now we have a
nice long content section let's make our
background match up to the length we
needed here okay so say this was the
movie clip that you want to make
scrollable so let's highlight all of
this make sure we get it all in our
selection if you didn't get it all make
sure you go and select those
let's just press ctrl-a that way that'll
get them all and then deselect the
scroll pane now right-click this convert
to symbol and there's your movie clip
you can name it my content let's grab
that name ctrl C copy it okay now in the
library we can go to my content movie
clip that's sitting right there that we
just made you go to properties you can
set the linkage here and the properties
and let's name it my content that's
perfect press ok it's going to define a
class path for that object or that movie
clip in the library now let's get it off
the stage completely you don't need it
we just wanted to build it on stage
there like you would normally build
anything in flash ok let's make sure the
scroll pane has an instance name before
we start the coding not scroll bar
scroll pane it's a scroll pane component
so we can actually highlight that and
copy it we're going to use it in our
code right here press f9 to open the
actions panel on the as3 layer and we're
going to type in scroll pane dot source
and this is going to put the movie clip
that we just created and gave linkage to
in our library my content as soon as you
put that as the source for the scroll
pane now we can set the scroll pane size
so you say set size scroll pane set size
open close parenthesis semicolon and in
between you put the width and then the
height so let's make ours say 500 just
for starters and we'll test it out and
see what it does 500 by 300 let's see
the size of our file is 340 that's good
it's really for this basic example on
how to scroll custom content that's
really all you need is those two lines
of code if you're going to assemble your
if you're going to assemble your movie
clips manually and you want full control
over
those two lines of code should should
get you going so press ctrl enter or f12
and there you can see we have a scroller
and we have a horizontal scroll here on
it as well and it's set to 500 by 300 so
let's change the sizes that way we can
get our content in there perfectly
because we had our movie clip set to 540
I think the width of that custom movie
clip we made so let's make this 5 I
don't know 56 and this that stays 300
that's the height so we just want to
make sure we make it wide enough to
where we don't get a horizontal scroller
and we also have our custom background
color and there you see that so that's
how it's done so two lines of code to
get you the UI scroller I'm sorry the
scroll pane component from the
components library here attached to any
movie clips that you want that you
create custom no matter how long or big
they are and you saw we had horizontal
scroll and vertical scroll if needed the
horizontal scroll will appear okay
that's just the basics of putting them
custom movie clip into a scroll pane
component and I'm going to be showing
you a lot more about the dynamics of
creating scroll pane components in a
dynamic scenario all through code okay
so we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
