will demonstrate usage of the color
picker form input type as well as tying
it to JavaScript for your Ajax
processing each once again here is the
finished product of what we will achieve
in this video lesson it will enable your
users to click this input field and
choose one of these standard colors and
if they don't like that standard color
set they can click other and then use
the color palette here to really
pinpoint the exact color they want the
tone and the hue they can even use RGB
values here okay and then there's my
color let's put in another color for
submit and we're showing you guys how to
process these color values using
JavaScript so we can pick up those
values in JavaScript and process them in
any way we need just like all the other
stuff let's once again begin with a
basic html5 web page structure and build
our little application so I'll go under
this heading here and I'll type in
choose color 1 : and here is where I'm
going to have my input field so let's
type input type and once you get the
type attribute set up it's going to be
the type of color and that's how you get
your color picker to render to the
screen now let's give this a name
attribute and also give it an ID we'll
call it color 1 keep things simple and
the name attribute as well color 1 now
let's close off this input tag now let's
highlight that whole line and create
another one real quick very similar line
and just call this choose color 2 and
this one will be name of color 2 and ID
of color 2 and its type is color once
again so it renders the color picker for
the user and the last thing we need in
the HTML is the input button like we've
been using throughout the other lessons
its type is button type and if you
wanted this to process in the
traditional form type sense you would
make this submit type and you would just
encapsulate all these fields and form
items within a form opening and closing
tag but since we're using JavaScript we
don't need a form opening and closing
tag really so when this button is
clicked it runs a JavaScript function
called processed data that we're going
to put up
the head tag in just a second and we use
the on click event to enable that and
this process data function is being sent
two arguments the first argument is the
identifier for field number one the
color not number one and this one is the
identifier the second argument is the
identifier for color number two any way
we can access those values when this
function runs okay let's go into the
head tag and let's place our JavaScript
tool will place an opening and closing
script tag there that we can place our
JavaScript within then we'll have
function and the function name is
processed data right here and we know
that that function is looking for two
arguments to come into it so I'm going
to make those two argument variables
right now I'm just going to name them c1
and c2 so I've created two variables
that will identify with these two fields
within our JavaScript not much the same
as we've been doing in the other lessons
regarding html5 and JavaScript form
processing these new input types we're
going to gather those two values and put
them in variables called C V 1 and C V 2
so this is color value 1 and this is
color value - the way we get those color
values the hexadecimal number for that
color value is say document dot get
element by ID c1 which refers to this
and this refers to this so once you
target that element on the page you just
say dot value use the dot value property
to get the value of what that color is
you store it in a variable called CV 1
you do the same exact thing for CV to
remember this is in relation to this and
this is in direct relation to this field
here
now let's simply pop in an alert once
again and give you guys those two
comments that I've been giving you in
the other ones about how to send these
values through Ajax to a PHP script and
then do whatever you need to do with
them from that point an AJAX is a
two-way communication you guys know what
Ajax is and if you need to learn how to
use Ajax and how to program it from
scratch using javascript this is the
video tutorial for you right here this
link and I'm just going to leave that in
the script
anybody can get to it I'll now press
ctrl s to save the file go to file
preview and browser and I'm going to
preview this in opera if I wanted to I
could put some brake tags in there let
me do that let's put two break tags
there to there and that is good now
let's go to file preview in browser
opera alright now click my first color
here the second color is not in the
standard color set there so I'll click
other and I'll go and fine-tune it get
the color I really want okay and then
submit and there the two hexes the
hexadecimal color values sorry my tongue
gets tied sometimes hexadecimal color
values okay and there you go there now
you set up color palettes that people
can use to really define distinct colors
that they want and you know how to
process those with JavaScript now for
all your form processing needs arrive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
