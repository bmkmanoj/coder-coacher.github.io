here and in this lesson I'm
demonstrating how to create really cool
realistic 3d effects on mouseover and
mouse out and flash so let's first
control and so to see what we have so we
have kind of like a logo animation here
when a mouse goes over it the logo spins
it comes to life when the mouse goes out
the logo stops and what's cool about it
is the animation stops at the exact
frame where it is see that you can even
see the reflections look on the 3d word
there you can see the reflection of that
other word flash sitting next to it if
it stops at the right angle and on the
spin you can see it in the reflection
really cool stuff really easy to do so
true 3d on rollover on roll out or on
click functionality in flash ok let's
rock and roll let's open Swift 3d any
version you have as long as it renders
out the swf file which i think all of
them do and i'm working in swift 3d
version 6 and let's see first thing I'm
going to do is change the width the
layout to 640 the height I only need to
be about 200 the file that I want to
bring into flash and let's hit the text
tool let's make that say flash
and let's back up just a little bit on
the view of it by holding alt right
mouse and then dragging drag up and down
holding the right mouse button with the
Alt key and it'll drag in and out like
that okay so let's go and change it want
something cool like that katana I like
that make that a little bigger and let's
go to bevels out around maybe point zero
three instead of point zero five there
we go now let's give it a reflective
material down here in the materials tab
go to reflective and let's make the
sides a nice gray reflective gray and
then you have a bright reflective red on
the edges and then on the face right
there we'll have a darker red this one
right there
okay and you can also go to the
smoothness of the bevel the mesh quality
you can bring that up so when it renders
out it'll look a little better now let's
back up a little more take that put it
over here make sure it's highlighted
press ctrl-c ctrl-v make a new instance
of that and then let's change what the
text says on that one too 3d and let's
give this one you know and I'm going to
change the font on that one let's go to
where's that Oliver Barney nice thick
one there we go and I'm going to change
the material that's on that too nice
bright white on the face it looks good
we'll leave it just like that now what
we want is this thing on Mouse roll over
in flash we want the word or this group
of letters here to rotate so we'll have
an animation we can just go to the
preset animations common spins put this
horizontal spin on it that way when it
spins around we'll be able to see this
word reflected in this face and on the
sides so we'll see the word flash here
reflected off of this when it spins
around let's see what that looks like
when I dragged the horizontal right spin
onto these group of letters and I'll
press play here on the animation you can
see how that works now let's go to
preview and export see what we have
raster let's go to frame 1 let's
generate the selected frame see what it
looks like
it's not too shabby now let's go back to
see editor let's get rid of one of these
lights it's a little bit too bright for
my taste and let's also bring this over
here let's change the layout or the
environment rather to background color
black because that's what will have it
in flash and the environment let's make
that a little darker there we go and
also the ambient light color like that
full black there we go try that give you
an export generate selected frame
that's cool all right now what I'm going
to do is render out the animation let's
go to scene editor see what it looks
like again make sure it's what we want
yep so when the users mouse goes over it
I want that thing to start spending when
the users mouse mouse goes off I wanted
to go back to the flat view all right so
let's go to preview an export make sure
we're selecting flash flash player swf
to render out and quality all the way up
raster generate all frames now it's
going to take time it needs to make all
I think it's 19 frames it's going to
need for that animation okay so all the
frames are finished rendering and we can
press play here to see what it looks
like it looks really cool because when
it spins around you can see this word
flecked it off of this faces of this
word really cool and you can see the
lighting moving around here okay so
let's go ahead and export all frames as
the swf let's go ahead and save it on
the desktop as flash 3d will name the
volume last 3d save now it's an SWF now
let's go into flash create new
actionscript-3 file let's make the stage
what we want let's go with six and maybe
about 700 wide and
150 hi let's go with 30 frames per
second or maybe around 24 background
black okie dokie and now let's import
import to the library
let's go to desktop flash 3d swf now the
whole swf is going to go into the
library drag it out as movie clip
library let's see there's all the bitmap
images for it but you can just grab the
movie clip of the swf which is
essentially a movie clip and now when
you press control enter you'll see that
you have your animation in flash that is
awesome it's awesome looking I know this
animation or the video probably is
choppy that animation looks choppy you
want to see how it looks really good
click the link in the or you want to see
the way it should be or its intended to
look the way it actually looks you can
click in the link in the description of
this video and you'll see it on page
develop PHP where the demo is this swf
showing okay so now we just don't want
it to spin like that the whole time only
on mouse roll over so let me teach you
that right now real quick okay let's
highlight this movie clip on stage let's
give it an instance name my logo my logo
on to score MC now let's go and put
another label or another layer above
this layer let's name that as3 for
actionscript-3 highlight that and press
f9 to open your actions panel now once
in the actions panel we use my logo on
to score MC that add event listener this
is going to be
mouse event dot roll over where is it
roll over gamma let's just name this
logo spin it'll be the name of the
function it's going to fire off there
now let's go and write that function in
function logo spin let's get a void in
here create the curly brace nest and
here this is going to be mouseevent so
we place event or a lot of times you see
II or EVT people write that out
differently but I just like to use the
standard event for that event colon
mouseevent now that's logo spin all set
up and ready to go so all we have to do
is well first let's go into this movie
clip and make sure it just doesn't spin
by default I'm putting a stop action put
a new layer and then put a stop action
by opening the actions panel here and
typing in stop this way it won't spin it
will just be sitting there and then when
you want it to spin that's when you just
say go to and play alright let's see how
we're going to do that
yeah let's not put the stop action
inside it'd be better if we put yeah we
don't even need that layer let's put the
the command for this to stop right at
the start of the script here my logo MC
desktop there's a stop action commanding
that to not play it by default and then
what we can do is say my logo on roll
over my little going to score MC dot
play now we'll just copy these lines
right here and make the out listener and
the out function so let's make this roll
out when the mouse users roll out or the
mouse the users mouse rolls out one logo
to stop so that's called logo stop let's
make sure it says logo stop here and
make sure this says stop
and that should do it so now when I put
my mouse over the logo it will start
that spin let's see if i coded that
right press control enter beautiful
mouse out cool it stops exactly where at
the frame where it's when the mouse goes
away from the clip that is cool so you
can see it hard hat is neat that is
funky fresh I don't care what anybody
says I love how you can see the
reflection of the other word and it too
and the shadows so when the mouse goes
over let's make this bigger mouse goes
over the whole thing spins mouse goes
out and it stops look at that you can
see the reflection right here in the
three of that whole word almost it's
awesome okay so that's pretty much how
it's done and you can doesn't have to be
for logos any kind of animations menu
panels whole screens whatever you want
to do these things can fly around and
this is the best way to do real 3d and
flash I think swift 3d exports nice SWFs
and you can see inside there's all the
little pictures that make up the
animation you just got to watch out how
bulky you make it files okay we'll see
you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
