cs4 training tutorial brought to you by
develop PHP calm and if you're wondering
why all of us Adobe tutors and
instructors sound like dweebs and geeks
and nerds it's because we are ok I'm
gonna demonstrate how to make some cool
line graphics using fireworks cs4 so
let's go to canvas size 900 height 500
it's good for me
just be in his eyes canvas color can be
any color whatever you want makes you
happy now I'm gonna go to the shapes
library here and if you don't happen to
have your show and you can go up to
where is it window Auto shapes it'll pop
open wherever it happens to be now I'm
gonna go into the shapes folder there
and I'm going to pull out inspire that
auto shape now when you click the auto
shape the little yellow dot it says
click for new inspiration so you click
it and it gives you a new inspiration
each time you click it something new and
creative for you to work from or on and
I'm gonna give mine a line edge and I'm
gonna give it no fill so it's just a
line now I'm going to take that so each
time you click it in the center it
changes in something else and that's
cool that's good now watch this
now I'm going to right click it convert
to symbol graphic name it whatever you
want okay now we have a symbol there
let's give it a hue and saturation
effect so let's go to adjust color down
in the filter effects hit the little
plus sign adjust color hue and
saturation and you can change this hue
and saturation to whatever you need it
to be adjust the sliders for achieving
any color you want I'm going to go with
that purple a bright purple pink there
and then once that set I'm gonna press
ctrl-c ctrl-v bring it down a little bit
and I'm gonna flip it horizontally not
vertically sorry flip it vertically move
it over a little bit maybe right about
there and now we can have the adjust the
hue and saturation on this one to be a
different color that's okay now what
we're going to do is tween the two of
these from this state to that state so
let's highlight both of them it's go to
modify symbol between instances now in
between my two states I want 24 steps
some press okay look at that isn't that
beautiful so you can make some really
cool line graphics using this method and
what's really even more cool about it is
that it tweens the colors from one color
to the next all the way through the 24
steps and what's even cooler about it is
you can just double-click any one of
these go inside and once you're inside
you just click the new inspiration and
the whole thing will change up look at
that that is funky click it again change
it up again awesome
so you see it's very creative very nice
and if you have those line graphics
going on with the cool
flowy background you can achieve some
really cool effects go back in
double-click anyone no inspiration no
inspiration and then once you land on
something you like something that
pleases you I like that one you just
double-click back out and you can group
all of those together if you like
control G and then add other filter
effects to the whole the whole thing
maybe a glow give it a glow look at that
isn't that awesome that is just awesome
any glow you want it'll look great maybe
not so bright that looks great
I like the red glow actually it looked
really good ok so there's some cool
effects for you to play around with and
have fun with a bag ok bye ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
