here with another fireworks cs4 tutorial
because Photoshop sucks okay we're going
to do is fix this missing tooth on this
child here it's very simple to do we'll
just zoom in by holding once you load
your image in you just hold down control
mouse wheel and if you don't know how to
get an image in the fireworks you go up
to file open and then you can browse
your system for any picture it loads it
in and then you hold ctrl and mouse
wheel and it goes in and out you say so
let's just zoom in and get to a spot
where it you can still see things pretty
good but you have a nice big view of it
and what you'll do is make sure the
picture is selected you can see it's
outlined in blue has a blue outline on
it when I select it and i zoom into it
I'm going to click the lasso tool the
polygon lasso tool and I'm going to
start anywhere in this dark area or you
can start up in the pink area but you
want to just make sure you get the whole
tooth and a little bit of the outside
coloring so let's just start right there
start working our way around what's nice
about the polygon lasso tool is you can
set any shape that you need go as slow
as you need to to really define a really
nice cut out okay so let's press ctrl C
just press the text tool ctrl V and then
there's your new tooth now what you can
do is just move it over like this get it
up into place then back out and take a
look at it it looks like child was never
missing a tooth if you want to be a
little more accurate you can flip it so
let's bring it over here let's flip it
now let's just grab the transform tool
or the scale tool or the skew tool
either one and it will give you the
little circular arrow there for the
corners and you can just grab it
move it around and you just want to get
it to where the bite on the bottom looks
like it matches up with the bite on the
other tooth there that looks about right
let's see what we have there you go now
you can you can't really tell this child
was ever missing a tooth let's even turn
out a little more there we go Booya
beautiful okay we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
