us today in this exercise you can learn
how to build drag and drop applications
with html5 and JavaScript we will also
teach you how to read the drop zone that
way you can pass the data in the drop
zone to your server-side or database for
saving that way you can record what
people put in the drop zone there are
many types of applications where drag
and drop features would make things more
user-friendly you're only limited by
your imagination and at the end of the
exercise we will discuss which
environments you can expect this to work
in and test it in Chrome Firefox and
Internet Explorer and I'll also offer
some extra tips so be sure to stick
around to the end of the video before we
get started let's take a look at the
finished product of what we'll be
creating today you can see we have three
objects that can be dragged and then we
also have a drop zone which is this grey
box so let's take object 2 and drag it
into the drop zone and I put an app
status let me let that go you can see I
have apps status up here just for
developer purposes so let's grab object
2 and put it in the drop zone so it
removes it from where it resides
originally and puts it into the drop
zone now let's take object 1 then object
3 and then we can get object data object
2 is in the drop zone object 1 is in the
drop zone and object 3 is in the drop
zone so it reads the data in the order
that it's dropped into the drop zone
that way when the user is finished
dropping things into the drop zone you
can record what they put into the drop
zone and the order that they put it in
in your database or email it to yourself
or whatever you need to do on the server
side ok you can get yourself a test HTML
file ready and I'm going to be offering
all of the code for the finished product
at my site and I'll put a link for it in
the description of this video that way
you can reference my code just in case
you have any syntax errors with yours
or if something seems to not be working
the first thing we'll do is put in place
the HTM
elements that we'll need and I'll
explain them very quickly but everything
is pretty simple we have a heading here
which is for the app status which isn't
very necessary in your completed
application this is just going to be
here for developer purposes that way it
shows exactly what's going on throughout
the operations now this heading is just
to give the dropzone a title above it
then we have a div with an ID of
dropzone
and that was that gray box where people
are going to drop their objects into and
we're using the on drag enter event the
on drop event the on drag over event and
the on drag leave event so in the on
drag enter event we're going to run a
function called drag enter and we're
going to pass the event as an argument
then for the on drop event we're going
to run a function called drag drop then
on drag over we just set return false
that way nothing happens then on drag
leave we're going to run a function
called drag leave then all we have are
the three objects that the user can drag
into the drop zone they each have an ID
of object one object to and object three
and at the end of the video I'm going to
discuss how you can add a lot more
information through data attributes you
can use custom data attributes to pass a
whole lot of information when it comes
time to read what's in the drop zone but
I'll discuss that at the end of the
video I'll give you some tips then for
each object we have the class of objects
set that way we can just style them
easily all as a group then we set the
draggable attribute to true that way
they can be dragged then the events are
going to be on drag start on drag end
and then the on drag start for each
object we run the drag start function
and the drag end event we run the drag
end functions pretty simple then I have
a horizontal line here just to separate
this button from those objects and this
button has an on click event and when
it's clicked we're going to run a
function called read drop zone and then
I just labeled it get object data
because this is the function that's
going to allow us to see how many
objects have been dropped into the drop
zone read all of those objects and pass
them as a list anywhere we need to for
saving or
or sending or whatever that's it for the
HTML now we're going to put in a couple
of CSS rules one's going to be for the
drop zone and the other rule is going to
be for this class objects let's put that
in style tag so we have class objects
and this is what Styles all of those
objects as a group then we have a rule
that affects the ID of drop zone which
is this div here and we apply these
simple properties to style it okay now
we're going to move on to the JavaScript
portion and none of this code has to
reside in your document you can put it
in an external dot j/s file but I'm just
going to have it directly in the
document just to keep things simple for
this tutorial you can also externalize
your CSS into a dot CSS file and also if
you would like all of these events drag
start drag and drag over all of these
events can be applied to these elements
when the document loads for instance in
a window dot load event you can add all
of these events through JavaScript that
way you can clean up your HTML a little
bit more if you would like but it
doesn't hurt to have the events directly
on the elements as attributes but if you
want to clean things up you can
certainly add these events to these
objects using JavaScript when the page
loads okay now we'll start with the
JavaScript first thing we're going to
have is a function with a name of
underscore and every everywhere we use
that it's just simply to return the get
element by ID reference so that way we
have an object reference for the
elements without having to write
document.getelementbyid
blahblahblah all we have to do is put an
underscore to get the object reference
that's all that's there for the next
thing we're going to do is put a
variable in place just to initialize it
as false and the variables name is
dropped in and we're going to toggle
that from false to true and back to
false
whenever we need to within the script
now the first function that we're going
to put in place is going to be for this
drag start event on all of these objects
you see we run the drag start function
so let's drop that function into place
so when each object is picked up by the
user and they start to drag it
to put into the app status element
effect it's innerhtml and we're going to
right dragging the event target get
attribute ID so we're just going to grab
the ID attribute of the object that way
we know exactly which one they're
dragging so event dot target is the
object reference for the element that's
being dragged you can simply get any
attributes from that element that you
want then we're going to set the drop
effect and there's different options you
can use for the drop effect property but
I'll give you information about all of
that at the end of the video and I'll
show you where you can do more research
into all of the data transfer objects
properties and methods then the next
line we're running the set data method
for the data transfer object and the
first parameter we pass is text because
we're just going to be setting some text
data for the data transfer object that
way you can be read in other events and
the text that we're going to be setting
is event a target target attribute ID
which is the ID of the element being
dragged and you can set any data that
you want you don't have to set just the
ID as text you can set any data as text
and the next function we're going to put
in place is drag enter and that's for
the drop zone you can see the drag enter
event here fires off a function called
drag enter so we have to have that in
place let's put it in right now function
drag enter we snatch up the event as an
argument and then we simply put in the
app status innerhtml you are dragging
over the event target that get attribute
ID which will basically say you're
dragging over the drop zone and you
really don't have to relate that
information to your users but I just put
that in place for developer purposes now
the next function is drag leave and drag
leave is also for the drop zone so when
someone takes an object drags it out of
the drop zone and they haven't dropped
it yet you can know when they have left
the drop zone with that object then we
just write in the app status you left
the drop zone which is also another
feature that you don't have to have in
place for your completed application you
really don't have to really
that to the user because they know that
they left the drop zone and they didn't
drop the object now we're going to put
the drag drop function in place which is
definitely more important now drag drop
is also for the event of drop on the
drop zone so whenever the user drops one
of the objects into the drop zone this
drag drop function is going to fire off
now the first thing we do in this
function is we're going to write event
dot prevent default so we run the
prevent default method on the event just
to prevent undesirable default behavior
while dropping because I noticed in some
browsers you get weird behavior if you
don't run this prevent default method
that way we can just customize what we
want to happen a little better and the
next thing we do is we get the element
ID so here we run the get data method
and remember up here in the drag start
we use the set data method to set that
data now what happens is the get data
method can retrieve any data that you
have set and we're going to retrieve
that text so basically that gives us the
element ID that's being dropped into the
drop zone then the next line we say
event that target which is basically
saying the drop zone object then we're
going to append child that way we add
the element to it by its ID that way the
element leaves where it is originally
and then lives in the drop zone now then
in the next line we're just writing into
the app status dropped then we write the
element ID into the drop zone in the
very next line we target the element
being dropped and then we remove its
attribute of draggable that way it's not
draggable any longer it's in place in
the drop zone and the user can't drag it
back out in the next line we change the
style cursor back to default for that
object because you can see here we put
the cursor as move for all of those
objects and we just want to set it back
to a default style cursor which is the
pointer the little arrow that way they
don't get confused about whether or not
it's still draggable
and then we simply change the dropped in
variable to true because we're going to
make an evaluation on that dropped in
variable in the very next function that
we put into place and this is the last
function that's going to be for the
basic drag-and-drop operations then
we'll just need one more function to
read all of the object data that's all
in all of the objects that are in the
drop zone we can count how many objects
are in we can pass all of the object
data to server side and do whatever we
want so the drag end function that we
just put into place is triggered on all
of the objects when the drag and event
triggers so we just run the drag end
function basically when the user lets go
now we run an if condition within this
function to see if dropped in variable
is equal to false and if it's not
dropped within the drop zone then we're
going to write into the app status you
let the object whatever its ID is go
that means they dropped it but not
within the drop zone and then no matter
what that condition reads we're going to
just change dropped in to false again
for the next item or for the next object
being dragged and that's it that's all
of the basic operations for a drag and
drop application ok now the very last
thing we need to wrap up this tutorials
code is the read drop zone function this
one's important if you want to access
all of the objects as a list all the
objects that the user has dropped into
the drop zone and they'll be in the
order that the user has dropped them in
the drop zone so under the drag end
function I'm going to put in place the
read drop zone function and all I'm
doing here is running a for loop that
iterates over the length of how many
children are in the drop zone so that
gives you a count of how many objects
are items that the user has dropped into
the drop zone because drop zone dot
children returns an array and you can
just read the
length of that array and then run this
for loop to process each one
independently so all I'm doing is
setting an alert that puts the ID of the
object passing through the loop and then
we write some text that says is in the
drop zone so it'll say object 3 is in
the drop zone object 1 is in the drop
zone and object 2 is in the drop zone if
they happen to drop all three now within
this loop you can make a list maybe a
comma separated list or - separated
whatever kind of delimiter that you want
to put in between each bit of
information and you can build that list
and then after the for loop you can run
Ajax request to pass any data to your
server so you can make a JSON object or
just a regular string a long string
that's a list listing all of those items
or whatever you want to do to it ok now
that all of the code for the tutorial is
in place I'm going to offer you guys a
few tips and a little bit more insight
into things that might help you along
when you're building drag-and-drop
applications now let's go up here to the
CSS and let's say these objects were not
display:inline-block but let's say they
were block display you'll get totally
different behavior of how they stack see
now they're block display if I take
object 2 and put it in the drop zone
then object 3 they stack as block level
elements when I had that as inline block
they can just stack horizontally
now what if I remove this and let me
show you some different behavior if I
put the position to absolute now they're
all going to stack directly on top of
one another you see you have object 1 2
&amp;amp; 3 are stacked on top of one another so
let me take off the top one and put it
in the drop zone see then object 2 is
top of the stack and I take object 2 and
put in the drop zone and it stacks on
top of object 3 in the drop zone
if I take object 1 and put it in the
drop zone so it'd be like taking a deck
of cards and reversing it so my point is
that your CSS can dictate how things are
stacked in the drop zone let me put this
back on display:inline-block there now
here's another very important tip if you
want to pass more data for instance with
these objects you can give these objects
more data attributes custom data
attributes to pass any information that
you want to these JavaScript functions
if you go to develop PHP calm and you
type in the search bar data attributes
and then search you'll see the custom
data attributes JavaScript tutorial and
that's in the JavaScript general
programming section so if I just click
JavaScript and go to video tutorials
then I go to general where's that
general or you can just use the search
feature it will take you right there but
general we have custom data attributes
where's that right there this tutorial
shows you how to add custom data
attributes to those objects that can be
read in all of those JavaScript
functions so if you want to follow this
tutorial that'll give you a good insight
into how to do that and also I'll put a
link to this tutorial within the
description of our drag-and-drop
tutorial here
ok now the very last thing we have to
discuss is which environments that you
can expect this to work in so let's go
ahead and file preview in Internet
Explorer let me drag this over here and
then object to object 1 object 3 and
then we can get object data object 2 is
in the drop zone object one is in the
drop zone and object 3 is in the drop
zone so it works fine in Internet
Explorer file preview in browser Firefox
drag this over here and let's go ahead
and put two three and one and we can
still
get our object at a no problem and when
we build I've been testing in Chrome the
whole time we've been building so I know
for sure that it works in Chrome browser
now I know some of you are going to ask
so let me go ahead and cover it right
now support for this technology on
mobile touchscreen environments is
almost non-existent but using touch
events a developer can replicate this
functionality on touch devices with a
little bit of work so touch event
programming could replicate the
application on mobile devices and touch
screens so if you don't know about the
touch events yet all you have to do is
type into a search engine JavaScript
touch events and you can learn all about
it and that will allow you to replicate
this sort of drag-and-drop behavior on
touch screens and mobile devices okay I
think I've covered all of the bases that
will allow you to get a good start a
good beginning in to drag and drop
application development and if this is
something that you guys are really
interested in you think it's really cool
we can go deeper to show you more
specific features that you might have in
mind and if you can just put a comment
into the comment area saying how would I
accomplish this specific tasks in my
drag-and-drop application development
and myself for somebody else that reads
your comment could provide you with a
very helpful answer or I may even do
more tutorials I might even just put a
drag and drop section at develop PHP
comm here in the JavaScript video
tutorials I might have a new section
just special for drag and drop
application development that's if you
guys want to know more or take it in two
different directions or whatever but
this tutorial here should give you a
really good start into whatever you want
to do drag and drop wise alright I
appreciate you tuning in and I'll see
you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
