lesson will be demonstrating how to make
a y position speed menu it's very
similar to the exposition speed menu
that we created and placed just a couple
of days ago and so we just wanted to
show the the vertical scrolling vertical
sliding in for you guys the reference if
you had any trouble changing the the x
position to a y position menu if you
have any trouble here it is so let's
push out and take a look in the browser
and you'll see it activates when our
mouse goes over the menu and depending
on where we are when our mouse enters we
might see it move but if we enter up top
the button menu or picture menu whatever
you want to use inside of there won't
move because we're at the top portion
but once the users mouse goes to about
the second button or the third button
you can see movement happen and the
movement is based upon where their mouth
is so if their mouse is deep into the
the menu we're depending on what side
it'll go faster or slower so if they're
hanging around the middle you can see
I've let my mouse go I'm not holding on
to it anymore it's just where my mouse
is placed inside that movie clip there
is what determines that speed that menu
is going to move at and I only have six
buttons here or picture but you can have
as many as you like just like the
exposition speed menu that sliding menu
we put the other day for the exposition
just like that one you can have 25 or 50
of these in there if you want and inside
of the code and then once once your
users mouse leaves this movie clip say
they leave the movie clip it's going
that speed then go around the rest of
the HTML page and it'll just keep going
until they you know until it reaches the
bottom or they get back in and start
when their mouths around it but it's a
really cool setup
you can see as each button comes into
view and over the arrow or under the
arrow it turns into a little hand symbol
when it goes off of the button it turns
back to an arrow so it's got good
functionality nice fluid movement and so
let's take a look at the code in the fla
now it's a similar code so if you want
to look at the other the exposition
speed menu or sliding menu you'll see
that these are both very similar all I
did was go inside and change all the x2
wise and so and I also change the speed
because we were dealing with a 500 wide
menu and now we're dealing with a 200 hi
menu so we had to change the math just a
little bit so it function correctly and
you can change this math further for to
speed up or slow down you just change
this 5 here too if you want it to go
slower change it to an eight or a ten
you wanted to go a little faster change
it to a three and and pretty much just
like the other code like I said in the
other video if you have any trouble
understanding the code which is just
basically simple math and we're using
looping to make I have a comment right
here it says this all happens around 15
times per second so all of this code
executes about 15 times every second and
it loops back you can see it's set to
loop back right at the end of this frame
go to and play loop and loop is this
frame to hear it's got a frame label
named loop and so it hits that one every
every second it hits that 15 times and
it will run that code
or actually it just it just makes it
loop in on itself so it never goes back
to frame one it only hits frame one in
the beginning of the movie and then once
the miles the users mouse goes over the
movie clip here the blue movie clip then
it shoots to frame too and never sees
frame one again it'll just stay in a
constant loop between two and three and
it's just using math and conditional
statements and a little bit of mouth
math calculations here to determine the
speed depending on where their their
mouse is like I said if it was in the
middle of the movie clip it goes nice
and slow you see my hanging out in the
middle there the menu is nice and slow
but the further I get down into the menu
or up goes faster in each direction and
you can get this fla and the code and
everything nice and clear if you go to
develop PHP and just download the free
fla and there's also a forum there if
you got any questions all right we'll
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
