with another fireworks cs4 tutorial this
one is a forum request from one of our
site members and his request is how to
punch out using custom shoes that he
learned how to make in one of our other
tutorials in fireworks punch out from
bitmap and you can also punch out I'm a
regular stock rectangle or any shape
that you draw out what about more
remembers Jael with that cool ass
double-headed dragon picture is
requesting to know how to change a
custom shape into a marquee that way he
can cut out a background and he writes I
Adam I just checked out YouTube on
creating switches in fireworks you're
absolutely right him save me loads of
time in Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator
can you tell me of having converted the
swoosh to path to marquee it's possible
to erase the background so I'm left with
a swoosh shaped hole in the background
layer thanks very much John okay John
what we're going to do is we're in
fireworks here and I have a couple of
custom swooshes let me get rid of those
first let me tell you what I've got here
we had a little background image
rectangle with the gradient and that's
just to show contrast once we punch out
and here we have a custom shape it's
just a rectangle that I drew out and
here we have a bitmap image probably
what you're talking about something that
you'd want to cut out but I'm going to
show you how to do both okay so let's
grab the spiral tool drag it out let's
zoom in by holding ctrl and mouse
wheeling so just the spirals to get it
to the look we want now right about
there
now let's go ahead and press ctrl-c
ctrl-v and I didn't show this in the
last lesson but this is an easier method
and even easier method of creating thick
swooshes you just put the one on top the
one we copied and pasted it on top of
the original you just modify it spirals
see how much easier that is it's so easy
it's tough is anybody can do it okay so
let's click the pen tool now click this
edge come around here click that edge
now let's give it a black fill and no no
border or no outline now we have our
shape here okay let's press ctrl-c
ctrl-v to make a copy of that and drag
it over to where we want to cut out over
here and this is my buddy Shane and I
have rights to display this picture he
told me he said go ahead add him use my
picture he said put your swirly up my
nose cut out my head that's what I'm
going to do okay so let's for this one
is very easy you just keep it as a path
and here is another rectangle the
rectangles so these are basically two
paths so you highlight both of them go
to modify combine paths and punch so
that's how you effectively punch out a
custom shape that you make out of a
rectangle that's just a default shape in
fireworks that you draw out just a
rectangle or any shape but it has to be
a path shape okay so now with this one
you just go to modify convert paths
marquee and that addresses your question
and you can go to three options here
until I is hard or feather I'm going to
go with anti Elias I'm going to press ok
now I can use my mouse not my mouse my
keyboard arrow keys to move this thing
around and position it before it gets
cut out
I'm going to show you a little trick
here you can use both pieces if you just
at this point you can press ctrl x or
you can just grab it and move it you see
that let's put it over here that's it
now you didn't have to keep this piece
but if you happen to want to keep this
little piece and you can to use in some
kind of cool graphics that you're making
slicing things out and if you don't want
it you could have just press ctrl x and
if at this point you want to get rid of
it just erase it that's it there you go
you can see how we've effectively cut
out using custom shapes out of a bitmap
and out of a little stock shape and fire
Wars okay go hope you enjoyed that one
will see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
