show the design process of a government
seal using fireworks graphics editor so
during this exercise you can learn some
cool design tactics that you can carry
into many different types of design
projects that you're commissioned for by
clients or for your own projects now if
you're using a different equally
powerful graphics editor you can do the
same exact thing that we're about to do
but the options might have different
names in your favorite tool but all the
workflow would be exactly the same the
first thing we shall do is create a new
fireworks PNG document with 1000 pixels
height 500 pixels okey then we're going
to draw an ellipse we're gonna hold
shift to make sure it remains a perfect
circle then we're going to take that
ellipse and put it in the center of our
canvas now let's give it a black edge
and let's remove the fill now we'll hit
our text tool and type in the text that
we want let's grab it and put it in the
center above the ellipse I'm going to
Center align it now let's hit the text
tool again and put the country and that
one's already Center aligned so let's
place it in the center of the canvas and
we're also going to decrease the font
size okay next we're going to highlight
our ellipse and we're going to press
ctrl-c ctrl-v then we're going to press
control V again so what we have are
three ellipses but don't move them now
while holding shift I'm going to
highlight the text that I want and the
shape I'm gonna go to text attached to
path now if it happens to attach to the
path in that way you can just simply hit
the scale tool and rotate it holding
shift to where it hits specific angles
and then put it where you want it now
since the center aligned I can change
the font size and you see what happens
okay so let's move that one up just a
little bit now let's highlight the other
text and while holding shift we're going
to highlight the next ellipse now let's
go to text attached to path now let's
also rotate that one hit our pointer
tool and we can drag it around anywhere
we want a while it's highlighted we're
going to go to text and reverse direct
now let's go ahead and rotate it and put
it back into place let's change the font
size let's move this one back down into
place now if I was to take another
ellipse and draw it around everything we
can move our texts aside and check the
dimensions to make sure they're both
even dimensions so let's just put this
one on 450 450 and we can just move
these out of the way and get it centered
in the canvas now let's go ahead and put
our text this one needs to be a little
bit smaller so let's just scale it down
okay so we can go ahead and remove this
last inner ellipse control X just get it
out of there and put your text back into
place and put this text back into place
now you'll notice that this ellipse
needs to be a little bit bigger because
the text is wrapped in a reverse
direction inside of the shape or inside
of the path so what I'm going to do is
go to text detach from path then I'm
just gonna make this ellipse larger and
make sure it has even numbers I'm go to
text attached to path and you just play
with it until you get the correct
curvature now I'm going to go to shapes
and grab a star and I'll draw a star
right here and then I'll copy that
control C control V and drag the copy to
the other side now the rest is pretty
easy and straightforward we don't need
this outer ellipse anymore unless you
want to have it so this outer ellipse
I'm going to bring the edge up to maybe
three and I'm going to draw another
ellipse in the center of the text make
sure it has even numbers even dimensions
no that looks pretty good I can move
this one up a little bit and if you want
you can also grab a donut and draw the
donut in and then make it the size that
you want you move that to the side and
get rid of these ellipse
if you don't want just lines maybe you
want a solid color now press ctrl shift
down arrow key to send it to the back
and change the color of it then you can
use your arrow keys to just put it
exactly where it needs to go bring this
in a little bit yeah that looks good to
me
actually it's bringing it a little bit
more and you can also give this dark
edge of any size usually it's changing
from black to a gold color and then
let's put the fill back to white okay
now I went to file and import and I
imported other graphics that I have and
I'm gonna put them into place
copy that control-c control-v flip the
new copy and drag it into place bring
this down a little bit and there we go
and then I can highlight all those
together group them and then scale it
then put it back in the center and you
can do anything you want with the
graphics now I'll just highlight
everything together press ctrl G then
I'll press control-c control-v to make a
new copy and now I'll go to modify
flatten and then shrink it down to the
size that it's going to display on the
webpage or in print design or wherever
it's going to display so you can see it
looks nice and crispy when you shrink it
down and everything's legible so that's
how it's done folks I hope you've
enjoyed this exercise and if you'd like
to be an operative in the National
cyberspace defense agency you can
contact me and I'll put you through a
rigorous training process to get you
ready to defend global cyberspace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
