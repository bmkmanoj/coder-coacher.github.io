that's accompanied by a free source file
and develop PHP calm in the flash tab
will show you how to dynamically render
and place list components using flash
ActionScript 3 and also when the user
clicks one of your list items we show
you how to access the value of what they
clicked and display it on stage I'm
going to select create new flash
ActionScript 3 file and once inside I'm
gonna resize my stage to maybe 300 wide
200 high you go to 40 that looks great
now I'm going to add another layer call
the bottom layer double click it and
rename it status text top 1a s3 short
for ActionScript 3 on the ASX layer or
the status text layer I'm going to drag
out a dynamic text field give it the
name of status text instance name and
this is going to be reporting what the
user clicks on in the list I'm gonna
make like simulated mp3 player list
status text single line 30s a little bit
large
24:22 let's enter it okay yep okay now
we're going to program in the data grid
let's get this off the a has to relay it
first put it on the status text layer
and we can walk the as3 layer now let's
highlight the as3 layer and press f9
here we're going to type in the import
for the controls for the list
that way we can use it now let's go into
the components library and drag out a
list component put it on stage
everything's locked let's put it on this
layer
now I'll highlight it and press control
X get it off stage and I do that so we
have that instance now in our library so
now we can use it dynamically easily
enough okay so now the next line we're
going to create the the new instance of
the list component that way we can place
it dynamically okay let's get back in
our actions panel by pressing f9 and
type in var list
list equals new list
so now we have a new list object with an
instance name of list okay now we're
going to say list dot set sighs this is
going to set the sizing the width and
height of the entire list object and
inside we're going to go 100 by 100 a
little square you can make yours any
size you want so 100 comma 100 now I'm
going to claim the move property that
way we can place it directly where we
want to with the exact coordinates we
want on stage I'm gonna place mine at
maybe 80 exposition and a Y position of
30 semicolon and now we can start adding
items to the list so we say list dot add
item and we open and close parentheses
semi-colon within the parentheses we're
gonna open and close the curly brackets
with a curly brace and inside the curly
brace we're gonna add the word label
colon and then string and that string is
going to be what's what appears on that
list item
so let's AC control C on that now
control V trophy trophy
let's make seven of them so let's track
one two three four five six and track
seven okay now all we have to do is add
child list
and that's pretty much the basics of
populating it but the data you want and
adding it to stage so let's see if that
works let's press control enter and
there it is you can see the scroll
automatically comes up because we only
made it 100 by 100 and it has seven
items in it if there was only five items
in it it wouldn't need it scroll bar
here but it automatically puts its
scrollbar there and that way the user
can get to all the items no matter what
size you make it and when they click
right now it's not doing anything yet
because we haven't programmed that in
yet so let's do that right now let's
make it report to this status text field
the value of the label that the person
clicked now let's head back into our
actions panel and right under that let's
add an event listener to that list
component
and it's going to be event that change
all caps and the name of the function
will be item click makes a good sense
just ctrl C on that now let's make the
function here's the function that fires
off on the change event and this is
going to be event :
defend : void open a curly brace close
the curly brace now we have a nice
function nest now inside we're just
gonna make that status test field on
stage update each time they select an
item there this is going to be equal to
you selected and then the value is going
to be placed in by claiming we're going
to append to that text and use the event
target the event object which will be
the list event that target
got selected index our selected item
without label so that will effectively
give us the label value of what they
select so let's try that out
see you select the track five you just
like the track seven track three and if
this was an mp3 player you just start
playing that track okay so now let's
move that bad boy over a little about 94
that's better and let's see let's take a
look at this here see how it says event
target that selected item dot label I
can take this list instance name and
replace event that target with that list
instance and it's the same thing
see it's the same exact functionality so
that shows you exactly what that event
that target is doing
it's just targeting the object that
happens to be access isn't accessing
this function that's all it does so
event that target is equal to list and
let me show you another trick I'm going
to show you how instead of having to
write all of these in you can make a
simple little quick loop that will
handle it all so let's see let's go here
right here where all of these are
rendered in let's go ahead and comment
those out and let's place in a loop a
loop is nice for dynamics that way you
don't have to code a lot of things in if
you're gonna have similar naming and so
what we do is we create a for loop that
has an index starting at one and if the
index happens to be less than 8
it keeps iterating over the loop and
right here the index gets added to using
plus plus each time so each time it runs
through the loop the index gets added to
until it reaches 8 and then it doesn't
run through the loop anymore so let's
see what happens
oops we have no property of I because we
did not claim that
right here let's put bar I listen
integer okay now you see there that's
how you can run a loop a dynamic loop to
populate your list items rather than
having do it the manual way or the long
way that I did first so I'm just gonna
comment this out but I'll leave it in
there for you guys if you'd like to use
it let's open that back up okay
so that pretty much shows you how to
populate and dynamically create and
position your list component I items in
