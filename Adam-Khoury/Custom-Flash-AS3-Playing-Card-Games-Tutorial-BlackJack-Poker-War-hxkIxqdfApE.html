tutorial in this short series we're
gonna delve in to learning how to create
custom card games in flash from scratch
and maybe this file because I'm going to
deliver the free source file and and the
video for the tutorial now maybe this
file can serve as template to people who
want to expand and and work on any kind
of card games that they weren't built
from scratch and so we're gonna be using
ActionScript 3 I'm working in flash cs3
professional and you can be in flash cs4
professional working with ActionScript 3
and the first thing we'll focus focus on
focus is getting this these cards into
flash so that way we'll have each one as
a movie clip we'll export it for
ActionScript once it's in the library as
a movie clip that way they don't have to
all be sitting on stage all the time we
can just use the ones that we need or
you can use the whole deck on stage you
can see I got a couple of jokers and
there's a back there alright so let's
create a new ActionScript 3 file and I'm
gonna resize this stage a little bit to
680
so we can pay on the page to fill the
PHP and then maybe 4 4444 ok and that
looks good now we need a table so to
bring out a rectangle and I'm gonna make
my table look like we're looking at it
with a bird's eye view from the top kind
of like a folding like a fold-out table
make it nice dark green like the casino
felt colors
I don't know I don't I don't gamble so I
don't know what the colors are for these
things make the edge a little brown
they're beautiful okay so you can have
room for buttons and it really doesn't
matter what it looks like that's not
gonna be the focus of all this this is
gonna be more of a programming lesson
but so you can take time to make yours
really beautiful mine's just going to be
a programming type template to where
people with nice decks of cards nice
tables graphic setup so you can lay it
all in there and still use the same
programming but mine is gonna be a
bird's-eye view of a fold out green felt
table how you like that okay so now I'm
leaving a little bit of room on the side
here and now what I have to do is get
the cards into flash so I'm just good
I'm just going to bring them all in
right here on this layer this first
layer we created plop them right in
there and first I'm going to go into
fireworks here let's go here and let's
just so you guys can see it all there we
go
okay let's get rid of those and do that
go to open all dese there we go so now
fireworks will open all of those or you
can do that with photoshop or whatever
okay there's everybody now but doesn't
need the Joker's but the Joker's are
cool huh pretty cool yeah we're all
right okay so let's go ahead and I'm
gonna show you the process that I'll do
for the first card and each other 52
will be the same so I'm gonna grab
number one which is just close that so
you don't
just grab the real number one there we
go
control C and in flash control V just
plop it right on stage current frame as
movie clip okay now we're gonna repeat
that process number two
wherever number two will be why they're
not in order there control C and so I'm
not gonna record all of this obviously
but I'm gonna bring all 52 in and then
we'll resume okay that took all of five
minutes and so that wasn't too bad I got
kind of into a rhythm as I was going so
here's all the cards so they just all
stacked in there I'm gonna highlight all
of them make sure I deselect that table
or that rectangle back there and press
control X now they're all off the stage
and they're all in the library as
fireworks objects see they don't have
the bitmap and the movie clip so what
I'm gonna do is go through and give each
one just to make the system a little
more dynamic and code it out right from
the beginning I'm going to give each
linkage for ActionScript each of these
movie clips so in copy
we got copy 2 looks like it starts with
copy 2
so correct 53 yeah
so with copy 2 this is going to be card
1 so I'm going to go in I didn't want to
click that I'm going to highlight it go
to linkage and now export for
ActionScript export in first frame
that's fine and even if we need if we
need a loader for this file once we get
done we might put it in what we might
not need it let's see this will be card
1 and we'll name all of those all 52
card 1 through card 52 but when we use
an ActionScript we'll just refer to it
as C 1 or C 52 you know
ok so press ok and it'll give you the
little ActionScript warning and just
don't warn me again because I know that
but I'll leave that there because it's
good for my tutorials to show that ok
and now all I have to do let's see let
me grab a little bit of code here that I
have waiting
right there and I'll explain it
no don't need to save that so let's just
pop it in here for temp temporarily and
I'll show you what it does since I named
that first one in the library in the
linkage we gave it card one the others
don't have it yet but we're going to
give it we can refer to that as an
object now even though it's in the
library and we can add it to the stage
let me press control enter
you see there's that card one sitting on
stage it's not positioned anywhere where
we want it yet but you should it shows
how you just bring it in right from the
library any movie clips you want and
they can be manipulated objects buttons
whatever so what happens is we create a
new a new object from that movie clip
that's in the library and the reason why
I brought them all from fireworks in
that way laid him in on stage as movie
clips is because this code works well
with movie clips and if it was just
bitmaps like if you tried to put that on
the bitmap that linkage you would get
errors and it would ask you for more
arguments within the creation of this
object right here and I don't really
want to do that I'd rather go this route
and just create the object through a
movie clip then the object is a movie
clip and so we put it into a new movie
clip on stage right here let's see we
might not even have to do that let's
check let's see if we comment this out
add child see one yeah we didn't even
need those other two lines its export
yep
seesaw that's very simple you just add
it right to stage and but we may need to
convert them to movie clips so we'll
keep this code handy but for now it
looks like we don't need it but when we
get to having to manipulate them and
move them around and such it might not
be necessary for them to be movie clips
but we'll cross that bridge when we come
to it
if we have to make them into movie clips
we know how to okay so actually to make
this code work it would be more like
this card clip add child c1 and then add
child card clip and it would be the same
effect it just adds it inside of that
new movie clip press ctrl-z okay so that
shows you how to get your deck of cards
all set up into the flash library and
ready for action scripting so basically
we can just take them out with a loop
once we get them all named and so what
I'm going to do is go and name all of
these give them proper linkage this one
would be card too so let's go to the
linkage and go through all 52 like that
export name is card too okay
and just do all 52 like that that won't
take you very long and then or you can
just grab my source files if you want to
just build off of these and then make
your own card graphics but we'll
continue on and in part 2 before this
video gets too long and in part 2 we'll
work on bringing it out to stage or
maybe just a certain number of them well
basically what we're gonna do is just go
we're gonna shoot for setting up
standard blackjack game and we might
probably won't get all the way through
to a finished product but I'll get you
guys started real nice ok we'll see you
in part 2 and I'm just gonna make a new
playlist series for this a whole new
section for card games flash card games
we'll see you in part 2 of building
flash custom card games from scratch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
