demonstrating how to create a simple
text email link if you don't have the
dynamics to run a PHP contact form or an
ASP contact form on your server you can
use this method to create a simple email
link to where the the users default
email application will open up and what
I have here is if you guys already know
how to do this just go ahead and click
away now cuz it'll waste your time but
for beginners this is handy to know if
you uh if you notice I have a client
site here that I'm working on and it's
in to the movie site and the movies in
pre-production and I'm going to they
requested a Contact Us link at the top
here they don't have the dynamics on
their server for a full-fledged contact
form yet so I'm just going to type in I
selected my text tool here and make sure
it's a static text and I select the the
font that I want and I type in contact
us you can have it say email me or
whatever whatever text you want there
make it a little bigger make it about
eighteen point on the font and then now
we go down here to where the link symbol
is and you type in that that box put
your cursor in that box and you type in
mail - all one word no spaces in this
string so male 2 :
and the email in question info at the
life we chose com
so you put the client's email there and
anybody can email them now when they
click that link and that's how easy it
is now when I publish out let's go ahead
and press f12
see what we get let's go ahead and skip
the intro click on that link see what
happens
oh look at that Outlook Express opened
up ok that's it we'll see you next
