ActionScript 3 lesson I'm gonna
demonstrate and show you how to code out
and graphically create all the elements
on stage and flash that you need for a
browse and upload files using
ActionScript 3 so you build a little
application that lets users upload files
to you and it gives them a nice upload
progress bar that's dynamic that runs to
show them the upload progress which you
don't get with traditional HTML upload
forms and it's kind of cool stuff like
MySpace and YouTube does so if you have
upload abilities for your members and
your websites to upload files you might
want to use this flash so you can give
them a better indication of what's going
on so let's go ahead and check it out
let's click browse file so i'm gonna
click browse file opens the file dialog
to search my computer and you see it
only lets them upload the files that i
specified with within the filter arrays
in ActionScript there's two filter
definitions and then they're packed into
an array in ActionScript and one is for
text files ones for images and you can
set whatever types extensions you want
in there okay so let's grab an image
take that white squirrel right there and
it loads the name into this dynamic text
field here waiting on stage so you can
see the name of the image the user sees
the name and then the uploaded now
button appears magically and a progress
bar so when they hit upload it now I
made a little flashing movie clip that
appears that says uploading please be
patient and there's the progress bar
moving right along you can also easily
implement a progress text and put the
text percentage
running along with that bar but it would
be redundant
all you need is the bar or the text one
or the other you don't really need both
people understand what progress bars are
and what they do and they understand
that when the end of it happens it's a
hundred percent so you really don't need
the progress text in there so when it
gets finished what will happen is it'll
give the user a little message saying
with the text of the name of the file in
it right here here come's
there it is it says image rapid barrage
that JPEG has been uploaded and the
upload button is gone you'll notice and
the progress bar is gone and there's
some pretty tricky things I do in flash
to make that happen you'll notice once
you open download the Fla file the
source files and you download the Fla
and you look at the ActionScript you'll
see how I did it and what's cool is they
can just upload another one so see
upload a smaller one this time so it
goes faster and there's the progress bar
shows up again and the the upload it now
button is back again it's magic so there
it goes it's uploaded nice and quick and
then you'll see the text string down
here changes to say this new dot JPEG
has been uploaded develop PHP JPEG has
been uploaded the upload button is gone
and the the load bar is gone so it's
exactly what you need and it loads the
image on your server it uploads the
image to your server to a file a folder
called images which is also in the
package everything you need is in that
package so go ahead and download it but
let's take a look at the ActionScript
now and the stage on stage I have well I
have three layers up in the timeline
that have elements on them and we have
the first one is the blocker clip and
you'll notice if I move my blocker clip
it's a movie clip it's just a white
rectangle that's all it is it's a movie
clip that can be set to invisible or
visible depending
on the need in the coat so if I move it
you'll see there's my upload it now
button progress bar and that little
movie clip so let's go ahead and put
that back and that's on its own layer
all by itself and then the upload
elements are it's everything for the
form and then this big white rectangle
is on its own layer and it's called
background and that's pretty much it so
all the form elements for the upload are
on the uploader elements layer there and
now at the ActionScript slate on the
ActionScript layer we'll take a look
inside and I'll try and explain the code
really quickly but I've commented above
all of the areas of importance where
things are going to fire off and happen
so you can reference what is happening
where and change things up if you need
to so the first thing we do is we set
the flashing movie clip you press nine
to open your actions panel by the way
but we set the flashing movie clip
that's the the word little blue words
here that flashes we set that to
invisible so visible equals false then
we make our URL request variable and
then we set our image types filter and
our text types filter here and then we
pack them both into an array called
all types and you can define more if you
like in their videos mp3s this is a
really good application for uploading
videos and mp3's because it shows that
progress really nice so something like
YouTube and MySpace and Facebook would
do in their upload applications so you
can be like the big boys with this
and then we set the the file reference
here the file reference object right
there is claimed then we add event
listeners for the file reference there's
this select complete and the progress
listeners and then those functions name
the function names for those three
listeners are right here and then the
functions are down below here here's all
the functions is one two three four five
functions that fire off at the
appropriate times when they need to
according to what's happening and go
ahead and download the Fla file look
inside it but read the comments above
the code if you've dealt with
ActionScript before
inside of every function you'll know
exactly what's going on so it's kind of
like contact form script but it adds the
the element of file upload so like I
said you could I don't know if I
mentioned it but you can add an email in
the name input field here and then when
they press upload it it'll be like a
contact form you can put an email
function in your PHP script to email
everything to you load everything to the
server all kind of nifty things but if
you just want a file upload mechanism
this is the one so let's see there's a
progress Handler this is the one that
deals with setting the progress bar to
show the upload progress and I have mine
set to 200 pixels and you can set it to
any length you want and then the
complete handler function the sync up
the variables synchronized variables
function right there and then the this
pretty much just loads everything up and
gets it ready to be sent to the PHP file
and then the upload bars is the one that
actually uploads it all of these things
this function right here uploads all of
these things and then file reference
that opens the Browse box and
that's pretty much it hope you enjoy
this one and I'll be expanding upon this
to put in ever handling in the PHP we'll
check out max file we'll set a max file
definition a max file size definition
sorry so if you wanted the mp3 that the
person is uploading to be you know 5
megabytes max fight maybe 5 megabytes
max then you can have that happen with
some error handling and I'm gonna be
expanding upon this to make different
things happen I might even put the
contact form together with file upload
or website form with file upload
capabilities ok we'll see you guys next
lesson and we hope you enjoy this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
