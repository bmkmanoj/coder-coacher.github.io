will demonstrate how to create a tiny
mp3 player with to the beat
visualizations and the code for this
project is located directly under where
the video is playing and develop PHP
calm you can go to develop PHP calm
click the flash tab look for this
tutorial in the list click it and where
the video is playing scroll down
underneath it and you'll see the code
that you can copy and paste directly
into your player script layer right here
okay and another thing to realize is in
the code we're referring song mp3 that
needs to live in the same directory the
same folder where this swf is going to
wind up so the song mp3 needs to live in
the same folder if your mp3 is named
cool jam mp3 you want to rename it song
down mp3 and then put it in the same
folder as this swf after you publish it
okay so the first thing we're going to
do is create the skin and that is well
let's look at our canvas size first we
have 1 48 x 24 pixels as our canvas size
and it's set to black background we're
going to click our skin layer and drag
out a rectangle and what before we drag
that out let's see we're going to make
sure we have a fill and a border so
let's give it a border of not so white
and fill of not so black and then draw
out the rectangle on stage any size
double click it to get the fill and the
border highlighted and put it at an
exposition of one and a y position of
one keep it double clicked and resize it
to 146 pixels wide and 22 pixels high
that way it's going to fill our stage
completely and leave no edges that can
be seen on the outside ok now we have
our skin we're going to punch a window
in it to create the
the area where the visuals are going to
display through so let's grab another
rectangle tool and draw it out not so
big this time you keep it nice and thin
and now let's change the fill color on
that what to do that we have to double
click it let's double click it change
the fill color to anything you want
that's not the same color as that gray
so it doesn't blend right in and then
we'll double click the whole symbol
there and drag it down and drag it into
place and then click outside of it and
then click the fill only press ctrl x
and you'll see that you've punched a
window in this gray now you have a
border around the window which is nice
now we can click the buttons layer go up
into window let me show you what i'm
doing here let's drag up click window
common libraries buttons and in that
little window you're going to click play
back rounded double-click it to open the
folder and drag out rounded gray stop
and rounded great play and put them on
stage there and close that window out
now get those lined up to where they're
even and select both of them by right or
left clicking one holding select or
holding shift rather holding down shift
and select the other select both of them
together hit the free transform tool
grab a corner hold shift and resize them
any size you want I want a nice and
small to fit up in my player there so
make them nice and small put them into
place wherever they look right and give
this play button an instance name
of play BTN and a stop button give that
instance name of stop BTN so I play BTN
and stop BTN of the buttons we have a
window open and that's it we're good to
go you can make this thing a lot
prettier you can make these movie click
buttons to make them have animated
effects or you make this thing look like
whatever you want punch this whole
wherever you want along this image and
put the buttons wherever you want on but
that's about it we'll see you next
