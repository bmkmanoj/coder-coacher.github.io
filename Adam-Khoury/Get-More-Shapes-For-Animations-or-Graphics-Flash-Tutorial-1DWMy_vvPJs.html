here the sweetest most lovable tutor on
YouTube everything i say is nice and
everything i do is puppies and sunshine
okay so let's get started i'm working in
flash cs3 so what we'll do is we'll go
i'm just going to use actionscript-3
file because I'm used to that but it
doesn't really matter for this example
it's just going to be all about graphics
and shapes let's click down on the
rectangle tool and see what flash cs3
and cs4 may give us as custom shapes and
maybe there's slight variations
depending on which flash application
you're working in cs3 cs4 mx-9 but in
mine I have oval rectangle and then the
primitive for those two and then the
polystar tool but what if I want
something a little more something a
little more creative like they set the
tool said they give us in fireworks
let's open a new fireworks document 800
y 400 hi
okay now let's click on their shape tool
let's put it back on rectangle because
that's I think where it is at the vault
when you come to open the application
for the first time so let's click down
on that you'll see look at all those
cool shapes you're thinking to yourself
didn't the same people create these two
programs why couldn't they have just put
the same custom stock shapes not custom
but the same stock shapes in both
programs they could have easily done
that I don't see why not anyways I'm
going to demonstrate with the store
let's take the store and you can take
any of those shapes anyone's you want
I'm going to drag it out to stage and
I'm going to adjust the points here
there we go and now i'm going to change
the color to a standard grey i'm going
to press ctrl c go back into flash and
then i'm going to press ctrl v and it's
going to bring it right in no problem
okay so when it does it's going to bring
it in as a movie clip new layer I'm
going to select new layer I'm going to
keep all paths editable and I'm going to
have keep all text editable just in case
I was bringing in text press ok and
there we have it you can see this is a
group shape now let's double click it
you see it is a drawing object now when
you double click on that you'll see it
is a now a native flash shape now not a
lot of people pick up on this and using
Fireworks with flash together makes it
really easy ok so let's click on the pen
tool and actually let's click on the
point the sub selection tool i'll show
you something cool look at this i can
select the points so if i just want this
one point i select it make sure i grab
that just that one did you see what I
just did you see what I just did I just
manipulated a custom stock or a stock
shape from fireworks and flash
that means the whole thing is editable
maneuverable shoppable you know what I'm
saying you can just grab this line right
here and move it look at that come on
how good is that it looks like an eagle
that just got blown up by an m-80 okay
we'll see you next lesson have fun with
shapes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
