to think of a way to let everybody know
in the beginning of this video that it's
not really for the stone-cold beginner
in flash this video's with somebody
already developed decent skills in flash
and they're ready to be a flash rock
star and give away or sell files that
people can configure and adjust without
having or knowing flash yeah
since we covered most of the bases in
logic for this kind of functionality in
the first tutorial I'm going to link to
it here and I'm going to suggest that
you go and watch that first tutorial
about making txt configuration files if
you would like to understand exactly
what we're doing maybe you you're not
understanding exactly what we're doing
how we set up the bile in flash because
all I did was I kept pretty much the
same flash file from the first tutorial
the dot txt config files remember it had
this script that was loading in a dot
txt file and then parsing out the
variables inside of it I just took the
same file and made it work for XML so
it's pretty much the same file the same
elements on stage and we have a new
script now that loads flash config.xml
file instead of a dot txt file and the
script is just a little bit different
for parsing the XML out but you can see
it gathers the variables and puts them
and applies them to the stage objects
pretty much the same way the first one
did so if you really want to understand
what we're doing and the code line by
line you should check out the first one
that discusses creating txt
configuration files because I go over
the script real well and if you're not
really confident with creating XML and
parsing it out and how it all works in
the ActionScript 3 I have a really
in-depth tutorial at develop HP com I'll
show you where that is right now that
way if you don't understand how to how
XML works in flash the fundamentals of
it you can check out this tutorial ok so
since this flash file the first one
called out to a dot txt file this script
calls out to a dot XML file sitting on
the server in the same folder as the
flash file so let's take a look at that
and here it is it's called flash
underscore config.xml we open it like
the person who would be manipulating the
file would
it usually notepad this is what they
will see and a lot of times it's good to
close that out I'm going to create a new
notepad file I'm going to call it read
me and it's going to have instructions
in it place instructions and I don't
want anybody telling me it's too hard
for somebody to go in and change in
xmlnode it's not too hard and maybe
ordinary people who never use the
computer before cannot do it but I see
so many people selling and offering
awesome free flash files that are
configured through XML and somebody who
doesn't know or have flash can just go
in and change that XML file I know a lot
of people are going to try and tell me
that's not a very smart way to give a
content editing system to somebody but
this is a way that's used by industry
professionals all over the world and if
you really want to know how to be the
smartest with it what you do is you
create PHP configuration files which are
more like us content management system
that somebody can use sort of like
joomla where they log into an admin
Center change data so they don't have to
open any txt or XML files but this XML
method is widely used so I don't want to
hear anybody telling me that this is not
an official way to let somebody edit the
content or configure a flash file
because it is it's very widely used now
so this would be you just file save this
as in that same folder with the xml
config file is a dot txt file named read
me just name it read underscore me save
close it now in that boulder when they
download the application that will see
the readme file will open it and will
have instructions telling them how to
adjust this file which is very simple
they just look for the owner name node
and changed what's inside of it the
background color
change what's inside of that the
background size node then you change
what's inside of that then they save it
put it back on server and at runtime the
flash file will suck it up and display
those configurations so this file will
be free for available so this file will
be free available for download as well
as the that text configuration files
example we made the other day from
develop PHP calm and you'll be able to
get to the script and all the elements i
have on stage here and this folder will
have the download package will have this
readme in it the flash config file that
xml file as well as the swf and the
editable source happy coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
