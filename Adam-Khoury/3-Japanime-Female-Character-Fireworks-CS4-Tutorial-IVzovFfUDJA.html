enough to where I could finish drawing
my sexy japanime cartoon girl and so
what I've done is I put the hair on and
I didn't record the video of me putting
the hair and everything on because
making these kind of custom shapes you
know especially for me since I'm so
nitpicky takes me a little while to get
it down so what I'm going to do is
deconstruct her and show you where we
last left off with her and what's been
added that way you can have a good idea
and you should have a pretty good idea
how to use the pen tool by now from the
first two tutorials where we started her
okay so now let's go here here's another
copy over and let's deconstruct our
first we have simple pen shaped tools
wavy lines to kind of match the flow of
the hair a little bit and they have a
gradient set on them a gradient has on
one side bring the properties panel up
on one side the gradient matches the
hair exactly on that section the other
side it's white so it makes a nice
streak and so you can see the hair on
the bottom well first let's just take
those off now you know those are Phil X
ok so let's finish taking our part here
these are beveled just regular beveled
shaped I also made with the pen tool and
they were colored gold to match the eyes
and given an inner bevel you see inner
bevel 35 100% softness 10 angle 90
that's that let's get rid of those X and
I gave her hair you can see when I made
the hair this is this is what I made
first right
I made this one first I drew that out
with the pen tool very carefully and
then I made this copy that that goes on
top of it using the first one kind of
like a template and just moving the
anchor points around to get it to where
I needed it and then you can see
everything kind of matched up and puts
like highlights on our hair so that's
why I did that let's get rid of that
this was the first one I drew let's get
rid of that now you see under the hair
put that back on here's the hair and
right under the hair there's another
layer it kind of matches the hair a
little bit and before I stuck on these
ponytails I put that under the hair and
so if you remove that you'll see on the
face their shadows and they just kind of
match where that where the hair is
placed so it looks like it's sitting
above the face a little bit not just so
2d right on it and if you'll notice i
put a blur and I changed its opacity
brought its opacity down to 39 so let me
reverse my steps bring the opacity up to
100 okay so black again I'm going to
remove the Gaussian blur however you say
that Gaussian Gaussian Gaussian remove
it and now you can see it's just pen
tool shape regular pin tool shape path
let's remove that now control x
the eyebrows you guys saw the nose you
saw I traded the open mouth for a pair
of lips and that's just drawn out with
the pen tool and that has an inner glow
to give it like a soft black inner glow
and also has a glow of white around it
slight glow of white around it and I
show you that right now remove the white
glow and also remove the inner glow okay
let's just pink pink lips there's also a
white glow behind it of the same shape
just to give the face more depth and if
I bring this one up let's get rid of the
Gaussian blur on that bring that one all
the way up you can see it's just a white
shape just like this pink shape and
that's what I'm sitting behind that and
she's starting to look like Gollum and
here was the lip separator and then
these are just little tiny pen tool
shapes that I created to give the lips
more depth dimple ish kind of effect
take the Gaussian blur off of those
bring them all the way up in their
opacity and you'll see what they are
exactly see say she has a little
chinaman mustache now control x get
those out of there and the ears i shape
some ears and stuck them back they're
not really done with this but look
pretty good so far so let's get rid of
the ears and those are just shapes you
can make with the pen tool that's why I
didn't record all of this with the I
don't I didn't want to have all of this
on video would have been me sitting
there for 30 minutes making all this
stuff and it's I mean once you
understand what the tools do and you can
see me reverse engineering it here
you'll know exactly what the elements
are having play or I have at play
so here to make the cheeks little rosy I
have a couple of ellipse regular
ellipses let's bring their opacity all
the way up and get rid of the Gaussian
blur you can see that the regular little
red ellipses they had Gaussian blur and
the opacity was down on them a bit let's
get rid of those and that is it and then
I stuck in just a temporary neck and
that's just a regular shape also made
with the pen tool and there was a shadow
on the neck with the head would be
rendering a shadow onto the neck my jam
and that is it that's everything I added
and so when we last left off she kind of
look like that and I kind of touched up
the shape of her face a little so she
didn't have so much of a jaw like a man
she still kind of looks a little ladyboy
yesh she's a little sexy it's not bad
and I'll continue on in my own with this
character but i just wanted to show you
guys how you can make cool cartoon
characters for your web pages to
represent make little mascots for
yourself and you can use fireworks to
make them you don't have to jump into
illustrator or photoshop necessarily
fireworks is a very powerful tool that
can do many great things for the web
okay we'll see you next listen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
