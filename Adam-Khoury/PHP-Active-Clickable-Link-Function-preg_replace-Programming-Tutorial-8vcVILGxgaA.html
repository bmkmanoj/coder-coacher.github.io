maker URL into a linker Abra abracadabra
going to be just like magicka
in this quick little PHP programming tip
we will share a function and after you
put it into place on your site your
function or class whatever way that you
want to establish this function will
automatically turn any URL strings found
in data into active clickable links and
you would use this function on your data
on the way out from your database not on
the way in so it's really only for page
rendering purposes and you wouldn't
ordinarily want to convert your URL
strings to actual link tags on the way
into the database for storage only on
the way out but it really it could be
converted going on its way in if you
need it to but traditionally people use
this sort of thing on the data when it's
coming out to render on the page okay
now I'm starting with a PHP file that's
named quick code test dot PHP but you
can name yours I am way better than Adam
dot PHP you can see I have my opening
PHP and closing PHP tags in the first
line I'm just going to establish an
example testing string and they might
have many URL references in their data
as you can see that there's no HTML
there's no link tag or anything like
that it's just a string a URL string and
it could have the HTTP and all that on
the front or it could just be the www
whatever and it will still convert it
alright so for this approach we're going
to use two arrays and the first array is
going to be named find and your second
array is going to be named replace and
there's two items or elements in each of
those arrays and they're separated by
commas here now I'm not going to go in
depth about the regular expression logic
used here because learning regular
expression logic well for JavaScript or
PHP could really take you up to one to
three weeks of dedicated study time
depending on how much you want to know
and how intelligent you are I'm just
gonna throw the function at you to use
it if you want to use it but I recommend
studying all of the modifiers and
special character functionality of
regular expression programming to become
fully knowledgeable about it and also
keep in mind that if you google search
for scripts like this you can find many
different ways that coders make this
magic happen so what you're about to see
is just one of the main
ways to skin this particular cat okay
now one those two arrays we're going to
run the preg replace function on our
original string so you can see we're
just claiming the string variable again
and we're making that equal to Kraig
replace with the parameters of find the
find array goes here the replace array
goes here and then the string data that
you want to do the replacing in so
basically everywhere in the data where
there's any URL strings those URL
strings are going to be replaced with
actual clickable link tags okay here's
what we get when it renders to the
browser you can see now I have an active
clickable link and if I click that we
set it up to open a new tab so it opens
a new tab with develop PHP comm in it
and the reason why it opens a new
because we put target blank here now
what we're going to do is go up into the
PHP and we're going to make this more of
like a modular function so you can
either make a modular external function
that you include into your PHP scripts
that need it that way you can use this
function over and over again or you can
create a class file and we did a whole
bunch of class file creation tutorials
that develop PHP recently so if you go
into the video section there I think I
have some a whole bunch of PHP class
file programming tutorials there for you
now that's if you want to turn this into
a class file which it's not even
necessary you could just make this a
dynamic include so let's name this
function something that is identifiable
to what the function does so let's say
activate URL or URLs
actually URL strings and we'll camelcase
that open close parenthesis opening
curly brace go down a couple of lines
and put in your closing curly brace now
we can just take all of this here
control X and put it right inside the
function so you have find array and the
replace array and now here you can just
remove where the string variable is
input return so what it'll do is it will
return the value of all these things
replaced by preg replace to wherever
this script is being called from so
let's temporarily remove this echo and
we're going to make the string variable
equal to
activate URL strings function and we're
gonna have to send a parameter of string
through that function so let's pass that
as an argument through that function and
we'll have to scoop it up right here so
we can just name this STR short for
string and now make sure you put STR
right there where you had string before
now your function is set up to be
dynamic to where in any of the scripts
on your site if you include this
function any of the scripts on your site
can just call this function using this
line right here so you just activate URL
strings by passing the string variable
through that function then you simply
echo and let's change this to YouTube
now test this on your PHP enabled server
and now I'm going to refresh my test
page you can see now I have a new link
to youtube.com and the script is still
running the same way it did before but
now it's modular you can take this and
put it into its own separate PHP file
and simply call it into as many pages on
your website that are going to need it
so you guys know how to use the include
or include once functions you can just
call that external function in from its
own little file that way you won't have
to have this code sitting in many
different pages of your site or you can
choose to make this a class and then you
can program against it in an
object-oriented approach okay so what
I've done is added a couple of code
comments for you guys and it says right
above the function this function can be
externally included as a dynamic
reusable module for your software
systems and then this comment says this
is the code that calls that function to
run basically this is the line that
calls the function to run we're
executing the function right there we're
passing whatever data that we want
through it as an argument and that
argument runs through the function here
and it is returned after pregger
does its replacing now I've done
tutorials on this sort of logic many
years ago it was using the air egg
replace functions remember the air egg
type replace functions they've been
deprecated in PHP for a little while now
we use preg replace now so years ago for
the web intersect tutorial series I
showed
to make active clickable links within
that software but it was using a
different PHP function and now some of
you guys will remember that script but
here today at web intersect Schaller a
member we have named Schaller and and by
the way you can't sign up for web
intersect yet
okay so Schaller gave us an example of
how to do this in another way this is
another way to skin the same exact cat
and you can see has a function called
make active link and if you want to find
this page on web intersex you can
probably just type in make a link
clickable in the search bar up here and
you'll find his little blog or you can
see it on the home page if you go there
soon so go to web intersect comm and you
can find his blog and you can see his
example that shows the same kind of
function make active link and you can
see all the code that he has at work in
it and he's using regular expression
with preg replace same like I'm doing
but his is a little more robust and as
you can see it says this will make an
active link when anything has an HTTP or
an email is posted to the to the data so
maybe an email string I think his also
converts email strings to clickable
links and he uses the mail to syntax
right there to make the users default
mail program come up so they can just
email that person right away now you can
see his example is a little bit more
robust than mine and mine is this
function we have here is only for making
clickable a tag links and not emails so
mine is a little more basic his is a
little more robust and like I told you
you can find so many examples online for
different ways to skin this cat with
many different regular expression
approaches okay so I hope you've found
this tutorial helpful and look into
regular expression programming more and
like I said you could spend weeks on
learning nothing but regular expression
mastery you can master regular
expression programming if you take a few
weeks to do nothing but that experiment
with that write some scripts archive
those scripts and hold on to them but
honestly there's so many examples online
men
you don't even have to write your own
regular expressions they're already
written all you got to do is just go
snatch them up buddy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
