learn how to read mouse coordinates and
use those values in your application
this is the finished product of what
you'll be learning how to program within
this video lesson you'll be creating a
document that reads mouse movement so
you're reading the X plane which is the
horizontal plane and you're also reading
the Y plane so you can see as I get
closer to the top left corner it starts
to near zero you see the numbers go both
near zero as I get to the top but as I
move this way horizontally the X plane
number rises and falls as I move down
the page this way with my mouse you can
see that second number getting higher
and lower right that's the first number
is your X plane and the second number is
your Y plane we're going to begin with a
bare-bones html5 web document and in the
body element you can see I have the body
element ready to go and my head element
is in place and it already has a script
element within it and I can put my
JavaScript right there okay okay so in
the body I'm going to type in this
sentence and then I'm going to wrap that
in h1 element and then under that I'm
going to just put in 0 and then one line
down another 0 I'm going to highlight
that 0 and press ctrl - if you're in
Dreamweaver you can press ctrl 2 and
that will just wrap it in the heading
for you ok now this first h2 element on
the page let's give that an ID of X
result X underscore result let's just
copy that ID and put in the next h2
element the ID of Y result now what's
going to happen on the pages in this h2
element with an ID of X result this
number is going to change to show us the
x coordinates of where the user's mouse
is as they're moving it around the
screen the same thing for this h2
element but this will show the Y
coordinates of where the muse
users Mouse's as they move it around the
screen and we'll be using these ID
values to communicate to these elements
using javascript and that's all the HTML
that we're going to require this basic
example now let's work on the JavaScript
and if you want in your script element
you can put in the type attribute that
is
javascript or you can leave it out I
don't think it's necessary in html5
documents but if you put it in it's not
an error or anything it works both ways
now the first line of JavaScript is we
want to access the document object and
target it's on mouse move event handler
and we're going to make that fire off a
function every time the mouse moves
anywhere in the document we're going to
make it by off the function called read
mouse move semicolon so all we need now
above this line is the function called
read mouse move so let's copy that
type in the word function paste in read
Mouse move open close parenthesis put
the opening curly brace and go down a
couple of lines in with the closing
curly brace and there's your function
nest all set up now when the document
onmousemove event fires off we want to
pass the event itself through the
function as an argument so you can just
put e and this e refers to the event of
mouse move on the document first we're
going to do is create a variable that is
for the result X on the page and I know
I'm putting the underscore on the other
side because I don't want it to have the
same exact name you could make it have
the same exact name just put X result
right there then you say document dot
get element by ID then we'll put the ID
in between single quotes there the ID is
X result you don't have the name at X
result you can name it result X so this
is just a reference for this element
here result X so let's do the same thing
and let's get result Y as a variable
reference for the Y result element on
the page down here now all we have to do
is adjust the inner HTML properties to
read what the mouse coordinates are so
let's take this one let's do X first say
result X that inner HTML is equal to e
which is this event that we are
referencing from the onmousemove of the
document e dot client x semicolon and
now you can just highlight that line do
the same thing for the Y plane with a Y
position dot client upper case Y now
let's take a look at
what we have and I've tested this in
Firefox Internet Explorer Chrome Safari
Opera and all the major modern browsers
in older browsers we used to have to do
some workarounds and put in some if
conditions to make sure that certain
event properties will be accessible to
us but now every browser has this event
property accessible to it so you don't
have to do many workarounds with this in
all Mountain browsers now okay all right
so let's take a look at this it's
publish it just view it in your favorite
browser software and you'll see that as
you move your mouse around this little
h1 or h2 and this h2 the first one is
reading the x coordinates and the second
number is the Y coordinates so the X is
the horizontal plane this way so you can
see how the numbers are growing when I
move my mouse this way on the X plane
now watch when I move this way the other
number is getting smaller and larger as
I go up and down if I go to the corner
it's going to be zero zero eventually
see and that's how it all works and you
can animate things according to these
numbers that are moving right along
there okay so now the last thing I want
to mention to you guys is that it
doesn't have to actually be the whole
document that you put on Mouse move or
if you wanted to have just a div or a
box some element on the page that you
want to put the onmousemove
event handler on you can do that it
doesn't have to be on the whole document
it could be on a div like div 1 dot
onmousemove
equals read mouse move and it would do
the same thing essentially but just over
that one div ok and I can also show you
guys if you want how to take this
application and use it to make a little
button or some kind of object an image
or whatever you want follow the mouse
around the page alright a rolling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
