going to assemble a Twitter clone we're
going to have to create a table that's
going to hold all of this data within
our original database that we made for
the site and we can use the script that
we created the first table with open
that script create table and then let's
modify this so let's save it as say
create DB underscore table underscore
blabbing and that's what we'll name the
table as well so we can just copy that
right there right here we connect to the
MySQL database we get sick success in
database connection print it to the page
then we're going to create table
blabbing okay now inside of that table
we don't want all the same data that we
put inside of the registration table you
got to change it up so let's make ID
field remain the same because we want an
auto increment ID for each post each
blab and we're calling our is blabbing
because if you call George tweeting you
might get in some trouble you don't want
to do that and so let's see let's open
the login form
let's see right there we can access
these session variables ID first name
and email really all I need okay so
really all we need to store is the
member ID person that's doing the
blabbing for that post we don't need any
of this other junk but we do need a text
field for the blab actually we're going
to make it a bar chart 255 and weight
can be any greater than 255 characters
so let's go ahead and remove all of this
so we have ID we'll save one of those
bar chart right there will change that
to blab the blab call it the blab
okay and we'll need a member ID field as
well so let's take this copy that I
think we can get rid of all of these
will need a date so let's keep that sign
update let's also get rid of that body
nope
no no no no ok will make the unique key
be the blab nope
there are no need for that do not need
it okay so let's try that I think we
have everything we need so let's call
this ID call this you ID or mm ID so
member ID this will be not auto
increment not know
it looks great so this will hold the ID
for the blab this will hold the ID for
the member who blabbed and this will be
the blab no larger than 255 characters
and we will allow we'll see what will
allow their we make the script and the
sign update is going to change to blab
date
okay so on the blab date field this
wants to be changed to date time and now
we're going to add the defaults for the
time 0 0 colon 0 0 colon 0 0 and now it
will hold time as well as date that way
we can order everything precisely by
down to the second of when the post was
made and let's see I think that's
everything we need we have the ID its
auto increment the member ID is not auto
increment the the blab itself which is
of our char 255 and the blab date which
is daytime set as a daytime field and
has a default of this here which holds
zeros for the date and the times and
then we have the primary I key is going
to be ID now we say if my Skrill result
which is the same variable name is
success in lab table blabbing table
creation now delete the file from server
name create bulava great DV underscore
table blabbing and we're ready to move
on let us go else if it doesn't get
created no table created you have
problems in the system in the script
dripping somewhere it could be anywhere
I don't know what the hell you people
are doing to my files ok so do the exit
perfect so now we have the table all set
up that we need now let's run it let's
put it on the server let's reconnect
reconnect and then let's go to the
scripts folder and put that new one up
create table blabbing
let's just go ahead and copy that and
run it in the browser the baby baby the
browser so let's go to web intersect
calm scripts folder / execute this file
give me some good news yes success in
table connection success in database
connection success in blabbing table
creation that completes the set up now
delete the file from server let's move
on you got it boss all right now let's
go ahead and remove that file delete yep
and now I'll show you the functionality
we need to gather all of these blabbing
we have to gather the blessings on the
profile page so let's go to open the
profile page and then all of the
blemings will have a feed on the home
page can be real cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
