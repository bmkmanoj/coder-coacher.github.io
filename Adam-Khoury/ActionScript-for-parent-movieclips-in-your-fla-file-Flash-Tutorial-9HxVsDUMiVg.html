lesson will be demonstrating how you can
script for parent movie clips in your
code if you happen to have a movie clip
that has movie clips inside of it and
then movie clips inside of that or
whatever we can show you how to get back
to the main scene or just jump up one
parent into that movie clip and do some
have some functionality happen but let's
just look at our timeline here we have
two layers in the main scene timeline
and one is the i named it whole file
because it pretty much holds all
everything in it except this dynamic
text field which is sitting on top of it
in its own layer and the dynamic text
field is going to say certain things
when we hit this movie clip this menu
when we hit the buttons inside of this
menu you can see the menu is very deep
down within a couple of movie clips I
will show you how to script it and this
screen is inside of this whole file MC
and then if you double click it you'll
see there's a movie clip with the
instance name of screen underscore MC
and if you double click on that I have a
simple stop action there and then three
key frames showing seen frame to same
frame 3 and same frame one there and so
in the in the menu if you click the
buttons here you'll see that since it's
an own movie clip and its name instance
name is menu if you double click on that
you'll see there's three buttons in
there and the button text and the code
and so what we'll do is whenever
somebody hits button one we're going to
tell this text field that's on the main
scene here to say something and then
we're going to tell the screen which is
inside this movie clip to go to one of
these keyframes so we hit button one
will go to the screen frame 12 screen
frame two and three screen frame three
it's very simple okay so let's show you
the code for it now and I'm gonna have
this Fla for download if you cannot if
you don't happen to see the code fully
just go ahead and download the fla to
get to the code real and you see it
really good once you open it up and
flash okay so inside i'm going to look
at the where we have our buttons
actually sitting on stage here and the
ActionScript is a regular button code
but inside we're now saying movie clip
with a bracket parent dot parent means
it's going up two levels if it said
movie clip parent that means it's going
up one level if it says parent that
parent that parent that means you're
going up three levels so what i'm doing
here is i'm going movie clip parent
parent so i'm going up two levels to the
main scene i'm telling my text to render
this string and that's on the main
timeline and then the movie clip with
the bracket here that has just one
parent inside of it will go up one level
into the screen underscore MC movie clip
and it'll go to and stop frame one so
basically that's the gist of it if you
if you didn't have a movie clip and you
just wanted to go up one level you just
wouldn't and and mess with that timeline
and manipulate that timeline then you
can just do away with the screen
underscore MC instance name here and it
would say movie clip in the brackets it
would say parent and then it would say
dot go to and stop whatever frame label
you want and if you happen to have a
frame label in there it would go
something like this page one so if you
wanted to go to frame label called page
11 parent up that's exactly how you
would script it right there and actually
I'll just keep that in there when I
publish this the Fla file but when I
save the Fla file that way you guys can
get to it and we'll make this once a dot
screen underscore and see again
and that's pretty much how it works and
this was a big confusing thing to a lot
of people and they couldn't understand
and in the action script tool was a
whole lot easier just to traverse
through your new movie clips but uh well
it wasn't easier it was just a whole lot
different but now once you get this
approach down you'll understand that
every time you put a parent that parent
that parent died parent in there that
means it'll go that many more levels up
and then you can dig down back through
movie clips after you close the bracket
there and that's pretty much how it
works we're going to go ahead and
comment this one out and this is I'll
put a comment here saying for frame
labels if you have okay if you have them
and that's pretty much it and that'll
show you exactly how to get to any level
of your of your file from within any
movie clip and we hope you find this one
useful and we will see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
