usefulness of the flash cs3 help file
that's in the authoring tool up in the
top menu selections here in the pull
downs the last one is help in the first
selection there is flash help or you can
get to it by pressing f1 as a hotkey but
you open that up and if you're in
actionscript 3 project and you'll see
that you have I just search sound a
little while ago but what you can do is
search what you're trying to do or what
you're trying to figure out or what you
think it might be labeled as in the help
file right there and you hit search and
then it lists everything in a keyword
fashion down and pulls all the pages up
that would be relating to what you
searched in your query and it pulls all
of that stuff up and we'll give you the
examples in all the info they have on
that but without even searching within
the the pull downs here you have pretty
much everything you can want to learn
how to do is right here within the help
file we see a lot of people going into
forums requesting a code on how to make
buttons and how to work with sound and
how to make visualizations or anything
like that and all of the the knowledge
you need to do all that's right here in
the help file and and a whole lot more I
mean granted not everything that you can
do with flash is listed here in their
help file but everything that you could
possibly create the fundamentals for it
all or is is right here so don't
disregard the help file it's very useful
and it has all of the code examples for
pretty much everything you can want to
learn how to do like I said you type in
sound once you hit sound
well once you type in sound and hit
search it gives you a new list here and
everything you click on you'll see that
the sound is highlighted the word sound
is highlighted everywhere in text and
there's also examples everywhere in
there pausing and resuming its on you
click on that and here's code you just
copy and paste it straight into your
frames wherever they tell you to there
and they explain to you how to create
the little applications so everything
you need is right there and if you go
through that whole set of lessons and
and help in there you'll have you'll be
a flash cs3 expert and you can teach
flash cs3 to other people because you'll
have a broader understanding of what's
really going on there ok we'll see you
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
