said multi-dimensional array it's not
like ordinary basic array now in order
to best demonstrate this let's start
with a basic empty array so we'll type
in var people is equal to you just put
the square brackets and that gives you
an empty array you want to populate that
array with data you can put your first
element in it and since we have an array
of people let's add another array
element and I'll add two more people so
now I have a basic array with four
elements within it now in this line I'm
just going to write some data to the
page so I'll use document type right and
let's refer to the people array and then
let's open and close square brackets and
we're going to put the index position of
the element that we want to access so if
I wanted to access Maria I would put a 1
here if I wanted to access Joseph I
would put a 0 because all arrays by
default start with an index of 0 so if
you run this in your favorite browser
you get Joseph now if we put the index
position 1 we're going to get the second
element in the array so let's check that
out we get Maria now let's take this
basic array and turn it into a much more
powerful multi-dimensional array let's
start off by separating all of these
elements really well and actually let's
just put them on newline that way we get
a clear visual separation of all of our
elements and there we go so that's a
good way to structure out your RA if
you're going to have a multi-dimensional
array now what we're going to do is just
wrap all of these individual elements
that we had in square brackets and what
that's going to do is create an array
out of each element so now we're going
to have an array called people and
inside of the people array we have
individual arrays now
now within this array I'm just going to
add more information about Joseph or
related to that element so let's say is
age is 27 that's another piece of data
that I can put in that array and let's
also put his country so Joseph is 27
from the United States so you can see
all I have is an array that is an
element within another array container
now let's just copy his age and country
data and let's populate that for Maria
Brian and Susan as well now what you
have is an array that contains one or
more arrays which is exactly what a
multi-dimensional array is you can put
as much data that you want in there and
you can nest them as deeply as you want
so if you want to access
Joseph's age which is 27 you just refer
to the people array and since Joseph is
the first element we put a 0 here now to
xxxx Joseph's name we would just put a 0
here so you're going into the people
array and you're accessing the first
element which is this array then you're
accessing the first element within that
array which is the name Joseph so this
should write Joseph to the page see
Joseph now if we want to access his age
we just put a 1 here and that will
access this piece of data within that
nested array see 27 and then we can
access his country as well by putting a
2 to get the third element in that
nested array now if we want to access
Susan's country we would just change
this to a 3 and that accesses the fourth
element which is this nested array and
we're accessing the third element within
that array which is her country so we
should get Australia written to the page
okay I want to show you how to make this
multi-dimensional array go one level
deeper and you can go as many levels
deep as you want to go so let's just add
another element to these nested arrays
and what we'll do is add another empty
array let's put a space here just so we
see what's going on a little better now
within this array I can put as many
pieces of data as I wish let's put two
pieces of data in this array
now this little array could represent
anything that I want that is related to
all of this data about Joseph so let's
say I wanted to put his eye color
let's put blue and then his hair color
black now you don't even have to add
that new piece of data that new nested
array to all of your other elements you
can still access that data if you want
so you can go reference the people array
let's reference the first element which
is referring to Joseph this element
right here so we put a zero here to
access that element then we want to
access the one two three fourth piece of
data the fourth element within that
array so let's put a three right there
so we got zero one two three we're going
to access that element and then we're
going to say we want to access the hair
color so let's put in another set of
square brackets here and the hair color
is the second element in this array so
you put a one right here if you want to
get the eye color you make this a zero
let's see what we get black so we're
properly targeting the data that we want
and we can nest arrays as deeply as we
want inside of arrays so now let's go
ahead and add that for the rest of
everybody as the last element in their
array as well
very quickly before we show you how to
loop over that array will show you how
to target these elements indexes for
adjusting values if you ever need to
change any of these values for instance
if Brian's hair color needs to change
from red to brown
maybe he dyed his hair brown let's put
people and we'll go to the where's Brian
he's zero one two
we'll go to element two and then we want
to go to zero one two three element
index three which we are ready at there
and then the second element which is
that one there we're going to change
that to brown so let's just put equals
Brown semicolon now if you access Brian
is hair color and eye color array the
second element which is his hair color
you'll see that it's now brown so if you
run that see Brown so we changed
Brian's hair color from red to brown
just by accessing that index and
changing its value to whatever we want
and you can see if we comment this line
out where we change the value of his
hair color it will be its original red
because we never changed it we commented
that line out all right so I'm going to
comment out both of these lines but I'll
leave them in place there so you guys
can refer to them now since we're
writing HTML to the page let's go ahead
and put this everything into the body
element because we're going to be using
JavaScript to actually write HTML to the
page so we just want to make sure we do
it inside the body element so we don't
get any tree parsing errors and now I'm
going to pop in the for loop that
processes this entire array and you can
see what we're doing is putting a for in
loop so we're using the for in syntax
here inside of a regular for loop so the
regular for loop
that's going to do is process your
people array and the normal away in the
normal way that you would process an
array using a for loop but since we have
multi-dimensional array we're going to
also loop over each nested array that's
inside of it so all you have to do is
create a loop for however many levels
that you have deep and I'm only going to
levels deep into my multi-dimensional
array for rendering things let me show
you what this renders to the page so you
can see we get person 1 person 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
and the details for each person come
pouring out as HTML on the page now if
you wanted to make the hair color and
eye color have little labels that say
hair color eye color all you have to do
is go in there and put another for loop
or any type of loop that you want inside
of this for in loop and that will give
you access to this deeply nested array
that holds the hair color and eye color
so you can see it's not very hard to
write multi-dimensional arrays and it's
not very hard to process them to loop
over them and to target all the data
that you want to target inside of them
to change the values so you can update
the data that's stored in the array and
