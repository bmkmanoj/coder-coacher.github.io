here and welcome to part 4 of creating a
real-time flash ActionScript 3 chat
application and now we've gotten through
1 2 &amp;amp; 3 so we're ready for part 4 we're
gonna upload all these files we created
to the server and test it live here on
video so nobody has any question about
whether this works or not nobody can
talk crap I love it ok here I am in my
flash file I created it in part 2 of
this series and you can see it still
says untitled 1 I haven't even saved it
to a folder yet so let's go to file save
as and let's go to desktop and here we
are a flash real-time chat let's make a
new folder let's call it a s3 underscore
real-time chat example
I like that name that's good we'll name
it that in the flash file - inside the
folder right here give it that same name
save now press f12 and that's going to
create your SWF HTML and JavaScript file
in that folder we just created
and there it is okay and as you can see
it's not connected because we're not
online and I don't have a PHP
environment set up on my machine so I'm
gonna put it online you can see the 5
second timer going though all right now
let's put the p80 file chat type PHP
file save as make sure we go to the
desktop ActionScript 3 real-time chat
example right there chat dot PHP update
links no so I don't need that one don't
need Dreamweaver anymore okay
now let's go and FTP these up here is
our real-time chat folder online on the
website and I'm going to and this could
be your root directory where your your
home pages and everything in here but
I'm just making an example folder I'm
gonna delete the create chat table that
PHP because that is not needed anymore
you don't want that to run again we
leave the connect to MySQL that's good
now let's go to the as3 where is it real
time chat example double click that
throw up or double click the SWF just
place it up online FTP it the JavaScript
file and the HTML file and the chat dot
PHP so you see what I have here on my
folder to make the application work I'm
gonna rename this to index the HTML file
I'm gonna need rename an index.html this
way I can just navigate to that
directory and that file will come up
let's do that press ctrl C I'm going to
that directory online
ok Here I am on the Internet's at the
Vela phpdoc um and I'm gonna fit that
directory navigate to it in my browser
press ENTER and I should see a chat box
and it says no data coming through just
like I said it would because there's no
chat in it yet let's go ahead and get
this window smaller and we're gonna open
up Chrome now Chrome I'm in Internet
Explorer with this first window here
let's open up Chrome first let's grab
this URL so you can just grab the what
the hell there it is grab that URL then
open up Chrome or Safari I'm gonna open
up Safari like a safari Safari very nice
browser and then I'm gonna put in that
URL navigate to it
in any freaking day now okay now let's
minimize this make it smaller maybe we
can see it along with the Internet
Explorer browser window so this will
simulate that's flash I want to do that
we want this one this will simulate you
being two people different parts of the
world or whatever it'll simulate you
being different to different people so
let's type in this one my name is Adam
and in this one my name is sexy girl and
in this one I'm gonna type in hi
everybody I'm fresh chat and let's see
what happens if all goes right this
Safari window we're sexy girls watching
should update as well
and there did right when that five
second timer hit five this Auto updated
you saw it now sexy girl she can be in
Alaska or something and I'm in Florida
or whatever I really I live in North
Carolina but say I'm in Florida she's in
Alaska it would all be real-time
updating so I'm gonna type in I am
looking for dorky webmaster to have a
good time with now if I type this in and
I press chat and it auto updates here
and Internet Explorer will know
everything is working fine and whoever's
having problems with this application
you just did something wrong that's all
there is to it
booyah baby that's funky fresh it don't
get no better than that
it's easy man to scripts one little
ActionScript 3 script one little PHP
file you got a really cool application
and you can tweak it out any way you
like it's all customizable and I made it
to where it might you know he might even
have bugs I didn't take very long to
make this application so it hasn't
really been run and tested rigorously
like an application should before it's
released so this is just a tutorial for
you to learn and expand will learn from
and expand for your projects alright so
that completes it
okay so bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
