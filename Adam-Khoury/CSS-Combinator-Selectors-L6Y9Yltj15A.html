we sometimes use special Combinator
characters in our CSS syntax to target
HTML elements and I get a lot of
questions in which people want to
understand more about the combinators
that we apply so I would like to quickly
clear everything up regarding the CSS
Combinator selectors and there's only
four of them so it won't take very long
ok fire up your favorite code editor and
get a new example dot HTML file ready
you're going to get four different code
examples now the first Combinator is
going to be the descendant Combinator so
let's take a look at that one so the
terminology alone should tell you what
it does it targets any elements of this
type that are descendants of this
element type so you can see div has ul
as a direct child element and then the
UL has child elements inside a bit of
list elements now it doesn't matter how
deeply nested these list elements are
inside of this div they're still going
to be targeted because they are
descendants of this div let's quickly
see what that renders so you can see all
list items properly targeted now this
next example is the child Combinator so
you can see that the descendant
Combinator just used the space the child
Combinator uses the greater than symbol
so the elements have to be a direct
child of this element in order for them
to be targeted and styled so you can see
we have a div and inside of it the first
child is a paragraph then we have an
article element and inside of that
article element there's a paragraph
nested inside of it so this this
paragraph element is not a direct child
of this div element so it's not going to
be targeted for styling but this one
will because it's a direct child and not
one of its deeply nested descendents so
let's see what this looks like now you
can see that the first paragraph gets
styled and targeted but the second
paragraph doesn't because the second
paragraph is nested into another element
is a child of the div so it's a
descendent of the div but it's not a
direct child and that's what this
Combinator symbol does when you see it
in CSS syntax and this is the one that I
get the most questions about because I
use this one a lot to target direct
children of an element and I use that in
my CSS syntax a lot and people have
never seen it before I guess and they
don't understand how it works in
comparison to the descendant so let me
run the descendant now you can see that
all are targeted because they're all
descendants of this div but if you want
direct children only then you put the
child Combinator and you only get direct
children of the element and not all of
its descendants so I hope that clears up
because I get a lot of questions about
that one because I use this symbol a lot
in my CSS syntax and it's just a child's
Combinator that's all
the third Combinator selector is called
the adjacent sibling Combinator and the
terminology alone should tell you again
what's it what it does what its purpose
is and it uses the plus symbol in
between two elements and so basically
what this is saying is anywhere where
there's a P element that is in a direct
adjacent sibling to an h3 that means
when it comes after it so let's take a
look at what this renders and you can
see that we get the first paragraphs are
targeted for styling and you can see
that nothing is nested here these are
all elements just sitting right next to
each other so they're all siblings so
you can use this type of Combinator when
you want to target the direct sibling
element next to your specified element
now the fourth and last CSS Combinator
selector is called the general sibling
selector and it uses little squiggly
squiggly symbol and it works very
similar to the way the adjacent sibling
selector does but this one will select
all elements that are that come after
your specified element so you
the main sibling element that you want
here and then you put the squiggly and
then you put the next sibling element
here and these are the ones that will be
targeted for styling so you can see we
have an h2 followed by two paragraphs
then we have an h3 followed by two
paragraphs a div and another paragraph
so let me show you what it renders
alright so you can see everything after
the h3 that is a P is styled and the div
is not styled because it's not a P so
you can see we have a ch3 squiggly P
that means everything after an h3 that's
a sibling element of the h3 and it
happens to be a P then it's going to get
styled and you can see that the P
elements that are above that h3 these
two P elements they didn't get styled
either because it has to be elements
that come after it okay so those are all
four of the Combinator selectors that
you can use in CSS now there's a whole
lot more selectors in CSS and if you
guys feel like you want me to go through
all of them in little groups like I did
for the combinators here I can do that
very quickly I can go through all of
these CSS selector groups and show video
tutorials about how all of them work if
you guys want that just click like on
this video and give me a comment on this
video to let me know that you want that
and then I'll understand that you guys
want me to go further with all this CSS
selector business and we can do that on
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
