we're showing you how to create in this
tutorial and you can see we clicked each
button it takes us to a different page
in our application or our flash website
our full flash website and it has nice
on rollover and rollout movie clip
buttons and it's the entire application
is running off of seven lines of code
how you like that
hello and welcome to another flash
building tutorial and in this lesson
we're going to demonstrate how to make
your coding life easier when it comes to
creating full flash websites and
navigation through your Flash websites
and things of that nature so let's go
into a flash file ActionScript 3 create
new and I'm working in cs3 and you can
be in cs4 and maybe at the end of the
video I'll show you how easy it is to
set it up and cs4 - it works just the
same ok so on the first layer first
thing we'll do is drag out a rectangle
permitted let's drag this up a little
and before I do that let me set my stage
i'ma set stage two
maybe 680 and 400 is good I'll make it
look like a mini site because I'm gonna
fit it on the page at develop PHP where
this source file will also be if you
want to just download it free and check
it out the source file let's change the
frame rate to 30 and that's good now I'm
going to drag out the rectangle
primitive
and I'm gonna call it let's just make
that solid
I'm gonna call it pages and convert it
to a movie clip symbol right-click it
convert to symbol you just name it pages
in the library
okay and down here you want to give it
an instance name of pages and now what
I'm gonna do is show you with just a few
lines of code how to make your code a
little more dynamic to where you can run
loops and set up your navigation that
way make life easier so we'll have a
movie clip here then we're gonna have
some buttons so drag out another
rectangle let's just make say we had a
button menu over here let's give that a
gradient
I like to give my buttons gradient fill
let's transform the gradient
it's good go to the color palette
make that just a right there beautiful
okay so now I'm going to convert that to
a symbol movie clip and I'm going to
call it inner button clip
okay
and I'm going to convert that to a
symbol it's gonna be a button
just name it button in the library and
now we have button instance instance
name home this will be the home page
button well the first button in your
menu whatever you want it to be and
inside of it is that inner enter button
clip which is a movie clip symbol and I
did that on purpose now I'm gonna go
ahead and make the three frame oh the
states for the button symbol and I'll
show you how I'm gonna do a little trick
here and it's gonna make a movie clip
animated movie clip button but you won't
have to code for it I'm going to show
you guys all kind of nifty tricks in
this tutorial okay so I pressed f6 to
make my keyframes here for all the three
states inside of the button symbol and
on the UP State
I'm gonna double click actually I'm just
going to highlight it that instance on
stage here and convert to symbol I'm
gonna call it over clip now I'm gonna
call it up clip because that's the up
state up clip in the library movie clip
okay double click inside of it and give
it a little animation in here maybe out
to 10 frames hit f6 make a new keyframe
there and then right click the center
create motion tween and on frame 10 now
on frame 1 let's make it you guys will
see what I'm doing at the end you'll be
like oh he's slick and sneaky okay so
we'll go to tint make it just a light
blue
20 percent looks good
and then here we have none that's good
and now we'll press f6 and type in St
Opie Opie parentheses close parentheses
semicolon stop action that way on the
Upstate it will always have this
animation and you'll see why I did that
in a second because now we're going to
go into the overstate and do something
similar right click that so back out in
the buttons three-stage you hit the
overstate right click it on stage
convert to symbol call this one over
clip okay double click inside of it do
the same thing ten frames
create motion tween but this time it's
going to go from none to a blue tint on
the other end
let's tint it the same put the stop
action in press f6 sto P okay on the
down state we're not even gonna worry
about that for now now we'll go back out
to the main scene and there we have our
button symbol inside of it it's three
states and then there's two movie clips
on each up and over state this one is
just the inner button clip but these
were specialized made movie clips with
animations and the reason why I did that
let's just ctrl enter see I haven't put
any code in the application yet and I
have a rollover animated movie clip
button symbol it's a little hacked but
it's mine and you can use it see
usually you have to code out for an over
an add eventlistener and over at event
listener for out you see I did none of
that and I have cool animated movie clip
button now I'm going to duplicate that
button or just make a copy of it press
control C highlight it press control C
control shift of V to paste in place
drag it down and we'll make three more
so we can grab those two by pressing
shift as we select control C control
shift V slide those down into place and
one more control C control shift V slide
it down using the arrow key here now
let's name this one home let's name this
one something like portfolio let's say
this is a flash designers website or
something or web designers site or
graphic artist if somebody who works
online or something this will be the
about page this will be the
la dee da dee da photos and this wannabe
contact
usually make this one services a bit
better okay
now we have Buy button symbols there
let's just go ahead and put them on
their own layer away from the pages
movie clip so let's create a new layer
go to this one bu TT Oh in this buttons
this one will be pages and the buttons
are all 5 let's control X grab all five
and ctrl shift V on their new layer and
now the you know all we have to do a
structure out the pages movie clip which
is gonna be really simple I'm gonna do
it really basic just to show the example
and how everything's gonna work but you
guys can make really complex inner page
it's movie clip in here but you see with
our buttons here we have five of them
and one movie clip here that is the
pages and now all we have to do is go
inside of that double click it inside of
the pages movie clip let's call this
layer BG for background short for
background which is going to be this
rectangle that's here move this up a
little so on that that layer we're not
gonna put anything but that background
so on top make a new layer make three
new layers but one actions call this one
labels and call this one content
and I have a tutorial that shows how to
animate the inner a pages timeline to
where it has animations if you wanted to
fade in fade out or move from one part
of the screen to the to the landing
point on the screen make them grow
whatever you want to make them on the
content layer we're just gonna put the
word my home page put the words my home
page
static text
Center that and you can put whatever
kind of content you wanted on each one
of these keyframes that would represent
your pages and they can be movie clips
themselves that have animations and
tapped inside of them it's the wonder of
Flash it's beautiful and then let's see
we can just press f6 one two three four
more times that gives us five pages the
background layer we'll just press f5
right here on frame five to extend the
keyframe or extend the frames out not
the keyframe it doesn't make an extra
keyframe it just extends them out by
pressing f5 and the labels will make
keyframes on that layer two by pressing
f6 on each one so this that was gonna be
our contact page right we'll say contact
me this is going to be
what was that services
and about
about me of course you would have a lot
more data on your pages for me yeah and
this one was portfolio
okay now it looks like we have all the
correct text or page content and the
labels I'm just gonna make them the same
as the but oops
group down here in the frame label in
the properties inspector you put home
for that first one here we're gonna put
a keyframe to in the labels layer we're
going to put about no that was a
portfolio and about
then services
and then contact okay so now our frame
labels for the pages are all laid out
appropriately and they reflect the names
of the buttons that are gonna lead to
those pages so in the actions layer
let's just go ahead and put a stop
action in all of those
just to be sure
mmm-hmm let's just copy this frame copy
frames and then right-click the one we
want to paste it in base frame base
frame base frame base frame now they all
have stop actions okay now what we can
do
everything's set up in there now all we
have to do let's put some text on these
so big
I line it and see control ship to be why
did you do that
we'll see control ship to thee
and this isn't the reason why I'm making
my button static and not creating them
within the loop that I'm going to show
you here is because there's a lot of
people that make really creative
websites where the buttons are actually
on stage somewhere the person has placed
the buttons on stage the flash website
creator I do it a lot myself and there's
a creative creative level you can
achieve further than you know what you
know what a programmer could get out of
just using code you know when you're
using stage elements and ActionScript
together it can lead to a more creative
project I think so I'm gonna show you
how I have a lot of other tutorials that
show how to create buttons dynamically
magically out of thin air you wouldn't
have them sitting on a stage here but
this one I wanted to show how to have
them sitting on stage because maybe you
have a creative project where you have
the random placement and random shapes
for your buttons or whatever so I just
wanted to show you guys this and so
right above the buttons layer make
actions layer just call it a s3 for
ActionScript 3 and now since everything
has an instance name and it reflects a
page in our pages movie clip you can
code this sucker out now let's press
control enter to look at it and see what
we have and you can see right when I
when mine comes in the buttons fade from
blue to white and it's a little side
effect of having that little movie clip
but an instant setup the way that I did
but it doesn't doesn't take away from
the project at all and so you have nice
rollover movie clip symbols and not even
the first bit of code yet it's beautiful
so now what I'll show you how to do is
code and I think I did it in seven lines
I can show you in seven lines of code
how to control this whole thing and
usually you have to make a Deven
listeners to reach button then you have
to make the little functions for each
button we'll just show you how to make
leaner meaner button code for your
creative flash projects and if you had a
huge menu system with you know 20
buttons and more you would almost need
to have some code like this so we'll hit
that ActionScript 3 layer the keyframe
there and press f9 open the actions
panel and let's get these lines in here
it's not much so save var and we'll name
the array and I'm gonna use an array
that way we can run a loop on the on the
data keep it slim mean and lean so we'll
put the opening bracket close the
bracket and the end we'll put the
semicolon and inside will build our
array and we're gonna have all those
buttons so and normally with an array
there would be a string and delimited by
commas
and it would be you know button1
letterblair it's
you would have button wine then you'd
have but two or whatever but since we
have buttons on stage already we're just
gonna refer straight to the instance
name like it's an object movie clip or
whatever or a button symbol with an
instance name so we can just target it
since it's there and ready home
portfolio about services and contacts
and that's that if you had 12 you would
just type them all in and the same
little bit of code you wouldn't have to
add anymore all you'd have to add either
your buttons and then the little names
here separated by commas there now for
the next line we're gonna run the for
each loop and for each loop
we'll run through each of those buttons
in the array that we just made close
that off down here and inside the
parentheses here we're gonna type in var
let's call this BTN clip or you could
just call it BTN because they are button
symbols so BTN and you can call it
whatever you want there in my menu array
so I'll grab this pop it right there
and then inside we can add an event
listener for each one of these buttons
that's in the array and that's on stage
so we just type in V TN dot add event
listener
this is Mouse event
that
we can use click try click networks it
should and we'll name our function
that's gonna run outside of this loop on
BTN click and close parentheses there
and the semicolon and now outside of
this for each loop we're going to type
in function create the function on
button click now and grab that put it
right there and this is going to be
event
: just grab this mouse event here pop it
there this is the mouse event boy open
the curly brace close curly brace and
inside here just gonna command pages I
think that's the name of that movie clip
pages yes
okay so pages we have to do is say go to
and this is the last line should be see
if it all works event that target this
is gonna be targeting each item that
iterates through this for each loop or
each item that passes through this for
each loop in the in the my menu array
and that name
so what essentially what we're saying
telling that pages movie clip here to go
to and stop home or go to and stop
portfolio or go to and stop about or go
to and stop you get it it according to
which button suppress and that's how it
works
it's very simple and so that seven lines
of code that should run the whole
website so let's see control-enter look
at that goes to each page and so like I
said at the website that develop PHP I
have lessons where it shows you how to
create buttons out of thin air like a
magic and now I have a lesson that shows
you how to have your you know creative
layouts many many buttons and you can
put many many more buttons here and this
seven lines right here will run 50
buttons you know maybe if you put more
buttons in the array it might make a
couple more lines here but you get the
idea it's a it's a nice way to add your
event listeners through your in your for
each loops or your for loops you can add
your event listeners and it makes coding
a lot more easy and inside of your your
pages movie clip you have as many pages
as you need you set them up and they can
be movie clip symbols here themselves on
each keyframe and inside they can have
whatever you need to have inside of
there any kind of data you can bring in
external put code that will run external
images into the scene you know any any
kind of thing you want to do but as you
can see we have seven lines of code
we'll make an entire application for you
a nice dynamic one to help
keep your coding for your projects a lot
leaner I have a few tutorials where you
know I'm put a whole bunch of event
event listeners and a whole bunch of
functions but it's really not necessary
if you know you know intermediate
programming in ActionScript or PHP is
the same way you can really just run
loop code and do everything you need to
do without spending heaps and gobs
amounts of time programming your
application okay so we'll see you next
lesson I'll have this tutorials source
files up at the website at develop PHP
calm and the flash section where you can
get at it if you want to get at the code
or the source files ok we'll see you
guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
