how to use PHP to parse XML feeds an XML
API data from any of your favorite
websites or from websites that your
clients request dynamic data feeds from
we will be tapping into the simple XML
extension of PHP for just one of its
functions you can parse RSS and API data
from all of the popular websites online
that happen to syndicate their
information so this is what we're going
to be doing within this video lesson I'm
going to go to YouTube then I'm going to
go to develop PHP and then I'm going to
go to Ted and I'm going to access their
data feeds I'm going to snoop out where
they have links to their RSS data feeds
I'm going to find them I'm going to get
the URL to those data feeds and then I'm
going to create an XML object out of
those URLs and then I can parse it just
like it's a regular XML object okay so
that's what we're going to show you how
to talk it's no problem it's very easy
it's like two lines of code maybe three
don't worry the first thing you want to
do is create a new blank PHP file you
can really name it whatever you want but
if you want to name it like I have mine
named it's feed parse example PHP so
within it let's create a new PHP
scripting block so we'll open up the PHP
tag and then we'll close it now in the
first line let's create a variable we're
going to call that variable HTML because
that's going to be our HTML output
variable at the end of the script we're
just going to echo that HTML variable so
actually let's go ahead and do that now
let's put echo HTML variable there we go
that's going to be really the last line
in our little example here right now
HTML is empty so this would echo
emptiness to the page what we're going
to do inside of a loop is build up on
this HTML variable now let's create a
variable called URL because that is the
variable is going to store or hold the
value of the URL that is the data feed
or the syndicated feed that whatever
popular website happens to have running
now I said we were going to target
YouTube
so let's go to YouTube and what we're
going to do is try and find their data
feeds so I'm going to go to the bottom
and click developers now that link
should lead me to their data API s which
are right here and let's see I'm going
to click the PHP link at the bottom and
here's their developer guide for PHP and
really I don't have to tap into their
API I mean you can if you want to but
you don't really have to you can just
tap into the feed in a raw sort of way
if you have the URL so what I'm going to
do is go down until I find where it says
show let's see searching for videos
videos uploaded by a specific user
that's what I want I'm going to target
my specific channel you can target your
channel or any channel that you like and
you can look at all of this information
they have here all these different URLs
point to different sort of data feeds
and you can set them to be any kind of
feed that you like in many instances
right here says feed identifier you just
supply it with the identifier here that
you want and that's the kind of
information that you get access to but
what I want is uploaded by a specific
user so I'm going to grab this right
there that's the URL that I'm going to
work with and I'm going to put it right
there and I'm going to change this from
username because that's just a generic
placeholder to flash building I'm going
to put my channel name right there so
now we have our URL to the data feed
that we want from YouTube in place and
ready to go okay now we're going to
create our XML object so let's put XML
as the variable name for that XML object
and the simple XML function that we're
going to tap into is called simple XML
underscore load underscore file and then
you open closed parentheses put in your
semicolon and then you just add the URL
variable as the parameter to that so
once you load this URL into this simple
XML load file function you get an XML
object from it and now we can work with
that within a loop so let's go down 1 9
and let's type in
four and this is going to be a four loop
so you can open closed parentheses open
your curly brace go down a couple of
lines and close off your curly brace now
within the parentheses for a four loop
you have to supply three parameters and
I'm using a forward loop because I want
to have a ceiling on the amount of data
that I'm going to get back maybe I only
want ten items maybe I only want five
items to display from that data feed
maybe it has a hundred items in it and I
don't want that many so that's why I'm
putting the loop plus the loop helps us
keep everything lean so I don't have to
have a whole lot of code to render out
many many different items many many
different items will come rendered out
through my for loop okay so for loop I
said gets three parameters so the first
one is the variable we're going to name
the variable I and it's going to be
equal to zero to start off with and then
you put semicolon in the next parameter
is the condition logic so we say I is
less than ten so this is what it means
first you created a variable called I
and you gave it a starting value of zero
then your condition is as long as I is
less than ten this loop is going to run
and process code that's within it and
the way I changes from zero all the way
up to ten is this I plus plus which
increments a number so you'll go all the
way from zero to nine actually which
will give you ten items and within this
for loop is where we're going to access
all of the API data and or they feed
data and we're going to pack it into
this HTML variable now before we can put
some code in there we have to know the
structure of this data feed so what
we're going to have to do is go to that
data feed within our browser so within
your browser you can just put into the
address bar that URL and it'll show you
a feed we can see the feed right here
and it depends what browser you're in
whether you'll see the actual feed data
or not so you see the feed data now what
I'm going to do is go down to the bottom
because I find that's the quickest way
to get to what I want to see
you can see the closing tag is bead and
then each video since this is my channel
at YouTube that we're targeting for data
feed each video is represented by entry
so I can target feed and then entry and
then that will give me an array of all
of the entries or somewhat like an array
even though it's it's XML data structure
this is really the first things I need
to see to be able to tap into what's
going on here and then I can check out
the rest of the nodes like there's link
see that link node I can target that
node and it's probably a title node for
the title of the videos so let's see if
that works let's go back into the code
let's place in a new variable for title
that's going to be equal to our XML
object and then we go into the XML
object into feed and then we go into
entry from feed so we're just accessing
the nodes of the XML there then we're
going to place in brackets and within
the brackets we're going to put our I
variable and that I is going to be
changing each time through the loop the
first pass through the loop this I is a
0 the second pass through the loop the
eye becomes 1 all the way until it
reaches 9 because that's the ceiling we
have so we're going to get 0 through 9
which is 10 items that we want out then
after we access entry we go into the
title node let me just type in title and
that should give us 10 YouTube video
titles from my youtube channel my latest
10 videos just the titles of them now we
have to make sure we put that into the
HTML variable so let's snatch up that
HTML variable put it right there and
then we'll put dot equals and we put dot
equals to make sure we're appending to
that variable and not overwriting it
with data each time so we're going to
output within the HTML that title
actually we can output some actual HTML
there so we'll put the title within
double quotes and then you can wrap that
in h3 or h2 whatever you want or I'll
just wrap it in paragraph tags that way
each one is separated down the page now
let's see if we get any success with
that
if we do we can build upon it and get
more information out of that data P okay
here's my example page and as you can
see I don't get squat so I got to change
something let's see if we do it without
accessing the feed node and we just go
straight into the entries let's try that
okay now refresh and there we go so you
can see I have 10 of the latest 10
videos that I released here's their
titles so that means I've successfully
tapped into the YouTube data API or the
data XML feed for my channel now I can
go about accessing the description of
the videos the ID and all the other
information that I want to grab out of
it okay so here's the raw source view of
that feed from YouTube again so what I'm
going to do is just want to highlight a
bunch of this I'm going to take it into
my text editor I'm just going to see
what's going on with it I'm going to
take about right there go into my text
editor I'm just going to create a new it
could be any kind of file I'm not even
going to save it you're going to paste
all of that right there and I want to
see what these nodes are set up like so
you can see there's the feed node
closing the entry node closing right
there we have a lot of other different
nodes so what you want to do is go in
and separate these all out so you can
see the individual nodes okay so just so
things are really clear I broke it down
to the individual little nodes that I
want to access and I removed all the
content from them because that's not
really important what is important is
the name of the node so what I want to
do is get the ID title content and
author name so what I have so far is the
title so let's get the ID now what we
have to do is go in pop in ID here and
ID right here then we'll get the
description of the content in this case
YouTube calls the description content so
the description for the video is content
let's just call it content and the last
thing we want is the author and name so
what we'll have to do is go one more
node in on that one to get to the author
name so let's grab this and actually
let's put that one up top so let's put
author then go one more node into the
name element will call this name or
actually let's just call it author that
makes more sense all right that's all
the data I want for my little loop all
right so what I'm going to do here is
change these paragraphs to developments
because they're going to have more lines
in them now and the title I'm just going
to wrap with the maybe h3 element and
then I want to also add the content
under the h3 element so I can put that
right there and then the ID I'm going to
put right under the content so I'll just
put a break tag right there their ID
will be under the content which is the
description for the each respective
video and then the author we can put
that in there as well we'll put that
right in front of ID then we'll just put
a hyphen or something like that now see
how that renders out actually here let
me put a HR element between each pass in
the loop there'll be an HR element that
renders okay we'll refresh our test page
here and there we go
is the first video or the latest video
that I put up and here is the
description for the video there's the
title in the first line you can see so
each first line in the h3 element holds
the title and you can see the
description comes after the title then
we have the author name right there and
the ID now if you just wanted the video
ID this link might not be good for you
because this is actually to a data feed
this whole link but if what if you just
wanted the ID you can easily do that in
PHP where is that ID you would just put
the string replace function to work on
it so let's put ID equal to string
underscore replace
open closed parentheses put a semicolon
now let's go back in the browser and
let's take a look let's get that link
and this is the characters that we want
to delete out of that now watch what I'm
going to do here my first parameter of
the string replace function is what I
want replaced which is this string the
second parameter is what I want to
replace that string with in this case
nothing that's why I just want to delete
that part of the string and then I can
just put the ID variable there because
that's the data that I want to affect so
the string replace function takes three
parameters what you want to replace in a
string what you want to replace it with
and then the string that you're doing
the replacing upon now let's see what
that gives us and we should see just a
video ID that way you could actually
render the video to the page if that's
what you wanted to do if you wanted to
actually render the video using
YouTube's embed code you can get the ID
in this way very easily so let's refresh
this and we'll see if this whole link
changes this whole ID link changes to
just the video ID here let's refresh and
there we go
we got access to just the video ID now
check this out we can go to youtube and
grab any embed code for any video so
where is that share I think if we go to
embed see that embed code right there
I'm going to grab that I'm going to go
here into my HTML and before my H our
tag I'm going to pop it in that code and
you'll see we have to escape any double
quotes so I'm going to change those to
single quotes so I don't have to put any
back slashes in my code just change all
these double quotes single quotes and
there we go and now the video will
actually render there on the page Oh
actually you got to change this to the
video ID which was right here ID we take
that and you put it right there that way
it's dynamic for all of them on the page
all right so we'll refresh the page and
see
we get so you can see underneath each
title description we have the video
actually rendering you can see it's all
the actual proper video that should be
there for the title and the description
it's pretty cool huh so that's how you
can get a lot of automated data flow on
your websites or your clients websites
or whatever without having to do very
much look at that script is tiny and
since we have most of the code structure
in place all we got to do is change just
a few things here and there because all
structures or most xml RSS data
structures for various websites are all
setup different so you're not going to
find the same node names and node
structure on YouTube as you would on Ted
or develop PHP or things like that
some of them conform to the same node
naming but you won't find the same node
names and structure on every feed that
you come across so that's why you got to
dig into it the way I did and break it
down the way I broke down the entries
from YouTube and got all of the little
nodes that I wanted to get out of it now
we'll go to develop PHP comm and see if
we can access one of its feeds so we'll
click the little RSS syndication button
down here and we can do any feed we want
let's get the library syndication and
let's look at the code for that the
source code you can see mine is a little
bit neater and it's all dynamic so all
my latest material would be in here so
let's go ahead and we don't really even
have to grab any of this code we can see
what's going on clearly we have the
channel we have items so I think we can
just target the item for that so let's
see where we have let's get rid of name
so we don't have any of that there and
let's just work on title we're not going
to be replacing ID we don't have that
let's just get the title first let's
remove this iframe that rendered that
video from YouTube we don't need that in
this one we just want the title at first
so
that's all I'm going to render so there
we go
let's see let's get rid of this content
as well so instead of entry I'm going to
put in an item because you can see my
XML has no entry tag I have item tags
within my item or all my various little
nodes for each little entry for each
item and then you can see I have title
as well so I can target category title
link description the GU ID is
permanently pub date and anything that's
within that item element let's just see
if titles render first I should get ten
titles of the latest library material
added there oh I got to make sure I have
the correct URL as well I'm still on the
YouTube URL so I can go here copy link
address and then put this right into
place right there to replace where the
YouTube data feed link was you can see
mine says dot PHP what that means is
mine is a dynamically rendered feed it
uses PHP to access my database and
that's how my RSS feed is rendered
through dynamic MySQL data but it pumps
it all out in XML structure that way
anybody can tap into it using these sort
of methods so let me save that and now
we'll give this a test
okay back at that same page let's
refresh you can see I get not
now let's see what else I can access I
can access the let's just grab the
description and I'll get the pub date -
let's do pub date and I'll get the
description as well so let's just copy
this line let's put two more this one
we're going to call pub date take that
put it over here and this one we're
going to call description take that and
put it over here now we can add those
let's add the description right under
the h3 and then update we can maybe put
a break tag in there put pub date as the
last line then we'll have an H R right
there now let's press refresh and there
we go now we get the title we get the
description and we get the date all
right see that shows you how you can
just go around attacking different fees
no matter what their structure is like
we're not attacking them you can just
strip all the data you want right out of
them display it any way you like and now
to show you how easy and versatile all
this is we're going to go to Ted and
we're going to chew up on it air feeds
okay so here I am at Ted calm and this
is a site that I enjoy because they have
very stimulating intellectual videos a
lot of times sometimes it's crap but
some all most of the time is very
intellectually stimulating so and it's
all videos it's like lectures is really
cool stuff and they also have a YouTube
channel as well but let's go down to the
bottom here and you can see the little
RSS icon right there so let's get TED
Talks via RSS feed click that that's
going to take you to looks like feed
burner but that doesn't matter this is
the feed right there you can see it all
rendering so let's view source right
click view page source and you can see
this is in fact XML structure material
so we can go down to the bottom again
and look and see what we have here we
have channel
that's sort of like the develop PHP
structure I have Channel and what else
do they have they have link title let's
see if they use item yep I see item
right there so you know they're
accessing item as well so what we're
going to do in the code let's just start
with title like we've been doing the
others and then we'll know we can access
everything else so let's remove these
also right there that way just the title
will render and we have to make sure we
have that URL right here just grab this
URL right up top add Feedburner and in
the code we're going to put it right
there so this should allow us to get the
10 latest titles of the videos from Ted
comm we get the title rendering then we
can delve into the rest of the XML
structure and get at the other nodes so
here we are at our example page once
again it's refresh and there we have it
so you can see that the structure of the
Ted file the Ted feed is a little more
like the develop PHP feed because I
didn't have to change any of this they
had channel node and they have item
nodes and they use title as well so now
you know that you can dig into the rest
of this feed and you can get to the link
you can get to the pub date the category
whatever you want so let's go ahead and
access the category just for example
sake right here and let's just type in
category we'll name the variable
category and we're going to render that
variable within our HTML let's put it
right under the actually we'll put it in
front of the h3 tag will wrap category
within an h2 element so let's see what
that gives us let's refresh so you can
see they're all higher education videos
let's see what else we can access about
each video or each entry let's get that
description so we can copy that go back
into our code just put it right there
for now
copy that title line paste it right
there cut that out and paste it right
there so we have description now and we
can put description underneath this h3
element now let's see what we get
refresh our page and now we have a nice
description for each video now I'm not
going to waste your time or mine by
taking this any further you know by now
that we can access any of the any of the
nodes that we want within any xml
structure from any site any feed from
any site so now you know how to go to
any popular site that you want if they
have api's data feeds RSS syndication
you can tap into those XML structures
and rip all the data that you want out
of it and custom design the data
presentation with HTML and CSS just like
you would any other and we use a nice
little for loop here to give it a
ceiling so we can get out just as much
as we want and not more okay I hope
you've enjoyed this video lesson and
I'll talk to you very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
