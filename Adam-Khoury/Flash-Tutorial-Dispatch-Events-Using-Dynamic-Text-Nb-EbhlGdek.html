dynamic text field to dispatch staged
events and use them sort of like you
would a button but you don't have to go
through all the trouble of making a
button hello and welcome to another
flash and actionscript 3 tutorial and
there may be times when you'd like to
dispatch some staged event that you want
to happen on stage using simple text or
a dynamic text field I'm going to show
you how to do that usually people have
to make buttons and such to make these
kind of things happen I'm just going to
show you that you can use text field as
well dynamic text fields let's go ahead
and write what we want it to say let's
just say click click me to dispatch
staged event okay let's give it an
instance name
of my texts so it's dynamic text field
my text can have any font you want if
you embed it and you just put that in
stage any way you want what you do down
here in the link in the properties
inspector in the link field just type in
the word event colon that assigns the
dynamic text field to have an event
placed on it and has an instance name of
my texts so all we have to do is let's
create a new layer here and put in code
let's well let's first put in something
on stage that can be manipulated let's
just make a box and let's convert it to
a movie clip symbol my box and let's see
movie clip good let's give it an
instance name with my box and what we'll
do is just every time that text is
clicked will mix will make the box move
say five pixels to the right each time
it's clicked so let's get the box off of
the actions layer put it here highlight
that keyframe their press f9 open the
actions panel and we'll type in my text
dot add event listener
invent this Center and inside the
parenthesis here this is going to be
text event dot link all caps that link
comma and the function we want to fire
off on this event will name it click my
text so now we just write in function
click my text
the event will be there in parenthesis
colon void open curly brace and go down
a couple lines close curly brace and
there's our function nest all set up
ready to go and here we take the text
event we place it in the parentheses
here so we'll say event of this function
colon is text event there now let's say
my box dot X plus equals 5
let's see what happens when we click it
now press ctrl enter see that every time
we click that text field that box is
moving and click it fast and move it
faster it moves 5 pixels over to the
right and you can change that value to
be whatever you want say 10 but that's
just for demonstration purposes you can
have any event that you want dispatch so
it treats it as a button you know there
might be times where you don't want to
go through the motions of creating a
button when you just want a simple event
to dispatch and you can put text there
to make that happen okay we'll see you
next lesson the source file will be
available free if you want to get to the
code and see the working application
that you can just open in flash and edit
and be available at developed PHP calm
