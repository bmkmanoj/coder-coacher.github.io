computer science math tutorial because
the logic could be applied to any
scripting language we just happen to be
doing it in JavaScript but keep in mind
it could be done this way in any
scripting language we're going to
demonstrate how to calculate percentage
values for things like sale pricing and
much more the equation is helpful in
more scenarios than I could even
possibly cover in one video and it's an
equation that you can use in any
scripting language you enjoy so it has a
multitude of uses and we're going to
write a few different examples just to
show the diversity of it and we'll start
with showing sale pricing calculations
so we'll go into our JavaScript
scripting tag in a regular HTML document
will type in var price and we'll just
make it equal to 150 at first 150
dollars now we'll apply the sale
percentage so we'll put bar sale is
equal to let's give it a 25% sale
percentage now the next variable we're
going to create is these savings this
will be a calculation of how much money
that the person is going to save if they
buy that $150 product at a 25% sale so
savings will show how much they saved so
to do that we're going to group price
times sale then we're going to divide
that by 100 so you take the price of the
product you multiply it by the sale
percentage and then you divide the
product of that by 100 now let's also
get a variable for the sale price which
is going to be the adjusted final price
of the product after the sales
percentage has been taken off and that's
simple to calculate we just take the
price minus the savings that we
calculated okay so now you see the
complete calculation now let's go ahead
and render all that to the web page you
can see I'm using dot two fixed behind
all of my numbers just to make sure that
they're fixed to two decimal places like
money if I render this in a browser
software I get the original prices 150
the sale is 25 percent actually that
shouldn't have a dollar sign there let's
remove that dollar sign so the original
price was 150 the sale was 25% so the
sale price is 112 50 that's what the
person will pay for the item and they
are saving 30 750 just so it's a little
bit clearer let's go ahead and change
these numbers from 150 to 100 and then
the calculations will look a little more
simplistic so out of 100 dollar product
a 25% sale of course the sale price is
going to be $75 after the sale and the
savings is $25 okay that's the first
code example we'll have now our next
example is going to deal with element
placing playing around with elements on
the on the page according to some
percentage math so what I'll do above my
script element is I'll put in some HTML
you can see it's just a div with an ID
of bar 1 and inside it it has a child
div with no ID or class now I'm just
going to put some style up top to effect
those elements we're going to target div
with an ID of bar 1 and then we're going
to target any child divs inside of bar 1
in the next rule which gives us the
following rendering make that a little
bit bigger so we can see it move it over
here so in our script element the first
thing we'll do is get access to an
object representation of that element on
the page bar 1 so here we have the
object reference for a bar 1 now under
that we're going to type a variable
called % and we'll make it equal to 50
at first then we're going to create a
variable called the new left and that's
going to represent a new left position
that we're going to move the little thin
bar the thin - within the bigger bar I'm
going to give it a new left position so
that's going to be a number that we're
going to need rounded so we'll just put
math dot round after it runs through
math that round it won't have decimal
places anymore
because the calculation that we're
putting inside of math dot round might
result in a decimal a floating-point
number and basically we're going to use
the same logic that we used in the first
example we'll take the number multiply
it by the percentage and then we're
going to divide everything
a hundred so we take the bars with and
then we multiply the bars width by the
percentage not a little black sliver of
a bar the big gray bar is the one that
we're getting the width for here
multiplying that by percent and then
dividing by a hundred what that does is
lets us get a percentage placement
through raw mathematics instead of CSS
now finally let's go ahead and apply the
movement so we're going to target the
first child element in bar one which is
this div right here it's the little
black sliver and we're going to make it
style dot left property equal to the new
left position so let's take a look at
that you see now it's in the middle or
its left position is directly in the
middle 10% save refresh you see now the
bar is at 10% or the little black sliver
or the child rather that child element
is at 10% within its parent 25% and then
we'll go 100% or 0% so no matter what
the width is let me change the width of
that bar and you'll see how it's dynamic
and works for any width so let's say the
parent element is 200 pixels wide and we
want to go to 50% of that width and boom
there it is so that just shows you how
to use percentages for placing and
positioning things through raw math
instead of using CSS because there's
times in certain applications where
you'll have to use JavaScript to produce
the math for the placement of things you
can't always just use CSS especially
when you get into complex software
development now you'll notice it's not
true Center if we were to make the width
of this say 20 refresh you'll see that
it's left position is matching Center so
the left position for the little child
div inside the parent div is at the dead
center so it's left position is at the
dead center at 50% but your calculation
is not accounting for the width of that
so if you want a dead center
mathematical centering you could just
take the new left and say minus the bar
child dot offset with / - that will give
you dead center let me refresh see now
it's dead center and I just wanted to
throw that in because I know there's a
lot of technical nerdy people that watch
my tutorials and they might feel
compelled to comment and say Adam
actually that's not dead center 50% you
have to account for the width of the
actual thing that you're centering and
then divide that in half and then you'll
get pure center hey this is people that
work my nerves because even though I
know how to do a lot of things if I
don't show it on video they'll just
assume that I don't know how to do it
and they try to school me on it so now I
got to show extra stuff just to
preemptively silence a bunch of nerds so
that extra two minutes was just wasted
because I know people are going to open
their mouths okay now for completeness
we're just going to add one more little
example and this one's very simple all
we're doing is taking two values neither
one of these are the percentage these
are just two values that we want to find
a percentage difference between those
two so let's grab our browser here
refresh it says 40 is 75 percent smaller
than 160 and that is true so if we were
to change 40 to 80 and then refresh the
application it says 80 is 50 percent
smaller than 160 and really 160 is the
base number so anything is relative in
this equation to that so 80 relative to
160 is 50 percent smaller than 160 and
it doesn't matter what numbers you can
have 153 and 79 so 79 is forty eight
point three seven percent smaller than
153 let's put this back on 160 and 40
now we'll take this same example and
we'll change it up to read forty is 25%
of 160 you might want to find out what
percentage one number is of another
number
now I'll pop that calculation in it's
very similar to the others but what
we're doing is taking value to 40
divided by value 1 which is 160 and then
we multiply that by 100 and that gives
us this 40 is 25% of 160 and if you
wanted to you can remove the 2 fixed or
you can just put it on zero and you'll
get no decimal points okay 40 is 25% of
160 but there's times you might want
that decimal point and you can make as
many decimal places as you need to I'll
just make it two decimal places let me
change this number to 253 so 40 is
fifteen point eight one percent of 253
all right so that shows you a whole
bunch of different examples about how to
use percentages in your calculations and
also how to get percentages from
different values that you have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
