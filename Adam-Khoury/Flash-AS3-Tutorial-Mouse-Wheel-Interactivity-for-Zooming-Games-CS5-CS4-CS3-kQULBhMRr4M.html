showing you how to put the users mouse
wheel to use for games in any kind of
interaction in your Flash projects I'm
using ActionScript 3 and I'm working in
flash cs3 that way cs4 and cs5 users can
get to my file and easily open it up as
well as cs3 users nobody will be blocked
off from using this or getting to the
files or whatever and what I'm showing
you is how to put the mouse wheel into
effect so the user can use their mouse
wheel to interact with your objects on
stage or perhaps you have a volume
slider that you want to make wheel
interactive on a player or something you
can use it for any dynamic values or use
it to manipulate objects on the stage
like I'm doing here and the reason why
this tutorial is coming at you is
because the next tutorial is going to be
this Facebook game style board where
people can zoom in and out on their
character and all the land and they can
also drag the grid around first thing
I'm going to set my stage to black
give it a frame rate of 30 now I'm going
to drag yeah let's make another layer on
top let's put a s3 because that's where
the code will go here we'll put site
elements now on the site elements layer
let's lock the as3 layer on the site
elements layer I'm gonna put three oval
primitives okay now I'm going to right
click this one convert to symbol I'm
going to call it lube our movie clip and
you'll notice I have a center
registration set on that that's okay
this one I'm going to convert the symbol
movie clip red bar this one's going to
have Center registration also on this
one I'm going to give registration top
left when I create the movie clip art of
it is yellow bar
they give it a top-left registration
you'll notice okay
and you'll see the difference when we
interact with that object about center
centering the registration and having a
top left or bottom left bottom right top
right whatever
wherever you happen to put it okay so to
understand how to use the mouse wheel or
allow the user interaction for the mouse
wheel and my flash applications I went
to the Help section flashhelp
and in cs3 if you're using cs3 then
you'll have help within the application
itself the help guide if you're using
cs4 cs5 the help tab I think we'll take
you online which has the same set of
data
I believe but anyways I searched mouse
wheel and it gave me these results so I
clicked on this and I read all about the
mouse wheel event and then I saw the
Delta property the Delta property
indicates how many lines should be
scrolled for each unit the user rotates
the mouse wheel a positive Delta value
indicates an upward scroll a negative
value indicates a downward scroll so
what that means is if the user is
scrolling up we're going to have
something that's above zero a positive
number and then if they're scrolling
down we're going to get a negative
number and I think it's three by default
so knowing that we can set Mouse event
listeners for the mouse wheel here the
mouse wheel event and utilize this Delta
property then we have all we need all
right let's head on up to the
ActionScript 3 layer here highlight it
the frame press f9 open the scripting
panel first thing we'll do is add event
listener to the stage
this is a mouse event dot let's go down
to mouse wheel here right there and then
comma and the function we want to fire
off when they scroll up or down with
their mouse wheel and I'm just going to
name my function wheely let's close that
up now let's type in function wheely
this is the event of the mouse event so
get that in there I just want to open up
my curly brace for my function and then
close it off now this is going to be
Mouse event so let's copy that so it's
right here let's type in event colon
Mouse event now like I said we can get
to that Delta property so what we'll do
is first above this event listener let's
make a couple of variables here let's
make the bar let's call this Delta bar
this is going to be integer and so that
one's initialized Delta bar variable has
been initialized as an integer type and
this one is going to be zoom amount the
amount that we want the value of the
amount of we want things to the objects
we interact with how much we want those
things to change that's what that value
is and we'll play with that number a
little I'll show you what it does and we
have our variable set up so what we're
going to do inside of the function is
we're going to take the Delta variable
which by default has no value yet but
it's set as a integer type we're going
to use the event dot Delta property so
that is the Delta property of this wheel
event that's happening while the user's
mouse wheeling the Delta property of
this event so all we have to do is type
in something like red ball let's take
the red ball for instance dot width
plus equal now let's put it in Zuma
Mountain right there so it's gonna make
it 20 bigger on the width now if we want
to height so also here let's test this
out see if it works let's put our mouse
on top of the red ball and zoom with the
mouse wheel you see how the width
expands and you'll notice that it's only
growing what I'm going to do is put a
conditional and if an else condition
statement here inside of this function
that's going to evaluate whether the
mouse wheel Delta value is true or false
and actually you can trace right here
let's trace the Delta value or the Delta
VAR value every time the mouse wheels
and show you what happen press control
enter so every time my mouse wheel we
get output okay it's a positive 3 so let
me wheel down now see negative 3 okay so
what we can do is take that Delta var
that we get knowing that if it's going
to be above 0 a positive number that
means they're scrolling up and if it's
going to be below 0 which is a negative
3 that means the scrolling down we can
utilize that information and program
with it but like I said if you want the
red ball to be uniform you just make the
height so there's height now it should
grow uniformly yep okay now we'll
program in the logic we need to make it
shrink up or down in size or control our
values going up or down so right here
we're going to type in an if statement
nest it off and then else we're also
going to give that let's just say else
if just to demonstrate what's going on
to you guys the best way possible and
inside of this if condition that's going
to be if this Delta bar happens to be
greater than zero that means they're
scrolling up remember so if Delta bar is
greater than zero execute code here else
if Delta bar is less than zero
let's just swap this around the less
than sign and we put code there so what
we'll do is grab this where we had the
width and height adjusting on the ball
whenever we mouse wheel let's grab that
code and this is going to be if they're
scrolling up so let's put that one there
and if it's less than zero that means
they're scrolling down let's put this
here but we're going to change these to
say minus equals so we say plus equals
and minus equals here within these that
way it doesn't change its original size
before they start Mouse wheeling that
way it retains the size basically just
kind of compounds adds to or takes away
from the current size so now let's take
a look at what happens see it grows and
shrinks according um scrolling up I'm
scrolling down scrolling up scrolling
down now another thing you can realize
is that this will work for any object
you'll notice I have three objects there
so what we can do to make it work for
all three dynamically is just type in
event dot target
so let's replace wherever it says red
ball event that target event that target
event that target now you'll see that
all three interact in the way it's
programmed to and you'll notice that
remember we set the registration top
left on this one so it doesn't zoom from
Center it doesn't zoom in and out from
Center that one you'll notice these we
made Center registration upon creating
the movie clip so it has a center zoom
in and out this one has the top-left
registration so it that's how it zooms
in and out but that's how we use the
mouse wheel event and set up a listener
for it and a function and within that
function you saw how we can access the
event Delta hope that proves helpful to
some of you guys and we'll see you next
lesson where we'll mess around with
making that zoom in and out drag the
board around type game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
