tutorial and this one we're going to be
discussing materials how to apply them
and how to get the best use out of them
and what you can do is so what we'll do
is we'll add an item to the viewport and
once that items there let's get the
axial up to 64 and the radial up to 64
for the best mesh quality and now we can
go to we have bitmap flat let's move
this over a bit glossy reflective
texture transparent so I'm going to go
to reflective and let's go ahead and put
a gold on it alright that looks good to
me now a lot of people they just stop
right there and don't go any further
don't investigate any more what the cool
features are here so let's go to
material let's double click this and I'm
going to show you how to add a bump map
which is a new feature which allows
bumpy textures to be displayed on the
objects that you want and you can use
your own bitmap images and here I have a
bunch of bitmaps that I use for various
different things but let's go to this
circuit board right there let's bring
the bump strength all the way up press
ok you can even generate preview and it
will show you what it will do there
press ok and there we go let's back that
off a little bit rotate it around take a
look at it it's pretty cool and let's go
ahead and tilt it just a little bit so
you can really see the effect now I'm
going to go to preview and export
remember when you export these items the
background that gray background isn't
there that's just the environment let's
go to raster generate selected frames
so you can see what it's done it gives
it that texture comes out bumpy in the
render let's go to back to the scene
editor let's just spin it around there
we go
now let's render that out you know how
let's press play you can really see how
the bump map takes effect there and it
gives an impression that it has a nice
bumpy surface okay so let's go back into
the scene editor grab that press ctrl X
get it off there alright I'll show you
one more little example working with
custom materials subscribe the cube pop
it on to the view pane let's bring the
height down I'm going to make a floor
out of it something like that click down
a few times now let's go to material
double-click it let's go here it's a
procedural color and texture go to pip
map image and there I'm going to go and
find this gray carpet brightness you can
adjust right there I don't want it too
bright and I'm also going to go to
bitmap image on the bump map to make it
a little bumpy let's use the gray carpet
again actually let's use this one bring
the bump map all the way up generate
preview okay okay so now you can see
what we have there
it's a carpeted floor now let's grab
another cube and let's mess with the
size of the box
so let's say this was a wall let's put
that into place right channel let's make
one more box give it the depth way down
and let's grab it over here and move
that into place
okay so to say you are making like a
shadow box or a room environment and
let's see let's go into the model
libraries and grab the little chair they
have by default in there you see that's
my martini glass right right there that
I made earlier file right there
save model when I got done working on my
model when I made that martini glass I
went to save model and it lets you
establish where you want to put it in
the 3d category extruding or extrusion
or lathes I put mine in the lathe
category and I was able to save it just
by going to file save model you can do
that with lighting and animations as
well save them so once you create things
that are complex you can just use them
again so you don't have to go and
recreate them not that that martini
glass was this complex but if I ever
need a martini glass boom it's ready to
go and I can further edit it so now
let's go into the materials again let's
grab the let's go into a bitmap or maybe
texture
let's just take the brick wall well yeah
I wanted to put the but you can get
stucco and all kind of your custom
bitmaps the way I showed you with the
material editor double-click that you
grab in your own bring in your own
bitmaps now what was I going to do I was
going to go to the model library and
bring out that chair see 3d there's all
kind of cool models in here let's grab
the TV yes I'd like you to fit the
contents there we go giant TV let's
scale that bad boy down let's make it
point five five point five point five
point five point five there we go let's
put it down on the floor and let's
rotate it just a bit using this
direction right there okie dokie so now
let's go into preview and export
generate frame so you see there that's
pretty darn cool I think so it's easy to
set up your materials to look to make
things look any way you need to really
and that's pretty much the gist of
materials it's a little bit more to it
but you can experiment on your own dig
around with all the settings and
everything let's get a little closer on
that down to the floor preview export
there we go and it's beautiful it
doesn't get any easier than that and
usually you wouldn't have a brick wall
in the inside of your home but you can
see what I'm getting at you just put
stucco there or wood whatever you want
so that's pretty much the gist of
materials and how that works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
