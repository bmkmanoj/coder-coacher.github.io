website the right way for beginners part
8 in the last tutorial which was part 7
at the very end I asked everybody what
they would like to see next and I've
been going through the comments anybody
who watched it through to completion
heard me at the end asking what they
would like to see next and I think most
of the people when I looked through all
the comments you can look through him
yourself when I looked through all of
them it seems as though people want to
see more CSS and people asked for CSS
dropdown quite a few times here more
than anything else please explain CSS
dropdown menus so that's what i'm going
to be doing there's one request for that
where is another one right here please
keep going and also CSS dropdown menus
Tony bill be asked and then we had the
r-mo gamma gamma however you say that
one may YouTube names are so funny
please do CSS dropdown menus was a
request also from its corey time and i
think there's a couple more asking for
CSS dropdown menus so that's what we're
going to cover since that's the most
popular request and then i said in part
7 that I would take what the most
popular request was and produce that
show you guys how to do it so here we
have drop-down menus and I've got them
all set up because it would take a lot
of time if you want to sit here and
watch me code the whole thing out so
what I did was I set it up at the Villa
PHP you go to develop PHP
and here's the URL let's say I just put
it up right here pure CSS dropdown menu
w3c validated and works in all major
browsers with no hacks no hacks at all
okay here's the HTML you need and then
there's the CSS that you need to put in
your style sheet it's very simple and I
put some code comments in there for you
so you know what sections are doing what
in the CSS and it's using a unordered
list and list items to render out the
drop-down elements so let's take a look
at it here we are an Internet Explorer
you can see what it looks like I styled
mine out a certain way but you can style
yours out to look any way you need them
to look and I made two menus just to
show you how you can have multiple
dropdowns in your menu bar okay and so
that's Internet Explorer here's Chrome
you can see it looks exactly the same
here is Firefox exactly the same except
the text all looks like crap because
Firefox just renders text crappily and
then here we are in Safari which renders
text the best in my opinion Safari is an
awesome browser Safari Internet Explorer
of my two favorites I don't really dig
chrome and firefox all that much but I
do I use chrome and I use chrome safari
internet explorer most Firefox I don't
even use only when checking my sights
it's the only time I'll use it let's see
if it validates now you can see it's one
hundred percent validated HTML let's
check our CSS Booya baby that's all you
need so you can go to this URL at
develop PHP com
see that URL right there or you can just
go to the homepage right now it's on the
homepage sitting right here and the
recently added page based tutorials
click right there and there you go you
add that to your HTML wherever you need
it and then you add this to your CSS
file okay so that addresses how to
create pure CSS dropdown menus that are
fully validated and compliant and looks
and works the same in all major browsers
and if you're going to use my CSS
dropdown menu all i ask is that you
please retain my copyrights in your code
as I built it this morning from scratch
because I looked online for a good
solution and all I saw were all a bunch
of CSS dropdown menus that had hacks all
over them for internet explorer a hack
for this browser handful is it was
retarded so i built one that doesn't
require any hacks and it validates so if
you could please retain my copyright
within your CSS i would really
appreciate it and if you show this code
to anybody else online please return
retain the copyrights now since some of
you guys said you want to see some where
am I Dreamweaver here you said you
wanted to see a little bit more PHP I'll
show you a little tiny quick trick let's
go into the index file or rather let's
open our include footer which is a PHP
file now right here where we have 2010
we can just put in a PHP lock let's
remove that 2010 I'm going to show you
how to write the date dynamically using
PHP that way all the years that pass
coming up 2010 all the way up to 2020 or
whatever you won't have to change your
copyright date it'll change for you
automatically using PHP so let's go to
the PHP block let's put one in let's say
echo
date semicolon in between the
parenthesis let's put a capital y see if
that does include put er now let's go
back to the site and refresh and look at
that still says 2010 even though we
don't write 2010 in here we're asking
PHP to render the date the year
dynamically we access the year by the
capital y there the full year and I
think I'll make this a solid 10 part
series so in part 9 and 10 we'll show
you some more interesting cool stuff
that will help you have a fully
validated site that loads fast and looks
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
