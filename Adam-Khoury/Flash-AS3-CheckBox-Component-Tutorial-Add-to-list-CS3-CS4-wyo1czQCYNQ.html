you'll be learning how to create with
this free flash source file and
instructional video you can get the free
source file from develop PHP calm and
the flash section and what it does is it
shows you how to dynamically program
your check box components so you can use
the check box component dynamically we
programmatically bring it to stage and
program it to update a list for us and
when we select it and deselect it it
adds those items to the list or takes
them away so the Spile will give you a
pretty good insight into dynamically
programming your checkbox components in
flash cs3 and cs4 for actionscript-3
here we are in flash cs3 just create new
flash actionscript 3 project and let's
leave the size just the way it is
that'll be just fine actually let's
bring the height up 300 ok
now what we're going to do is bring in
some shopping cart graphics really quick
scale this down a bit and I'm in
fireworks here
okay let's good control see back in
flash control V brings it in as a movie
clip let's just plop it right there now
right on top of that create a rectangle
and make it it's phil have an alpha of
about 86
bring that outfit down a little bit
there we go
okay so now all we have to do is drag
out a dynamic text field so let's grab
the text tool set it to dynamic text
here whatever font that you want and
whatever size and all the attributes you
can set down here you know so I'm just
going to drag it out where I'd like it
right about there
make sure it has no border around text
that way we can see through that little
opaque rectangle we've made and see our
cart let's name this layer let's double
click this layer and name it stage
elements let's create a new layer above
it by clicking this insert layer button
and let's name this one as3 short for
actionscript-3 now we can code it out
because we have everything we need now
just like in the last lesson I gave we
created button component instances
dynamically will be creating the
checkbox instances dynamically now the
first line of code is to import the FL
that controls checkbox that way you can
access it to created dynamically now
let's see well let's look what's in our
library here just that fireworks object
which is basically just this bitmap in
this movie clip so let's bring those out
let's delete that folder okay it's just
our card there there's no checkbox in
the library so let's press control enter
and see what happens with that line of
code okay we get an error definition FL
controls that checkbox cannot be found
so what we have to do is drag it text a
check box from the components library
put it on stage and press ctrl x and
delete it now in your library there it
is check box and component assets so
what you need now when you press ctrl
enter you won't have any errors see okay
now let's start coding this out
first thing we're going to do is set
that text field that we have on stage
cart underscore txt I didn't give it an
instance name let's cart underscore txt
now it has an instance name will
referring to it in our code now dot txt
is equal let's put the sentence that we
want to display their shopping cart
contains coal in and make sure it has
the line break actually at first it
won't even matter if it does or not so
that's fine for now and now let's go
down two lines create bar this is going
to be the first checkbox that we're
creating dynamically you name it check
box one this is going to equal new check
box
you
open closed parenthesis on that function
okay so let's create the next one it's
going to be very similar check box to
now we can add event listeners for this
check box and the listener will be click
when somebody clicks in it we want to
make an action happen or make a function
fire off that's what we'll do okay check
box one we can just grab this name here
check box 1 dot add a bent listener
open closed parenthesis put semicolon
this is going to be mouseevent of click
that click all caps comma and the
function that's going to fire off update
list
now let's add another listener very
similarly for the checkbox tube and that
we're creating dynamically here c12 now
we have event listener for both of those
here okay now we're going to give those
a label so we just grabbed the first one
check box 1 dot label is equal to milk
put that in between double quotes now
similar to the label for check box 1 Lex
checkbox to will have a label of bread
there we go now we're going to give
check box 1 just grab the name here give
check box 1 an exposition that it's
going to land on stage when it's
dynamically created where it's going to
live on stage 80
and make the Y position for that one too
right now now it's Y position on stage
and say about 100 we'll check our
numbers and everything is not just like
we like it will change the numbers up
it's very easy okay so now here check
box to needs positions check box to x
and y let's make this one 120 here so
that way it's Y position will be lower
than the other one that's what we want
so they won't be stacked right on top of
each other but they're exposition will
be 80 so for instance let's grab a
rectangle let's put it at the position
where those are going to land exposition
of 80 and a y position of 120 that's the
second one 100 right there it's a little
bit too low so let's bring that Y
position up a little let's make this 60
and then this 180 that you do it now all
we have to do is add child so we say add
child open closed parenthesis semi-colon
check box one
this will effectively put it on stage
this line of code right there at that
moment that's when it gets added to
stage so we add one and two both check
boxes that we created dynamically now
all we need is the function that is
waiting to PI raw update list remember
that function that both checkboxes have
when they get clicked they fire off that
function let's build that now okay so
type in function we already have the
name here update list this is going to
be between double quotes and avoid and
then our opening curly brace close curly
brace now we have a function that set up
all nice we have to make sure we give
the function they proper event let's
just say Evan dot mouse given it works
okay now first thing we're going to do
inside of that function each time one of
the check boxes is clicked whether it's
putting the checks in the box or taking
the checks out of the box this function
will fire off so let's say cart
underscore or txt that text is going to
be equal to similar to what it says here
so let's just pop that in this one we
want to give double line break so we'll
put backslash n backslash n that will
put double line break and now we're
going to append the text so you put a
condition of if checkbox one not
selected is equal to true if checkbox
one not selected is equal to put equal
equal to and you have to put two equal
signs with that type of comparison in
that situation cart underscore txt now
we're going to append the text here if
it's true if it's selected so we put dot
append text
open parenthesis closed parenthesis and
let's put the semicolon there and here
we're going to add the label of the
actual check box so remember the label
milk and bread right there check box one
label we can access that value and let's
add a line break to that by claiming
blacks back black splashing backslash
and so it will have a line break that
way the words because we're going to put
the next one in right here control C
it's going to be if checkbox to that
selected checkbox to label will be put
into the text field you use a pen txt
use the append text function when you
want to add to a text field that way
every time one of the checkboxes get
clicked this function will fire raw and
update what the card says using these
three lines here ok let's look
everything over real good before we test
it looks great this is going to throw
whenever it has to be a semicolon there
or a pull or colon focalin and I had a
period sitting there let's see what else
here that's not going to display because
it needs to be black or some other
darker colors make it blue let's also
make it multi-line so we show multiple
lines in it and let's embed it it's
embedded uppercase lowercase numerals
and punctuation ok that way no matter if
the matter whether or not the user has
that font on their system it will
display correctly and nicely non
selectable no bag no border multi-line
dynamic text ok so that's how the text
setting should be not selectable
okay now let's test it out control enter
your shopping cart contains milk bread
if I click unclick the milk checkbox it
removes it from the list and that's how
it works
and you can add more of these very
easily you just make checkbox 3 make a
new label for it give it its x and y
position addchild so you can add it to
stage and then you add an if condition
right here for it for number three and
you would be done okay so i hope the
source file and video example helps you
guys code out your dynamic checkboxes
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
