I've had a whole lot of requests on how
to make the mp3 playlist boombox that I
made not auto start by default and it's
pretty easy to do so when you go when
you download the original so what you
can do is you'll notice that this one
that I'm tweaking right now is there
presently if you want to grab it and do
what I'm doing here so what I'm gonna do
is click on the object on stage there so
the only thing on stage is to movie clip
called the whole player I'm gonna double
click inside of it and here's the
player's functionality it sets itself up
on frame 1 some variables on frame 2 it
swaps out which song to play in the
playlist very simple and on frame 3 is
most of the players functionality for
all the little things the speakers that
bounce and all of that so let me publish
out and see what we got
ok so you can see it just starts auto
playing on its own all kind of nifty
little features on it so it starts auto
playing on its own and I've had a lot of
people ask how to make it to not auto
play so we're just gonna hit this
control and text layer and let's call
this startup click startup clip now on
that frame on that keyframe there that
first keyframe I'm gonna draw out a
rectangle
that will cover the entire thing that
looks good
so now what we'll do is have a let's
give that a little bit of a tint let's
bring down the alpha there we go now
right on top of it I'm just gonna make a
button a rounded button
I'm gonna put the play symbol on that
just using a triangle let's put it right
in the middle so let's just grab the pen
tool and draw a triangle the best we can
looks good
good enough let's bring this point up
it's about right there now let's just
grab that make it white in the pill
let's turn it you can hold shift to make
it turn at increments at certain angles
so it doesn't turn free now let's just
resize it free transform bring it down
bring it in bring it up bring it in
there we go
something like that and that's going to
be the button that will tell the user
that they should click on that to start
playing the to have the player start
we'll just make it to where they click
on anything there it'll start convert
the symbol
movie clip startup clip so you'll see I
grabbed all three of those items I just
created on that startup clip layer and
now they are a movie clip let's give it
an instance name start-up clip
okay obviously you would make your
graphics look better than I have mine
here but just for the sake of the video
length I'm not gonna go too through too
much trouble to get the functionality
going just to show you because you guys
can make your buttons and that cover
look really smooth nice bevels out
whatever you want okay so now we have
the start up clip sitting there
let's move the controls actually all we
really need to remove is the
ActionScript not remove it but move it
over so we have the skin the cosmetics
speakers and EQ all of that can stay now
let's move these ActionScript frames
over let's just click off here frame 10
and then highlight frame 1 and drag
click down and drag and you'll grab all
three then once all three of black you
can grab those move amounts of about
frame 20 there you go so now the code
that's gonna be starting up the player
it's not gonna do it until frame really
frame 22 is when the player is gonna
start up it's gonna initialize its
variables in frame 20 frame 21 it's
going to do the switching so you know in
the code anywhere where it says go to
and play to change that to go to and
play 21 because that's where the frame
switches for the song the track that's
playing switches okay okay now all we
have to do to make this happen now is
make sure the startup clip is sitting on
top but is not visible when they get to
frame 20 so we'll extend out these by
highlighting or just clicking down and
dragging again once all four are grayed
out press f5 extend all the cosmetics
and such now let's extend out to frame
19 the startup clip layer
let's give that f5 so what's gonna
happen is when they click this I'm gonna
code it out right now right here in
frame 1 I'm gonna press f9 open actions
panel type in stop action that way it
doesn't just play on its own it'll stop
right there in frame 1 and now let's
code out the button or when this clip
when they click it to start it up ok so
we'll enter our actions panel here a
stop action will put the instance name
startup clip yeah there it is okay so
now once you press the anything here you
see there it starts see that again
that's what it'll look like when they
come to your site for your player and
they'll know to click the play button if
they want to hear some music
you can even right right there click to
play but once they click it starts up
that's what you guys want it so that's
what I show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
