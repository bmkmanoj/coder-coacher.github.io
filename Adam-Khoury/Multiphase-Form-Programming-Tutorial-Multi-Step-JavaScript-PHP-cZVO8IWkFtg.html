multiple steps or multiple stages and
they're ideal if you have a limited
amount of space to dedicate to your form
or if the form that you have is very
long you might want to break it up into
stages and essentially it could be used
to display any HTML content in any
custom sequence that you like so if you
happen to enjoy the workflow in this
demonstration be sure to catch the next
video where we'll engineer an online
test or online exam or quiz and we'll
start by putting the form element in the
body of our document go down a couple of
lines make sure we close it and we'll
give this form an ID equal to
multi-phase and since we'll be
submitting this form using javascript
we'll put on submit equals return false
so in case you put a submit button in
your form it won't allow the form to be
submitted in the normal way because
we're going to submit this form using
javascript and I'll explain more about
that when the time comes now for this
particular form I'm just going to use
divs
to stage out the form or to make the
different phases of the form I'll type
in div go down a couple of lines and
close that div now let's give that div
an idea of phase one and then you just
put all of the elements in your form
that you want for phase one of your form
so in my phase one I'm going to have
these two elements their input elements
for taking in first name and last name
so you can see my input tags here and
they have ID first name and name of
first name and the last name is the same
now when we process this form and submit
it to our PHP parse file that's where
this name attribute is going to come
into play and that's how the posted
variables are going to be scooped up
using this name attribute so your PHP
script that parses this form is going to
scoop up this variable name according to
this attribute now the ID attribute
we're using mainly just to communicate
with these elements
to JavaScript to make all the magic
happen that way we can get values out of
them when we want to and things like
that so in my phase one I'm just
gathering their first name and the
user's last name now the button I have
in place has the label of continue so
after they fill out their first name and
last name I want them to hit continue
and then the next stage of my form will
come into view now the function I want
to run when they hit this continue
button is called process phase one so
that function actually has to be in
place in our JavaScript so let's type in
function process phase one opening curly
brace and closing curly brace
now as the different stages of the form
are being processed by our JavaScript
we're going to be using some variables
to hold or retain some depth so let's
pop in these variables and we're just
initializing these variables in this way
here we're not giving them any initial
values we're just initializing those
variable we're going to give them values
within the functions now just to make my
programs code a little bit leaner I'm
also going to add this function the
functions name is underscore it's in
place so I don't have to call document
I'd get element by ID in my functions so
many times I won't have to use this
string so many times okay so now since
we can use this function to access any
elements that we want and get their
value out that's what we're going to do
so in function process phase one and
this is going to occur right when the
user clicks this continue button process
phase one function is going to fire off
when they click that continue button and
then this code is going to execute
you're going to take the value out of
the first name and last name input
elements down here you're going to put
those into these local variables F F
name and L name then you can run an if
condition to check the length of those
strings just to make sure that it's two
characters or more or actually three
characters or more so if the first name
length is greater than two characters
and the last name length is greater than
two characters then we'll accept it and
run some code to make the program
continue else if they're less than three
characters then you
to run this alert to tell them please
fill in the fields more so now at this
point your fname and lname variables
already have the value of what they
typed into the field so if you check the
lengths and lengths are good then you
can run code like this you just target
the phase one div which is this guy
right here you target the display CSS
property you make that equal to none and
that will make it disappear now
immediately after that you want to make
a Phase two element which we don't even
have on the page yet I'm going to put
that in place right after we put this
line you want to make a Phase two
element display equals block now the
phase two element on the page will make
it display:none by default so all the
user will see is phase one when they
arrive to the form but when they click
continue after filling out the fields in
phase one then phase one is going to
disappear and phase two is going to
appear so let's just go down into the
HTML and we have to have a Phase two
because our program is looking for one
here so we have to have that in place
put a copy under it change it to Phase
two and you can take out these lines and
in Phase two
we'll be gathering the user's gender so
what we have here is a select element
with an ID of gender and name gender and
there's three option elements and we
have the first one being blank so that
forces them to choose one they have to
choose either male or female from the
option list then the value that gets
sent to JavaScript when we scooped up
that value out of these out of this
element it's going to be either M or F
now inside of phase two we're going to
have a button that's similar to the
button in phase one but this button is
going to call a function called process
phase two all right so up in our
JavaScript right under process phase one
function we're going to put the process
phase two function and it's very similar
to the process phase one function so we
just grabbed the gender value out of the
select list and we run an eval
valuation to see if the gender length is
greater than zero then we're going to
run the desired code for the program to
continue else we alert them to say
please choose your gender now while
they're filling out the form as they're
going through each stage you're going to
want to make sure that they're giving
you the data that you need for each
stage to continue if they don't supply
you with the data you just want to give
them an alert or some kind of every
message on the page telling them to fill
out the data so what we do in the case
that they give us the data and we're
going to continue to the next phase is
we just set phase two
style.display to none and open up phase
three for them to fill out whatever
fields we put in there and we're also
going to add a progress bar and a little
status to show the user how many steps
are left in the form and we'll also give
them a progress bar that'll be a good
visual indication of how much they have
left now it's also important that I
mentioned that this function process
phase one and process phase two could be
made more dynamic and they could both be
processed within the same function which
is something I want to be showing you
how to do in the next tutorial where
we're building quizzes or exams that
might have up to a hundred questions you
don't want to have a hundred different
functions processing each one of your
questions you could make one function
process all of the questions within an
exam or a quiz or something like that
but I just wanted to break the functions
out into different phases as well for
beginners to grasp the concept of going
step by step through each function but
rest assured that in the next video
tutorial where we're going to be
building online exams or online tests
we're going to have one dynamic function
that processes every single question of
the test and we're going to be using
arrays to make everything a lot more
dynamic okay so now you're probably
getting a little feel for what I'm doing
here so I'm just going to move a little
faster there's no need to go slow
through the rest of this let's go ahead
and pop in div with ID of phase three
and in that one we have a select list in
place so the user can
tell us what country they live in and
the continue button for that phase is
running a function it's going to execute
a function called process phase three
now my particular multi-phase form
happens to only have three phases and
you can give yours as many phases as it
needs so in type of process phase three
I'm going to put the country value from
the Select list on the page into the
local country variable then I'll
evaluate it to see if the length is
greater than zero so if there's some
value there then I'm going to run the
code the desired code for the program to
continue now you can just pop an else
condition here on the end of this if
condition like we did for the rest if
you want to make sure they give you
their country value here I'll just do it
will put else please choose your country
now for the program to continue in this
process phase three function what we're
doing is we're checking the length to
make sure that they give us a value and
we target the phase three element which
is the div that holds all the phase
three input and we set its style that
display to none that way it disappears
from the page and then we want to make a
new div called show all data we want to
make that render to the page so we make
its display block so let's go ahead and
put that div in place right now called
show all data and what we're going to do
is show the user it's like an overview
of it so I'll go down into my form and
under phase 3 div or actually it could
be outside of the form if you want it
doesn't matter you can put it anywhere
you want on the page I'll just put it
inside of my form
it's a div with an ID of show all data
and what I'm going to do is show in
these span elements they each have a ID
this one has an ID of display F name for
displaying the first name this displays
the last name this displays the gender
and this displays the country and
they're just inline span elements now I
can target those IDs with JavaScript and
populate them with any text that I want
any data that I want now the button in
this element the way you show them an
overview of all the data they gave you
then you want to have a button that
says submit data which is the final form
submit where it actually goes to the
server the data goes to the server and
you process it so you can have a
function called submit form fire off and
I'm going to write that in one second
and you'll see exactly what it looks
like but first we have to put data into
these span elements to show them an
overview of the data they gave us we go
up into our Java Script and right under
where we're making the show all data
element display we're going to put these
lines that are going to target the span
elements down there and in their inner
HTML we're going to put the variables
that way the user can see an overview of
what they gave us within the whole
multiphase form you can extend this to
have each phase could have as many
inputs as you need and you can have as
many phases as you like all right so now
once we have the data the overview of
the data they gave us they're going to
press the submit button and a submit
form function needs to fire off and
that's very simple to do through
JavaScript all we're going to do is
target that form you can see our form
has an ID of multi-phase so we target
that element that form on the page and
we make sure it's method is equal to
post you can make that the get method if
you want to make them URL variables but
I would just use post and then we make
the forms action equal to my parser PHP
that way my parser dot PHP can scoop up
all of the form data and process it on
the server that way you can email it
stick it in a database do whatever you
want with the data at that point and
finally the last line is the multi-phase
form dot submit and that's what actually
submits the form and it will go to your
parse file now an alternative is to use
an ajax request here and replace these
three lines with an ajax request now
since we haven't applied any CSS at all
when you run this or test it you're
going to see that you see every phase of
the form you don't want that it's
because we haven't put any CSS in place
to hide specific elements that need to
be hidden by default at four
first when the page loads so in our
style element let's target the
multi-phase form itself and let's give
it a black border let's give it some
padding and let's give it a specified
width you can change all of these values
now what we'll do is make a rule that's
going to target the multi-phase form
elements with ID of phase 2 phase 3 and
show all data are going to be displayed
none now let's run that take a little
test see now you have just phase 1 and
if I was to let's see if it works put an
atom my last name query continue and it
continued to phase 2 I could pick my
gender male continue it continues to
phase 3 and then if I choose my country
continue I see an overview and then when
I submit all data what's going to happen
is all of the form data is going to be
sent to my parser PHP in a traditional
sort of way but we're just submitting
the form through JavaScript like I said
if you want this to be an ajax request
where it happens without the page
reloading or anything
then you can use an ajax request right
there to send all of the form variables
to PHP now i also told you that i'm
going to show you how to put a progress
bar and show the user how many steps
there are and what step they're on which
are handy visual aids when you have
something that's multi stage or multi
steps okay I'm just going to put it at
the top of the page above my form you
can put it anywhere you want you can put
these things these two things inside of
your form if you want it doesn't matter
so what I did I put in progress element
and an h3 element this h3 element is
just really going to show text and I
could change this text at any time with
my JavaScript by targeting this status
ID and that's exactly what I'm going to
do then for the progress element I gave
an idea of progress bar starting value
zero the max value is 100 and the style
I just gave it a width of 250 pixels and
you can also put that style up here with
the rest of your CSS if you don't want
it in the
HTML directly like I put it here so
let's start up in process phase 1 and
what we'll do is right after we make
phase 2 display
we're going to change the progress bars
value to say 33 now if yours happens to
have four phases or four stages you
change this to 25 if your form has ten
stages you change this to ten so I'll
just make it 33 since I have three
stages I'm going to divide by 100 by
three and that's the number I'll put
here so the progress bars value is going
to be a third of the way after the user
gets finished with stage one or phase
one and then in that status text we're
just going to put the string of Phase
two of three so you can see in the
status text it starts out saying phase
one of three by default that's the
default text in it then after they press
continue on phase one we're going to
change that to say Phase two of three
now we can just copy those lines since
they're already all set up and go down
into Phase two the function that process
is phase two and add those lines again
but change this to 66 and then change
this to say phase three of three and
then down in the process phase three we
can just put a 100 here because that's
the very last phase where we're showing
them the the overview of the data they
gave us so that could be a hundred right
there and then the status could say data
overview now let's run it in our
favorite browser to make sure that we
have a working multi-phase form with
progress bar and status text and all
that good stuff so let's type in our
first name and then our last name
continue and you see when we continue
progress bar gets a third of the way
full because that part of the
multi-phase form is complete and then
we've put in the text that they're on
Phase two of three then when they choose
their gender continue the progress bar
grows a little bit and now they're on
Phase three of three then they give us
their country United States
to you and you fill up the progress bar
completely by making it 100 and then you
put in the text data overview and then
you just show them all the data they
gave you and then they when they press
submit data this form is going to be
submit to a my parser dot PHP file which
I'm going to show you right now okay
here's my parser dot PHP and I made it
very simple as to not over complicate
this lesson about the multi-phase form
now all this vial is doing is seeing if
the posted variable of first-name is set
and we're going to echo out all the
variables from the form that way you can
be sure that your form is sending over
all the data from the form over to your
server-side script once you see all this
data being populated here echoing out in
this script and you know everything is
working now what you want to do is make
sure you sanitize these variables first
thing if you happen to be making any
database queries or even emailing any of
this data you'd want to make sure you
sanitize it to make sure it has only the
specific characters that you desire to
be in the strings you don't want to let
the user put in funny characters like
quote quote marks or equal signs without
first escaping them or removing them
altogether so I'm going to have example
HTML all this code will be available for
you to copy and paste if yours happens
to mess up you want to see my exact code
and I tested mine in Firefox Internet
Explorer and Chrome now my parser dot
PHP code is also going to be available
under where the video plays it develop
PHP it's going to be right under the
example that HTML code there's not much
going on here but if you need that code
you need to copy and paste that I'll
have that as well okay so in the next
video what we're going to do is build a
quiz or online exam or online test that
could have as many questions as you want
and what we're going to do is just make
our script a little more dynamic so we
don't have to have a lot of JavaScript
functions we'll have one dynamic
beautiful function that powers the
entire quiz or the entire full-length
exam the
you want to offer online or whatever so
it'll have some differences from the way
we set things up in this tutorial it'll
be a little more dynamic and we'll be
using some arrays to hold the questions
and things like that if you enjoyed the
