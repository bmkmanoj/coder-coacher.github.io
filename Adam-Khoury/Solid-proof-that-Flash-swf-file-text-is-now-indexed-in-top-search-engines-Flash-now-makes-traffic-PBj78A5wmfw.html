another blog post about web design and
in this one we're going to discuss or
I'm going to show you proof that flash
files swfs all the text inside of them
is being indexed by search engines now I
believe Yahoo and google are leading the
way with technology but I have proof
right here what I did was I googled my
com ww Adam Corey calm and on the fifth
page there's not many links to my site
because my site sucks and it's
rinky-dinky but if you go to that's my
personal site that is nobody ever visits
that site but if you if you go to Union
blue calm it's one of the links in the
last results you'll see that there's my
contact page or my contact us form
tutorial sitting on that page and it's
an SWF file and it's the only thing on
the page besides this link here and I
viewed the source of the page as well
and you can see that the text that comes
up in the search engine is nowhere in
the source of the page there nowhere at
all just an object tag and a link and I
mean you can view the source yourself
but you'll see in the Google search
engine results it says untitled document
and the link is Union blue comment says
by Adam Corey or develop PHP if you find
our tutorials handy and helpful please
link to develop PHP com where you can
websites blogs blah blah blah blah blah
and you'll see inside the flash file it
says by Adam Corey develop PHP calm and
there's also text that you can't see but
it's in the swf it's in the flash file
and that's the text that reads if you
find our tutorials handy and helpful
please link to develop PHP and I put
that in most of my tutorial files you'll
see if you download my tutorial files
you'll see that exact text is sitting
down here inside the file so there's
proof for you
Google is indexing what's in the flash
file on the HTML page I did nothing
special you'll see you can't even
highlight this text it's not even
selectable this text is not even set to
selectable and it's still indexing it
just fine no problem so all you flash
haters can stuff it for finally saying
that flash doesn't index as well because
you can see irrefutable proof right here
that flash is indexing beautifully I did
nothing special no special methods of
doing this it just does it automatically
and it's google and yahoo who are behind
the technology that's now crawling the
swf files and i just wanted to show some
proof this uh this debate not debate but
the subjects been on the table for a
while we've all known that the search
engines are going to start indexing swf
files but i just want to show you guys a
little bit of proof and if you need it
yourself go to Union blue com or you can
just search my com WWE Adam Corey calm
and page five you'll see Union blue
right there boom it's indexing all that
swf data okay we'll see you guys next
