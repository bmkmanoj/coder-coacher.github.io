dynamic community member based website
system brought to you by develop PHP
created my flash building and in the
last section or the last part we we left
off with creating our Universal header
file that's flashing in this case and
yours can be all HTML and CSS and we
haven't begun to dissect the home page
yet we're still designing the home page
we're going to set up some CSS well I
had the CSS to the top and then we're
gonna use a CSS style sheet will zap all
the CSS right out of here put it in an
external stylesheet that way when we
make all the other pages for the site
they'll all stick to the same CSS rules
and styles and we can all we can change
everything universally to make
programming the site a whole lot easier
when it comes to designing the layouts
and changing the layout so later on or
whatever okay so we're in design mode
and we're gonna add a table so we can go
right in here and this is something a
lot of developers might yell at me for
using tables but I don't care I'm going
to use it anyway so I'm gonna go to
insert table right below the div here
they did a line that holds the object
tag for the flash file I'm gonna add a
table make it 9:50 the same width as our
header
two columns one row and pixels press ok
now if we look at that and see what we
get now let's Center that
by highlighting it and going down here
to the properties and hit center and
let's just grab and make another one
identical press control-c highlight this
table press ctrl C go to the side there
press ctrl V and you put a copy
same exact right under itself and put
seven columns in this one and that's
gonna be our footer so let's just go
ahead and type a few things in say this
is going to be a link
let's give it a make it an active link
by giving it a pound sign down in the
property's expected into the link
section there each one will define what
these links are and where they go what
they say what the labels will be when we
figure out what we need them to be for
right now we're just getting our layout
set up now let's Center all those okay
it looks like a good footer to me now
inside the body section let's go ahead
and throw in some break tags here so we
can extend it out and now let's pull
this over to this side and I'm gonna
have this section here for ads and on
your homepage you might not want ads or
anything like that but on mind there's
going to be some ads and most of my
pages probably for the whole system
let's see how big should that be let's
just make it 184 right now and then I
have this whole section to work with
here and you can lay out your structure
of your table any way you need to and
but inside of this main section here on
the home page is where we'll have all
the things that we want to display about
our members and things like that hi you
know flash news flashes about what's
going on cool on the site and everything
like that
whatever your site's about maybe it's
about photography community of musicians
community of graphic designers community
of webmasters any kind of community
you're making so let's see let's go
ahead and make this different color here
let's give this a background color of
gray so we can see what its gonna do in
the browser press ctrl s save it
and FTP it index.html and remember that
that header that HTML that's where the
header file that flash header file you
never have to really touch that file
again that HTML file every time you
output the flash header file it's just
gonna overwrite that SWF but it won't
ever overwrite your index that HTML page
because it's not connected to that
header file directly if that makes any
sense
every time you publish out that header
file will be overwritten and made new ok
so let's go here web intersect and
refresh okay so now we have a 950 wide
site which might be yeah that'll work
because the information will be down
here and the box won't be all grey like
that so let's go ahead back into
Dreamweaver let's make that no color
again okay so that is now we're gonna go
ahead and make sure we get the CSS
Styles we want in here for the whole
site we're gonna make our style sheet I
mean the ones we want to start with at
least so we'll get an external style
sheet shut up set up and then we'll
dissect the home page and make these
included template files just to make
life easier for the whole system
or for coding out the whole system
okay my site has a color scheme that I'm
gonna be working with and yours would
too and these are gonna be the major
colors that I'll be using on the site
and a green orange black and gray and
white and so inside of Dreamweaver let's
go ahead and set those Styles up the way
we can get everything rolling right
along with our CSS style sheet and you
can see here I already have my link up
and I'm gonna have all this source code
available in a few days when I finish
this system so you guys can get it all
the source code so you can see what it's
how it's uh all put together without a
doubt and you can see I have style a
folder called style and then main dot
CSS so that's gonna have to be the
directory in the file from my stylesheet
when I go to create but I already sunk
my link in here just so I'm ready ahead
of time when I go to create it okay so
let's go ahead and set up some styles
we'll go and crawl this one say dot
let's go down a couple more lines well
first let's go to the design view and
make the font and everything the way
we'd want it to be so let's go to page
properties set the default font to Arial
that's what I want you can set yours to
anything I'm going to set the default
font size to 11 pixels and see how that
looks and then or maybe 12 12 pixels
text color
should be almost black background color
is white and you just leave it like it
is and it'll be white and the background
image we don't have one yet maybe we'll
put one in later margins are all set
links we're gonna make our links color
what color should we make our links
let's see I'm just gonna leave them
standard so let's press apply
okay and you can see a change to the
size of our text and everything a little
bit so let's see how that looks in the
browser you always want to check and see
how things are gonna look in the browser
and on different browsers that looks
good to me okay let's let's quickly set
up the colors for the site now so we can
go actually let's go ahead and do it
with text so I'm just gonna type out
test then go down a couple limes test
and test
I make this one the color I would like
it to be which is that which orange am I
using I forget let's see orange would be
that orange there okay that orange I
also want this green and that gray is
good for default but I want a lighter
gray for some certain things so let's
use that one okay those are the three
colors I want let's go to code view and
up here it popped in three styles you
see that and so we have a design view
that's gray style for style three is
green style two is orange so let's
change the name on those so the more
identifiable style two is orange so
let's say orange color
I think style 4 was the gray color and
this was the green color
let's see if we get it right go down
here make this one green orange
something like that and the gray okay so
they all have a span class orange color
you see how that's gonna work and then
when we set this out into its external
CSS file those will still stick to those
rules okay so we have some colors set up
that we want and what else do we need
let's just type some text into the home
page
so let's see I think that's all waiting
for the colors let's go ahead and set up
the stylesheet now it's on file and
we'll add me be adding more to it later
so let's go to new basic CSS and we have
a CSS document and we're gonna go into
the index file and snatch out all that
CSS there from body all the way to the
last one which was the gray color press
X ctrl X you can then get rid of all
this you don't need that go here press
control V viol save as we need a new
folder called style remember style and
inside of that would name this file main
main dot CSS save go back to index press
save now I'm go to design we can see
it's still sticking to all those rules
so if we type in text we want it styled
with those colors there they are even
though none of those styles are in our
HTML file to our external CSS file now
so that's how we can set up our external
CSS file Universal CSS file for the site
to make coding and laying out design a
whole lot easier especially as it gets
bigger and you want to add changes to
the layout or design okay so you can see
the meta tags I have here and like I
said I'm gonna have all the source code
exact for everybody to download when the
system is complete or the foundation
when the foundation is complete and so
now we have a good start to the system
or the pages anyway so we can
so let's go ahead and make this link
right here say home let's make this link
say just for example say we'll make it
say about so about we're gonna make that
go to a page about the PHP
and now this one will go to HTTP colon
slash slash www.webociti.com ik PHP and
go to code view zap all that out of
there go back to the design view and
we'll go to index let's grab the header
let's go into the code grab that div
align Center right there
the whole div tag opening and closing
tags press ctrl X leave a little space
so we're going to be adding something
there in a second and let's go to that
untitled file go back in a code view pop
all that code in now go to file save as
back in the root directory I'm going to
name this ahead dur TMP LT for short for
template header template let's just name
it full Tim plate header template
and PHP in the root directory is safe
okay now we turn the index that HTML
into an index dot PHP let me say save as
index dot PHP instead of HTML save and
now we go into the code view here again
and right there between above the body
table there we're going to add PHP tag
which is going to be this is how we're
going to include our header and footer
into all of our pages universally and
any other things that we want include
underscore once and then we can just
type in two double quotes semicolon and
then close off the PHP tags right here
we're gonna include oops
I'm sorry we already type that this is
going to be the header template late dot
PHP so that's how it's gonna work and if
we press save we have our header
template here we can test it out and I
just prove it to you that's gonna work
well you just put up index up PHP let's
remove index out HTML here delete it yes
and let's go on the web and you can see
that it's gone see now let's go back to
FTP the index out PHP and the header
template file now and now if we go back
refresh
tada the header is now oh I forgot we
need her CSS folder just bring that
whole style folder right over it's got
the main cascading style sheet in it so
let's go ahead and refresh again now
we'll have our margin set back okay
that looks great now when we click this
now what we have to do let me show you
the handiness of this now well we'll go
back into header into the index design
view let's do the same to this control X
highlight the table control X file new
PHP and we're in design view let's go
into code zap that out go back to design
view press control V pop that table
right back in make sure it's just the
table in the code view let's save this
as footer template
and it's a PHP file make sure it's PHP
save it now we include it just like we
did that one let me just grab that press
control-c go down underneath the table
to the body section and for the template
footer template so you rename that
include once footer template and you can
include or include once which it's very
literal what it means here it just
includes the file once you can include a
file many times on a web page but this
makes sure it only includes it once okay
let's go ahead and put this up now it's
file index dot PHP now we'll go and
refresh and you'll see that there's no
footer because our templates not up
remember so the FTP the footer template
for the template header template
everything's up now will refresh there's
a footer our header and our body
sections all set up now create a new
page index dot PHP our home page let's
save that as about that PHP
and press save now it's about that PHP
all you have to do is change the
keywords so whatever about web intersect
I'll put more later description is about
web intersect and
right here the title about web intersect
and so now we have you can make 20 30
pages this way and they'll all have the
same header and footer on strand let's
go put this where is it about that PHP
let's go back to the web so refresh the
homepage click about and there it is
here we are in about that PHP you can
see we have the same exact header the
same exact footage let's click home goes
back to the web in a sec com the home
page so you can see the handiness of
that as you're going to be building a
bigger system you won't have to change
these you go straight into these little
footer and header files and make all the
changes or additions you want and you
FTP that back up to the server and all
hundred pages that you have a hundred
thousand pages however many pages you
have will all be updated at once that's
the handiness that's where I had to take
all the time to show you guys this
because you know some people were having
trouble understanding how all the files
are connected and how things are
included using PHP and so yeah that
pretty much wraps up part 3 will in part
4 I think I said we'll make the
registration form part 3 but I don't
think well I'll have time squeeze it
into this video we'll squeeze it I'll
squeeze it into the next one and I'll
make it directly after right now so yeah
next one will create the registration
form that puts the members information
into our remember database and then we
can really get moving with this thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
