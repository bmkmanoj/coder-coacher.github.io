animated peekaboo boxes that appear
according to the users scroll position
on the page we'll be targeting the
bottom of the page in this lesson but
any scroll position can trigger a
peekaboo box to appear and disappear
from the page will be using javascript
to trigger the css3 transition to make
this possible before we begin the lesson
let's take a look at the finished
product so when the user Scrolls down to
the bottom of your page a peekaboo box
appears from anywhere that you want it
to appear and from any direction and
when the user starts to scroll back up
it goes away again in an animated
fashion so it peek-a-boos in an animated
fashion and it goes away animated it as
well okay you can use the scrollbar to
same deal
boomp boomp
Picabo Picabo whoo okay let's start with
the bare bones of an HTML pipe web
document you can name yours whatever you
want now I'm going to pop this code into
the body element and let me explain it
real quick we have an h2 element that
holds a heading on the page actually if
I render this to my favorite browser you
can see what I have I have a heading up
top and then I have a paragraph here and
I set the paragraph to be really high
that way I have a lot of vertical scroll
on my page you see on the bottom it's
his peekaboo down here because I'm not
hiding this element yet using CSS but in
just a moment I'm going to take this
element and I'm going to hide it off to
the side of the page somewhere where I
want and then the logic is when the user
hits the bottom of the content on my
page when the scrollbar hits the bottom
we're going to make that peekaboo box
come into view in an animated way and
we're only going to use one line of css3
to make the animation possible okay so
let's take a look at that content on the
page here's my div peekaboo and it has
an ID of bottom window one actually Nate
let's name that peekaboo just so it's
more in line with the lesson okay so we
have a heading a simple paragraph that
is set to height 1600 pixels to give me
a lot of vertical scroll that's to
simulate that I have a lot of data on my
page
enough to make vertical scroll then
under that paragraph the last element on
the page is my peekaboo box and that's
all the HTML we're going to have in the
example now let's apply our CSS so we
can open up a style element in our head
element type text/css go down a couple
of lines and put in the closing tag for
that style element now let's target this
peekaboo box and the CSS so we make a
rule for the div with an ID of peekaboo
and we apply all of these properties to
it the important ones you have to know
is the position property is fixed that
way we can set its bottom position to
zero and that was how I got it to the
bottom of the page and then the right
position I set to minus 352 pixels and
my box is 300 pixels wide and I set it
to write 352 pixels so it's off outside
of the window view pane so it's outside
of the view pane sitting off to pixels
off to the side on the right of the
users window I give it a background
color of a light blue I gave the Box 25
padding that's why my width you see my
width is 300 but I have the box sitting
at 352 the box width with the padding
comes to 350 so that's why you see me
sitting in the box at 352 and I put it
at 350 - in case you put any borders on
your box you don't want to have a little
sliver of a border showing so just make
sure you move it to the right enough
where the user can't see it initially
and the tight is 200 pixels and the font
size in it is really big because I
wanted to put the word peekaboo in it
really large for you just for this
example but you can put whatever you
want and style that peekaboo box any way
you like okay now let's test on our
favorite browser and make sure that the
element is off of the page hiding to the
right so let's scroll to the bottom and
I don't see it over here anymore that
means it's doing its job off to the
right over here it would be living off
in this space but we can't see it now
let's apply the JavaScript to make the
magic happen and I'm going to use a
function that I used in an
tutorial that we made a few months back
for scroll to the bottom add more
dynamic content tutorial it was a
tutorial where I showed how like you
know on Facebook and Google+ where you
can scroll I'm going to sure if Google+
does it but Facebook does it when you
scroll to the bottom of the page more
dynamic content loads in so Facebook
doesn't initially load a bunch of
content to the page they'll only load it
if you scroll to the bottom that was
what that tutorial was all about and I'm
going to show you that tutorial to show
you how I'm getting this function first
let me put the function into the head
tag under the CSS you can see here I
have the function code set into place
and I name the function y scroll handler
now why I named it Y scroll because Y is
the vertical plane X is the horizontal
plane so Y is the vertical plane so Y
scroll is the plane that I was targeting
now if you were to go to develop PHP com
in the JavaScript video tutorial section
if you scroll down or you can just use
my search bar up here but you want to
search for JavaScript scroll tutorial
low dynamic content into page when user
reaches bottom and this is the one where
I was talking about that whole concept
of loading more content to the page when
the user reaches the bottom we're going
to use this sort of code see the Y
handler function right here
I used that similar sort of code
to create this peekaboo box effect so if
any of you wondering you know what this
function is all about I'm not going to
explain it again and again and again you
can go watch it out of the tutorial if
you want to understand in depth how this
function Y scroll handler works but I
will tell you that it works with a
window dot on scroll event and that
means when the user Scrolls the window
this Y scroll handler function is going
to fire off every time they scroll the
window even just a little bit oh we
don't need wrap either because I
realized that we can just target the
document body offset height instead of
requiring a wrap around all of your
content you can just use the body
element as your offset height setting
here so let's take a look before I
discuss this little bit of code
right here inside of that why scroll
handler let's take a look at what it
renders in the browser and make sure it
works scroll to the bottom and there's
the peekaboo box very nice scroll back
up and it goes away
okay so I'll quickly try to explain the
code and it's very similar to the code
that we had in the other tutorial that I
just referred to a second ago the first
thing we do in this function is we
create an object reference for the
peekaboo element on the page which is
this peekaboo box we say document dot
get element by ID peekaboo so now we
have an object reference for that
element then we say if window dot page Y
offset plus window dot inner height is
greater than or equal to document body
offset height then you want to run code
that makes the box come into the users
view so they can see it in an animated
fashion and we use the transition
property to do that and just a few
tutorials ago about three tutorials ago
I think it was I talked in depth about
how to trigger css3 transitions using
javascript the way that I'm doing it
here so I'm not going to go in depth
about that again either but just know
that when this if conditions logic is
met and it returns true then this code
is going to run to bring the box into
view basically this if conditions logic
is set up to sense when the user Scrolls
to the bottom of the page so if you
don't understand all these properties
and the values that they might give you
just understand that it's there to sense
when the user hits the bottom of the
page when they scroll to the bottom when
they do you want to bring that magic box
into view else when they're scrolling
and they're not hitting the bottom maybe
they're scrolling back up you want to
animate that box back out of view so
it's that simple
when the user hits the bottom and it
made the box interview else animate the
box out of you and that's all there is
to it now let's test it on all the
browsers so I've been checking it in
Chrome so we know it works in Chrome
already peek-a-boo peek-a-boo now let's
go to file preview in Firefox
peekaboo piccaboo preview in Internet
Explorer scroll to the bottom peekaboo
piccaboo now let's preview this in
Safari now let's go to the bottom and
see what happens
oh no it just snaps into view in a very
non animated sort of way the users still
see it when they get to the bottom but
it's not very pretty so what you can do
in older browsers is use the prefixes
and to do that in JavaScript it's a
little bit different than doing it in
CSS usually in CSS you'll see something
like this that's the WebKit prefix but
in order to do that in JavaScript right
here and Safari uses the WebKit prefix
so in order to do that in JavaScript
right here you just type in WebKit all
lowercase and then give you a property
your CSS property a capital just the
first letter so you can see I have
WebKit transition I can take that copy
it put it right here press ctrl s to
save my file then go to file preview in
Safari scroll to the bottom and we have
animated peekaboo just like we want now
so if you want this to work in older
browsers you can target the prefixes for
like M s for a really old internet
explorer you can put m s right there I
think but most of the browsers as you
guys noticed we're using the straight-up
transition property but if you have to
add multiple you just add this line last
so you take this line make sure it's
last put the others above it where
you're going to put WebKit transition
right there and then have this one under
it now it'll work in chrome when I go to
the bottom get a peekaboo
and Safari
okay but this standardized property
transition in JavaScript can be called
in the all modern browsers Internet
Explorer Firefox Chrome and maybe my
Safari is just an older outdated version
stay off the drugs
okay I hope you've enjoyed this lesson
on creating peekaboo boxes using
javascript and CSS if you don't like
this video and share it with your
friends I'm going to kick your ass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
