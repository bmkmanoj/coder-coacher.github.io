you'll be learning how to create as
fireworks cs4 graphics design workflow
tutorial hello everybody Adam in develop
PHP here and I'm in the requested
tutorial section at the site and my
homie Asgard rights you please show how
to create this line in fireworks i think
yes and he gives a link to a YouTube
video of mine and I went to it and I
checked it out and this is the line he's
talking about this graphics or these
graphics which i created in fireworks
and that's what this video will be all
about
okay Asgard let's open up fireworks cs4
and click create new fireworks document
P&amp;amp;G here i'm going to make mine a
thousand by 500 and if you were making a
desktop background wallpaper for
yourself for your computer you just make
it the size of your screen resolution
your canvas size and then i'll put that
file alright i'm going to make the
canvas black and let's go ahead and grab
the pen tool now we have no line and no
Phil we've got to change that make sure
we have a white line here or whatever
color you want to draw with you can also
have set to bill but I'm not going to
set the fill is just yet I'm going to
set the fill after I complete my shape
or with our pen tool selected will go to
the spot on the canvas where we want to
start right about there click down and
let go the next point you go to with the
pen tool you're going to click down hold
and drag now lets you manipulate the
contour or the arc of your shape you get
the desired arc you like and then you
just go to the next point after you let
go you go to the next point let's go
right about there click and hold and
then let's give it a little bit of
manipulation here on this Ark see I'm
just holding it down and I can
manipulate it any way I want and it
doesn't stick until I let go so I'm
going to go right about here and then
I'm going to come around here click hold
drag a little bit and then right about
there now instead of making another
point I'm going to select or go put my
mouse right on top of that last point
you'll see a little arrow appears that
little arrow will appear and let you
know that you click that same point to
merge them and now you can make a sharp
taper going the other direction and
close up the object see I can close up
the object right here if I wanted but I
don't want to do that I'm going to go
around here and manipulate this taper on
the way back we're going to try our best
to follow these contours nice and smooth
but taper it so make it bigger as we go
so let's start off nice and sharp at the
edge there and then come around click
and hold shape it to where it looks like
a nice contour just go right about here
hold down and then click you close up
your shape now once your shape is closed
you can give it a fill let's give it a
feel of white okay now let's take our
main shape move it out of the way a
little bit we're going to create a drop
shape so let's grab the pen tool again
click down hold drag right about here
right about there and bring that contour
in just a little bit right about there
and then come around here and make that
a little more rounded at the bottom
click down click down grab the sub
selection tool make this point on the
bottom grab this that point and make it
all straight because now what we're
going to do is take this ctrl-c ctrl-v
flip it horizontally the copy we just
made by pressing ctrl-c ctrl-v once we
have a copy there we can merge the two
highlight both of them go to modify
combine paths and union and there's your
drop shape shape of a drop which you can
make these shapes any size you need to
once you get them made let's go to the
scale tool with that selected scale that
down just a little bit
and a little bit more now we're just
going to make a series of drops
following this one that get smaller as
they go ctrl-c ctrl-v drag the new one
down scale tool make it a little bit
smaller so they graduate in size now for
the drip ease on the tail end let's just
grab the smallest one ctrl-c ctrl-v and
let's skew it to where the point is
coming off of this end right there and
kind of match it up and press ctrl-c
ctrl-v move this 10 / scale it down you
can even zoom in by pressing ctrl and
mouse wheel that one's a little bit too
small so let's use that for the further
one ctrl-c ctrl-v scale it down there we
go that's better so we'll have three
drops on each end well before we add
effects to these shapes let's go ahead
and put in the text text is going to say
creative hello
and the font that I used was creative or
art brush I think it's called art brush
yeah that's it bold make it white
let's bring up the size and maybe Center
it there we go it looks good right the
let's bring it up maybe a little bit
bigger that's good create a flow
vertafore now we put effects on dit
let's grab pretty much everything we'll
see how it looks we'll just do
everything on stage and go to the
filters bevel and emboss inner bevel now
you want to take that inner bevel and
give it smooth all the way up on that
slider all the way up on that slider and
all the way up on that slider now you
can mess with the angles if you like
okay I like it so far and with the
bevels it all looks pretty nice let's
see let's make this one let's highlight
this one and let's manipulate its inner
bevel first and let's make it to where
it's not so faded make it stand out a
little more the bevel there we go it
looks good okay so now at this point we
can just grab everything press ctrl-a
and give it another filter of glow you
can have a glow any color you want
there's the red glow and I think the
glow color I had was this one
and you can see how this kind of ribs in
that you want to make sure that's all
the way smooth let's go back to the
inner bevel oh I see mine was set to
five should have been on ten so there
you have it Asgard that's pretty much
how I did it hope you get some helpful
tips out of that workflow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
