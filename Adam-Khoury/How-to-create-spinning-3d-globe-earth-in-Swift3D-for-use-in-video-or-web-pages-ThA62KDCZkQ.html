tutorial we're going to show you the
output of what we're creating here it's
a spinning globe that has opacity set on
the land masses in the water and there's
a glow set on it that I put on it in
flash after I imported the swf that
Swift 3d renders out into flash after I
imported that into flash I put a glow
effect on it and you'll see all your
frames in flash let's see double click
on this movie clip and there's all the
frames spin it around and that's what
Swift 3d renders out swf files that you
can import into flash then put cool
effects and animations and control on
using ActionScript or using stage
properties ok so here we go ok in this
tutorial will be working inside of Swift
3d version 5 and we're creating a an
animated 3d globe it would be a spinning
globe and it will have opaque qualities
to it to where you can kind of see
through certain aspects of it so the
first thing we're going to do is we open
the Swift 3d version 5 and I have a new
brand new file here I didn't do any
adjustments yet but I'm going to go
ahead and change the layout the output
size of the file to 200 pixels by 200
pixels and now you can see adjust the
size of the window there and now I'm
going to add a sphere creates fear get
the segmentation up to 64 for the
latitude and longitude and then we'll
highlight the sphere and we go to bitmap
now on materials bitmap and
let's see now actually you don't even
have to go to bitmap you can just go to
materials here you click materials once
this hi this object is highlighted you
double-click this the object here that
shows the material and then you can wear
it says color you can select down the
drop-down list a bitmap image and then
you go to your documents folder or
wherever they are and go to your
pictures and you try to find the picture
you want to use and I have created in
fireworks a PNG document that has opaque
water it has blue water and it has green
land and the water is set to an opacity
of about sixty percent and the land is
also set to an opacity of about 75% i
believe so now i'm going to press
generate preview and you can see how it
puts it on the globe then you press ok
and there is opaque qualities on a
bitmap image that's loaded on to that
sphere so now once we go to animations
here you click animations and you go to
counter clockwise spin because that's
the way the Earth spins and then you
press play up here and you can see your
earth spinning around and you can set
the the layout the environment up here
to make it a black background if you
want so let's change that to black
background first okay now it's on a
black background and let's change the
lighting to be not so bright we only
want one specular highlight on the on
the globe we'll put a dead center kind
of dead center top there and you can
move your lights around add lights
the delete lights by selecting them and
then controlling them here you're you're
seeing light lighting can all be
controlled down here so what we'll do
then is go to preview and export and now
this is where it'll render out and swf
file for us but first we want to click
raster and generate all frames you can
see here I have flash player swf already
selected so it will generate all frames
now it's rendering all the frames that
that the animation is composed of then
once the frame is our finished rendering
we can press play and see how it's going
to look in the browser once we send it
into flash so now we have an SWF and you
press export all frames see how it says
export to file up here press export all
frames and now let's just put it on the
desktop and we'll call it globe save
let's minimize this and now on the
desktop here you can see I have so many
files here here it is you double-click
globe and there it is spinning around
and you can then take that into flash
load it like any other swf into flash
actually if you import the swf into
flash you'll see all the frames it it
puts all the frames into a movie clip
and each frame is laid out in its own
little keyframe and you'll see it in
flash once you import this file it's a
flash so there you go spinning globe
ready to go you put glow all kind of
cool effects on it and you can have a
ball with it but that's how you make a
nice 3d spinning globe that has opaque
quality to it in the way I got the
opaque opacity set on the bitmap image
it was inside of fireworks I just set
the opacity down for the landmasses and
the water okay that's it we'll see you
