develop PHP calm here once again with
another exciting flash actionscript 3.0
tutorial now before we do any learning
let's take a peek at the finished
product and discuss what we're setting
out to do we have a little application
that has sliding doors on it and what
we're setting out to do is make sure
when we animate our sliding doors that
the proper section comes in to
appearance just the right time when it
should when those doors are opening back
up again and this tutorial comes
courtesy of Mike 4:25 who is a developed
PHP forum member and he's the one that
requested to get a little help on making
the sliding doors happen correctly so I
told him I would put a little something
together and he said okay so that's why
we're going through with it
all right first thing to do is create a
new flash ActionScript free file I'm
just going to start from the very
beginning that way people who might be
following along or watching this video
will have a better understanding of what
we're trying to accomplish and how to
make it so you can choose to draw out
your graphic elements right directly on
stage and flash using the toolset but I
happen to have some in fireworks here
that I'm going to use so I have some
little doors one two three four and a
cover I'm going to grab all five of
those objects ctrl C then in flash cs4
I'm going to paste them control V into
current frame as movie clip okay so it's
556 wide 400 high so let's make our
stage match that 556 400 okay you can
see it imported it as a movie clip so
all of those items are inside that movie
clip I can name this layer whole clip or
whatever you want I'm going to double
click inside of it you can check out
this layer folder the way it has all of
those items in there so you have the
cover bottom right door bottom left or
top left or top right door so let's lock
the cover layer and let's grab all four
of those doors so you see I have all
four selected I'm going to right-click
them convert the symbol make sure its
movie clip name it whatever you want in
the library okay now it's highlighted
and give it an instance name of sliding
doors so now the movie clip that
contains those four sliding doors has an
instance name of sliding doors it makes
good sense ah let's delete these layers
we don't need them to rename this
sliding doors because that's the layer
that the sliding doors movie clip
resides on the layer above it let's name
that cover now let's give it one more
layer and rename that one buttons now
let's put a button on there or the shape
of a button you can use your tool set to
put any kind of button you want I'll use
the rectangle primitive all right once
your little shape is drawn you can
manipulate things and give it a gradient
if you like go to
transforming a gradient using this
little wheel on the end you can
transform that gradient to be any
direction you want okay me likey that
now let's put some text on it I'm going
to make mine static text doesn't have to
be dynamic put it into place on the
button I'm going to adjust the gradients
in the color palette where I can see
through this just a little bit just for
a little bit of a nicer effect so you
can just pop these open and adjust your
alpha that's how you can see through it
a little bit right click that convert
the symbol this one I'm going to make a
button okay double click inside and on
the overstate and the down state I'm
clicking f6 in the overstate I'm going
to change the button just a little bit
make it brighter on the color palette
and take itself it down a little bit
that'll work for me
okay so there's one button so once you
have one button there you can go into
your library duplicate that symbol
that's okay and now you have a copy of
it just drag the copy out then you can
go inside of that duplicate and change
whatever you want I'm going to do it one
more time I'm going to copy symbol two
I'm going to copy the symbol to copy
duplicate that okay there's my third
button I'll go inside and change that to
okay so now when I press control enter
you can see what we've got
three buttons and nothing happens when
we click them yet now since the buttons
are here right here that's where we're
going to put our code let's make another
layer and call it a s3 short for
ActionScript 3 that's where we'll press
f9 to open our actions panel and if
that's not available you can go up to
window actions that will open your
actions panel that's where we'll put
some code to have these buttons run
these sliding doors okay before we
program the buttons let's knock out this
door animation real quick so highlight
the door the sliding doors movie clip
double-click inside of it separate these
out into layers so hit the create new
layer button three times grab this one
control X put it on the top layer
control shift V grab this one control X
put it on next layer down
we'll shift V grab this one control X
put it on the one the last one that's
left control shift V so there's your
four doors and right above four doors
put a new layer and call that frame
labels let's go out to maybe frame I
don't know 20
let's give it a frame label of clothes
on the first one to give that a label of
open let's extend that out to frame 40
by pressing f5 so now you can see my
frame labels in there
and I'm going to use those frame labels
to command to have the buttons command
this animation so you can see where they
are in the first frame let's go to frame
19 so in frame 19 I'm going to press f6
I'm going to do that on all four of
those layers and I'm also going to go to
frame 40 and do the same thing f6 f6 f6
f6 actually those should be on frame 20
so I'm going to move those over you can
just grab them and move them over okay
now the ones in the center on frame 20
we're just going to simply grab them and
move them so I want to take it from this
position here so this one moves this way
up this one moves that way up this one
moves this way and this one moves this
way so go ahead and do that okay so once
you get them directly in the corner just
make each corner meet up to the corner
of your square or your empty hole behind
it so now you can see on frame 20
everything is wide open you can go right
in between and create classic tween on
all of those you can actually highlight
them all at the same time I'm just going
to do them individually classic tween on
all of those and then you'll see you
have a nice animation where they come
well they start at the close position
then they open and they close you can
just drag your playhead so when these
doors are open behind them that's where
you want your page content that holds
all your various pages so let's go ahead
put a rectangle there I'm just going to
draw a rectangle primitive so I'm going
to create a new layer make sure it's on
the bottom of everything so drag it to
the bottom you can just grab these
layers and drag them around and that's
where I'll put a rectangle primitive
here so in frame 20 I can see exactly
what's going on I'm going to move that
rectangle right into place put a little
default text on it
to say section 1 let's make sure that
text is white so we can see it and a
little bit bigger there we go let's put
it somewhere in the center alrighty now
let's highlight that and the rectangle
both of them
right click them convert to symbol this
is going to be a movie clip symbol okay
doesn't matter what it's named in the
library now highlight it and give it an
instance name of pages now you can
double click that this is where you page
out your sections so right here I'm
going to put a new layer this is going
to be for actions press f9 and put a
stop action there because you don't want
this movie clip to just repeatedly loop
over the frames we're going to add a few
more frames in here so just put a stop
action on frame 1 now go to frame tool
you can even rename this layer pages
frame 2 you can press f6 change the
color of this to some different kind of
color change that text to say section 2
so now you'll see on frame 1 you have
section 1 brain - there's section 2 so
that's how you can separate out and have
different content on different pages
here and keep in mind that this can be
more than just a rectangle and some text
it can be movie clips animations
whatever you want to put in there these
can be individual movie clips if you
like so I just need one more section to
make section 3 and let's change the
color of this rectangle just so
everything has a different color so you
guys can see what's going on alright so
there's my three sections 1 2 3 and I
made in different colors just so we see
a distinct difference let's go back into
our sliding doors movie clip and on the
same layer where we have the let's make
it to where we can't see those doors
there
on that same layer layer six which we
can name that pages pages clip I'm going
to put a dynamic text field and this is
where the magic comes in you're going to
you guys are going to like this this is
slick just put some default text in
there and make sure that's a dynamic
text field to give it an instance name
of go to page go to page underscore txt
we're going to put a 1 inside of it as a
default value and it doesn't really
matter what color that text is because
nobody's going to be able to see it and
this is going to be a way it's going to
be sort of a way to hold a variable but
in a more physical form that you know
it's going to work
you can also do this through variables
but I think this is a lot easier and if
you have the access to a dynamic text
field you might as well so this is
what's going to happen right here on
frame 1 we're going to put one more
layer let's call that a s3 for
ActionScript 3 we're going to command
this movie clip with the instance name
of pages to go to whichever frame
because it has different frames inside
of it you see we're going to instruct
that movie clip to go to whichever frame
inside of it that this text field is
holding right now it's holding frame 1
so it would go to frame 1 well it's
already on frame 1 but if this was a 2
this would go to frame 2 this was a 3
this would go to frame 3 so let's put in
the code to do that and say pages dot go
to and stop then you simply put in the
name of this text field which was go to
page underscore txt right there dot text
go to page on the scroll txt text I'm
going to double click over here to go
into the parent movie clip now I'm going
to give these buttons instance names BTN
one this one's going to be BTN two this
one will be BT and three
now I can code those buttons out right
here on our as3 layer let's go inside
this movie clip and make sure we can see
those doors again there we go
now let's double click can go here now
if you were to test your file at this
point you're going to see your doors are
just closing and opening and closing and
there's no control over them yet and if
you want you can double click inside the
sliding doors movie and on the as3 layer
right there in frame 20 press f6 put a
stop action right there we're going to
need that anyway now if you test you'll
see it opens like it should and stays
open to the section alright
double click on the outside here go back
into that parent movie clip where your
buttons are the as3 layer press f9 open
the actions panel Oh real quick if you
want to see how that works check this
out just change that to a three now
press control enter
you see that section three opens up
change this to a two booyah baby so
that's how it's done now let me show you
how to control that with those buttons
that are in the parent movie clip turn
that back to a1 alright so we're in the
parent movie clip of the sliding doors
and we're going to code to these buttons
now as3 layer press f9 okay let's type
in function click one open parentheses
close parentheses inside the parentheses
let's type in event colon mouse event
outside the parentheses let's with colon
void open the curly brace go down a
couple lines and close the curly brace
there's your click one function for
button number one so we have to say BTN
one dot add event listener make sure
this is a capital e open parenthesis
Mouse event
dot click all caps comma and the name of
the function you want to fire off as
click one up there close parentheses
semicolon now any code that you want to
happen when et n1 is pressed that be
this one that's what you put right here
inside of this function so what we want
to happen is we want to make the sliding
doors go to and play close this frame
label and I'll show you why in just a
second so make sure you get the right
instance name sliding doors go to and
play open parenthesis close parenthesis
semicolon and inside you give it a frame
label close now before that happens
you want to change that text so let's go
inside here and change this text field
to dynamic text field so we can do
whatever we want
let's get the name of that text make
sure you get the proper name let's go
back to the parent movie clip right here
we put go to page that go to page
underscore txt dot text is equal to one
for this button make sure you refer to
sliding doors before that you're
accessing the sliding doors movie clip
and then you're accessing the dynamic
text field that's sitting on stage
inside of that movie clip and you're
making it a 1 and then you instruct
sliding doors to go to and play clothes
now watch if I just take this whole
thing put one there one there let's just
change these to a two this one's three
three three and three I think that's it
let's press control enter the section
one opens up when the application loads
let's click section three isn't that
pretty neat and it changes when
everything is closed exactly when it
should you just watched how I structured
the whole thing out you know how exactly
how it's working and if you want to put
sound in there all you have to do is go
into this part of the movie clip the
sliding doors where you see this
animations running that's where you put
those sounds I mean you can load sounds
right into your you can go to file
import any kind of sound you want just
going to get a star track sliding door
sound or whatever import it into your
library then once it's in your library
you can put it on a frame so you would
just make a new layer call it and name
it music or sound sound effect but I'm
going to leave that up to you to do I
just wanted to show people how you can
have content behind sliding doors like
that and show you how to change the page
content just at the precise time when
you should okay hope you enjoyed that
lesson and you can get the source code
at the better PHP com I have the source
file so I'll have a link to the source
file in the video description area that
you can click you can go and grab this
source file that I made here for this
tutorial and you can see all kind of
other Flash tutorials we got there at
develop PHP calm okay peace I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
