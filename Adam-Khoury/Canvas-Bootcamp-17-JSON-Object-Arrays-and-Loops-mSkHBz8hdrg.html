this simple exercise you can learn to
put JSON objects arrays and loops to
work in your canvas application JSON
objects which can also be recognized by
some programmers as associative arrays
are a great way to group and keep track
of many objects as individual entities
in the canvas that can possess any
properties you wish and packing those
JSON objects into arrays makes it simple
to add or remove them from a particular
group of objects from the canvas when
needed let's demonstrate this concept
with some code I have an empty canvas
here and what I'm gonna do is create an
empty array called buildings so I'll
just make that equal to an empty array
now I'll put the first JSON object into
it by opening and closing curly braces
and within the curly braces I put all
the data for my JSON object and each one
is going to be a building so the first
property I'll put in place is going to
be the ID of the building and then I'll
put colon and the first one I'll just
call house now the next property we're
going to put in place in this JSON
object is going to be the exposition
because each building is going to need
an x position a Y position a width and a
height we'll put in : and the x position
I want is 100 and I'll put in a comma
for my next property will be Y that's
the Y position for where it's going to
live and for this first one I'll make
that 100 Y as well now let's put in a
comma we want the width and that will
make 50 then we're gonna need the height
and that will be 50 as well and then the
very last property will be the
background so I'll name that BG for
short and for the house I'm gonna make
that a magenta color so you see what we
have is a JSON object and there's only
one in this array so far but we can put
multiple objects in this array what I'm
gonna do is just put a space here and a
space here I'm gonna highlight the whole
JSON object here
press ctrl C and then put a comma here
then go down one line and indent to the
first object and then paste in then what
we'll do is take this closing bracket
here and put it down
- right there so now you can put as many
objects that you want inside of your
buildings array and just make sure that
the last object doesn't have a comma so
let's say if I put one more if I want to
put one more in there I want to have to
put a comma and then the last one so
when the last one doesn't get a comma
but all the ones that precede the last
one make sure you put a comma in place
now this one I'll just call the grocery
this one we'll call post office we're
going to make sure they're not all
stacked on top of each other when they
get rendered to the canvas so we'll put
this at an exposition 200 we'll put the
post office at an exposition of 300 make
sure we change the background colors
we'll make this one green and this one
orange now all we have to do is run a
simple for loop over that array to
render all of these things to the canvas
in just a few lines of code and maybe if
we had 50 objects in here we wouldn't
have to render them each separately we
can just use the for loop to render them
all at once all right now I'll show you
what a loop like that would look like so
we type in 4 open close parentheses
opening curly brace and put in our
closing curly brace and a for loop we're
gonna need the VAR I which is equal to 0
semicolon
let me need to stipulate if I is less
than our buildings array dot length
semicolon and then I plus plus which
will increment the I variable so we're
just saying while I is less than
buildings that length this for loop is
going to run and this loop starts at an
index of 0 and it's gonna run over the
length of the building's array now what
I'll do inside of the loop is I'll
create a variable that will just
represent each building as they come
pouring through the loop so I'll just
call it B and that's gonna be equal to
the building's index in the loop and we
can just put I within the brackets so
the first time this loop runs this B is
going to represent the house then the
second time this loop runs this B is
going to represent the grocery store
then it will represent the post office
as each comes passing through the loop
so we go down one line we say CTX dot
fill style
is equal to B VG we access the BG
property here for each of those then we
say C T X dot fill rect open close
parenthesis semicolon and the fill rect
method gets X Y width and height
parameters now all we have to do is say
B dot X building dot y building dot
width and building dot height if we run
this in our favorite browser we see that
we get all of our elements placed on the
canvas that are in the building's array
so that's the basics of working with
JSON objects inside of an array and it's
very simple to access any index in this
buildings array to splice elements out
of it to remove them or push new items
into it during the runtime of your
applications and we'll be working with
JSON objects a little bit more in later
