line styles now in order to visualize
line styles we're going to have to have
some lines within our code so what we're
doing is using CTX dot begin path to
specify that we're beginning a new path
then we're using the move tool method to
begin the path points at 150 and 150
then we use the line to method to draw a
line from that point 150 150 to this
point 240 240 and these are x and
y-coordinates then we're using line two
again to just draw one more portion of
that line to these x and y-coordinates
and then we complete the stroke using
the stroke method and these are all
functions or methods that I'll be
explaining in later tutorials when we
get into building paths but for right
now we have to have a line to visually
inspect and that's the way we're going
to be drawing our line and if you look
at it right now in your favorite browser
it looks like a check mark I just made
it to look like a check mark so we use
the move to function to plot this point
here then we use line two to go here and
draw a line to that point then line two
to go here and draw a line to that point
and then we use the stroke method and we
if we were to pop it in the fill method
which is another path building method
you'll see that it gives you a fill
within those points to complete your
shape but we're just talking about line
styles in this tutorial so this is all
we need for now
the first property we're going to adjust
is line width property I'm going to make
that line a width of 20 so let's take a
look at it would you look at that just
look at it now the next property that
I'm going to adjust for that line is the
line cap and I'm going to make it round
and the three different options you have
there are but round and square so I make
mine round and I take a look at it again
and now I have rounded edges at the end
of the line
now the next property we're going to
take a look at or attribute is the line
join attribute and I'm using miter to
show you how to miter and that has three
settings as well
I'll bevel round or mitre I'm going to
set the miter limit to two to another
property that you can access for line
styles we'd have to lower that to see an
effect on the miter of that lines if I
was to move the angle of that check mark
for instance move its last point to
something like 250 let's see what
happens let's move it in even more let's
go to 180 we change that to 5 we see no
miter so if you want to get rid of that
pointy edge you just make sure you set
your miter limit to where when the line
has the proper angle the line will be
mitered the point on that line will be
cut or mitered so if we put this back on
3 we see the mitered effect now if we
change that to round the line join
method take a look at it now we get a
perfectly rounded little edge down there
and there's our check mark all nice and
rounded out now we're going to take a
look at setting line - so we can use the
set line - method and in between these
square brackets here is where we assign
the numbers that we need to create the
dashed effect that we want so let's just
start with a 20 if we take a look at it
ok so you can set more numbers separated
by commas in here so that the second
wave of dashes has a 10 pixel separation
so let's take a look at that actually
let me change this from round to but
change this to but now let's take a look
at it so you can see we have 20 pixels
and then a 10 pixel space then 20 pixels
10 pixels 20 pixels 10 pixels 20 pixels
10 so you see how that works now if I
would if I put a 30 in the next position
then we take a look at that and we have
20 pixels 10 pixels 30 pixels 20 pixels
10 pixels 30 pixels and it continues on
that way and you can put as many as you
want in there so if I put 40 for the
next one and then another 10 you can get
any kind of line
- staggered effect that you want in
there and if we change this back to
round we can round those edges again now
the next line style effect that we're
going to take a look at is the line -
offset so first let's see what it looks
like without that setting and now what
I'm going to do is put the offset in
place and then run that again but you're
not even really going to be able to see
it unless I put my hey let me do this
I'll put these side-by-side I'll just
change this line - offset to 30 and
refresh the page and you can see the
line
- offset moving let me change it back to
20 refresh you see it moving 30 refresh
and if you animate this property it'll
give you like marching ants effect on
your dashes that are around your objects
go to 50 refresh and they'll just march
along like that 60 you see so that's
what the line - offset property is used
for basically that's all there is to the
line styles
there's also one more property that you
can access CTX dot get line - and that
returns a copy of the line - pattern
I'll just leave that commented out I
just wanted to throw that in that way
I'm not leaving anything out okay that
completes the line styles methods and
properties in part 4 we're going to
explore drawing and building paths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
