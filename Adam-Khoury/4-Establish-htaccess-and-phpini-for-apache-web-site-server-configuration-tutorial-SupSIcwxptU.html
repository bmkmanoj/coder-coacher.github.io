access file which will help you make
your social network or any website that
you're building for that matter more
user-friendly and secure before watching
this video you'll want to check and see
if your public HTML directory online
already has an HD access file in it if
it does you can add things to it easily
enough by using your FTP software to
download the file and adjust it if you
have no HT Access file in your public
HTML directory yet you can follow along
with me now as I create my HT Access
file and FTP it to my web server online
before I discuss making the vial and
establishing server settings inside of
it I want to show you the default server
behavior that I wish to change default
server behavior that I just don't like
I'm on a Linux PHP Apache base server
which I think is the default for most
hosting accounts nowadays when they are
established if you're not on an Apache
server you must go a different route to
change these type of settings okay bad
server behavior default server behavior
issue number one for me is if I type in
images I can go and browse all of the
files within my images directory anybody
can and that's an issue that we have to
address and you guys have to keep in
mind that people will know my secret
folder names just because I'm exposing
my whole system in this lesson series so
don't name your folders the same thing
I'm going to name my folders and things
like that and you won't have an issue
with anybody knowing what your script
folders might be named and things like
that the only reason you guys know what
my all of my folders are is because my
entire directory is going to be open to
you guys throughout the lesson series
throughout the videos you're going to
see a lot of things that normally people
won't see about your server so I'm going
to have more security problems than you
would most definitely all you have to do
is name your things differently than I
have okay now issue number two which is
another pretty big issue that if any
pages ever get deleted or somebody just
say happens to navigate to poops not
that HTML on your website see you get
some generic 404 ever page that the
server automatically throws up but what
you can do is customize that and it
gives you a better user experience
especially if you were to throw your
search bar for your search mechanism for
your website right on the the custom 404
page that you create and I'll show you
how to make the settings to navigate to
a custom 404 page
when this occurs if somebody navigates
to a web address or directory that does
not exist on your server
now we'll be using Dreamweaver to create
our htaccess file but you can use
notepad it's pretty much the same
procedure so you go to file new and I'll
just quickly select HTML and then I'll
press ctrl s to save the file and down
here I want to go from all documents to
all files make sure it says all piles
and htaccess is a little bit weird in
which it has no name in front of it has
no file name in front of the dot you
just give it a dot and it's extension
which is HD access and that's the type
of file it is and save and so you want
to make sure it looks just like this and
if you're in Dreamweaver and have this
new V design mode don't put your code
there go to code view remove all this
deponent crap the Dreamweaver puts in
now let's knock out those two issues all
you have to do is set these two lines
really the lines with the pound signs in
front of them are just comments all you
need is these two lines one and two now
with this one does is establishes a
custom 404 file not found page so if
your user happens to go to a file that
has been deleted by your system or if
they type in some address that doesn't
exist on your website it'll
automatically go to file not found PHP
or you can name it whatever the hell you
want HTML or whatever I don't care and
on that page you can have a search bar
for your website your search mechanism
can be right there you put a nice
message like hey that file wasn't found
but would you like to search our website
and that can be on the page the file not
found that HTML or dot PHP that you want
to create
now the next directive is preventing
directory file listing in all of your
folders and you can just use index
ignore space asterisks and that will
work for hiding all files in all of your
child folders all right so now let's
press ctrl s and let's be sure to FTP
this file to our public HTML folder
online right now
now after you FTP that htaccess file to
your public HTML folder refresh your
website live online and then go to
forward slash hoops not dot HTML hit
enter and now you have your custom 404
error page C - custom says that page
does not exist on web intersect press
back in your browser software Adam curry
but if I want to I can have all kind of
extravagant things there and lovely
messages and search mechanisms for my
whole website now let's check out that
other issue and see if that's rectified
as well let's go to images folder
forward slash enter and now index of
images it shows nothing now another tip
for you guys
is that you can use a dot PHP file an
index dot PHP file inside of your images
folder or all the folders on your
website and what you can do is tick that
index out PHP file in there and have the
header function inside of it just one
line of PHP code inside of it that is
the header function and header them back
to the main home page of your website so
if anybody happens to go to images and
hit center like this they'll be
instantly navigated boom back to your
home page and they won't really know
what has happened but they'll know that
they didn't belong wherever they were
trying to go so that's an alternate
route that you can go if you don't want
to use this HT access to prevent
directory file listing in all of your
folders you can just stick an index a
PHP file in all of those folders that
will usher them back to the home page if
they happen to try and sneak a peek at
the directory listing now keep in mind
there are a whole lot of htaccess
directives that you can put inside of
your htaccess file and by the end of my
site actually when it goes to running
there's more directives that I'm going
to want to have in place inside of mine
and there's also something called a PHP
dot ini' file if any of you guys are
interested in researching how you can
fully configure the way PHP runs and
operates on your specific server so your
PHP dot ini' file also has a lot of
things settings inside of it
that can allow you to secure your
website a little bit more and make it
more user friendly so don't skip out on
researching your PHP dot ini' file
alright so that just gives you a little
extra blanket of protection and it
starts you on your way to understanding
all the directives that you can have in
place within your HD access file and if
you google things about htaccess you can
find thousands and thousands of pages of
information on all the different various
things that you can have within your HD
access file so have fun doing that bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
