here and in this webmaster video guide
we're going to be discussing site links
and what site links are all about why
you would want them and ways to attract
search engine algorithms to place site
links for your websites what site links
are let's see let's just go to the
search engine and here I have facebook
in type in my space myspace com when I
put that in you'll see there's
specialized links that come up here and
this doesn't happen for every website
it's only certain websites this happens
for and i'll be talking to you about
what kind of websites that happens for
in a second okay so now we've seen my
spaces a site links there and here is
i'm going to link to this blog which is
going to tell us it's going to tell you
i'm going to put the links in the video
description it'll tell you all about
what google says straight out of
google's mouth what site links are so
you can understand it and so I'll link
up that little article here about what
site links are developed PHP has
specialized site links and a couple of
these are dead and i want i went to my
webmaster tools and I block them so one
when they appear for your site you can
go into your webmaster tools and choose
to block certain ones so if you happen
to change directories or restructure
your site which I did last week I chose
to block two of the directories from
showing up in this listing which given
some time those two will go away then
new ones will appear and so what site
links are is it's kind of like the icing
on your search engine optimization cake
for your website it's the way to know
that your site is becoming optimized or
is optimized and Google sees it as
something that's worth indexing well at
this time it's all
automated according to google so it's
only given to certain websites that meet
certain criteria within the pages and
the directories and they appear under
the number one result so if you search
twitter or twitter com it's going to
come up the same there same with develop
PHP you just put develop PHP without com
still comes up and it's since its
automated you really can't request
Google to play certain ones there or to
place them for your website it's just if
your site happens to meet a certain
criteria then you'll get these
specialized site links and your site
doesn't have to have a whole lot of
pages and it doesn't have to be online
for years and years and it will still
occur you just like just has to be
optimized and it has to have a decent
amount of pages and some longevity but
it doesn't have to be online for years
and years just some longevity and a
decent amount of pages well organized
well optimized for search engine
optimization will usually get you there
you can change automatically these links
according to the algorithms of the
search engine box whatever they're
picking up from your site usually it's
the ones that have a high click-through
rate so my website flash and
actionscript 3 has a very high traffic
volume and click-through rate so that's
first of course and these used to but I
move the directories so now new ones
will appear in time and replace those
now all major search engines are running
the algorithms to set site links for all
sites Yahoo is doing it as well and all
the big ones out there and you also get
this nifty little link here that says
more results from develop PHP com
okay now let's talk about why you would
want site links here we can also see we
looked at twitter twitter has site links
all the big sites have site links web
intersect which isn't very big at all
which is just some site i use as a demo
site has site links so it's not that
hard to get and here are my webmaster
tools is where i was showing you where i
can block see these are the site links
that are showing up here right there and
it shows you where they lead to and you
can block them or leave them and once
you block them and take some time for
them to go away and then new ones will
probably come in and take their place
okay so why you would want site links
site links will help raise your traffic
by placing more blue things for people
to click on people love links so you
place more blue things for people to
click on there obviously you're going to
get more traffic if they search some
query and there's more blue things to
click on near the top it's a better
chance you're going to get more traffic
it also will help direct visitors to
certain areas of interest within your
website so they can bypass a lot of the
the crap that they don't want to see and
go straight to what they want and it
gives instant visual insight into what
is in your site as well so when they
look at these links when somebody
searches for developed PHP and they see
these links they're going to understand
exactly what the site is about what's
going on within these pages before even
clicking this and entering and further
than your description and your title
this gives just a little more insight
into what your site is about straight
through the organic results here you can
impress your other webmaster dorky
friends and make them jealous of you and
hate you more and if they don't happen
to have any site links you can rub it in
their face that's always fun
and another reason why you would want it
is just it's a testimonial to yourself
and others directly from Google that
their algorithms think your site is
top-notch when queried and it's worth
having site links for in their search
engine so it's it's like the icing on
the cake you know okay now I'll just
discuss a few tips that I think might be
handy for you I'm not really an
authority and all this so take it for
what it is okay so we talked about your
site having some longevity helps you
need moderate to high traffic low
traffic probably won't get you site
links you have to build up your traffic
a little bit a good navigation that the
search engine BOTS can crawl good link
structure good page structure good page
copy everything that falls under good
search engine optimization when
constructing a site those type of things
where the with a search engine BOTS can
crawl into your site real nice will help
your outbound and your internal links
will help so if you have internal links
such as just links to other pages from
your website just like in your and your
menus or whatever having those helps and
having inbound links coming from other
websites to your websites help and
outbound links when you set links to
other websites from your websites that
helps a little bit so all the link
structure and the page structure helps
right here on google you can go to the
webmaster guidelines right here and
follow these you follow the webmaster
guidelines you go through the webmaster
checklist and yours you can bet your
site's going to be pretty well optimized
for the web on all search engines that's
yahoo and everybody okay and the size of
your site doesn't really matter too much
i've seen 12 page websites make site
links and
a site with 10,000 pages also a settling
so the size and the amount of pages
really doesn't matter just the structure
okay so I hope you found this
information helpful and hope you get
some site links on your site see you
