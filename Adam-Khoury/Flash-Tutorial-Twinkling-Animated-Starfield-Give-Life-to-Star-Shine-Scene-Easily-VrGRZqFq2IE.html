we'll be showing you how to create a
lovely animated twinkling star field in
the simplest way possible that works for
flash cs3 cs4 cs5 any ActionScript
version you like you can download and
reference my files free by clicking the
link in this video's description area so
let's rock and roll now the first thing
we want to do is get our star field on
stage in flash and ready to go so here I
am in fireworks cs4 and you can use any
graphics program that you want to make
your star field image or you can get one
online from a stock image facility press
control-c now let's go into flash let's
create a new ActionScript 3 or
ActionScript 2 file it doesn't matter
because action scripts not going to be
involved so I'm just going to use
ActionScript 3 I'm going to make my
stage the same dimensions as my star
field so it's 400 by 400 happens to be
the size of my star field I'm going to
get the frame rate up to 30 now I'm just
going to press control V it's going to
bring it in as a movie clip and there it
is I'm just going to set it at x
coordinates 0 Y coordinates 0 to fit it
in the stage now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to rename this layer star
field I'm going to right click this
movie clip and convert to symbol I'm
going to call it whole star field inside
of my library that will be the name ok
now we do it this way in case you happen
to be working in a full flash website
where your stage is a lot bigger than
your star field then you can simply mask
the star field once you get done
creating it you can just mask that movie
clip so what I'm going to do is go and
double click inside layer 1 your name is
stars
I'm going to create a new layer above it
I'm going to call it twinkle twinkle
clip so I'm going to lay out a series of
oval primitives so you can click down on
the shapes tool and grab the oval
primitive out hold down shift and draw a
nice perfectly circular oval primitive
to the stage and if yours just happens
to be an edge and not a fill all you
have to do is manipulate grab those
little circles in there and you can
manipulate the fill in it
for instance yours might look like this
so where you can't put a fill in it or
it seems like you can't put a fill in it
all you have to do is grab it
move that circle to the middle and it
will fill it for you ok so we don't need
an edge so let's get rid of that edge
and let's make this I don't know maybe
three pixels by three pixels you could
really make it any size you want so what
I'm going to do is make a series of
these I'm just going to press control C
control shift V I'm going to move them
around put them in two random spots then
I'm going to grab both of those together
control C control shift V move it over a
bit move it down a bit
then let's grab all of these ctrl c ctrl
shift V and I'm going to continue this
process will see ctrl shift V until I
get a nice area filled with all these
little dots okay so after getting all of
my little dots in place I'm going to go
ahead and lock the Stars layer and on
stage I'm going to press ctrl a and see
how why this is so it came out to be 481
wide and my star field is 400 wide so
that's just about right it's a little
bit wider than my star field and that's
what I wanted with everything
highlighted on this layer you can just
press ctrl-a right-click any one of
those convert to symbol and call it
twinkle clip okay so this is a movie
clip that we named twinkle clip in the
library now what I'm going to do is grab
it and put it on top of my star field
right about there now to get the whole
thing animated all I have to do is bring
the frames out to maybe 100 so I'm going
to go out to frame 100 and press f6 to
make a new keyframe on the twinkle clip
layer and on the Stars layer I'm going
to press f5 just to extend out that
image now I'm going to right click right
here and create motion tween now with
the motion tween set in place all I have
to do is move from the starting position
of that clip to the ending position on
frame 100 just move it over a little bit
so let's highlight it and take your
arrow keys and move it over just a
little bit you can see how it starts to
twinkle everything it doesn't even have
to be moved over much at all now let's
press control enter you see there it
makes a nice twinkling effect and people
really can't see what's going on and how
you have that those black dots animated
over it
since everything is so finely since
everything is so small and fine
but it gives it a nice twinkling effect
and if it's moving too fast for you you
can just move this to where it's not
moving so much put it right about there
and it'll slow everything down or you
can just bring this out to extend more
frames so the animation moves slower see
so now it's got a nice slow twinkling
effect so it looks like it's more
randomized and the same stars aren't
always twinkling but it makes your star
field come to life so that's how it's
done
and this Fla file all the source and
everything will be available free for
download from develop PHP calm in the
flash video tutorial section where all
the other free epilate files are we'll
see you in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
