geared for cs3 and cs4 we're teaching
you how to create cool custom animated
Mouse cursors those are custom cursors
that you can have in your flash
applications when the mouse user is over
it and when it leaves they get their
normal cursor back when it comes back
there's your custom cursor and I'll show
you how to put cool animated effects on
it that pulsating effect there ok here
we are the develop PHP forums in the
flash cs3 and ActionScript 3 section and
we have a member who writes I'm creating
a website and what I want to do is when
someone visits the website I want their
cursor to change into my custom design
cursor all works fine until I've moved
the cursor off the website
ie on to Firefox toolbar my custom
cursor stays on the stage and does not
vanish so then he supplied his script
and what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to show you a little tiny script
that'll help you get the cursor to
vanish once it leaves the flash stage ok
so first thing is we'll go into flash
I'm in cs3 you can be working in cs4 and
this ActionScript 3 that I'm gonna write
will work all the same for you so what
we'll do is let's make this a little
smaller and you can have your stage size
set any size you need it I'm just gonna
make mine a little less high maybe 320
okie dokie now let's make that
background black just for my preferences
and now let's go into fireworks and grab
my custom pointer now you can design
your custom pointer in any Adobe
software that's made for graphics you
can even do it in flash but I just
wanted to make my own fireworks because
I like the way fireworks graphics come
out so I'm going to press C ctrl C
and by the way this is a bitmap it's
flattened press control-c and go into
flash press ctrl-v so what we'll do is
import it directly onto stage copy and
paste style as movie click ok and now
we'll give that movie clip an instance
name of my cursor cursor or underscore
MC my cursor underscore MC and now let's
create a new layer above that layer 1
let's call this new layer a s3 for
ActionScript 3 let's call this cursor ok
now we have an instance name on our
little movie clip cursor there and let's
open the actions panel by pressing f9
that way we can type in some code that
will affect this movie clip ok here we
are in our actions panel and the first
thing we want to do is add to event
listeners to the stage we're going to be
listening for mouse move and mouse leave
so we'll say stage add event listener
this is person one in this mouse event
that Mouse mold so anytime the mouse
moves this is what this event listener
is listening for and it's going to react
by firing off this function called the
redraw cursor Thank You speller right
redraw cursor so anytime the mouse moves
it's going to fire off the function
called redraw cursor now let's just grab
that whole line for a second event
listener and that's going to be
targeting the stage as well event
listener for the event of and it's not a
mouse event it's going to be a staged
event really and then it's going to be
mouse leave so anytime the mouse leaves
the stage this function is going to fire
up and I'm going to name it hide cursor
now the next line down we're going to
hide their default white mouse pointer
by doing that and now let's write the
function in the first one redraw cursor
function redraw cursor Lloyd open curly
brace close curly brace and there's our
function nest and inside this is a mouse
event so type in event colon Mouse event
there we go and the next function nest
let's just go ahead and set that up
is going to be event colon event hide
cursor so there we go now we have our
two functions set up and ready to go to
fire up anytime the mouse moves on stage
or any time the mouse leaves the flash
stage so you put your code that you want
to have that whatever you want to happen
on those events and put your code right
here and we'll do that now okay so the
first thing that we want to happen is on
the hide cursor we want to say my cursor
underscore MC which is the instance name
we gave the cursor dot visible equals
false and that will effectively hide it
when it leaves the stage which addresses
the bottom question that our member
asked and here in the redraw cursor we
want to make sure it's always true
always visible so in this function mouse
move it's always visible in this
function Mouse leave it's always going
to disappear now in the mouse move in
the redraw cursor function we have to
make sure that the little movie clip on
stage here is always going to be where
the mouse pointer should be and that's
very easy to do with two lines of code
let's take this instance name my cursor
dot X position
this is its x position on stage is going
to be equal to the event dot stage X
that's it now
the next line is very similar this is
going to be staged why that way it just
follows where their mouse is going like
it should and I think if we test at this
point we should have a working
application so let's press ctrl enter
and there we have it you see when my
mouse leaves the stage the mouse cursor
the custom cursor disappears like it
should and my little black pointer comes
back for use in my other applications
okay so let's see you see how it's kind
of jagged you want to raise your
framerate make sure your brain rates not
so lower everything will be jagged all
of your animations will be a seam will
seem chopping so now you can see how
it's much smoother now with a higher
framerate and you can also do other cool
things like make it have a pulsating
glow or something like that easily and
you can have this anywhere onstage and
offstage you can set it off stage if you
want and it will still work the same you
see it just follows the mouse the
pointer so if you double click inside of
this you convert this to a movie clip
let's call it inner cursor clip
okay
now that this is a movie clip we can in
this timeline we can give it a little
pulsating glow let's go ten frames not
even maybe a trains and then two sixteen
hit f6 again so I hit f6 twice there to
make new keyframes and it looks like
this needs to come back one there we go
now in between here we're going to
create motion tween create motion tween
in the center let's click this highlight
that keyframe click the object and go to
filters add a filter of glow let's make
a glow white nice and strong
blur it out to about 13 minutes bring it
over here so we can see it better that's
too much too strong
there we go all right about there now
you can see that oh I didn't want to
make that moment what position is that
that is zero let's put this back to zero
there we go there's all kind of
animations you can set inside of this so
now let's press control enter and now
you'll see it has a pulsating back now
the mouse and it moves anywhere you go
on stage and when you leave stage it it
disappears when you come back it
reappears follows the mouse it's exactly
what you want okay we hope you enjoy
this one and we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
