how simple it is for you as a website
developer to offer your visitors the
option of changing your web pages to
their preferred language you're not
limited to just a few popular languages
you can have all languages the Google
Chrome browser offers this to its users
by default if the user hits a foreign
language web page but Firefox and
Internet Explorer do not yet perform
this action by default for their users
many people using Firefox and Internet
Explorer are not presented with any
options of changing your web page to
their preferred language you might want
to make sure that that option is
available to everyone no matter what
browser they use before we get into the
lesson let's show you a finished product
of what you'll get after the lesson so
here I am in my Adam Cory comm website
and I'll go to select language and I can
change it to Spanish you can change to
any language you want and it's just a
couple of lines of code and it only take
you a few minutes the first step is to
sign into your Google account if you're
not already signed into Google the next
step is to type Google Translate into
the Google search bar now click the
Google Translate link and in the middle
of the page you see down here it says
Google Translate for business just hit
website translator and that's how you
can get access to the plug-in I've
already established one for develop PHP
comm but what you want to do here if you
don't have any sites established here is
hit add new website and then Google says
well played let's do this that what is
the URL of your website my website which
is Adam Cory comm and then the next
question is what is the original
language of your website mine is English
so I'll press next now here is where we
can adjust the plug-in settings it says
set the options you want for translating
your website you can change these
options later - so translate languages
also I'll just leave it as all languages
but you can set specific languages if
you only want for instance French
Spanish Italian popular European
languages or you can set whatever you
want I'll just leave it on all languages
and then display mode you can set as
vertical and then it has little powered
by Google Translate
words underneath the drop-down
horizontal where the words are on the
side or drop-down only where it's only
the drop-down and I'm going to show you
guys how you can style this drop down
this element now I'll leave this checked
here where it's automatically displayed
translation banner dirty user speaking
languages other than the language of
your page so a little banner will come
up at the very top of the browser
communicating to just those people and
you can also click here to add your
analytics link up if you want to link up
to your analytics for that site and then
once I have all the plug-in settings I
want I just get code it says ready to
roll now let's talk code paste this code
into your website okay here I am in the
index.html page from my website and I'll
go to view the code so it says place
this meta tag before the closing head
tag so I'll grab this meta tag right
here and I'll put it into place and
actually I notice that it works see
here's my closing head tag I'll put that
meta tag they suggested right there and
I noticed that this works the plug-in
will still work if you don't put this
meta tag into place but this meta tag is
for relating unique content ID to google
translate for you but like I said I
noticed that the plug-in works without
adding this meta tag at its basic level
for translating a web page so now we
grab the code that says place this
snippet where you'd like to display the
website translator plug-in on your web
page so I'll grab that snippet of code
press ctrl C to copy it and I'll go
right under my div top here so let me
collapse that div top so it doesn't get
in our way and I'm going to put a new
div into place here put the closing div
tag then go down a couple of lines and
inside of that div container I'm going
to add the code that Google offered me
in the translator plug-in now since I
have the meta tag in place now and the
code that they suggested let me press
ctrl s and I'll FTP this file on to my
server and run it live in a browser okay
here I am on my web page and you can see
that the plug-in is sitting right here
first of all I don't want it all the way
on the edge of my page I want it tucked
in maybe a
this area somewhere right there so let's
go back into the code and here's the div
that contains all the code that Google
gave me so I'll give this div some style
I'll make its width
maybe 850 pixels and I'll give it a
margin of zero pixels and auto so it'll
have a zero pixels for the top and
bottom margins and auto for the left and
right margins that way the 850 wide
container will be centered directly in
the page and if we go back into our
browser and we refresh we'll see that
it's sitting where I wanted it to sit
now because it's contained in an 850
wide div right here there's an 850 wide
div that is set to center in the page so
the plug-in is just sitting on the left
side of that 850 Y div now for really
understanding how to style this thing up
I need you guys to go into Google Chrome
or any browser that lets you inspect an
element that your mouse is old I put my
mouse over the element right click
inspect element and then a window is
going to pop up so a window popped up
and what it shows me is all of the
element names so you can see that I have
my Google Translate element div here and
then inside of it there's all kind of
other classes and ID's that I can target
for instance if I wanted to change the
color of the text that says select
language in between that span element I
would just target this a class of Google
te menu value and target its child span
element so let me show you what I mean
I'll target the Google TE menu value
class so in my web page code I can just
go into my style my CSS for the web page
and target the a element with a class of
goob te menu value goog te menu value
open close curly braces and we wanted to
target the span element inside of that
because that's where those letters
reside so I'm going to target the span
element inside of that
they have and I'll change its color to
anything that I want let's make it a
crazy color so you can really see the
difference press ctrl s and then FTP
your file and then refresh your webpage
so you can see now I have like a hot
pink or magenta color as the Select
language text so basically what I did
was I went into the code I used Google
Chrome to inspect element and what that
did is it shows me all of the things
that were rendered dynamically into that
element by Google basically it shows you
all the code that Google places into
that div dynamically and you can go
through and target all of these things
that you want now I'm going to target
this class of Google Gadget simple and
that's also a div that's dynamically
rendered at runtime that you really
can't see unless you inspect the element
so that's good teehee gadgets simple
press control s and FTP this up to the
web now let's give this a refresh you
can see we have nice rounded edges on
that element now and that div is what we
target for all that you can also give
that a background if you want that to be
a black background with the pink text on
it and you might not even want that
underline you see how the ugly black
underline comes into play when I put my
mouse over it I think we can get rid of
that so I'll try and get rid of that and
make the background for the whole
element black and see what happens so
what I'll do is I'll target the a
element again make another rule right
above it but don't target its child span
this one's going to target the a
directly I'm going to make
text-decoration:none that way it doesn't
have any underline effect when the mouse
goes over it and let's also give this
like we said a background color of black
and we can change the text color to a
nice light blue or something like that
maybe right there press ctrl s and FTP
this up to the web so you see there and
you can also target the borders of that
element maybe you want to give it a
little bit of padding so let's go here
and say
adding maybe seven pixels and I can also
change the border styles if I want so if
i refresh the page now we'll see a
little bit more padding around
everything which makes it all look a
little more cushioned and comfortable
and I think we got rid of the underlying
effect on the text and the arrow so now
I'll just leave it up to you guys to
find the ways to style this iframe
element that pops up because you can go
into the code and see everything you can
see right here the iframe right there
class of google te menu iframe and
there's other elements you can play with
styling all about the Google Translate
website plug-in so now let's use it
again and let's change this to Arabic
now it's very important for you to keep
in mind that you can also put this code
into your PHP include files that way you
just have to add it once and it will
appear on thousands of dynamic pages
okay so I hope you found this tutorial
helpful and I'm not going to be offering
any source code you guys can just watch
the video and get your code from Google
like I did and I showed exactly
everything I did in the code you can
just copy it straight from the video if
you want to use the CSS that I applied
and things like that
but everything I grabbed was pretty much
what Google offered me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
