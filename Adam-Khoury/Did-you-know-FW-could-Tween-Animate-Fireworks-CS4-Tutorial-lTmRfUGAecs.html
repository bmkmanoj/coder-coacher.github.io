to create in this fireworks cs4 tutorial
let's press play in the little animation
I'm showing you how to create tween the
animations sort of like you wouldn't
flash not many people realize that
fireworks is capable of tweening ok
let's go to create new fireworks
document I'm just going to make mine 500
x 500 for this example and I'm going to
change my canvas color to black I'm just
going to use the pen tool make a little
custom shape
grab the sub selection tool modify that
point make it to where it's nice and
straight ctrl-c ctrl-v flip it match it
up go to modify with them both selected
combine paths Union and then I have a
little custom heart now but that the
center i'm going to go to convert to
symbol change that hard to assemble
let's just name it heart graphic symbol
ok now let's go to filters hue and
saturation so we go to adjust color and
hue and saturation in that list I'm
going to leave mine first instance of
the heart nice and red like that now i'm
going to press ctrl-c ctrl-v i have to
now now i'm going to press ctrl-c ctrl-v
again now i have three the one in the
center let's grab that one and change
the hue and saturation on it adjust the
color now let's press ok i'm also going
to resize it
there we go put a dead center again put
the red the third instance right back on
top so you can see basically we have a
sandwich a heart sandwich with the
filler or the meat being the little blue
heart and the bread being the two red
hearts let's highlight or drag over all
three highlight all three of them go to
modify and symbol between instances now
you can place how many steps you want it
to have or how many key frames that the
animation should have in this box and
then you make sure this is selected
distribute to states that way you can
have an animation that runs and it will
save as an animated gif you put it on a
web page you know press ok and here in
few check-ins states in the state's tab
you'll see all of the states that make
up the animation there now you press
play then you have a nice tweening heart
that tweens color and size now that's
going really slow you can change the
state's speed the animation speed just
by clicking the first one the first
state and hold shift on your keyboard
click the last one now double-click
anywhere where it in this number section
for the state speed now to change that
to a 1 and the animation press ENTER and
the animation will run much faster now
I'll press play there you have it
if you wanted to go a lot faster than
that you would just make a lot less than
21 states maybe I don't know 18 maybe 15
maybe 12 this heart would beat a lot
faster and the colors would change a lot
faster and if you didn't want the colors
to change just wouldn't make the one in
the center blue just leave them all
three red and you wouldn't have to
adjust the hue and saturation that's how
you can achieve nice twinned animations
without making every key every frame by
frame without making a frame by frame
animation and fireworks you can't win
also not many people realize you can
tween and fireworks and render out
animated gifts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
