how to embed cool or custom fonts into
your web design project we're going to
take care to make sure it works in all
modern browsers including Internet
Explorer first let's take a look at the
finished product let's look at Internet
Explorer first and there it is an
Internet Explorer now let's look in
Firefox and there she is in Firefox now
let's look in Google Chrome
there it is in Google Chrome and now
let's take a look at Safari
there it is in Safari there's other
browsers you can test it out with but
I'm pretty sure it works on all of them
so you can take a good look at that and
you can see that my first paragraph has
a cool custom font applied to it and
like usual I will place the code with
the video on the same page of my site
and I'll link it up for you guys just in
case you want to grab the code real
quick and experiment with it you can see
I have the very simple beginnings of a
web document here it's an HTML file and
I named it index.html like it's the home
page of my website you can see the only
two tags or elements that I have it play
inside of the body tag there are two
paragraph tags the first paragraph we
assign a class attribute and we give it
a name of my font class and this is the
content that we wish to apply a custom
font to you can see this other paragraph
tag has no class attribute so this one
will not get our custom cool font
applied to it and that's all we have to
consider about the HTML for this simple
example any Content that you have inside
of an element with the class setup for
my font class will have the custom font
applied to it even if it's a div or
whatever kind of tag now let's quickly
expand the CSS we'll discuss it talk
about some considerations and then we'll
have the code available for you guys now
the font face syntax that you see here
is a part of CSS that allows you to
embed custom fonts really elegant fonts
or creative fonts that would normally be
installed on a user or all your visitors
computer so they won't see it so this
syntax gives you a way to embed the
custom font
this was introduced in CSS version 2 and
then it was taken out I believe in CSS
version 2.1 and now in css3 I think
they're making it a standard once again
now where you see it in place here the
first time is for Internet Explorer so
let's make ourselves a note so this one
says for IE browsers and this one is in
place for all other browsers so let's
put a note there too okay so this one is
for IE browsers and this one is for most
other browsers now you'll notice that
the first thing we're doing is setting
the font family and you can name that
pretty much anything you want that's all
I did is I rename my font files to any
custom name that I wanted to put on them
and then we use the source to specify
the URL to the actual font file and it's
very important that you have these font
files on your web server online you have
to FTP these two font files the EOT and
the t TF version both to your web server
put them in your CSS folder but you have
to make sure that you FTP the font files
themselves to your web server for those
people that don't have these files
installed on their machine they're not
going to see your cool custom font and
actually down here in this font class
let's go ahead and put a comma and then
we'll put Arial and let's put all of
these and those will be the ones that
will show up just in case the a font
doesn't work okay so now you understand
that for internet explorer you have to
have a dot e OT type font file and for
others you have to have a dot TTFN the
TrueType font so this is caught by
internet explorer and this is caught by
all other browsers and you don't have to
put in a special catch or condition you
can just list them both just like that
and it will work in all the modern
browsers now the last little bit of CSS
are the style properties that we're
assigning for the my font class for this
we just want to affect the one paragraph
or maybe you want to affect a certain
div on the page now I had it set like
this before and that'll work just fine
but if that font doesn't happen to
process or get picked up
then a default maybe times roman font
will be used by the browser you don't
want that so you want to add some
backups and I'll just add the Arial and
these are just like fallback fonts so if
a font isn't available
it's the browser is going to fall back
to Arial
if Arial is not available the browser
software will fall back to Helvetica and
so on and so forth however many commas
in fonts that you want to put in place
there but you won't need to put too many
because most people have arial 'arial
will probably get picked up first now we
can also take this and add all kinds of
things to it like letter spacing if your
font happens to be really jumbled close
up letters you can put this to two
pixels and see what that does you can
see if a much more dramatic difference
if I put that on five or so you see so
you have letter spacing and we also have
word spacing and you can set that to
whatever you want
let's see 50 pixels and you'll see a big
difference in the spacing between my
words you see let's just make that 12
see what that looks like oh that's way
too much it's fine the default so I'll
leave that in place just so you guys can
reference it and then we also have color
so you can set your color to whatever
you want I'll make mine a nice green or
something something like that okay
preview it just looking very nice now
let's up the size on it
font size let's make it 18 preview that
alrighty
you can also make this P and H whatever
you want so you can remove the font size
if you wanted to have this P tag B
instead in h2 you just turn those two h2
and then preview it be nice and big now
let's add a shadow text shadow you'll
have some problems with text shadow and
Internet Explorer and I'm not going into
that in this video so vertex shadow you
can just set something like let's say 2
pixels 1 pixel
2 pixels and then the color that you
want for the shadow
I'll make mine black we'll see what that
looks like you see so you can drop a
shadow on it actually look a little
better if I had this all it may be one
pixel and this color a little bit
lighter like a light gray or something
and see what that looks like see it's
very pretty and you can get creative as
you want let's take that out okay that's
pretty much all there is to it I'll
leave it just like that this is the code
that I'll have for you guys to grab you
want it and that is that and I'll see
you guys in the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
