how to create a website the right way
for beginners when we last left off we
created our main that CSS stylesheet our
index file is reading all of those style
definitions to bring into the file now
we're going to demonstrate the
usefulness of it see this index file
let's go to file save as let's say about
this will be our about Us page or what
we do type thing it'll be HTML file save
the right there next to the index file
and you see it has all the same styling
and everything you can go to that body
section and do whatever you need change
how many columns it has maybe you only
want a two column design here it's that
simple so now i have a two column design
on my contact page it can be right dead
center right there and now let's go into
the main that CSS file watch this if i
remove this background image press ctrl
save or ctrl s to save the file and each
file here you'll see the background
image is gone on the about page and on
the index page if you had 50 50 pages on
your site and you weren't using an
external style sheet good luck to you
buddy because you would have had to just
go into 50 pages and change that that is
why we made an external style sheet and
took the time to show you how to do that
because it's going to save you a lot of
time in production down the road and
management of your site when you want to
change it especially if you want to
change the design you have 50 pages good
luck buddy you should have used the main
that CSS stylesheet
okay so that proves why having a style
sheet and setting setting it all up the
way we did taking the time initially to
do that will be handy way down the road
now I told you I was going to show you
how to get some content in here so what
we're going to do is write down here by
the footer we can go down to that last
table here in the code and add a div tag
so let's type in div align center and
inside we're going to put and copy
that's the copyright symbol 2010 web
intersect calm and under that i'm going
to put another div tag and this is where
we're going to put our validation HTML
and CSS validation icon links as we're
producing the site then we're going to
take the footer the whole footer of the
site and put it into an include file so
let's just type in right here validation
service links to show everybody that
we've taken the time to create an
interoperable website all right so we
can go ahead and put these files online
now let's ftp them to the web where
they're going to live at web intersect
com okay I enjoy using FileZilla to ftp
my files to my actual live web site a
lot of people prefer to use Dreamweavers
ftp management system but i have
multiple multiple sites so I like to use
filezilla so I can connect to all my
sites and my client sites very easily
now I'm going to go to the root
directory here where I'm working in and
I'm going to have the fav icon needs to
go up and this is the root directory on
the live site this is the root directory
on my local machine let's put that index
the about page
the whole style folder drag that whole
thing in or you can create a new folder
called style and drag it and put the
files in independently in filezilla you
can easily create directories by just
right clicking create directory and that
will make a new folder on the live site
or you can just drag the whole folder
like I did see style fold is all there
ready to go and we got our fav icon
that's everything we need I'm going to
go and create an index or images folder
now on the live site so i'll have my
images folder ready to go here when i go
ahead and put images on the page or
whatever but everything that is a style
component of the site is going to be in
the style folder images like any
pictures that will be on the pages or
whatever regular type pictures will be
in the images folder now we can go to
web intersect online and see what we
have you go to your site hit enter
there it is okay now before we do
anything else this index HTML page is
getting turned into a dot PHP page index
dot PHP so let's save as index PHP save
now we're going to put that to the
server index dot PHP we're going to
remove index.html I had to index HTM
there too I'm going to remove index HTML
let's delete that so now we're running
the site off an index dot PHP vile let's
go to site and see if it works yeah same
thing so now you understand that you can
have any of your HTML pages rename dot
PHP now what this does is gives you the
power let's just close that index page
we're not going to use it anymore this
new index that PHP page is what we're
going to focus on and this is going to
have our home page content on it you can
see it's still the same exact content in
the page to all HTML in there but it
just simply has a dot PHP extension now
so i can add PHP to it now watch this
PHP include let's call it
maybe my footer well let's call it
include underscore footer any include
files that we're going to have in here
let's make this one a PHP to it could be
an HTML page that it includes but I'm
just going to make my foot in PHP page
so see this div that holds the copyright
and the validation service links watch
this I can take the soul out control x
see that include footer there and we're
going to make a new page called include
footer.php so new PHP get rid of all
this crap put in what you have in your
clipboard those two divs from the footer
file save this page as include
underscore border make sure it's PHP
extension save so now you have an
include footer the PHP file is calling
that include photo you see let's go to
the design view look at that you're
probably saying how the hell is that
showing up see it says server side
include include photo PHP and this is
the content that's in it so if we go let
me show you the usefulness of this now
and this is similar to using this main
that CSS file to bring in all the
styling this is going to bring in all
the footer information it's almost like
just bringing a whole nother set of data
into the page let me show you the
usefulness of it control C I'm going to
copy that I'm going to go to file well
let's just take the index page file save
as about
bout that PHP so now our about page is
PHP as well we don't need the about HTML
anymore and this one has the include in
it as well you see that div those divs
are not in these pages anymore but now
when we put this online index dot PHP
include footer.php and about that PHP
let's get rid of about HTML and it's
really handy to turn these into PHP
files because you got a lot more power
to the site you can add all kind of
applications to your website forms user
interactivity all kind of really smart
dynamic stuff using PHP so it's good to
just set it up as PHP from the beginning
in case you want to go that route later
on now let's look at the site and you
can see it's successfully bringing in
our include file let's go to about dot
PHP on the server live and you can see
that one also brings in the links so
both of the files are holding the same
exact content even though that content
isn't on either one of those pages index
or about it's in the include footer so
if i want to make include footer remove
that big giant V at the front put that
back on server go to the website live
refresh it the V is gone on the about
page let's go back to the index page and
the V should be gone here too when we
refresh you see on the index page and
the about page it's gone so that's the
usefulness of setting up include files
through PHP and what's handy is if you
work in a dreamweaver you can actually
see all the content on the page in
design view now let's see if this bad
boy validates and looks the same in all
browsers all the four major browsers
firefox dream with firefox safari chrome
and internet explorer and we're going to
check make sure of validates at w3c</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
