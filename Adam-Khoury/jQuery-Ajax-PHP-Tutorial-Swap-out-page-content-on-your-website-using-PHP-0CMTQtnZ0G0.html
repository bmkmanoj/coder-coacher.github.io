lately how to use jquery's Ajax
mechanisms to communicate with PHP to
swap out data on a page dynamically so
that's what we're going to be showing
you how to do in this lesson we're going
to use jquery's Ajax mechanisms to post
a variable to a PHP script and get
content back according to what that
variable is that way we can set up links
like this on a page where the page
doesn't refresh or reload but it
communicates to PHP each time a link is
clicked to bring new data into this page
area and I even show how to make that
little loader gift that loader animation
that you see there that's popping up
I'll show how to make that in fireworks
during this lesson as well towards the
end okay we're going to show you how to
build this application from the ground
up and you'll see I have index.html open
which is the home page of my website it
could be any page of my website and
within that folder
which is my website I have my index page
here and jQuery one point five point one
if you just google jQuery
you'll go to the jQuery site and you can
download the files easily download for
it's right there on the home page and
you can save it as a javascript file
name it whatever you want
put it on your server so back in our
index page the first thing we're going
to do is go into the head tag and we're
going to include that javascript file
jQuery one point five point one is that
way anything I do within this index.html
page I can apply jQuery to it now the
next thing I want to do is go into the
body tag for the page and I'm going to
put in a div then I'm going to close the
div tag within it I'm just going to type
in my default content just for now I can
change that up I'm going to put three
links right above that div now we're
going to leave that pound sign in the
href I'm going to put a space here and
I'm going to put in the on click event
and the value for the on click event is
going to be return false so that means
nothing will happen when they click this
link if you leave it just like this
nothing would happen when they click
this link I'm going to use the on my
down event to communicate with
JavaScript so I'm going to put another
space here and for that link we have an
on Mouse down event now so on Mouse down
of this link when somebody clicks down
on it
javascript is going to fire off a
function called swap content and the
value that we're sending to that
function is con 1 and here you just put
whatever you want your link to say so
I'm going to put content 1 so that's
what the link will display as to the
user little blue link on the page so
since this link is now set up to run a
JavaScript function called swap content
that means on this page up here we have
to put that javascript function in and
we have to make sure it's ready to
accept 1 parameter because we're sending
one parameter to it one variable
now let's duplicate that twice just so
we have three to show you guys a good
example this one is going to be content
to this 1 3 here we're going to place
con to con 3 okay so now we're going to
go up into the head tag right underneath
where we applied the include for the
jQuery file we're going to apply a
JavaScript function that's sitting right
here on the page now I'm going to
explain this function to you real
in-depth and you can see swap content is
the function that we assigned to fire
off when any of these links are clicked
down and we're sending variables that we
designate to that function all right so
here we have function swap content and
it lies dormant just sitting here on the
page waiting until somebody clicks down
on one of those links and when they do
click down they send that variable for
whichever link they're clicking to that
function and you pick it up right here
here is where you scoop that variable up
see this little variable called CV that
takes on the value of whatever you send
so if I put the word poopoo right here
and I click this link it's going to fire
off the function swap content and the
value of poopoo the word poopoo will be
fed to this function and it will be
housed within this variable called CV so
see
would be equal to poopoo but if I click
this link CV is equal to con 1 this link
CV is equal to con 2 if I click this
link CV is going to be equal to con 3
that's how it works now the first thing
we do when that function is executed
when it's sold to run is we want to show
like a little animated gif maybe a
little fan loader that's animated or a
little loader bar I'll show you how you
can get some dot gif animations made
real quick and easy so you use jQuery
selector here to target that div called
my div which is sitting right here in
the page let me say dot HTML open
parenthesis and then close parenthesis
here and then in between double quotes
you can put any type of HTML data you
wish there so what we're going to do is
put a dot gif animated image tag there
so we'll have an image tag with an
animated gif in it that way we show a
cool animation while things are loading
so people know that something's loading
on the page and they won't have any
question about what's going on and then
you just say show and this is all jQuery
functionality so you're using jQuery to
target that div and put some HTML in it
it's that simple
next line is we create a variable called
URL and that's going to be equal to
whatever PHP script you want to use for
this little application and we're going
to custom code that in just a second
mine is going to be called my PHP script
PHP is going to be living in the same
folder as my index file here do you want
yours in a different folder you just put
in my folder forward slash and it'll
pick up that PHP file and in folder now
the next line is jquery's post mechanism
which uses Ajax and they've made the
post mechanism also easy in jQuery okay
so the post mechanism or the post
function can take three parameters the
first parameter being the URL which I
just told you what my URL is going to be
and that you place right here as the
first parameter the second parameter is
any string of variables that you want to
put in there if you want to put multiple
variables in there you just do the same
thing I did to send this variable but
you separate by commas and you can add
more right there as many as you want
just separate each one by
and don't have a comma on the last one
it's very simple so it's key value pairs
so the key is content bar and the value
is CV which that will be dynamically
changing according to what people are
pressing that could be either equal to
con 1 con 2 or con 3 in our case here
but the PHP script is going to be
looking for a variable named content bar
and we're going to scoop that up in the
PHP file and the third parameter is the
return data function which enables us to
get data back from whichever script that
the post mechanism is communicating to
so post occurs the script is
communicated with and while it's
communicated with it might take a second
or two for things that occur in some
cases so that's why we show the animated
gif and then right when the PHP file is
echoing data back to this post mechanism
that's when it displays within my div
whichever data we're calling to display
and that will be dependent upon con 1
con 2 and con 3 the PHP file is going to
be able to distinguish between those
three variables and give different
content depending on which one it is so
basically you're sending a posted
variable to the PHP file using jQuery
AJAX mechanism PHP file is going to say
oh I see which variable you're sending
to me and I'm going to give you this
specific content because you sent that
specific variable so when the post
mechanism is finished it puts the HTML
data that's coming back from the PHP
file into your div and then that
replaces the animated gif that you have
there so that won't be showing anymore
it's very simple now all we need is a
PHP file let's go to file new PHP so if
you're a notepad plus plus you just
create a new PHP file in that or if
you're in Dreamweaver you could just do
like I did and I'm going to remove all
of that data because this is going to be
a PHP file with just PHP scripting in it
so let's save this into the same folder
where we have our jQuery and our index
file I'm going to name it my PHP script
and it'll have a dot P
HP Extension the first thing I'll do is
put in a PHP block or PHP tags opening
closing tags on line two there we're
going to scoop up the content bar
variable coming from index.html when
this swap content function runs right
here in the post mechanism you have a
variable called content bars can be sent
to PHP with the value of cv whatever cv
represents in our case it's either con 1
con 2 or con 3 so we're going to pick up
the posted variable of content bar then
we're going to have simple else
condition statements so let's say if the
content bar is equal to a value of con 1
close parenthesis open a curly brace and
close curly brace couple of lines down
you just want to echo out here whatever
your default content is so let's check
on our index page we had a default
content of this so let's copy that put
it right there
very simple else if actually you can
just copy this if condition all the way
down to the closing bracket for it and
replace this if here or basically just
put else space paste then do it one more
time else space paste in the second if
conditions you want to type in con two
here and con three here and then change
the content for those so now I have
different data when I echo for con 2 con
3 and con 1 hey let's change this one to
this way it makes more sense and so back
in the index page we have to have our
page initially loading with that same
exact content all right that's it that's
the basics of it you can use most any
jQuery version for this as long as it's
relatively up-to-date
just make sure you have your jQuery file
this javascript function and then inside
of your links or buttons this can also
be placed on buttons the
one mouse down just make sure you call
that javascript function called swap
content and feed it whatever is variable
that you need for that link all right
now down here between each one of my
links I'm going to put a couple of
spaces and a bullet so I'll have a
bullet point a couple of spaces between
each link that way they're not all
crowded on each other when we go to test
it out so I'm going to load this up to
my PHP enabled server to test things out
because if you're not on a PHP enabled
server you won't see any results that
you want to see okay so this is what I
have so far I have three links on top
separated by bullet points and then a
div that holds my information so let's
click content two and you see put a
split second and said put animated gif
here that that's where we're going to
put an animated loader now let's click
content three content for the third
click is now loaded any HTML or text you
wish content to this is content and I
want to load when the second link or
button is clicked and content one is my
default content for this page element
when the page initially loads or if it's
refreshed so say I'm on content three
and i refresh the page it's going to
automatically load content 1 by default
unless you put special programming in
for it to remember which content section
it was on upon refresh which is a whole
nother lesson to hold another ballgame
all right now I'm going to go into my
HTML page and right below the script tag
still within the head tag of the
document I'm going to add some style and
that style is going to affect my div
whatever CSS styling that you want to
add to it and that gives us this now we
want to make sure we have an animated
gif so let's show you how to do that
real quick ok here I am in fireworks cs4
and I'm going to create a new fireworks
document maybe 44 by 10 we'll see if
that's big enough it looks good to me
now I'm just going to put in a rectangle
to match the size of that you can zoom
in by holding ctrl mouse wheel so that
I have a rectangle that's that size you
can get the stroke and the fill to be
colored any way you want and then I'm
going to put in a couple of ellipse
right inside there I make sure they have
no stroke and a fill color of whatever I
want I'm going to use that are and dried
lower now so I'm just going to go
through there press ctrl-c ctrl-v and
copy that little guy
then give me give them a little more
space there we go highlight both of them
by pressing select while I highlight
them press ctrl-c ctrl-v there we go
maybe it looks like one more can fit so
let's add that there we go
that worked out perfectly okay so normal
size that's what it looks like and on
the first scene of this animation I want
it to be let's see let's make these all
alpha down
let's go alpha and you can change the
colors of them you can be as creative as
you want when you're making these things
there I'm the first one I want alpha all
the way up for the first frame of my
animation and to make this picture that
you just created an animation you just
simply go to States add a new state so
on state two you just take all the
elements from state one control C
highlight them press control C go to
state two press control V well this one
you just put the Alpha back down to 48
on this one you put it back up to 100 so
you'll have an animation that starts on
frame one with it bright on the first
dot and then the second frame it's
bright on the second dot and we're going
to do that five times so as you can see
I did that five times so I have my dot
moving across
oops I'm going to make sure I get this
one back down to 48 right here so you
just make sure that your dot moves along
like it should through your five or
however many frames you want to put in
your animation you can even make yours
go back and forth like nightriders
little red light
remember how nitride is a little red
light or kit rather kits little red
light used to go back and forth you can
make your animation do that very easily
by adding more
but if I press play on mine you'll see
what I have that's all I need for this
simple demonstration so I'm going to go
to file export wizard continue continue
as animated gif make sure it says the
animated gif then you can check out your
speeds and everything by clicking play
there then you export and you export to
wherever your site is you call loader
give save now when we go back into the
HTML file instead of showing the words
animated gif here we actually put the
image tag in down in your HTML if you're
in Dreamweaver you can go up here to the
image just click loader let's make that
say loader but the alternate text okay
and then there's your image tag for your
loader press control X take it out of
the HTML put it up here within the
JavaScript bada bing bada boom and let's
make sure we put single quotes around
this HTML around the HTML data we're
going to change that from double quotes
and single quotes that way we can have
double quotes within our HTML no problem
so now let's see what we have when we
check it out online okay I'm just going
to refresh the page press content - you
see my little loader for a second there
you can have any kind of animation you
wish to have there and it will jump into
place right when the person selects new
data to come into that page section and
it all happens without refreshing and
reloading all your other page content so
if you had a big giant web page with all
kind of stuff on it
you could have these links or little
buttons or whatever you want next to
some kind of little container that you
have that you want to swap data for this
data can also actually be images it
would be very easy to create image
gallery using this kind of functionality
and also keep in mind jQuery
gives you the ability to easily animate
things so even though I'm saying dot
show here I can say dot whatever
animation jQuery has to offer me so it
could be a cool
transition that you throw in there so
you just use your imagination and have a
good time get creative with it and just
know that you can animate things real
easily with jQuery okay so that shows
you how to swap data out using jQuery
AJAX and PHP okay bodies talk to you
