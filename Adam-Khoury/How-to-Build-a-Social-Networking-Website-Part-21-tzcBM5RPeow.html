final free lesson in the web intersect
social networking community website
building series in PHP mysql and flash
and the rest of the the series that will
take you further into your system if
needed as those lessons are produced you
can purchase them from web intersect
directly and those videos won't be on
the YouTube grid and all the details for
that will be at web intersect real soon
okay so this lesson is going to be
dealing with mostly just some cosmetic
things on the design end and I didn't
want to leave out and have people have
too many questions about the objective
here is to get our homepage blab data or
any data that you have coming out of
your database or what have you it might
have a long list you might want to put
it into a Content scroller a div
scroller and I'm going to show you how
to set that up and also on the profile
page when you're viewing anybody's
profile if they happen to have a lot of
data you see how it the blab section on
my profile now that I have a lot of labs
in there pushing my details down and I
don't want that i want to have it in a
nice manageable space so and just a few
showing then people can scroll to see
all the rest and it's all going to be
HTML based so it's all good we'll go
into the profile PHP page so let's open
and first I'll just show you how to do
the profile page first and then doing
the homepage I won't show because it's
the same process so first let's show the
home page or the profile that PHP page
let's go to design view in dreamweaver
and i'm working in dreamweaver cs4 and
go to the blab section here and
highlight this blabber display list PHP
block go to the code view now once we're
in code view we can just right below the
black or display form
and under that brake tag and push that
down a little bit and right here we're
going to set a div so let's say div
style and in Styles we're going to set
the width to 100% that way it fills the
space in that area semicolon height and
this is really the one I'm after a
height i'm going to set to about 180 see
how that looks 180 px4 pixels semicolon
then we're going to set the overflow and
this is important to get the scroller
overflow scroll that will make sure that
if there's enough data well there will
always be a scroll actually we can put
overflow auto that will make more sense
so if there's enough data to warrant a
scroll being there then it will be there
that's what that means and we're going
to set the overflow X which I don't
think is a default in the pull downs
there so we'll just pop it in overflow
dash X colon hidden and this hides any
scrollbar that might be showing that
might show up a horizontal scrollbar the
ones that go left to right we only want
the vertical scrollbar so we set the
overflow x2 hidden so there will be no
horizontal scroll bar and now all we
have to do is close off the starting div
tag and then put the closing div tag
here and that's it now we save by
pressing ctrl s ftp it up i'm using
FileZilla once again profile PHP
let's go ahead and look at my page and
if i refresh now I should see
everything's in a nice scroller that's
beautiful now let's make sure we're all
good by going to Safari I'm testing it
out there because Safari is the same
engine that runs oops I spelled it wrong
well it's the same engine that runs
google chrome and several other very
popular browsers many people don't know
that google chrome is using the same
engine that runs the Safari browser here
so let's look at my profile and make
sure we have a scroller in this browser
as well just to make sure our CSS and
HTML setup is universal beautiful and i
must say i really love safaris default
scrollers they're beautiful there are a
lot prettier than Internet Explorer's
and fireboxes so that's how you can get
any kind of content you want into a div
scroller and i'm going to do the same
thing to the homepage here so i can have
more section or area to play with more
real estate on my page to put pertinent
data ok I told you that was a short
sweet one and it sure was so on the
profiles now we have a scroller and you
will see on the homepage they'll be a
scroller as well and the source code the
free source package will reflect that ok
we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
