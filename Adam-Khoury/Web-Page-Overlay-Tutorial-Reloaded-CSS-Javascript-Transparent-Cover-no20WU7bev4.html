overlay tutorial that I put up here last
week remember was the very first page
darkening lesson that we covered so if
you'll bear with me for just a quick
moment I'd like to present that
particular lesson over to show both the
opacity setting method using JavaScript
and the transparent PNG image method in
the same lesson rather than making two
separate lessons to demonstrate the
logic being as a script will be
virtually identical between the two
lessons it makes sense to me to merge
the lessons together into one now since
we have beat this topic into the ground
and discussed a lot of code in depth
already about it I'll simply swap out my
semi transparent PNG file for CSS black
background and then we'll use JavaScript
to set the opacity for the overlay div
to any setting that we require now this
complete script will be available at
develop PHP com first let's take a look
at it
here it is running in google chrome
apply overlay close the overlay okay so
you saw it in chrome let's try it in
Firefox and it works exactly the same so
that's good there and let's try it now
in Internet Explorer that way you guys
can see it working in the all of the
popular browsers press allow blocked
content and then apply overlay
everything works great okay so now
you've clearly seen it working with the
opaque dark dot PNG semi-transparent
file now all we have to do to use the
opacity setting in JavaScript is change
this to just say background color black
now once you have that set up you don't
have to put anything else into this CSS
all you have to do is go down into the
JavaScript now and put in one line here
let's put it right there we'll say
overlay so we'll grab that reference for
the overlay div overlay dot style dot
opacity equal to let's make it point
seven and the way the values work for
opacity is it goes from zero to one so
if you have
city of 0.5 that means you're at 50%
transparency if I'm at 0.7 that means I
met 70% transparency okay so now let's
render this in the browser and you can
see we're using just a black background
for the overlay t'v we're setting its
opacity down in the JavaScript so first
let's try it in Chrome and it works nice
we can also change that number which is
the seven to something darker like a
nine if you want you can see how the
page is much darker now so you have a
little bit more play with the
adjustments in the settings when you're
using the opacity setting rather than
the transparent PNG file because that's
just a static file all right so let's
put this at point eight because I think
it'll look the best at point eight file
preview and browser let's try it in
Firefox okay so that opacity method
works cool and Firefox they're the same
line that works for Chrome now let's see
if this same line of code works exactly
the same and Internet Explorer as it
does in the other browsers allow blocked
content so everything seems to work
universally the same and everything is
commented down here in the HTML so you
can't go wrong and we really we
discussed the toggle functionality but
darkening the page like five times now
and in the four different tutorials
we've done okay so that was it we won't
cover any more material on base
darkening or overlays and things like
that I'm done I've said everything that
I want to say about it and so that's it
we did theater mode we did overlay we
did the YouTube lights out birthday
thing light switch and all that we did a
whole bunch of crap it was a good little
run</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
