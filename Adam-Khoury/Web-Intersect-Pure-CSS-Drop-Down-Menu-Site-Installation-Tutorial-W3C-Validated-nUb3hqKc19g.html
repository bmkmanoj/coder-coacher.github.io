intersex series today we're going to be
putting in a drop-down menu because it
looks as though from the develop PHP
poll that people want to see private
messaging before any of this other stuff
so I'm going to show a private messaging
system very quickly in the next tutorial
but in this tutorial real quick it's
going to be very very fast and very
short I'm going to show you how to put a
drop down menu on this account button
and I don't want everybody to just see a
drop down menu there and be like oh how
to let them do that I'm gonna show you
every little bit of how I do that right
now okay and what I'm about to show you
is so easy anybody could do it like an
old lady that's 95 has never seen the
internet doesn't even know what a
website is she can do this a little baby
who just came out the mother's womb it's
still a little wet and gooey with the
moms who is all over it this baby can do
this so don't tell me having trouble is
so very easy we'll go to develop page
p.m. we'll put in pure CSS and it should
come up in the search bar put in pure
CSS click search and then the first one
is pure CSS dropdown menu w3c validated
works in all major browsers that's the
one I want and i made this tutorial
little while ago magna know what time it
was March 9 2010 idts and I made this
from scratch with my own bare hands with
chisel and Hammer all right now what
we're going to do is simply grab this
HTML actually we only need one I'm going
to grab this and I'm going to go to my
files I'm going to open the web
intersect scripts check user log and
here is where we make our blog options
for the logged in user whether they're
logged in or logged out here's where
those options get created the HTML that
is displayed in the header so this is
where I have to put this so right here
here's account I want to trade that or a
drop-down so
let's just comment that out using the
comment button there in the HTML let's
go a couple lines down and pop this in
now let's trade this I'm saying drop
menu 12 account and this one just those
three for now we'll add some more later
when we add some new things to the site
but for right now that's good so I'm
going to take that whole div press
ctrl-c to copy it actually we can put
the link let's put the link in there
right here where the pound sign is okay
that should be good now we're going to
copy that and we'll put the links with a
message inbox in the sim box in place
when we start creating the private
message system which will be in the next
lesson now I'm going to place it also
here let's comment this one out that's
their account button let's go down a
couple lines let's place in that div
once again so that way no matter whether
they're coming back from being away from
the site for a week and they're using
their cookie to be logged in or whether
they're session is available the
recession idx is set so no matter what's
the scenario the person will have that
account drop down now now all we have to
do is open the main dot CSS go to style
main and then here down at the bottom we
add the rest of what I had on that page
there at develop PHP all this CSS I
don't need the style tag because I'm
putting mine right into the main style
sheet of the site but I do one all this
stuff here so line 64 down here boom I
just put in all that and up here where
it starts let's get rid of that
okay so this is the CSS for the
drop-down menu okay now we're back at
the homepage of the site and it should
be on every page let's refresh right now
it's not there but if we refresh it
should be there hopefully and there it
is you can see mine is set to align
right so all I have to do in the CSS
let's put right here right here DC text
the line make sure it's left now I have
to beat it up now I'm going to refresh
and let's see what we have this time ok
so now it's aligned to the left the way
I want it now I'm going to go back into
the CSS until we get out just a little
bit to get it colored the way I want if
I wanted to make it look like buttons to
have image backgrounds and each one of
those buttons cells I can do that we can
also position right here where it says
left we could change that from 0 to say
10 and you'll see the difference when i
refresh and top we're going to bring up
a little more because i think there's
too much of a space there so let's put
that on 13 ok now you see how it's
positioned a little better it's right on
the underline there or right under the
button where it should be so that way
there's no question whether somebody's
mouse going over it will let them hit
those buttons under it when it comes
into view if you leave a little space in
here there it could make it to where it
doesn't function correctly if the person
is moving their mouth slowly enough over
it but we can see that I went the wrong
way there with my left maybe we can make
that a minus about minus 5 let's see
what happens ok so you see there I can
position it left the right anywhere I
want that box to show up and I can also
position the height of where it's going
to show up once the mouse goes over it
doesn't have to be right under the
account word there but it should be with
pixel range to where it doesn't go away
when they go down when they go off of
the word account you want to make sure
this menu system doesn't go away and
their mouths access is the first button
right away okay so I'm going to tweak my
not a little more and you can tweak
yours to look at any way you like and in
the next lesson we'll start this private
messaging system which is pretty simple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
