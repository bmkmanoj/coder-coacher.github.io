me thank you for inviting me onto your
computer screen in this lesson we're
going to scratch program smooth auto
scrolling effects on your webpages after
we discussed the core programming that
makes the magic happen I'll show you how
to externalize and reuse your scripted
creation you can even offer it to others
as a little lightweight efficient
framework for smooth auto scrolling on
their pages if they don't happen to know
JavaScript programming so well now just
so you have a really good idea of what
you'll be learning how to program in
this video lesson let's quickly take a
look at and play with the finished
application that you'll have at the end
of the video but instead of snapping to
section 3 when I click this link it's
going to animate the scrollbar it
automates and animates the scrollbar now
when I click this link go back to top it
animates the scrollbar and the whole
page back to the top and traditionally
it would instantly snap to document
section 3 when I hit that link if I was
creating normal named anchor links if
we're going to begin with the bare bones
of an html5 web document and we'll start
in the head element will start a style
tag type text/css and then go down a
couple of lines and make sure we close
that style element that's where we're
going to put the CSS and under the style
element we're also going to have a
script element and go down a couple of
lines and make sure you close your
script element now you can choose to
leave your script element like that or
put the type attribute text/javascript
and in the script element is where we're
going to place our JavaScript and
towards the end of the video I'm going
to show you how to externalize your
JavaScript that way we just call on an
external jes file here in this line
seven instead of having our JavaScript
visible within the document and by the
way the file that I'm working in is a
dot HTML file so yours can be index dot
HTML services HTML it can also be index
type PHP or services PHP as long as it's
a web document now before we put in the
CSS and the JavaScript for the document
we're going to go and put all the HTML
into the body element so first thing I'm
just going to type the sentence
JavaScript
smooth animated autoscroll tutorial
we're going to highlight all that and
I'm going to make sure I wrap it in h2
tag I want to give this h2 an ID
attribute with a value of my heading now
let's go down one line and let's open an
a element which is a link and let's make
it href attribute equal to the pound
sign that way it doesn't navigate
anywhere then we're going to make an
on-click event attribute that's going to
be equal to return false and we're doing
this so that the pound sign doesn't get
put into the user's address bar up top
in their address bar when they click
this link if we didn't put return false
in the on click event that pound sign
would show up in their address bar at
the end of the URL and you don't really
want that now we're going to put an on
mouse down event handler on that link
and that's going to be equal to the
JavaScript function that we want to run
what we'll name that function is auto
scroll to open closed parenthesis and
you can put in your semicolon now in the
inner HTML section here we're going to
type in document section 1 so this is
the little link that when clicked will
auto smooth scroll to the first section
of the document so let's make that first
section of the document we're going to
put a div right here this div is going
to have an ID equal to div 1 the class
is going to be equal to content box
so whatever divs on the page that have
the class of content box will be
affected by the CSS that we create in
just a moment so since this div has an
unique ID on the page of div 1 that is
going to be the element that we're going
to assign this link to auto scroll to so
in the argument for the auto scroll
function which this auto scroll function
has not been written yet it's going to
be written in our JavaScript element
here in just a second but we're going to
need to pass an argument of which
element on the page that we want to auto
scroll to so we have to pass that
argument right here through the function
and we're going to put it in between
single quotes div 1 because that is the
ID of
here now when we highlight this div
press control-c and copy it go down one
line like this once a div to give to
content do that two more times so now
you have four content sections now let's
highlight the link we're going to need
four of those to go to those specific
sections of the document we're going to
need little links that the user can
click to smooth scroll to those sections
so put in three more and change this to
say document section 2 section 3 section
4 and then give 2 to 3 to 4 so you see
what's happening when each link is
clicked it fires off the function on the
onmousedown event handler to auto scroll
to whichever div or whichever element on
the page any point on the page that you
want to make it auto scroll to now
underneath each div you want to have
another little link so anywhere we're
using the a elements here you can trade
those four buttons or any kind of user
interface that you want to use you can
use button elements input elements the a
element like I'm using whatever you want
so right underneath each content section
so you see underneath div one here I'm
going to place another link and this
link is similar to the one up top but
instead of its onmousedown event firing
a function called auto scroll two it's
going to fire a function called reset
the scroller that's going to be another
custom function that we're going to
create and it has just a couple of lines
of code and that is made to reset the
scroller back to the top now in the
reset scroller function we have to pass
one argument to that one as well and
we're passing the value of my heading
and remember my heading was the h2
element on top or in your case it might
be the header or whatever you want to
make sure the ID for that element
whatever elements at the top of the page
is being passed through as an argument
to the reset scroller function now once
you have that one a little link in place
you want to put three more under each
div that's holding a whole lot of
content on your page now in these first
four
elements right after those let's just
put some line breaks that way they're
not all in the same line and that is all
of the HTML now we can go up here into
the style element and put in the CSS
that's going to affect these content
boxes your divs your content sections on
the page so you can highlight that class
name ctrl C copy it and then up in the
style element let's type in div dot
paste in content box open curly brace go
down a couple of lines and close your
curly braces then I'm going to pop in
these five lines of CSS and actually we
can take a look at what we have now by
rendering this page in our favorite
browser so you see what I have now when
I click these links nothing's going to
happen because I have no JavaScript yet
but all of my CSS and HTML is ready to
go all right so I can collapse the CSS
now since we don't really need to see
that and I'm also going to collapse the
HTML because we're going to focus on the
JavaScript the first thing we're going
to do is create three variables and give
them default values now these three
variables are going to be used within
our auto scroll tool function so let's
begin that function type in function
space auto scroll two and you can see
I'm camel casing here so each occurrence
of a word after the first word within my
function name has a capital letter
that's called camel casing it helps you
identify where the words are in there
okay that's all camera casings open
close parenthesis then put the opening
curly brace go down a couple of lines
and put in your closing curly brace
you'll have your function nest all set
up and ready to go now remember this
function look at the HTML each time this
function is called when the user clicks
these links we're passing an argument
through of whichever div that we want to
smooth scroll to on the page so we have
to pick up that div whatever element and
we'll call it e l for short ee l stands
for element now within the function the
first variable that we're going to
create is going to be named current Y
and that's going to be equal to window
dot page Y offset now what window dot
page Y offset
returns to your script is the exact
number of pixels that the user has
scrolled content down into the page now
after that variable we need another
variable it's going to be called target
Y and we call it target Y because the Y
position is the vertical plane your x
position is your horizontal plane since
we're doing up-and-down scrolling we
don't have to worry about the x position
at all we're just going to worry about
the Y positioning because that deals
with up-and-down vertical X deals with
horizontal sideways now the reason why
we call this variable target Y is
because it's going to represent
whichever div is being passed through as
argument when the function is called to
run so when the user clicks this link
here div 3 is going to be sent through
this function and it's going to be
represented as e L so we say document
dot get element by ID e L that would be
div 1 2 3 or 4 dot offset top property
we use the offset top property on a div
what that returns to your script is
exactly how many pixels that that
element that div on the page is from the
top or its parent element so however far
it is down into its parent element in
our case the parent element for all
these divs is the body element so
however far div 4 is sitting on the page
within the body element however far down
it is we get that exact pixel number
back that's what target y represents now
these next two lines within our
JavaScript are only in place because
when the scrolling happens to hit the
bottom of the page we want to make sure
that we cancel the animation and stop
the whole process of scrolling because
what will happen is when the auto
scrolling mechanism hits the bottom of
the page and the user tries to scroll
with their mouse back up the page the
animation will keep going pushing them
back down to the bottom so these two
variables are going to help alleviate
that problem the first one is we get the
body height here's the body element on
our page so what we say to get the
hi it is document.body offset height
property now the Y position variable we
get by adding current Y which we
discussed up here how we get that and
what that all represents so we use
current y plus the window inner height
property and in a moment in an if
condition in the script we're going to
compare to see if the Y position is
greater than the body height if the Y
position happens to be greater than the
body height and we're going to cancel
the whole animation and the scrolling
stops because the user has hit the
bottom of the page I just wanted to tell
you guys that's why we're creating these
two variables now the next line in the
script we're going to create our
animation mechanism and we'll just name
that bar animator and that's going to be
equal to the set timeout method and you
can also use set interval for animating
things on a web document now so timeout
gets two arguments passed through it the
first one is the function that you want
to happen which is this one right here
it's the code that you want to execute
so we'll just put that function in and
we'll put our opening and closing
parenthesis there now the next argument
that it gets is the milliseconds and
we're going to have speed variable
control the milliseconds and actually
that's something that never changes in
this particular script so you can just
actually write see how I have var speed
24 you can actually just put 24 there so
just know that speed is 24 because we
created a variable outside of our
function called speed and it has a value
of 24 so that's 24 milliseconds remember
1000 milliseconds is equal to one second
so what's happening in the set timeout
but the variable name of animator is
that the autoscroll tube function is
repeatedly very quickly
many many times per second is being
called to run repeatedly over and over
and over again and that's how animation
is done in JavaScript so we have to pass
one argument through this auto scroll to
function every time it runs which is
e/l so let's press ctrl C on e l there
and we have to pass it between single
quotes here put
notice if we put single quotes it's
going to give us a syntax problem so
backslash before each single quote and
you won't have any problems with single
quotes there then in between those two
single quotes that have back slashes
around them there we're going to put
single quote plus il plus single quote
all right so you see what we have there
I'll even zoom in on it real nice so you
can see the exact character
configuration I have that play it will
pass the value of either div 1 div 2 div
302 4 back through that function
repeatedly many many times per second as
it's being called to run here by the set
timeout method you can pass more
arguments if you like now right under
the animator function we're going to
have an if condition and this is where
we're going to do that check I was
talking about to see if the scrolling
mechanism happens to hit the bottom of
the page you don't want the animation to
keep going if the user happens to try
and scroll up again it's going to keep
animating down and hit the bottom so you
want to clear the timeout on the
animator to make the animation stop only
if it hits the bottom of the page so
after that if condition we can put an
else statement open your curly brace go
down a couple of lines and close your
curly brace now here in the else
condition is where we're going to have a
little bit of mathematical calculations
all your set timeout is doing is
creating a very fast running loop that
will enable you to animate if you adjust
some numbers on things and remember in
the beginning and remember I told you we
were going to learn how to animate the
scroll method of the window object
alright so to do the animating all we
need is another little if and else
condition statement and then that is the
last little bit that we're going to have
within our auto scroll tool function let
me explain these last few lines so when
animating if the Y position is greater
than the height you're going to clear
the animation altogether this auto
scroll to function will cease to run if
the scroll mechanism hits the bottom of
the page else you wanted to keep
animating
now you have to have an if condition in
place here to see if the target that
you're trying to scroll to has been
reached or not because how else would
the animation know to stop but you have
to evaluate if the current position on
the page happens to be where that target
element that we want to scroll to where
that hits that then we want to make sure
we clear time out again on the animator
so you can set all of that logic up by
simply saying if the current y is less
than the target y minus distance and you
know a distance is it's 40 so the target
y which ever did one two three or four
its current location that would be
target y minus forty pixels so if the
current Y is less than target y minus 40
then we're going to set the scroll
amount now the scroll Y amount is a very
important number for your script because
that's the one that you're going to keep
changing and adding to to make the
animated effect and what you're adding
to the current Y is 40 you're adding
distance so you can change that any
number you want it can be a hundred it
could be ten so that's how you get the
animated effect is you take the current
Y position where the actual scrollbar is
on the page and you add 40 pixels to it
and it moves it that many pixels very
very quickly that way it seems animated
now you take that scroll Y amount and
you actually apply it to the window that
scroll method and that's really this
line is the magic behind the whole thing
you're running the window scroll method
which allows you to scroll to a specific
point on the page basically if this said
nine hundred and I ran this line by
itself in JavaScript right here the
window would scroll to nine hundred
pixels down into the page but it will
snap to it
there will be no animation the fact that
we have a variable here that is changing
very very quickly over time it's slowly
getting bigger and bigger that's going
to animate the scroll so what you see
what appears to happen is a scrolling
animation to the point on the page that
you want so if the current Y is less
than the
target why you wanted to keep animating
to that point on the page until it gets
there once it gets there this else
condition comes into play and you clear
time out so that's the whole bloody
script okay now underneath the auto
scroll to function we're going to need
one more little function that is reset
scroller remember the little links that
say go back to the top we got to have
those in place and actually you can test
your application right now without even
putting that in
if we click any of these links it'll
scroll to that section but since we have
no reset scroller function yet when we
click these it won't go back to top yet
but these work just fine now so in your
web document right under the auto scroll
to function let's go ahead and collapse
that right underneath auto scroll to
let's put a function called reset
scroller and it's going to be very
similar to the auto scroll to function
but it's definitely not as big there's
not as many lines in it as there are and
the other one basically what it does is
it goes the other way instead of scroll
Y being equal to current y plus distance
here we're using minus distance so
current y minus 40 every time we'll make
the page appear to animate going back up
and once it gets there we clear time out
on the animator an animator is the same
thing as it was in the first function
set time out and it's set to run this
function reset scroller over and over
again that's why we put these set
timeout methods to run within the
function that they're calling it creates
a loop and it's running the same speed
you can make this one run a different
speed so basically if you wanted to
scroll up faster let me show you what
I'm talking about if you wanted to click
document section three so if you wanted
to scroll back to the top super
lightning-fast you could just change
this variable here from speed to let's
say 10 and instead of speed being 24
it's going to be 10 you can even make
that faster by going maybe 5 now if I
test this and I go to section 3 when I
click
go back to the top it's going to be
super fast go to Section four back to
the top see how fast it goes back so you
can use the same variable to go the same
speed as your first function or you can
change it up and if you guys have any
questions basically a lot of this code
is the same thing that the function on
top that's doing and I already explained
every line of that top function
so basically everything within this
function has been explained already the
only difference here is that we're going
- instead of plus distance all right
let's render this in our favorite
browser and see what we have let's go to
section one it's good let's go back top
section - good back to the top section
three good go back to the top link works
nice go all the way to the bottom back
to the top good all right let's take the
inside of this function reset scroller
and collapse all of that code now let's
take all of our HTML let's collapse that
as well and the CSS is already collapsed
now remember in the beginning of the
video I told you guys I'm going to show
you how to externalize this code and you
can even show people how to use your
external script as a framework for their
pages so they don't have to have they
don't have to write this kind of script
and they can just use your functions as
long as you externalize it let's just go
ahead and give this script tag the
source attribute and let's make that
equal to let's name the javascript file
auto scroll to dot j s okay so once you
have that in place take all of the
JavaScript to highlight all of the
JavaScript both functions and these
three variables so get those three
variables and both functions highlighted
control X cut them out now take this
closing script tag and just put it right
next to the opening script tag to where
it's all on one line and press ctrl s to
save this document go to file new
basically you just want to create a dot
J s JavaScript file once you get that
ready press ctrl V to put in all of your
code
so there's your function autoscroll -
and there's your function reset all
within an external document now you just
go to file save as and I'm just going to
save it in the same folder here auto
scroll to save so you see here I have
auto scroll to a s
so that file has been saved and my
original file that we've been working on
has been saved so now if I run this
script it should still work because I'm
tapped into that external auto scroll to
file here C so what we've done is we've
modulated it and made it external and
anybody who we want can just put this
one line into the head tag of their
document and use those functions they
don't have to actually write those
functions or have them in your document
so now let's test run this in your
favorite browser and if everything
animates we've successfully connected so
everything animates just fine that means
we're successfully connected to the
external auto scroll - Jes now to allow
other people to use this external
framework that you have now created all
you have to do is make auto scroll - Jes
available to everyone on the web so you
just put it up on the web somewhere and
allow them to link to it or you offer it
up as download and they can just put it
on their own server on their own website
and connect straight to this file on
their own server that way they don't
have to depend on your server being
active or available to make this script
run alright I hope you've enjoyed this
lesson and within it we demonstrated a
lot of core JavaScript programming we
showed how real JavaScript animation is
created from scratch to animate certain
properties and methods of the JavaScript
Dom and beyond that we showed you how to
externalize it and modulate it and make
it available to anyone that wants to use
it maybe they don't know JavaScript
programming so well you happen to know
core JavaScript programming so you can
create all kinds of functions and cool
frameworks for people to use and they
don't have to learn the first thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
