the previous exercise we demonstrated
how to create custom alert dialog boxes
using JavaScript and CSS in this related
exercise we're going to demonstrate
creating custom confirm dialog boxes in
which you give the user more choices
which means more buttons and a confirmed
box requires just a little bit more
script logic because your program has to
perform some action after the user
confirms the action let's show you the
finished product of what you'll be
learning to create so what I have here
is a simulated dynamic posts on a page
and I have a delete button next to each
post so let's go to the first one and
click delete confirm that action delete
post and you can see our custom dialog
box here for confirming and this gives
the user two buttons yes or no if they
click no nothing happens but if they
happen to click yes that post is deleted
from the page we can also delete the
next one dynamically delete post yes
we're going to begin with the same exact
code that we left off with at the end of
the last exercise so if you need to
understand all the code that we're going
to begin with all you have to do is view
the previous exercise now our goal as it
was in the previous exercise is to make
a reusable box that will render all of
our program dialogues dynamically so
we're going to simply extend this
existing code to make it work for both
confirm dialogues and alert dialogues
we're also going to declutter this
primary file by externalizing and
compartmentalizing our CSS and
JavaScript that powers our custom dialog
boxes so what we'll do is open the CSS
first we'll take all of the CSS code
control X then you go into your code
editor whatever IDE you're in and you
make a new CSS file and then you can
just pop your code in and you go to file
save as dialog CSS so now I have dialog
dot CSS sitting in the same folder as my
primary file so we can just remove this
style element and in its place we're
going to put a link element to our
stylesheet and then we put the path to
our style sheet right here now that you
have the CSS externalized let's test to
make sure everything is still connected
and working so I hit my custom alert and
all the CSS is still attached to
everything is fine now let's do the same
thing to the JavaScript because all of
this JavaScript can be externalized and
made more reusable that way if you have
to use this in many different files so
let's grab all of the JavaScript ctrl X
let's go to file new JavaScript file and
we pop it in all of our code ctrl V to
paste it and then we save this file just
like we did the CSS file so now I have
dialog j/s all I have to do is go into
my primary file now and right there
where my script element is I just put
script source and dialogue j/s now let's
test and make sure that our JavaScript
is still working and connected and
everything is working just fine now
that's a good way to declutter your
primary files and you can also just call
in dialogue CSS in dialogue Jas into
many different primary files that you
have within your program all right now
let's create this custom confirm box to
go along with our custom alert box so
we'll take all of the existing HTML
within the file making sure that we keep
our dialog overlay and dialog box in
place I'm going to put in the following
HTML and what i'm doing here is
simulating posts that you would have
dynamically rendered within your
software but it really could be any
content so i have two paragraph elements
and each paragraph element has a unique
ID
this one has post 1 ID and this one has
ID of post 2 and here would be the post
text and then in the post somewhere we
have a delete button and what we're
going to do is run a custom method of
confirmed render this is going to make
our dialog box pop-up and we're going to
pass 3 arguments to that method the
dialog that we want the user to see in
the window the operation that we want to
perform and the ID of the element that
we want to delete so you can see both
buttons are set up that way for both
posts so all we have to do is go into
our dialog j/s now and instead of having
just a custom alert object we're going
to place in a custom confirm object now
and our confirm object is going to have
a similar structure to our alert object
with some slight variation so what I'll
do is collapse all of the custom alert
code and right under it I'm going to pop
in the custom confirm code you can see
it has a very similar structure to the
custom alert but instead of having an OK
method we now have a no and yes method
because a confirm box you have to give
the user a choice between yes or no or
ok and cancel whatever you want to name
your buttons so if they confirm you run
this code here if they cancel or press
no then you run this code here I got to
bring line 38 here separated I got to
bring that up to be all on one line on
line 36 so with the custom alert box all
we did was we put one button here that
was running the alert dot okay method
but now we have to
by two buttons to the user a yes button
and a no button so for the first button
we're going to run the confirm that yes
method which you can see is sitting
right here and we're going to pass two
arguments to that confirm yes method the
operation and the post ID and we get
those arguments by initially passing
those three arguments through the render
method right here confirmed that render
we're passing three arguments we're
scooping up those three arguments right
here and we can pass those arguments as
needed to any other methods within our
object and you can also make these
properties of the object but I just
decided to pass them dynamically through
the methods and if they click the no
button all you have to do is run the
confirm dot no method and that simply
just removes the dialog window and the
overlay but if they click yes that's
when we want to actually perform the
action that they were about to initiate
such as deleting a post now what I did
in the yes method was I put an
evaluation to see which operation we
want now if the operation happens to be
delete post then we're going to run a
function called delete post and pass the
ID of the post that we want to delete
into that function so let's go right
above our custom confirm object and put
in a new function called delete post
we're going to scoop up the ID of the
post that we need to delete as an
argument now this line the reason why I
put that there is that's your database
ID for that post and all you have to do
is remove the post and the underscore
for instance if you're rendering these
dynamically what you would have coming
out of your database is id-1 id2 for
whatever post so all you have to do is
put on the front of that post an
underscore and that can be the ID of
each element that holds that post and
when your JavaScript parses it to delete
it you can remove all you have to do is
replace the post and underscore and what
you'll be left with is the one what
you'll be left with is just the two that
way you can run an ajax request in this
delete post method you run an ajax
request
right here and what this line does is
removes that element from the page so
actually let me show you how this runs
by saving all these files and let's run
this in our favorite browser what you
can see is we have two posts and I'm
going to delete the first one and you
can see my custom confirmed box it says
confirm that action delete post I say
yes or no if I say no the post remains
if I press it again and I say yes the
post is deleted I can also delete the
next one dynamically yes so the way I
got the element to be removed from the
page without page refresh is I just run
document that body remove child method
and I put the object reference for the
child that I want to remove right here
now the reason why I put this line in
place now this line isn't even needed to
remove that child element this line I
just put in as an extra to you because
this is the database ID for whatever
post this will represent a number such
as just the one or just the two which
would be the IDS because we're stripping
the post and underscore substring from
the post ID so you can use this variable
in your Ajax request I'll just put a
note I'll say run Ajax request here to
delete post and database and that's what
will remove the post from the database
so you remove your post from your
database using Ajax and when your PHP
file gives a response back to the Ajax
request you simply remove that element
from the page now it's important to keep
in mind that when you're issuing the
render method for a confirm box you can
put any variables that you want right
here and then in your yes method you can
check to see which operation that you're
doing so this can be used for more than
just deleting posts if there's other
things on the page that you will need
confirm for you can run different
operations and those would be handled
within your this yes method so this that
yes can be set up to intake an operation
variable and an ID and then you can just
check to see if the
operation is delete post you're going to
run some specialized function that
deletes posts which we already placed up
here and that's pretty much all the
logic now in the final video we'll be
adding a custom prompt object because in
JavaScript you have three types of
dialog boxes you have alert confirm and
prompt we already covered creating
custom alert and confirmed boxes now the
last box is the prompt box and what the
prompt box gives the user is a input
field so they can give you some value so
if you ever have a situation within your
program where you need to get a value
from the user before something can occur
prompt box is perfect for that
so that will be our last video in
demonstrating how to create custom
dialog boxes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
