we're going to discuss three things one
being popular payment gateways now there
are a whole bunch of different payment
gateways that you can find probably
hundreds but PayPal and Google Checkout
are the most widely used in popular
right now probably only reason I'm going
to focus on PayPal is because PayPal is
the most popular and widely used right
now and it's the most trusted shoppers
love just having their PayPal account
and they can shop at a hundred stores
online and not give any one of those
stores their credit card information and
that's why they like it now with Google
Checkout I'm sure it's a great service
and everything but with Google Checkout
versus PayPal that's kind of the way I
feel about Google versus Bing I think
Google is a much better search engine
than Bing I think Microsoft had really
no rhyme or reason except making money
and more online traffic by themselves to
make a search engine Google mastered the
search engine and then Microsoft comes
in like five thousand years later and
they're like oh we go to search engine
oh it's better to gurus no you don't
that search engine blows and I like
Microsoft products I just don't like
Bing
so that's one saying I don't think
Google Checkout should be moving in on
online payment processing I don't think
Google should be moving in on that it's
kind of like wrappers going and becoming
actors after they be cut become a
successful wrapper so I go you're a
wrapper okay you can act now no you
can't you can wrap
you can't act now no matter which
payment processor you go with which
payment gateway you use it doesn't
matter they're going to have encrypted
type buttons versus developer button
code now using encrypted buttons defeats
fraudulent purchases I know a lot of
people that have set up stores online
they hear a lot about people price
jacking so price jacking can occur and
if you want you can pause and read all
this that I have there and I tell you
how price jacking can occur right here
if somebody knows the
Gateway's system well and programming so
if they're a good programmer and they
know that Gateway system real well
whether it be Google Checkout some other
service PayPal whichever kind of online
payment processor if they know that
system well and they're a good
programmer they can replicate your store
items on a page on their server and
simply change $100 price that you may
have on your current items to $1 price
so if you're not using encrypted button
code in your store you protect yourself
as the merchants by making sure the
payments match the product purchases so
when you get all the invoicing and
whatever back from PayPal or Google
Checkout you make sure that if somebody
bought jeans and it's supposed to be $10
you make sure what their payment is is
$10 it's very simple and you can even I
give you a little note here it's not
very tough to do or script a PHP system
to do it for you automatically so you
don't have to check everything since
we're going to be using IP n with paypal
we can cross-reference prices in the
database with what the checkout amount
was so you can see what all they bought
and you just make sure and PHP can do
this automatically on the fly you can
make sure that that checkout amount
matches the products they bought and
only then do you process that within
your system and if it doesn't you throw
up a red flag in your system email
yourself Danger Danger Danger somebody's
trying to price tamper but like I said
using encrypted buttons you can defeat
price tampering in within PayPal you can
make encrypted buttons that nobody can
price tamper and they're using the
hosted button ID code now but that's for
if you want to manually make your
buttons within your gateway account and
then bring that code over to your site
but what we're doing is we're going to
use the developer button so all payment
gateways give you a set of developer
tools and api's you can use that will
work with their system so we're going to
be using the developer buttons and what
that is is certain codes that you can
apply it will be a little bit less
secure than using the encrypted buttons
so like I said encrypted buttons there's
no way that I know of that anybody can
do
price tampering with the developer
buttons it's a little bit open in the in
the source code view somebody can view
your source and view the button code and
recreate that button code somewhere
alright so the last thing before I show
you what's going on at PayPal is SSL
encrypted pages SSL encrypted pages are
only needed when you are accessing or
transferring private personal or
financial information over your web
pages so if your store incorporates
PayPal ipn or any other mechanism that
gets variables passed to it you will
want to incorporate an SSL certificate
into your online store web site is only
required that you use HTTPS secure URLs
when personal data or financial data is
accessed or transfer to pages pages on
your site that do not handle private
data do not need to be encrypted pages
you can run HTTPS secure pages on all of
the pages of your website if you want to
give shoppers more confidence so what
you do is you buy an SSL certificate
it's like 25 bucks around 25 bucks from
your hosting company and they can easily
apply it to your hosting account or they
can help you to apply it show you the
steps and I dig it I think it has to be
the main domain on your hosting account
so if you maybe have six domains in your
hosting account I think you can only
apply SSL to the main domain on that
account to use the secure functionality
SSL provides you simply make all of your
site's navigation have HTTPS instead of
HTTP and this can be done using an HT
Access file directive that will force
all of the URLs to have the HTTPS
instead of HTTP no matter what somebody
tries to type in to you the URL address
bar okay now we're going to go login to
PayPal and I'll show you a few things
that you'll want to know there
okay so after you create your PayPal
account you'll notice that they offer a
whole ton of payment processing
solutions for your website website
payments pro if you want to give your
customers all on site shopping
experience what I'm going to be showing
its website payment standard solution
and that one uses it will usher people
to the PayPal payment gateway and then
will send them back to your site so you
can save 30 bucks a month if you want
that kind of set up or if you want them
to be on your site the whole time which
is a more professional better set up you
can spend the $30 a month and the same
kind of forms and everything that would
they would use on PayPal once they get
to PayPal using the payment standard the
same kind of forms would be on your site
for the person to use but using payment
standard person is ushered to the
pavement gateway and then right when
they check out using PayPal they're
ushered back to your site
now some people were asking me about
handling taxes and shipping and currency
and things like that PayPal will allow
you to handle currency types within your
PayPal account that's why I haven't
discussed it yet because it's really it
all goes down within your merchant
account at whatever gateway you choose
but PayPal will handle your currency
types it'll handle you can accept any
currency and they'll convert it for you
it'll handle taxes you Dax establish
what you want your tax rates to be for
all your products and it also handles
shipping and we'll be discussing that
just a little bit and you can research
that a lot more on your own there's a
whole lot of information to be read at
PayPal they'll have the developer
section which I'm going to be showing
you as well so log in to your PayPal
account now mine I'm not going to show
you all my private details and
everything like that but this is what my
menu bar looks like on the home page
when I log into PayPal you can see mine
is a mine is a business type of account
and it's verified now I could spend I
could do 12-volt tutorial is just about
PayPal but I'm not going to spend a lot
of time I'm just going to show you this
profile page which is probably the most
important page within your merchant
account at PayPal okay let's take a look
at these things we have here
all the way on the left you have account
information in the middle financial
information on the right selling
preferences so I'm going to show you
I'll just lead you to areas of interest
that I want to target I'm not going to
show you what inside of all of these
links that you can do on your own but
I'm going to show you certain things
that are key important things that we'll
have to know that we can adjust all
right I want you to check out merchant
fees and then that way you can find out
exactly how much PayPal is going to
charge you when somebody checks out on
your site or in your store you can see
exactly how much they take out
percentage for each transaction to get
their cut for offering you this nice
safe secure service and giving your
shoppers peace of mind because when a
chopper sees PayPal let's face it you
know when somebody's checking out I
don't know and maybe not everybody's
like me but when I'm checking out
somewhere they better have PayPal
checkout option or I won't buy anything
from there so definitely check out
merchant fees that's what it was getting
started steps so you want to click this
and when you're on this page just make
sure you complete all of these actions
so you get verified as a business so
that's how money is switched back and
forth you know your store makes a bunch
of money and it doesn't go straight into
your bank account it goes into your
PayPal account and at any time you can
transfer the monies from PayPal from
your PayPal account to your local
business account wherever your local
bank is and what's cool about PayPal's
you can even get a debit card I love
using my paypal debit card ok so that's
all I really want to show you on the
right side there now in the center what
do we got here I think this stuff is
mostly for your if you use your PayPal
account to buy something say you want to
buy something from Walmart calm or
whatever store online you can use this
PayPal account to buy things online we
don't need to look at any of that but
definitely look it over in your own time
you should look under look over all
these links now the ones on the right
here is what I want you to take a good
look at this is your selling
preferences
so this is all definitely important
stuff see there you have sales tax and
I'm not even going to try and train you
on PayPal that's not what this tutorial
is about I'm trying to show you how to
make custom PHP cart and MySQL database
to hold your inventory and all that and
connect it to your gateway you've got to
learn about your gateway on your own but
I'm just showing you where these things
are so you can investigate further set
up your sales tax they're set up
shipping calculations shipping
preferences this is where you get you
save buttons you make more buttons you
can make any kind of buttons you want
here you can make add to cart' buttons
by now buttons give certificates donate
buttons all kind of crap and that's
where you make your encrypted buttons
I'm not going to be showing you how they
make buttons through the system here
we're going to look at PayPal's
developer tools and they give you
different ways to make and script your
buttons if you're doing custom things
making custom stores payment receiving
preferences you definitely want to look
at that because that I think deals with
the converting currencies like you can
accept all kinds of different currencies
from around the world but PayPal will
convert them for you if you select that
kind of option within your selling
preferences you got to select the option
I think if you want to accept any kind
of currency and have PayPal
automatically convert it to your
currency instant payment notification
that's what I'm going to click on in a
second here what else we got PayPal
shops now I don't need you to look at
that but you definitely want to look at
all of this customer service website
payment preferences you want to look at
that see this is the auto return I'm
going to be showing you how to do this
through the buttons but you can set it
in here and just set the page that you
want PayPal to auto return them to after
they check out what else we got here and
we don't need to look at any of that
and here's encrypted payment settings
dynamically encrypt your website
payments by downloading PayPal's public
certificate and provide paypal your
public certificate you will need to
dynamically encrypt the website payments
with your own code to use this feature
learn more I'm not going to show you how
to encrypt anything that's all on you
and it'll probably be different within
Google Checkout and other different
gateway services that you might be using
so I'm not going to go very far with
everything I'm just going to show you
how to tap into PayPal's developer tools
and integrate IPN that way every
purchase that's made ipn is instant
payment notification that way every
purchase that's made using your store
your MySQL database is going to get fed
to all of that information that way you
can do custom in-house handling of all
that data and then the series is done
once we get done with the instant
payment notifications and you're getting
all this data back from PayPal after
people check out and everything is
getting stacked into your MySQL database
that's it I'm not going to show you guys
how to make customer profiles and
accounts so your customers can log in
that's all on you you can go check out
my social networking type website
tutorials and then integrate the two and
you'll have your whole thing so for now
all we need is to click this instant
payday network is that has to be HTTPS
and whatever whatever URL your website
is that Vlad comm slash my ipn script
dot PHP that's how it would be so you
can have my IP and script up PHP be in
your site's it could be a file on your
site when people check out that script
is going to be given a whole bunch of
variables behind the scenes paypal is
going to send all these variables behind
the scenes for the person what their
name is the amount they checked out for
what they bought everybody back so
that's how the magic works and at that
point since it's a PHP script that's
gathering up all this these variables
for the
payment of the whole transaction you can
put these things in a MySQL database
email these things to yourself in a
custom fashion whatever you want to do
and I'm going to show you a nice ipn
script example so don't you worry but
I'm not going to I'm going to cancel
this because I'm not going to set it up
like this I'm going to use the actual
button programming using the developer
tools to signify which ipn script that I
want to hit on my site and I think
that'll show you a little more of a
dynamic approach to it so okay so in
part 19 I'll introduce you to the PayPal
developer section show you all the tools
that you have available to work with as
a programming error and we can take what
we need understand and learn what
variables they want us to use we'll take
all that information and we'll put it
into effect within our website that way
we can properly communicate things to
PayPal in a custom way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
