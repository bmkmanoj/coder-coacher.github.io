covering all of the fill and stroke
styles we can apply to our fills and
strokes on our canvas we're going to
continue with the same code that we left
off with in exercise number one and
we'll just remove all of the style we
have here and we'll pop in another
comment to ourselves now I put this
comment in place that way you can see
all of the different types of values
that you can use for your fill style so
you can use a standard color like if you
just type in the word blue green pink
you can use hexadecimal color values
which are CSS type values and another
color value type you can use in CSS is
called RGB a which is red green blue and
alpha so you can set the red green and
blue spectrum to get any color you want
and then you have an optional alpha
setting so you can make it opaque if you
like then we have gradient and patterns
gradients are self-explanatory it
creates a gradient on the canvas and
then pattern will allow you to put
repeating image patterns inside of an
object as a fill so let's create a fill
style let's type in CTX dot fill style
equal to let's put green then let's
create a rectangle CTX dot fill rect and
will supply the XY width and height so
we'll put it in an exposition of 100 a Y
position of 100 and we'll make the Box
150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high and
like I said you can use hexadecimal
colors so any hexadecimal color that you
want to throw in there your box will
become that your fill style will become
that color using CSS type values we can
also grab this RGB a function put it
right in place there and let's set the
red green and blue to 0 0 0 and alpha to
1 now if I put 4 Green 200 here I'll get
a full green box now what if I was to
set the opacity to 0.5
now you'll see that my box it looks kind
of minty green now because it's half
opaque I can even take the opacity way
way down put it at point two now when
things slide around behind that fill
they'll be able to be seen behind it so
that's why it's handy to know how to use
the RGB a values okay so that shows you
how to use the color by its name
hexadecimal color or RGB a color now
let's talk about stroke style real quick
so we type in C TX dot stroke style and
let's just make that equal to red now
what this will do is affect the stroke
of our rectangle if we give it a stroke
so we can type in we can just actually
copy this fill rect line then under that
put stroke rect we're going to use the
stroke correct method again to put a
stroke around that box so now we should
get a red stroke around a green box and
let's put the opacity back to one on our
RGB a so we get a green box with a red
stroke and if you want to effect a line
width
before you put that stroke you can just
put it in CTX dot line width and we'll
be going more into line styles in the
next exercise but I just want to show
you real quick that you can make the
line width ten for that stroke if you
want it to be ten pixels wide so if you
look at that then you have a nice thick
line stroke so it's important to keep in
mind that your fill style properties and
your stroke style properties can be
given all of these types of values so
not only can your fill style have
gradients and patterns and all of these
other options but your stroke style as
well all right now I'm going to put
another comment in place that deals with
the gradients that way you can see what
kind of values that the gradients create
linear gradient method requires it
requires four values you put the X
starting position the Y starting
position the X ending position and the Y
ending position for your gradient screen
so if I take that line that gradient
let's put it in place above everything
else here and let's just name
g1 so if we decide to have more than one
gradient we can name the next gradient
g2 so for this first one I'll name it g1
for gradient 1 now what I'll do now is
draw a box my fill rect will be at 0 0
it'll be 200 wide and 200 high and let's
make my stroke match those dimensions so
since my box is starting at a zero
position X and zero position Y now I'm
going to make my gradient start at a
zero position x and y and make it end at
exposition at 200 and make it end at a Y
position of zero so now underneath
anytime you're going to work with
gradients you have to put color stops so
we use the add color stop method so
right under where I initialize the g1
the gradient one variable I'm going to
add color stop twice to that g1 variable
so I just say g1 add color stop the
first parameter is zero that's the
starting position for the gradient and
the ending position for the gradient is
a 1 so 0.5 would be the center and I'll
show you what I mean by that in a moment
and then all we have to do is take g1
and apply it to the fill style instead
of any color or whatever we just add the
gradient the linear gradient as g1 to
the fill style now let's see what we get
so we have a gradient that goes from
left to right now we're going to do is
add another color stop directly in the
center of those two existing ones and
we're going to put 0.5 or you can put
0.5 and that will target the middle of
the gradient and we'll make this yellow
and and here where I'm using these color
names you can also replace for hex and
RGB air so now if I test this you can
see I get a yellow portion added to my
gradient so now it has magenta yellow
directly in the center and then it Grady
eighths to black so you see how that
works you can add as many color stops as
you need within that gradient now if I
take this and have a ending position of
x and a ending position of Y of 200 here
that will make the gradient go from
to bottom so if I test the gradient is
now going from the top to bottom
now what if I actually move my box you
see where I have it at zero and zero
position what if I put it at 100 and 100
so let me put my stroke there as well
I'll take a look at what you get now you
can see that your gradient is determined
at the zero X and zero Y of the canvas
and not of your element or your object
that you're giving a fill to so you have
to account for that so to get that
gradient positioned correctly I can go
100 here I could change this to zero and
then it's the ending x position to 300
and that will let my gradient fit within
the fill like I want it to so your
gradients positioning has to kind of
correspond with your boxes or your
element or the object that you want to
fill its position all right I'm going to
put that box back at zero position for
its stroke and it's fill and then we'll
put these back to zero
and this back to 200 this will give us
the gradient back in the top-left corner
and I'm going to make my canvas a little
bit bigger now so I can put another box
in there let's make it 700 wide by 500
high now let's just grab all of this
code and we're going to go right
underneath it paste it in and this one
can change to G to create a second
gradient so all of these change to G to
anywhere you see G one right there make
our stroke stroke style green on this
one make the line with a little bit less
I'm going to change the colors to
something like pink blue to orange we're
going to position the box at an
exposition of 250 Y position of 0 and
the stroke same thing 250 and 0 and if
we keep the same positions for our
gradient as the first one you'll see
that we get unexpected results so now
let's test this in our favorite browser
so you see we don't get the gradient in
the box like we need to because it's not
positioned in the top left corner of the
canvas so we have to reposition this
gradient to fit where this box is so I
need to adjust those numbers
to account for the position of that new
box so if I test that now I get a
gradient that goes from pink to blue to
orange within that second box so your
gradients positioning has to be relative
to your boxes or whatever thing that
you're filling it has to be relative to
its position now we'll quickly
demonstrate how radial gradients work so
we're going to overwrite this g2
variable for a different one and this g2
variable is using the create radial
gradient method and here I'll put a
comment in the top that shows you all
the parameters that you need for that so
in this one you simply add the radius
values for your starting radius and the
ending radius so the X and the y pretty
much mean the same thing as in the
linear gradient then we're all three of
those values end the ending radius the
ending Y and the ending X go after the
starting positions in this one I'm just
using two color stops and I'm
positioning my rectangle in the same
position that I had the second one I
made just a little while ago so let's
see what we have so you can see we have
a radial gradient now that starts
magenta and goes to black now what if I
was to add this yellow color stop as
well to g2 in the point five position so
change that to g2 dot add color stop in
the middle position of the gradient
we're going to add yellow okay so that
takes care of linear and radial
gradients now we're going to discuss
creating pattern fills and you guys
should be good to go with everything you
need to know about fill and stroke
styles so outside of our draw function
at the very top of our script we're
going to put var leather we're going to
make that equal to a new image object
and this is how you can preload images
in JavaScript so after we have that
defined will type in leather dot source
is equal to the path to the image that
you want to use and mine is called
leather jpg you can use PNG and gifts
and whatever so I have my leather
variable and it's an image object
instance and it has its source set
already
so let's just go under these two and
we'll type in bar pattern or you can
name it p1 if you're going to have
several patterns equal to CTX create
pattern make sure you uppercase the P
and you open and close parentheses now
within the parentheses you're going to
feed it two parameters the first
parameter is to the image object and
ours is called leather that's my little
image that's going to repeat through
there and I'm going to set the repeat
which is going to be repeat X&amp;amp;Y so I can
just put repeat you can also use repeat
X repeat Y just like it works in CSS now
I'm going to take the CTX fill style
instead of the gradient fill I'm going
to put the pattern fill in this next or
my next rectangle okay so under that I'm
going to put in the rectangle and a
stroke around it now the reason why I
have gradient here is I want to show you
guys that you can use a I made my line
width 20 for this new rectangle and I
gave it a stroke style of g1 I'm showing
you you can use a gradient or a pattern
that you want for your stroke you're
lying your border around your boxes or
around your shapes any strokes or lines
now I'm placing this rectangle at a 0 X
position to 50 Y position so it'll be
under the first box and it's going to be
again 200 pixels high in 200 pixels wide
line width is 20 the stroke style
I made gradient one you can make it
gradient 1 or gradient 2 and my stroke
is going around that rectangle just like
before
now before we test this let me show you
what that leather JPEG looks like it's
just a 48 by 48 repeating background
pattern it's a JPEG
it's just 48 pixels by 48 pixels so now
let's see what we get if we render this
in our browser there you go now you can
see that gradient 1 was applied as a
gradient for the stroke of this box of
this rectangle and it's fill was given
the leather pattern so that shows you
linear gradients radial gradients and
pattern type fills on your fills and
your
ROK's okay that completes the fill and
stroke styles exercise and in exercise
number three we're going to tackle the
line styles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
