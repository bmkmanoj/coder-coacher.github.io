going to be all about smoothing for
flash actionscript 3.0 v map images this
lesson we'll go over smoothing dynamic
externally loaded images or images
imported to the stage and library in the
normal manual way and we're covering
this because it seems that a lot of
beginners in flash have a hard time when
they're resizing or rotating images they
happen to get a jagged or pixelated
effect to them whenever they're resized
if you put smoothing on it it fixes that
right up so whether they're rotated or
resized they look pixelated and messed
up you can put the smoothing property on
it and it'll fix that right up for you
okay we're going to first focus on the
the manual way that people can bring
images into flash which a lot of people
use is import so that's what I'm a to is
import to library I'm going to choose
this builder man photo and this is in a
folder I have here called as3 smoothing
images and inside that folder there's a
pictures folder with those two images in
and then the SWF which is my flash file
and I'll have the Fla in here too and
I'm going to offer this for download if
in case you guys want to get to see the
structure of everything and the actual
code in the file ok so let's go to
pictures import builder man and now he's
in the library now let's bring him out
to the stage you say see he looks
perfectly fine but now let me go ahead
and resize that let's get the tools up
here so say I just had it selected and I
wanted to resize it
you see those jagged edges on it now and
then say I rotate it just a bit still
has jagged edges on it so what I can do
is go into the library right click that
bitmap go to properties and you see
right here in that check box right there
allow smoothing go ahead and check that
and right when you do watch your image
cleaned it all up smooths it up real
nice that's ok now no matter what I do
to it it's nice and smooth and it looks
the way it should
without those pixelated edges ok now
we're going to show the code method just
in case some of you guys who are loading
external images happen to face these
problems of jagged edges and pixelated
images so let's just ctrl X get rid of
that in the library I'm going to remove
that from the library control X so now
it's an empty file again and it just has
some code on this layer here now this
would be code that you use to bring an
image in here's the loader and then here
is the on complete event that fires off
when the image is actually loaded in so
this is how we bring in an external JPEG
image or whatever and here you can see
I'm going into my pictures folder and
I'm loading in builder man JPEG and in
the oncomplete event when that image is
fully loaded in we're going to add it to
the stage and before we do we're going
to use bitmap that smoothing property on
that image so first let me press control
enter I'll explain the code in just a
second I'm going to press control enter
and you'll see what happens see how it
brings in that builder man photo and it
rotates it the code that we have set
here rotates it to the side and you can
see how pixelated it is very pixelated
and not good at all and you can see I
have my smoothing code commented out now
let's bring it back into play control
enter
and you see see we have a rotation set
on the loader of rotation property of
ten so it's rotating at ten degrees and
you can see how smooth it is here with
the smoothing applied so to get that
applied all you have to do is create a
new variable that's a bitmap out of the
loaded image which we use event that
target that content put the loaded image
into a bitmap and then once that bitmap
object is available we put that property
of smoothing equals true on that bit map
object and this is all normal stuff for
placing it and this is for adding it to
this or actually this is for the
rotating it and then this adds it to the
stage whenever this code is executed
that's when it gets added to the stage
so let's go ahead and uncomment that
again let's look at it very crappy and
pixelated no good at all now let's apply
the smoothing and it's much much much
better and this is a problem that a lot
of beginners face when they come into
flash since a lot of people who work
with flash deal with images this is
something that's very handy to know and
spread around to all your friends that
work with flash so there's both it both
ways the externally loaded images method
and the method for if they happen to be
in your library you can just right-click
them and go to properties and check box
for allow smoothing so once you learn
how to scale things correctly to the
desired size you want them to be and
then apply smoothing to them you want to
rotate them resize them whatever they'll
look great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
