here and today we're working in the
requested tutorial section at develop
PHP calm or Demian web asks what is the
best way to format text inside flash
easy update ability is important here I
was following a tutorial I found on
Google and an outlined a way to use HTML
tags in a text document and upload it to
your flash file bla bla bla didn't work
or at least I can't get it to work
all it does is display HTML coding as
well as my text no formatting whatsoever
so I responded with ok I'll make a
tutorial and I mentioned that I was
going to suggest make the field render
as HTML text within flash which is
probably what he's missing just that
little part but I decided that I want
this whole example to be archived at
develop PHP calm with the rest of our
working with external files in flash so
that's what we're going to be learning
today is how Dex
how to format external text with HTML
tags and then bring it into flash and
render it out with the with that
formatting in place ok so here on my
desktop I have a folder and inside that
folder I have my text file which is what
his text file would be like and inside
of the text file you can see I have HTML
formatting on that text now let's go
into flash and let's make it render out
correctly let's go ahead and close that
up I'm working in flash cs3 but you can
be in flash cs4 and cs5 and this
ActionScript 3 will work exactly the
same with the text field so let's create
a new ActionScript 3 project let's go to
file save as and let's put it in that
same folder and the desktop with that
txt file all this my flash file save ok
Dec 8 now let's create a new layer so we
have two layers on the top one let's
call this a s3 short for ActionScript 3
this one let's call this stage elements
I'm gonna put the text field there
let's go ahead and grab dynamic text and
let's put some text in it you can see it
sets a black and 12-point let's give an
instance name of my text underscore txt
we're going to make sure we use the HTML
property in the code on this text field
that way it properly renders all that
HTML text coming in alright so you set
the size or whatever and I'm also going
to show you how to use from the
components library this text area which
is a very easy way to get a nice
scrollbar on the text field in case that
happens to be a lot of text coming in
from that external text file it'll
automatically put the scrollbar on it
for you if it happens to be more text
than the fields can handle the fields
height can handle okay so we have an
instance name on this so our code can
communicate with this text field now all
we have to do is pump in the code so
let's go to the ActionScript 3 layer now
let's open our actions panel by clicking
actions here or the window actions or
you can just hit f9 okay so here's the
simple code that's going to bring in the
text file let me explain it real quick
first we create a variable called loader
and that's going to be a new URL loader
object and inside of that new you are a
loader object we have a new URL request
object and that one's going to be
calling in the external text file that I
was just showing to you guys that's in
the same folder as this flash file now
all we have to do is say loader that add
event listener event that complete and
that has a function that's going to fire
off when that event is complete the
loading of that text file the function
that fires off is named complete handler
so that function complete handler
sitting right there so function complete
handler runs and inside of it there's
two little lines and here I just added a
new URL loader object and I set it for
event that target which is basically
this text file
when
a text file is completely loaded in this
complete handler runs inside this
complete handler function we create a
URL loader object and we call it loaded
text and that gets the event that target
now all we have to say is my text on
school txt that HTML text equals loaded
text data which is the data from that
external text file you can see here I'm
using the HTML property of this dynamic
text field and that's going to be
essential here but what we want to do if
I had it like normal just HTML one
school txt text it's going to show the
tags and everything and we don't want
that so we want the HTML text property
set and then we'll display like we want
so let's see if it gives us the results
that we were looking for press control
enter or you can press f12 to publish it
out and there you go now you can see
that our link
I set a link here here are some texts
that I want a link on once it loads into
flash you can see that it's not blue or
underlined but it is in fact a link when
I click it it takes me to develop PHP so
I'll show you how to get that blue and
underlined okay let's go back into our
external text file let's find that link
there it is you see the a tag right
there so we can just grab the font tag
right there let's go over where the link
is a href right there right inside of
the link tag we're going to put this
font tag we don't want that sizing to be
any different but we do want the color
to be blue so let's just change this hex
value to a blue color instead of the red
now we're going to make sure we close
the font tag before the link tag closes
there we go and now we want to underline
it make sure it's underlined and blue so
we can just easily put in the underline
tag there and close that off as well
we're using regular HTML or running
press ctrl s to save it back in flash
let's render this out again see what
happens
ctrl enter you see now it's nice and
blue just like a regular HTML link would
be and it opens up to any webpage that
you want you can see this has a bigger
text in the heading this has a little
bit larger text and it's red because
that's what we assigned within the text
file okay so that's pretty much it now
in the flash file let's say you had a
whole lot of text and your text build
can only be that big
or maybe that big we press ctrl enter
you can see it's like it's it's no
scroll it's gone it'll scroll but people
won't know that it's scrollable they'll
just see that and they won't realize
they can stick their mouse in there and
easily scroll it it might not be that
intuitive for a lot of users so what you
can do is zap this out control X just
get rid of that field put in the
component of text area now watch this
let's make this I don't know
380 let's make this maybe about 180
let's give it the instance name my text
underscored txt which that the code is
communicating to bring the data into
press ctrl enter and you see there now
it's got a scrollbar
which is much more intuitive don't you
think yes and it can scroll with the
mouse just like that or they can drag I
think that's a lot more intuitive if you
happen to be working in a space or a
text field
doesn't have the height that'll that'll
hold all of the text that you want to
load in so that's pretty much all you
need to know about it so I'll have these
source files wrapped up in a nice
download package so you guys can get to
them and check it out
okay peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
