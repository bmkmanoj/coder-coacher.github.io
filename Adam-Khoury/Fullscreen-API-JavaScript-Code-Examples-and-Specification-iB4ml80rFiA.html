provide some code examples and reference
to the JavaScript fullscreen API and you
can learn how to implement fullscreen
toggle controls for the user into your
web applications in this first code
example we have a full document or a
whole web page that can go fullscreen
and the toggle button goes back and
forth in and out of full screen mode so
you can see it looks exactly the same as
it does in full-screen mode as it does
in the regular desktop mode but it has
the whole browser and the bottom bar for
your operating system all that gets
wiped out and the application takes up
100% of the real estate of the screen
now in the code example you can see
we're affecting the document body so
within this JavaScript toggle
full-screen function we're checking for
all the prefixes of the browsers to see
what request fullscreen method we have
to use and here's the standard syntax so
on the document body we run the request
fullscreen method and that puts the
document body in full-screen mode and
then we make the is fullscreen variable
true because that's a variable that we
created up top that has a default value
false so we just make that true
that way the application can remember
that we're in full-screen mode it's just
an easier way you there's other ways you
can script that out but I just thought
that was the easiest way and then I
changed a little bit of the rap there's
a a div wrap like a wrapper for your all
your content and we just adjusted some
of its CSS properties to match the
screen width and the screen height so
that's when it goes into full-screen
mode what comes out of full-screen mode
the other side of the toggle because the
first half of the toggle is if is full
screen variable equals false and this
variable is full screen if that happens
to be true then all of this code will
run and we have to check all the
prefixes once again for all the
different browsers
to get the cancel full-screen method you
know what I'm saying and then we can put
the rap back to its default CSS settings
for the with night that's when it comes
out of full screen mode and back to
normal mode you make the is full screen
variable false again and that's how your
toggle function runs and the DB variable
you know it's document.body because it
shows you right there and these specific
properties of the body are here in the
CSS just to make sure that it's in the
top left corner without any margin space
so remember when it goes into
full-screen mode you can do any CSS
adjusting to any elements that you have
in the page and there's also properties
because I'm going to lead you to the
documentation so if you see down in the
documentation when you're looking when
you're studying this page you'll see
that there's CSS pseudo selectors C for
the full screen mode and backdrop so you
can check that all out implement that
into your stuff I don't give a crap and
that specification that link I'm going
to lead you to has all the documentation
on how browsers should implement it into
their software and so it shows all of
the the methods properties so right
there here's all the properties
fullscreen enabled is a boolean true or
false
property then you have the fullscreen
element property and on fullscreen
change event and the on fullscreen ever
events so if you're familiar with
programming JavaScript those are two
events that you can tap into here are
two properties that you can tap into and
here's the exit full-screen method and
request fullscreen method so to go into
fullscreen we use request fullscreen to
come out of fullscreen we exit
full-screen and we can tap into any of
these properties and event handlers here
ok that's how you work alright so this
example that we just showed you here is
one that shows you how to make a full
web page or a full document
go fullscreen now maybe you just want a
single image to go fullscreen or a video
tag or whatever you want okay so here's
the first example that we started off
with and we're targeting the document
body but let's just make this target
something else for instance let's go
into the body and let's remove actually
will leave rap in place and everything
and then right under that h3 I'm gonna
add an image element I have an image
named poster one dot jpg and I'm gonna
give this an ID of whatever poo and I'll
take that ID and we'll just replace DB
and see if this works
instead of document body there will say
document dot get element by ID poo
actually we can send that string or the
object reference for that element
through the toggle full-screen method as
an argument but I don't want to change
much up and do much work just to show
you how you can target just a single
image on the page so let's see ah let's
just see what happens you see it made my
image fullscreen I'll just press escape
you can have a photo gallery that when
you click the image itself it'll toggle
full-screen now you can see you'd have
to change this up a bit more here let me
I'll change it to actually make more
sense for this example okay so what I
did was remove all of the CSS so it's
more like a normal document without any
initial CSS in it and I just put three
images in place and each has a toggle
fullscreen method or function being
called to run for its own click method
of the image so when the user clicks the
image will toggle full-screen send this
elements reference through that function
and we pick it up right here as LM so
here in toggle full-screen we're picking
up that argument as LM and we simply
changed
LM where we had document.body before
very simple huh okay and then I removed
the code that we had under these
variables changing here because we don't
need to change anything in a document
this can be sort of like an image
gallery of source so if I click one it
full screens that and I just hit escape
to full screens that one and I hit
escape actually I have to double click
those so let's remove this is full
screen and we don't even need this else
condition because they can just hit the
Escape key let's see is full screen to
remove that is full screen get rid of
that in this initial condition here
let's wrapped around that there we go
that should do it let's see what we get
one then escape three escape to escape
and you would have high-resolution
pictures there maybe mine are very small
images and so what you can do is have
high resolution images there or swap
these little thumbnails for a more high
resolution version right here in your
JavaScript function the thumbnail can be
swapped for a larger better more high
resolution image so right when they
click it'll go into full-screen mode
with a higher resolution version of that
image
soon between noon soon that's easier
that's probably the easiest way you can
make a photo gallery that has thumbnails
with large images because there's no
mechanism that you'd have to use to
display the large image they just click
it and it gets full screen then they can
escape okay so these are the two
examples that will have this one for the
little ghetto image gallery and then the
other one for the whole document full
screen example and we'll have that on
the page at the Vela PHP comm where this
video will be playing and then we'll
have this link for you as well that you
guys can go to to research it
depth the fullscreen API okay okay copy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
