tackling a JavaScript topic at the world
of web craft forums first we'll take a
peek at the forum topic second we'll
quickly take a look at the finished
tutorial example made to answer the
topic and then we'll begin the lesson
okay call rights hi all say you had an
image like this and it was a gift for
PNG so the white was transparent how
would you put an image of the website
behind it so it looks like it's on the
screen and change the image every 5
seconds using JavaScript don't really
want to use jQuery if I can help it now
so I just told call that it'd be nice if
I can do this tutorial on videos who
were to reach a wider group and he said
ok that's cool so that's why we're going
ahead with it now so we're making
something in JavaScript that's going to
put images on this screen like it was a
TV and they'll change every five seconds
now let's take a look at the finished
product of the little example
application that we created you can see
that in a div we are laying in our TV
graphics and then inside of that div we
have another div that's positioned with
CSS in such a way to where it looks like
it is the screen and I made it the exact
dimensions it should be to fit in as the
screen and I just gave it a little bit
of margin and padding to make everything
fit in there just right using CSS then
what I did was use JavaScript to put
contents of images on the inner HTML
property of that div and I set up a
little timer for every 3 seconds in this
example you can set it to 5 seconds 10
seconds 20 seconds or half a second if
you want now let's explain the code
alright within this application we have
our style tag here in the head tag of
the document which has the styling for
our TV and our TV screen divs so you can
see in the body section of the page I
have one div with an ID of my TV then I
have another div nested right inside of
that first div and that one has an ID of
my screen so my TV holds the whole
graphics for
your TV and then my screen is just to
section off the screen part of the TV
graphics now what we do is we use CSS
here and I'll show you that right now
for targeting the my TV and my screen
divs and applying CSS to position the
little square or the rectangle that's
going to be just the screen exactly
where it needs to go so what you do is
you set the width and the height
according to your TV graphics dimensions
and then you set the width and height
for your TV screen that you want laid
inside of the TV to be the screen part
now the border we don't need any border
so let me just remove that and you can
have a border attribute here on my
screen make it dashed and some bright
color if you want to see exactly where
that screen is positioned in there but
really you'll know where it is according
to where your images show up now the
margin left you see here on the screen
is to bring it off of the edge of the TV
graphics a little so it fits right in
the screen area where it should and the
padding top that you see here on the my
tv graphics is to allow pushing down
padding on the top of that div to push
down the screen a little bit to where
it's not on the top of the graphics and
it's laid right in the screen area where
it should be so you can adjust the
padding top and the margin left to move
the little box that is the screen inside
of the TV graphics anywhere it needs to
go to exact pixel locations you can see
I change my height a little bit to
offset the padding top so I just minus
20 pixels I subtracted 20 pixels from
this should be 184 pixels so I
subtracted my padding top amount of
pixels from my height of my div that way
everything was exactly the way it should
be and finally of course we put the
background image of screen jpg in the my
tv div which is the main div that holds
your TV graphics the whole TV and
remember inside of that we have another
div called my screen now we can talk
about the JavaScript since you fully
understand the CSS and
HTML that's happening there okay now I'm
going to collapse up the CSS we're going
to talk about the JavaScript now you can
see that my JavaScript tag is positioned
under my HTML elements in the page this
is not in the head tag and you can
adjust my JavaScript a little bit maybe
put it into an onload event for the page
and then that way you can have it up in
the head tag but since it's not in an
onload event yet and I just wanted to
make a quick example for you I just
stuck the script tag under the HTML
elements and this is acceptable and it
validates so everything is cool about
the way it runs just like I programmed
all right now let's open up this
JavaScript block here and explain it a
little bit in the first line we create a
variable called my screen and that's
equal to document get element by ID my
screen that way we can adjust its inner
HTML property very easily or any other
things that we want to do to it within
this little script so my screen remember
that's the div that's inside of the TV
div now my pix is a variable that is an
array it's an array of information and
you can put as many pieces of
information that you like within this
array this array just happens to hold
pictures names of pictures these can be
gifts or PNG s or JPEGs whatever you
want just put the picture name right
there along with its extension and you
separate each by comma and you can see
that each is encapsulated by single
quotes like I said you could put 40
pictures in there if you want and the
script will still perform the same way
because I set it up to be dynamic so the
next variable that we create within this
application is called total pics and
that's going to hold a number for how
many total pics that you've placed into
this array so if you place ten pictures
into this array that means this variable
total pics is going to be equal to ten
because we access the length property of
our pix array okay next variable we have
is called I and I is also a number and
that's equal to zero when the script
first begins now within this loop I is
going to iterate right here in this line
I plus plus that's an iteration of this
I variable that will make it iterate by
one it will increase by one each time
this loop passes so the first loop pass
it's going to be a zero the second loop
pass it will be a one then the third two
and so on and so forth and we set up
this is a tur within the loop just to
make sure that our loop will never try
to access an image that's not in the
array by never going beyond the array
boundaries we use this total pics
remember we use total pics to evaluate
to see if we've gone past that amount in
the array we want to make sure we bring
the eye back to zero
that way when when it gets to the end of
our this loop when it gets the end of
our array it doesn't keep trying to
select items that aren't there in the
array it goes back to zero which is the
first item within the array all arrays
start within index of zero so this item
in the array is 0
this item is 1 this item is 2 that's its
index number within the array because
all arrays start with an index by
default of 0 so now let's explain this
function called loop which is really the
magic of the little application this
loop is what allows it to swap out
automatically new pictures every 5
seconds now this first little bit within
the loop is a simple if condition that
evaluates if I is greater than total
pics minus 1 and the only reason I have
minus 1 in there is because total pics
is not going to really represent the
index number amounts in there because if
you have for instance if I have 3 images
right here my top index number in this
array is going to be 2 not 3 because all
array indexes default start with 0 so
this would have an index number within
that array of 2 so that's why I put
total pics minus 1 so if you have 10
pics in there you want total pics minus
1 here to make it 9 so for instance if I
is 10 you don't want that too
because there is no tent picture that's
why you shift I back to 0 if I is
greater than 2 in my case if you have 10
pics this will represent a 9 this little
equation so this will read if I is
greater than 9 shift back to 0 so we can
start at the first picture again all
right then we just have three little
lines left well really four lines now
this next line is we simply access the
my screen variable that we created here
that represents this div in the HTML and
we access its inner HTML property to
place some HTML into it in each time you
place new HTML into it using this method
it'll swap out the old HTML that was in
it for this new HTML so all you have to
do is put in an image tag each time
within the loop so each three seconds or
five seconds however long you have your
intervals programmed in the loop you pop
in new HTML within that div and I'm just
popping in an image tag now the way I'm
getting the particular picture that
should properly go in
within each pass of the loop is you
simply access the my pics array remember
my pics array right here and you put I
as the index to access because remember
I is always changing it starts at 0 and
it goes all the way up to the number of
total pics that you have within your
array so each time the array passes
remember the first time this is a 0 the
second time it'll be a 1 third time
it'll be a 2 and then that's really the
end of my array then it'll shift back to
0 in my case and i keeps increasing like
that by using this line right here which
is i plus plus which basically means i
equals I plus I and a shorthand for I
equals I plus I is I plus plus it's just
a way to increase by 1 each time the
loop passes now here we establish the
loop timer which is a mechanism that is
holding the set timeout method and the
set timeout method is a timing method in
JavaScript which will allow you to use
feed
and two parameters to it first parameter
is the function that you want to execute
when this timer is finished and these
are milliseconds this is the amount of
time that you want your timer interval
to be so if you want in 10 seconds you
would replace that 3 with a 10 since
those are milliseconds you want one
second you put 1000 seconds I'm going to
leave mine is 3 now since we have this
set timeout method running inside of the
loop function and the function that it's
calling is the loop function itself that
is how we set up the looping process so
this function will run and loop on
itself every 3 seconds now finally we
have a little line of code it just tells
the function to initially run basically
when the page loads
that's all this line is doing is telling
this function to start up now once this
function starts up it's not really going
to stop because we set it to loop on
itself every 3 seconds so every 3
seconds this function is going to run
then iterator I is going to change
that'll allow us to access a different
picture within our array and we've set
up this if condition to make sure that
our I variable never exceeds the total
pick index within our array and that's
how the whole application works okay
Karl I hope that helps you and I hope
you other guys get a little bit
something out of the workflow that we
went through and I'll have this code
available at develop PHP underneath my
video tutorial like always and I'll put
the link to it the code underneath this
video's description ok I hope you guys
have a fine day I died</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
