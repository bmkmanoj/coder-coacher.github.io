tip and code example is for those of you
who use lots of JavaScript on your web
pages and I think we can safely say that
that is most of us the thing is that
anybody can turn JavaScript completely
off in their browser making your website
look retarded and only have functional
okay here I am at develop PHP comm with
JavaScript enabled in my browser and it
doesn't matter what browser the user is
in they can turn off JavaScript in each
one and in the lesson I'll be using
Google Chrome but it's the same exact
kind of process in each different
browser but if you're using Google
Chrome you can follow my steps exactly
here alright so you can see the page
looks nice it has its animations there
in the header little rollover nice cool
things happening with JavaScript up
there it's got a nice JavaScript powered
search bar when you put your mouse in it
it turns a different color that's really
nice now let's see what happens we turn
JavaScript off completely so let's go up
here to the little wrench and you just
go find the internet options for your
whatever browser you're in go under the
hood press content settings and then go
here to JavaScript and click do not
allow any site to run JavaScript and
then close that if you're in another
browser that says apply or okay button
you might want to press apply so it
applies that setting okay with google
chrome you don't have to press it it
just does it okay now let's just refresh
the page now that I've turned JavaScript
off let's refresh it develop PHP and you
can see that I've lost my cool
animations up in my header up top I've
lost the Google ad that comes in so
there should be fallback content here
that I don't have in place there's also
no rollover animations lighting up my
buttons and when I click in here in my
search bar it doesn't light up the whole
rim around it my button doesn't have its
rollover effect but you can see my pages
still work pretty good and the site
still looks pretty good because I don't
over jQuery or over JavaScript my pages
because look if you click HTML you go
you start learning there's really
nothing that that is missing all really
so bad that would deteriorate the user
experience on my web site but some of
you guys you have to all these crazy
jQuery powered everything and nothing
gonna work on your website if you don't
accommodate with fallback content okay
now I'm gonna go ahead and turn it back
on under the hood content settings allow
okay and then I can go back to the page
and refresh and it'll all be running
again the way it should
everything's animated everything's
packed now I just wanted to show you
what that's like because I want some of
you guys who use heavy heavy jQuery on
your web sites you guys are almost worse
than the flash users with over animating
and over flashing things on your website
but I want you to turn off JavaScript
and view your website that has all this
jQuery powered everything on it and
you'll see that you almost lose the
entire ability to sometimes even
navigate the site view any content or
anything like that
okay now let's jump into the code this I
have named index underscore know
underscore JSA HTML that means index no
JavaScript HTML and that's where I'm
gonna send people who don't have
JavaScript enabled I can just pretty
much markup and layout my whole website
here all static with no JavaScript
animations or anything for those kind of
crazy users now in index.html we have
this code and I'm gonna explain it to
you real quick and this is just like the
bare bones in the skeleton of what you
would have in place to redirect the user
to this index nodejs page on your real
page where you have all your JavaScript
here which is gonna be probably your
index dot HTML one of the first things
you can do in your document before it
loads up first thing in your body tag
even in your head tag but if you put
this in your page what's gonna happen is
the people who have no JavaScript
enabled this no strip tag is gonna pick
them up first if somebody has JavaScript
enabled this will be ignored and then
the JavaScript user will see this so to
illustrate that let me go to file
preview in chrome it'll say hello
JavaScript enabled visitor but if I go
into the settings again and I go into
options and I change the setting for
JavaScript to not be enabled in my
browser we close that out same page
again let's go ahead and file preview in
browser Chrome it says no JavaScript is
placed into this version now what it did
since no JavaScript was enabled in the
browser the no script tag picked up that
that user does not have JavaScript
enabled so this meta tag does it refresh
which is pretty much a redirect meta tag
right when this meta tag gets recognized
by the browser in this process it's
going to send the person to whatever
page you designate or whatever website
you designate if you want to send them
to a different domain altogether and if
the person happens to have JavaScript
enabled like most normal people do this
will get ignored and then this will
process all your JavaScript beautiful
jQuery everything will work fabulously
and you won't ever have a problem with
anybody not having JavaScript enabled
because you're gonna send them to
another page that has no JavaScript on
it at all and the reason why I say that
this method is a little bit cleaner is
because in a normal page you might have
I see a lot of people putting no script
tags like 50 times in their page and
they'll have fallback content all up in
those script tags for the people who
don't have JavaScript enabled and I just
think it bulks folks up the HTML code
greatly it just makes the page have more
bytes to load into the browser when
honestly most people don't disable
JavaScript you really you shouldn't
really bulk out your pages like that
with the no script tag in it so much
when you can use this method to just you
know handle that 1 or 2 oddball users
there really it's gonna be dorks who are
worried about security that showed off
javascript it's not gonna be like the
masses the only people that know that
you can shut JavaScript off are techie
dorks so that's really the only people
you have to accommodate for and you
might not even want to accommodate for
them at all like a develop PHP I don't
care they can if somebody wants to shut
off JavaScript they're still gonna have
a good functioning site because I rely
mostly on HTML and CSS to power my user
experience so this is how it works you
use no script once in your page and if
that person happens to have JavaScript
disabled they get refreshed to another
page everybody else this gets ignored
and the page can continue like normal
you can do whatever your normal thing is
on your page</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
