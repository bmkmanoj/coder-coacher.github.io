learn how to build a friend system into
our custom community or social networks
or any website we have first will
briefly discuss the logic of what needs
to take place in the programming so you
have a clear-cut picture in your mind of
all the steps that need to take place
within the application and then after we
have the logic and the steps laid out in
our head then we'll lay out the
programming to make it happen in PHP and
MySQL will be using just a touch of
jQuery you can get at the source code
for all of this with web intersect com
version 1.3 2 will have this friend
system and tutorial at work inside of it
with well commented out code for better
understanding all right let's not waste
any time and let's explain how this
application will work ok this tutorial
is kind of breaking into new ground in
the lesson series so where we're going
to be learning about using arrays in PHP
during this lesson will also be learning
about using jquery ajax functions in
this lesson and it's going to be
practical applications of those
technologies so this way not only will
you learn those things you will have a
practical way to apply them to a real
world situation rather than just saying
oh that's how that's programmed you will
see it actually working in an
application that makes sense too and it
might be by the end of this tutorial
that your curiosity is sparked about PHP
arrays and you want to know more you can
go to develop PHP calm learn PHP section
there and I have a little section about
working with arrays in PHP that lays it
out in a common-sense way to show you
all the different types of arrays and
the array function reference list right
here now for jQuery if you don't know
how jquery's Ajax post functions work we
have an example here at develop PHP com
we're on the profile you'll see when
you're editing your profile let's say if
I go
info and i want to change down here
where it says lake toxaway to brevard
change my city now when I press Save
Changes it doesn't refresh the browser
page at all it uses see how it says
profile info updated and that goes away
the browser didn't have to refresh and
you can see my location has changed here
automatically it seems like it's
seamless and magic when you use jQuery
AJAX functions it makes it to where
things are seamless Facebook and YouTube
both use Ajax functions like mad you'll
see inside of your facebook account as
you do things and as you change things
sometimes the page doesn't refresh in it
loads the new data in in a magical sword
away so that's what you'll be learning
about will introduce you to jquery's
Ajax functions and PHP erase okay before
we get to any code and showing you any
of the programming of how it works let's
lay out the logic while member one is
logged in he goes to member to profile
we want to make sure that when member
one being logged in and goes to member
to his profile that he sees an add as
friend link in that profile if it
happens to be a regular visitor that's
not a member not logged in we will not
show that add his friend link or maybe
we'll show the add as friend link maybe
gray it out or we'll think of some way
to make it to where people who are not
logged in don't have access to make
friends with people who are members and
logged in so what we'll do is make sure
it shows an added friend link on the
profile using conditionals simple if and
else statements now what we'll have to
do for this particular system that I'm
going to build we're going to make a new
table that's going to hold MySQL friend
requests so when member one clicks this
link to add member to as his friend
we're going to put that pending request
into this
mysql friends requests table now this
mysql friend requests table that we're
going to create is not going to actually
hold all of the friends lists and
everything that's just going to be for
pending requests this way your system
stays a little more streamlined and it
doesn't get is clogged up with multiple
rows of data or maybe multiple fields
that are not necessary to be in a table
so what we're going to do is how's the
friends array we're going to have each
member is going to have a new field
created into their existing table so you
can see down here it says we add a new
field in our existing members table to
hold their friends array what their
friends array is going to look like is
something like this see those numbers
delimited by commas or they're separated
by commas that's an array it's an array
of numbers and what those numbers
represent or guess what member ID so my
member ID is one at the site so if I
click Add his friend for this member to
my ID is going to go into the pending
friend request along with his ID and
then he's going to get the option to
accept that friend request maybe he
doesn't want to be my friend so we're
going to give members the option to
accept friend requests in a list they'll
get a list of all the people who are
requesting to be their friend just like
Facebook or whatever or YouTube so when
member to actually goes to check his
list and confirm or deny friendship on
member one will get removed from that
table that way this table stays nice and
small all this table holds is friend
pending friend requests when a friend is
accepted or denied the row is removed
from this friend request table so let's
say member to accepts member ones
request that means member ones ID is
going to go into members to friend array
it'll be in this list of ID's that are
separated by commas which is going to be
an array that's going to be stored in
one field inside of our existing members
table that we have going already the new
table that we're going to add is simply
going to be for pending friend requests
you know all those different types you
can have in your mysql database we're
going to be using the text type for this
array that way you can hold a whole lot
of different friends with in that array
and using the PHP array like that it'll
give us a lot of flexibility when it
comes to popping people in and out of
those arrays and managing those arrays
so basically that's how it's going to
work and one more thing to note is that
we're going to program things in like if
member one requests member two and then
he tries to request member too again
we're going to have the programming in
place to where it's going to say you
already have a pending friend request
for this member please be patient as
that member needs to confirm all friend
requests blah blah blah and once they
are friends then you change the logic on
this add as friend link to be remove
friend so when member one goes to member
to his profile after they become friends
what he's going to see on this profile
is remove friend link when he clicks
that link he'll get the option to remove
that friend from his array or his friend
list and then once that happens both
members are removed from each other's
array and we will begin learning the
programming to make all this possible in
video number two of this little series
there should be just a couple of videos
in this series because i can't really
pack it all into one because we're going
to be going into PHP arrays jquery's
Ajax functions and all kind of nifty
stuff and I don't really want to speed
through it all I want to make sure you
guys grasp all of it if you're somebody
that does want to speed through it all
just get straight to the code maybe see
the comments in my code you don't even
have to watch these videos
you can go straight and get the source
package from web intercom version 1.3 to
when it's available so stay tuned for
building a custom friend system using
PHP and MySQL part tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
