jack-o'-lantern carving tutorial let's
take a look at finished product number
one that is made for a white background
that has like a white or a light ambient
light that's hitting the pumpkin from
the outside and we also have a version
where it make more sense to have a dark
meat to the pumpkin on the inside maybe
if you had a flame inside of something
like that and you would really want to
darken the whole pumpkin up you would
want to make the pumpkin darker and the
meat and then just put a nice soft
candle glow inside we will begin with
the vector style pumpkin we showed how
to create in the video we made just a
few days ago so you have two choices you
can either fullscreen this video right
now press the Print Screen key on your
keyboard and paste that captured image
in the fireworks you can just have an
open canvas and fireworks and paste it
right in using ctrl V V is in vector
control V will paste it in this way you
can take the easy way out and just use
mine if you want to get straight to
carving and you don't have a pumpkin yet
but I recommend path number two where
you watch the vector pumpkin video we
made just a few days ago to make your
own pumpkin to get to the point where we
are here ready for carving it you don't
want to be a pumpkin snatcher do you
okay let's get right to it pen tool
masters grab your pen tool don't grab my
pen tool hahaha okay let's start right
here what we're gonna do is let's just
let's just go wild and free and just
draw I'm gonna click down here then I'm
gonna let go and then I'm gonna click
down maybe somewhere up here to make
another point let go after I do a curve
I'm gonna hold down and let go after I
create the curve I want right about
there looks good then I'm gonna click
down on that point to make a sharp edge
come down to maybe write about heal and
then I'm going to hold down click hold
down make the curve I want there once
again then I'm gonna click down here to
make a sharp point on that last point
then where we meet up I'm going to click
down and hold and then I'm going to drag
to make the shape I want for the bottom
of my eye maybe right there it looks
good to me now I can fill that in just
fill it black
and if it has a white edge or any kind
of edge on yours you can remove it that
way you wind up with something that
looks like that
and you might see some people making
something like this and they will just
draw two eyes a nose and a mouth with
regular plain black shapes like that
without going the extra mile like we're
going to go in this video we're gonna go
the extra mile and make it look he'll
have really good depth perception and a
3d observation type thing going on now
at any point throughout this whole
process you can highlight your little
shape that you're working on and hit the
sub selection tool highlight a point and
then you can maneuver these edges maybe
I want to bring that up a little like
that or leave it like it was it doesn't
matter okay so if it's not perfect when
you draw it out you can manipulate it
afterwards now let's grab a regular
pointer to it again and highlight this
black shape let's hold down the ctrl key
on our keyboard and mouse wheel mouse
wheel up that way you zoom in right
about there looks good and now you can
just hit the white area over here to
deselect everything and we're gonna grab
our pen tool again now what you're going
to do here is really set the depth of
the meat of your pumpkin so let's click
down right about here let go then let's
come down to somewhere around this
region right here in the black area
maybe right about there click down and
hold and drag until you meet the contour
of that other line the outside black
line to the right then you can let go
click down on this point to make a sharp
corner point then let's go right about
here almost to the point of this one but
a little bit up right about there click
down hold and drag make another contour
to match that let go click down on this
point to make a sharp edge and come
right about here click down then let go
and then come right about here click
down and hold drag make that contour
match then let go once you have that
contour matching then click down here on
this point to make a sharp corner point
come up to the top
click down again hold drag you guys
should be awesome with your pen tool by
now click down and make a sharp corner
point and then come down here and close
that shape off now you can see that
black shape I'm going to turn it maybe
this bright color right there now you
don't want to leave it yellow like that
because that's terrible but you want to
make sure that the black shape behind
here is fully covered by this shape so
let's you can see a little black on my
edge down here you see that that's no
good
so I'm gonna grab these points at any
point you can grab the sub selection
tool and use your keyboard to just move
these by the pixel or you can just grab
them and move them like this you see I'm
gonna move it with my keyboard because I
like the pixel precision once I
highlight a point I like to move it with
my keyboard and it goes pixel by pixel
this one I'm gonna move down and that
looks like everything's in place there
let's move this one down so let's grab
the subselection tool make sure that
it's nice and neat perfect and this one
needs to go up to cover that just so
everything is perfect now we can zoom
back out by holding the ctrl key and
mouse wheeling down and now I'm going to
grab this object the yellow object there
and let's just make it white for now
really we're gonna change the color and
give it a really good pumpkin meat color
in just a second but I'm going to
manipulate that just a little bit you
get the sub selection tool and bring
this one in this way a little right
about there and down a few pixels like
that and even over here this one I'm
gonna move that in a little bit right
about there
now at this point to make life easy I'm
just gonna set up some colors like I did
last time which like I mentioned in the
last video where we made the pumpkin
that you can save these to your color
palette if you go here you see down here
you can save colors
okay so let's one two circles that's
really all I need and the first one I'm
going to make or the second one rather
I'm going to make this dark pumpkin
color down here where it's all shadowed
and actually I'm gonna make it just a
little bit darker so I'm gonna go to
color wheel pull that down
okay that's good now this one I want to
make my pumpkin meat color the color
that's going to be this inside kind of
that bevel look that bevel color on the
inside and we're gonna have to give that
a gradient so that's why we're setting
up this other color so this one you can
you can set the color of this circle to
maybe this yellow here this bright
yellow and then go and manipulate that
hit the color wheel and make it a little
more orange and we're also going to make
it much brighter so you see I have it
looking gold and now I'm gonna bring it
up right about there looks good to me
okay and that's going to be the color of
the meat of my pumpkin okay now let's
bring this thing to life and give this
good depth perception so let's highlight
this white shape that we created here
we're going to go to gradient linear
once it has a linear gradient on top
where it's black we're gonna change that
black to this dark brown and we're gonna
change that white to this fleshy color
and there you go you manipulate that
gradient any way you need to now I can
zoom in and I can put a line there if I
want just grab the line tool right at
this point to this point somewhere in
there you can put a line and you can
make that line any color you want so
I'll match it up to this color right
about here and you can see what that'll
do is give me kind of like the look of
an edge there if you want it's really
not a necessary thing but I think it
adds another level of 3d to that edge
but you can see how it is without it you
see and with it it just gives it another
level of depth and realism now let's
complete this I what we're going to do
is grab an ellipse I'm going to draw it
right in about there looks good to me
and let's give it a fill color of this
yellow and let's make it have no edge
and let's pop it in place wherever we
feel like it's a good spot for the eye
now what we'll do is highlight that
which is already highlighted will also
hold shift and highlight this black
shape behind it
go to modify combine pats and punch
makes it look like somebody went with a
knife and left that shape in the pumpkin
for an eye
okay I'm gonna add one final touch to
this eye I'm gonna highlight the black
shape when I go down to filters and
let's add a drop shadow and make it go
only maybe three in depth let's turn the
angle to be maybe 120 and you can take a
look at what it does it just kind of
rounds that top off a little bit and
that's a little bit heavy so I'm gonna
bring it down to write it there and
three now let's look at it so you kind
of just rounds it off a little bit
make sure the angle is such to where it
doesn't look funny on the left edge of
the eye and that's going too far it has
to be two maybe even one yeah two is
good it's very it's a very subtle effect
but it's one that I want because you can
see how it looks now let me take the
effect off see it's very subtle and I'll
turn it back on now you can see that
there's a slight improvement in just the
look and the feel of things now at this
point you have to decide do you want the
other eye to be perfectly symmetrical
and even with this one so you can repeat
the process that we just did to create a
whole new shape maybe you want to I
that's a little more narrow or you mean
to make an eye that's a little wider
than this one so you can repeat the
process for the other eye but what I'm
gonna do is highlight all of these items
that little line that and this so
there's those three items I have
selected I'm gonna group those ctrl-g
I'm gonna select the whole thing make
sure I have the group selected ctrl-c
ctrl-v then I'm gonna go and flip
horizontal now I can take that and put
it into place just use my arrow keys on
my keyboard or you can drag it and get
it to where it looks about even with
that other one right about there it
looks good now the nose is simple we can
just grab the pen tool and right about
here I'm gonna click down then I can
just make any shape I want and I don't
really want it to be a perfect triangle
so I'm gonna make mine a little odd
shaped kind of like that maybe and I can
adjust those points at any time what I'm
gonna do is gradient that one on its
fill linear remove the edge we want no
edge we want it to be dark on top and
light on the bottom actually I'm bring
this point down just a little bit right
there all right about there now very
quickly you can just repeat the process
and draw another triangle on the inside
of that one watch right there and you
were right about there right about there
and right about there and I have that
point selected so I move that point up a
little bit and let's make that one solid
black solid black let's make this linear
a little bit darker so you can just drag
that down like that actually let's make
it not so deep I'm gonna zoom in just
these points a little bit right about
there and now this one you can give it
an outer glow filter effect of glow and
just make it a dark this color right
here and then bring it down to zero then
bring this down to maybe six and let's
take a look at what that does it's very
good now you can add some lines remember
this line we put in for the eyes you can
do the same thing for this so zoom in
grab your line tool just go from here so
there and you have to drag when you make
a line you have to click hold and drag
and then let go wherever you want it to
end the line so let's make those a
little bit darker than the color space
that they're in now so let's make that
about this color and let's see what that
does that's good I'll make them a little
bit darker there that's nice sometimes
subtlety is key and this triangle I need
this gradient darker on top I don't know
why it's so light this needs to be this
dark color and this is I think that's
white let's change it to the meat color
oh that's so much better I don't know
what I was doing there oh my god
can't believe you guys let me through
that that really looks a lot better you
can even make these little lines a
little bit darker
you've gotta pay attention to detail
boys and girls okay now let's just draw
a simple mouth with the pen tool any
kind of shape you want I don't care you
can make it crazy and creative go nuts
with it let's grab that and I'm gonna
make mine a little bit wider right about
there
bring it down just a little bit to right
about there
now highlight the mouth and we're gonna
make a copy of that press ctrl-c ctrl-v
you can see I have two now there but
don't move it if you move it press
ctrl-z to undo that leave it exactly
where it is and you're gonna leave that
one black and what we'll do is highlight
it go to the scale tool bring it to the
bottom up just a little bit on that now
what you want to do is get the meat on
the bottom here and make that a gradient
am i doing gradient linear and give it
the colors that we designated here dark
brown on top and the light flesh color
on the bottom now what we're gonna do is
move this around let's scroll in a
little bit or mouse wheel in and zoom in
by holding ctrl and mouse wheel and
let's size this down just a little bit
like that now you see what that does
it really gets it in there better so
it's not sticking out over the top you
know what I'm saying
and you're gonna want to manipulate
looks like that edge on top just a
little bit so let's go to the sub
selection tool click this and manipulate
that edge right there that looks pretty
good so you see what I have now I can
simply grab my pen tool and draw in some
teeth maybe right let's start right
about here I'm just gonna do like a
Dracula vampire teeth so it's good
scary-looking right about there that
looks good to me and I'm gonna make that
white so you can see it really good and
I'm gonna press ctrl-c ctrl-v so I have
two copies of that there but don't move
that second one just highlight one of
them the one on top and highlight this
black shape go to modify combine paths
and punch now highlight the second white
shape and then the meet
behind the black shape so you have those
two selected now modify combine paths
and punch so basically what I did was I
put down two little triangles and I used
them to punch one first into that shape
and then I punched into that shape I'm
gonna do the same process for this tooth
here now once you have that in place you
can also manipulate these points at any
time if you want to zoom in
hit your subselection tool grab that
point right there move it anywhere you
want say you wanted it more in there
like that and you can show a little bit
of meat in there you see what I'm saying
so now let's grab and I'm moving the
points on this black shape by the way
I'm gonna do the same thing to this edge
let's show some of that meat not too
much but you definitely want to have the
teeth have a little bit of depth
perception to them as well you know what
I'm saying you don't I'm saying you know
I'm saying let's take a look at that
let's see what we got that looks pretty
good and you know what I'm gonna grab
this subselection tool for that point
there and move that up a little move it
over one pixel right there perfect and
then I'm going to grab these two shapes
that we just drew in for the mouth you
can see it's just those two shapes
sitting there it almost looks like a
cowboy hat huh ha ha and let's just
group those you can work on them further
and I'm gonna make mine a little bit
taller so I can just stretch it like
these you see that if I want to I'm not
too close to the nose there now I'm
gonna highlight it I'm gonna go to
filters and I'm going to give it a drop
shadow make sure it's on the top make
sure the drop shadows 90 degrees so it
goes up and let's make it maybe 3 make
it this brown color a dark brown bring
this down to 3 and let's actually bring
this down a little more maybe 2 and this
would be better
make this a little darker so let's see
what that gives us that's all right
that's not so bad
see if I make it darker all right that's
better and I'm gonna move my nose a
little bit up so I grab all four of
these items by holding shift as I select
them and control G group that whole
thing and move it wherever you need it
if you want to move your eyes up
actually I'm gonna move the points on
this shape a little bit because I don't
like how I think it's too much meat
showing there yeah that's better now I'm
gonna show you quickly a variation
before we end the video I'm gonna
highlight everything go to my normal
selector tool highlight everything press
control C go to file new just make a new
file that's okay
pop it into place all those things you
copied and what we're gonna do is select
the subselection tool that way we can
get into these groups you can see if I
try to use my normal normal pointer and
I click this it selects the whole group
that's not what I want so I'll grab the
sub selection tool and I'm gonna grab
just that item just this item press
shift to grab them together and this one
and the nose just those gradients and
since they all have the same gradient
color I can easily change that to this
side I'm gonna make let's see let's make
this side very dark brown and then this
black now let's grab these little lines
and change the colors on those as well
and these and you can see that when it's
white this one makes a little more sense
again and this one is a little bit
doesn't make any sense because the meat
on a pumpkin is not that dark if you're
in a nice ambient lit area I just wanted
to cover that because some people might
be saying out over there those are
really your meats really not the right
color of every breath you can make you
meet any color you want I'm just showing
you the differences in the way things
look on different color background so
you don't I'm saying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
