important related news about two months
ago I heard that Google is going to
begin ranking SSL secured websites
higher than non SSL sites but I wanted
to wait and do more research to see if
it was true before reporting on it to
you guys and it turns out that it's true
and I just want to quickly make sure
everybody's aware of it so Google is
going to begin ranking SSL secured
websites
higher than websites that have no SSL
certificates an SSL secured website is
when you pay for an extra certificate to
enable HTTPS in the URL addresses for
the site pages and you can purchase a
certificate directly through your
hosting provider and they'll apply it
directly to your website and when it
comes into effect you'll get a very
lightweight advantage initially the
existing other strong factors weigh more
heavily in your overall rankings but
Google may decide to strengthen the
amount of ranking increase that SSL
delivers to a site owner at any time
that they see fit so they could make it
to we're having an SSL web site gives
you a much stronger increase in ranking
and indexing and relevance but in the
onset it's going to be a very light
weight advantage that you would get from
having an SSL certificate applied now
here are some handy tips if you decide
to go for the SSL ranking boost in
Google search engine for your website
the first thing is you'll want to
research the different type of SSL
certificates that you could apply to
your server because there's many
different types and levels of SSL
certificate which have different
security features and whatnot so
research all the different types of SSL
certificates that are available another
important thing is to use relative links
and URLs to files and resources that
your SSL secured pages would call in so
for instance images and other files
your page relies upon you want to make
sure that you just use relative links to
all of your external resources like
images JavaScript files style sheets and
stuff like that
now one more final important thing when
you do switch over to SSL secured
website you'll want to add an Apache
rule or some kind of server directive to
force HTTPS in the URL web address of
your site pages all of your site pages
and it can be done with one htaccess
rule or one apache directive so
basically if anyone tries to access your
pages without HTTPS in the URL
maybe they try to remove the s you don't
want to make sure that the server forces
HTTPS into the address bar through
redirection so once your site is as
ourselves secured just make sure that
nobody can remove the s from the URL and
access your pages in that way make sure
that the only way they can access your
pages is with the s in the URL now I'll
give you my personal feelings on the
matter I personally feel that all site
owners will strongly desire the ranking
and indexing benefits that an SSL
secured site now offers it's not going
to make much sense to give any boost to
any site owners once all sites are SSL
secured so perhaps Google wants all
sites to be SSL secured from now on so
this move is to assure that that begins
now and the transition happens quickly
maybe they just want every site from now
on to be SSL secured which in the end
when all sites are SSL secured it will
be an obsolete feature so I honestly
have no idea how they're justifying the
algorithm within the grand scheme of
their search engine service it almost
seems like when all sites on the web are
ssl secured and it becomes the standard
thing they may as well remove the SSL
boosting algorithms altogether and go
back
to true search engine results based
solely upon content quality popularity
and all of the good factors that make up
a nice search engine so let me know your
theories or concerns if you have any on
the matter I'll be reading all the
comments you guys leave under the video
talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
