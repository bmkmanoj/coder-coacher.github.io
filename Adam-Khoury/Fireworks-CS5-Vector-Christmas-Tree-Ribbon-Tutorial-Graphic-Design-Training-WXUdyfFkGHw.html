good friends and today we have for you
another Mary Black the Christmas
tutorial and this one is being made
mostly in part because at the world of
web crafts David sculpted great
Christmas graphic tutorials there he was
talking about the ornaments we made and
he said just an idea for a video have
you thought about designing a Christmas
tree in fireworks so that's mostly why
we have this tutorial being created
right now for this Christmas tree it's
just a really cool effect and I thought
you guys would dig it and you can get a
lot of workflow design tips and
fireworks by watching me produce this
thing in real time
create new fireworks document mine's
gonna be 1,000 wide by 550 high
resolution 72 and that's good to the web
good enough
so opera's okay you can change your
canvas color down here but I'm going to
be working on a white canvas and go
ahead and hold down on the rectangle
tool if you happen to have the rectangle
showing hold down on that and you'll see
all the different shapes you can draw
out when they grab the star and I'm
going to drag and draw that out right
there
then I'm gonna grab the points and make
sure it's only three so I'll have a
perfect triangle see the points I'll
just make sure I'm down at three I'm
gonna go to the scale tool I'm gonna use
this triangle to be the form really the
guide for my tree shape so I can draw my
ribbon in more easily and it'll help me
visually stay within a nice triangular
shape you can make that any size you
needed just by scaling it and if you
want to see those little tiny tooltips
you can go up to view tool tips and make
sure that's selected then you'll see
those numbers that you see when I drag
things those little numbers on the sides
if I drag this up you see those numbers
the width and height that's the tool
tips enabled so you can make yours fat
or skinny whatever you want so I'll grab
it I'll put it right in the center dead
center now throughout the video you
might see me zoom into my canvas like
such zoom in and out and I'm doing that
by holding down ctrl and mouse wheeling
all right now I'm gonna grab my pen tool
I'm gonna click down right here on this
edge then I'm gonna come up just a
little bit to give it an angle right
about there on that edge you can choose
any angle you want and you can make your
ribbon shaped any way you want we're
gonna go right about here click down and
then just kind of keep those two lines
parallel the angle on those two lines as
parallel as you can with your eyeball
then we're gonna give it a green fill
maybe a little lighter green right there
I'm going to take that black edge off
now let's draw the next one I'll start
right about here and at any time I can
move any of these points so it's really
not detrimental if I put something a
point in the wrong spot or I draw
something in the wrong place I could
just move it around it's no big deal and
I can make these as tall as I need them
as they're going up I'm going to
gradually make them just a little bit
less high okay we can start connecting
some of these back parts of the ribbon
so you can start at any point that you
want along these four points here 1 2 3
4 so I'll start at this bottom one and
I'll click let go
click down let go here click down let go
here and then click down let go here and
then just connect the shape to finish it
off and we'll make this a little bit
darker green and I'll send that to back
control shift down arrow key and the
reason why it disappeared is because my
triangle has a white fill and I'll just
make it no fill I'll draw and the others
real quick here click down here then
I'll click down here click here let go
click here let go click here let go and
give it a fill to match this color no
edge if it happened to have a white edge
whatever and then send to back control
shift down arrow key we can adjust those
points if we need to and we are this one
here is sticking up a little bit so
we'll fix that everything all right let
me get my last one in
click here let go click here let go
click here let go click here let go and
then finish off the shape give it a fill
no edge and then send to back now let's
take a look at this one up here we'll
make it a little bit smaller by grabbing
the subselection tool bringing these
points down a little bit so it's not so
tall but still keeping an angle on it
then we can adjust the points on that
one bring that down a bit
bring this over one and just make it to
where this one's not showing behind the
other one at this point you can just
move your triangle if you want get it
out of the way adjust these points to
where everything looks real nice and
sharp this point on that one in the back
needs to come down one even maybe one
more
maybe this point come down a little okay
now let's shape the bottom so we'll grab
the pen tool just click down at this
point right here click down here and let
go and then make this one just go
straight up click down let go and then
click down here and let go and once you
have that piece draw it in you can send
it to back by pressing ctrl shift down
arrow key let's grab the pen tool again
the next shape is going to start right
here so click down at this point let go
then maybe come to right about here
click down let go give it the angle that
you want want mine right about right
about there I'll click down let go click
down here let go
then click down here and this one I'm
going to give it a solid color
this lighter front color you can see
what that does
let's move it over one
my tail looks good okay now we'll put
one more last little fold down at the
bottom here so let's click down here at
this point and right about there and
then angle it back up just a little bit
and then connect it at the bottom put
your pointer tool highlight it control
shift down arrow key we'll send it to
back and we have no more use for this
triangle so I'm just gonna press control
X and get rid of it okay now to make
this look a little more genuine we're
going to put some gradients on it and
we're gonna make sure that we unite or
combine some of these shapes all your
bright shapes all of your front-facing
ribbons highlight all of those by
holding shift and you can select them
and highlight them all together once you
have them all highlighted you go up to
modify combine paths and union now
they're all one piece or one path but
don't move it to leave it right where it
is then you're gonna highlight this back
piece this back piece this back piece
this back piece and this back showing
peace once you have all of those legs
you go to modify and combine paths and
you're gonna Union those as well so now
you have two different adds one for the
front and one for the back so get these
gradients now more easily now that
they're all one piece so let's select
the front facing ribbon go to its fill
selector gradient and we're gonna select
cone now cone is the best option for
this because our shape happens to be
triangular and I'll show you what I mean
right there if you put it right there it
doesn't look very authentic because it
just looks like there's a nipple or a
point coming straight out at us right at
that point right there and that makes no
sense
or even if you put it up there that
makes little sense but what you can do
is put it at the very top where your
triangle would be and then you can
rotate this guy around
that but what you do is you go into the
cone gradient color and then you move
the green in so you see that see as I
move the green in that'll allow me to
get more of a tight gradient line and
then I can just wheel it around like
that to get any light direction that I
want and where it's white I really don't
want it white I want it to be a very and
let me go into my color selector right
about there that light green very light
green okay instead of white and I can do
the same thing to the back go to its
fill gradient cone move it up to the top
where it would be at the very tippy top
point to be a triangle and you can move
this around just like we did the other
one but this one you're gonna make dark
where it's light and where it was dark
we're gonna make that a little bit
lighter or a very light color like that
this one we're going to darken it may
get a very dark green okay then we can
bring in the bright green like that and
then you can rotate this to make it look
any way you want see that you make it
look like that or you can highlight
again rotate it around make it a little
darker like that whatever you want to do
but now it has a more authentic
curvature to my ribbon in the front and
the back or the front face of the ribbon
and the back base of the ribbon the back
base would be I guess inside the cone
I'm gonna use a dingbat font so I'll go
to my text tool and I'm gonna make sure
let's type in a couple of things to make
sure we can see that make it a green
color
and we'll change it to and if you want
to download this font
it's called WWF lakes and it's all kind
of cool snowflakes so if I type in Q W
er T why I you see it gives me all kind
of little designs for different
snowflakes and I can turn those into
paths if I want so it's not text anymore
it would be paths at that point like any
other shape so I'll just get the one
that I like or one that I want to start
off with because you can change it up
easily after you set the first one up
like say for instance I have this one
sitting here and I want to press ctrl-c
ctrl-v and make a copy and then I can
just change this to a D or my keyboard
or a J but first you'll want to get the
effect that you want or gradients that
you want upon these little snowflakes it
looks like I have to move this point in
you see this one showing a dark edge on
this edge right here so I'm gonna go to
subselection tool highlight the back of
the inner part of the ribbon to move
those in just a little bit move this one
down
right there looks like this one is a
little bit showing as well there we go
now with this little guy I'm just gonna
go ahead and change his bill color
change the fill options down here go to
fill options gradient and then change
the linear to radial or whatever type
you like and now you can have fun
sprinkling those about and if you happen
to change any of these like say if I put
one here and I change it to that right
there and I make it bigger
maybe 67 just remember you have to
change your gradient to match okay like
that this one should come out more like
that you just sprinkle those about and
you can just keep going through there
with your snowflakes so you wind up with
something like this I just made a
variety of sizes and chose different
snowflakes and this one is also part of
the bond and I thought it would be
perfect for the top of the tree so what
I'm gonna do is make a little more room
on my canvas canvas size I'll go to
maybe 750 okay and now I have room at
the top so I'll make that a little bit
bigger
right about there put that in the center
and bring this down and then make sure
it's sent to back if you have yours on
the front like that you can leave it on
top if you want actually that looks
pretty good like that or you can send to
back control shift down yeah I'm going
to send mine to back and now for the
finishing touch is will put a little
shadow underneath so grab an ellipse let
make it maybe around that big like that
and you can just make this solid this
dark green color would work right there
and then we can go to blur Gaussian blur
blur it real nice okay and then bring
the opacity down right about there and
if that's on top of everything make sure
you send that to back like that and then
bring it down and put it where it looks
like it would be a nice shadow for that
illustration okay so there is the
completed vector Christmas tree hope
you've enjoyed that one and hopefully
we'll have some more vector Christmas
tutorials coming before it gets too
close to Christmas if you guys happen to
have any requests let me know I was
thinking about doing maybe some
peppermint candy canes red ribbons
presents gift boxes I don't know so you
guys just let me know what you want to
see and we'll bang it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
