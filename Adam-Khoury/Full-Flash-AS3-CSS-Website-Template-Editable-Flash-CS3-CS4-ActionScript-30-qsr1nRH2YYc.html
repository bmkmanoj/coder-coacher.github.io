here and I have a special surprise for
you this is one that I had at the site a
long time ago I'm not a long time ago
but we had a source box in it was in
there for a little while a couple of
people downloaded it enjoyed it so i
figured i would rerelease it to the
crowd here at YouTube and you guys can
come to develop PHP and download it free
and it has a it's a full flash
actionscript 3 template for cs3 and cs4
and what it has is a cool button menu
system that shows my menu marker method
it's one of my methods that are used for
menu mar kering and what menu mar kurung
is is if they're on that specific page
it makes the button a different color
and it cannot be clicked again so menu
mark marker ring is pretty cool in flash
and lets people know exactly where they
are on your site and they cannot react
sess the page if they're already there
because that doesn't make any sense
because they're already there and so
that's a really cool thing you can do in
flash you can also do it in HTML if
you're slick but it's easy and flash and
there's also a little cool beam or bar
that you see that I put there that goes
and it's adjacent to the button menu
that will show you show the user exactly
where they are as well in your menu
system what else we have cool animated
header also man emissions going on in
there glint effects sparkle effects
we've got in there all kind of cool
stuff spinning globe each page is ready
to go with a really cool masking
transition animation using simple
rectangles you can also use circles and
stuff in there what else should I tell
you about oh it has a transparent
background the whole flash file and it's
sitting on a beautiful CSS like
operating system style desktop wallpaper
type background that I made in fireworks
cs4 so you get the free CSS the free
coding for having the CSS a transparent
background on your flash file the free
editable flash template
as what more could you ask for it now
I'm going to walk through the file with
you so makes it this more of a tutorial
and you can get a little bit of insight
into the editable flash file that you
would get and the source files in the
package
okay so when you download the free
package and you extract the zip file to
your desktop or wherever whatever
location you want to extract it to you
open that folder you'll see there's a
folder inside of it called root and that
would be your root directory your main
directory of your website click inside
of it there would be your index file and
all that good stuff that would normally
be in a root directory of a website and
we have a style folder which is for your
CSS background and there's that
background file I was telling you about
it's really pretty looking background
that I made kind of Windows Vista ish
but it was made custom by me and
fireworks so you can don't worry about
it you can use it free whatever take it
into fireworks change the colors on it
change the hue and all that good stuff
and we have the what we have here is the
AC run active content file which is the
default file that flash outputs when it
when you publish for allowing it to
render correctly in the browser and then
we have the flash Fla file the flash swf
file which is the swf version of the
movie without the background and all and
then you can just double-click this open
it in flash and let's go ahead and do
that mine's going to open in cs3 because
I have cs3 set to open default all my
flash files I have cs4 as well but i use
cs3 more even still let's cs4 is out i
use cs3 more okay
so now once it opens up we can let's
take a look at this thing
oh and before we talk about that the
last file that I didn't explain was this
index file which will hold the website
and it has the CSS let's open with
Dreamweaver index file let's grab that
open it up and look at it okay so we
have the index file holds the script the
JavaScript for the AC run active content
script there for whatever a CFL run
content script and then here's the
object file for the flash and you can
see we have CSS up in the head section
and we define that background in the
style folder to be attached to in this
file and all your all your pages in your
site can have that background if you
want to have another page that doesn't
have the flash file on it just put this
in the file and you'll have that
background on that page too ok so that's
really is you see it's very basic it
just holds the flash file and has a
little CSS that I put it in there for
having the background and you can see
we're set to transparent in the window
mode say transparent window mode
transparent window mode in all
parameters okay that's enough of that
let's talk about the editable flash
source file now
okay I tried my best to make it
intuitive as as intuitive as possible
and I know a lot of template monster
files or flash files are hard to edit
you might look inside the Fla and you'll
just be lost with the way the program is
set it up because template monster wants
you to go back and spend an extra couple
of grand and have it edited to your
specific needs by the programmers there
that's how they get you yeah you can buy
a fit 60 bucks and it's editable but
when you go to edit it they make it you
know so complex in object oriented
sometimes even to where you can't even
understand it a beginner cannot even
understand it so I set this one up to
where it's a little more intuitive than
a one of those kind of templates just
because you know we're all about
learning and teaching at develop PHP so
if you go you'll see we have actions
here for loading the moving this is it
all has a preloader and everything you
see these elements down here that's your
preloader bar that way if you have a lot
of things on your pages in your movie
all throughout these pages if they take
a little while to load your set because
you have a preloader for your whole site
the whole site will be pre-loaded and
you can see the whole site is in a movie
clip it's called entire site see that
down their entire site this is the movie
clip you double-click inside of it well
first let's explain after the preloader
loads the site in we do a little
animation where to site tweens it's
alpha to go from alpha 0 to alpha 100
and then the site is accessible and then
inside if you double click it you'll see
we have the button code pages border
pages movie clip and then panel
backgrounds which are these big panels
for the menu and the pages and then I
put a pages handle here so you don't on
the first frame there's no there's no
elements on the first frame of this
movie clip so we put a handle right
there
okay so inside of the pages movie clip
you'll see all of the pages and this is
where you edit each page let's say I
wanted to edit page three I would go
here to where this page is showing right
here and then double click where it says
page three there it is and what's cool
is you can go to develop PHP and snatch
up if you go to Adobe Flash here I've
got tons of tons of tons of free source
files that are cool stuff to plug into
your website most of them are even set
up into movie clips we're plugging in is
easy to do some of them will be a little
more difficult for you and I don't
really have the time to come out and
help you with your project personally
but hopefully it'll be easy enough for
you but this look how many this is Ton
Ton Ton Ton tons Jonathan Jason's got
some two good ones okay so yeah that's
pretty much all you need to know is you
can dig into the file and there's
nothing external about it everything is
right here inside the file as it is now
and the button menus sitting right there
on the pages MC layer with that pages
handle clip right there you see you have
buttons sitting on top right you can
edit those edit these buttons and
everything you want to do to this okay
so we hope you enjoy that and we'll see
the next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
