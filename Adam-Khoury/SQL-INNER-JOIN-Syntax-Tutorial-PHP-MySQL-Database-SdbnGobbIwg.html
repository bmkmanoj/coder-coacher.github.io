exercise you can learn to use inner join
syntax okay we have a visual
representation of two tables that are in
our database we have a people table and
an options table and these two tables
are related because this table here
options stores specific options for
specific users now our task is to select
information from the people table and
information from the options table only
if the user has their YouTube options
filled in so basically only if they have
a YouTube channel will they get selected
and we're going to select data from both
tables to render the list that we need
so the inner join syntax reads like this
we select people that username people
dot country and options dot YouTube
those are the columns that we're
selecting from the people table inner
join options table on people dot ID
equals options ID where you see the on
syntax that just specifies that the
people that ID call has to match the
options ID column so you can see our
options and people ID columns all match
up for the correct users and that's just
a clause that you can put in place to
make sure that one column from the first
table matches another column in the
second table it could be any columns
that you want then we use the where
Clause to specify where options that
YouTube is not equal to nothing ordered
by people that ID ascending so we're the
YouTube column in the options table does
not equal nothing so we only have two
users whose YouTube column does not
equal nothing so those are the two users
that will get selected and will be able
to get all of their information out of
the people table all in the same query
here's an actual rendering of the script
that I wrote on my server and I'm going
to show you that script right now you
can see it only selects Mike from USA
who has a YouTube channel listed in the
options table and then Julie from USA
has a YouTube channel
listed in the options table all right
here's my SQL example PHP script and I
connect to the database then I run my
query using MySQL I then I build my
display list and I'm able to capture all
of the columns that I want we have Rho
username row country and Rho YouTube and
you see those are the columns that are
selected here then close the database
connection and echo the list so you can
see there's nothing very hard about it
and there's different types of join
syntax which we'll be exploring more
about join syntax in later videos we'll
cover all the bases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
