3.0 form components tutorial I just
wanted to show you the finished product
and this is what we have created in the
tutorial and you can see it has nice
elements for gathering data from a user
and I show you how to program all these
things in and from start to finish and
as as always the source files for the
Fla the PHP parse file and everything
you need is free for down for download
at develop PHP comm under the Flash
tutorials tab and just as an edit I
aside edit here just so you know I had
to put some code in you won't see me
code this in as we go through the
tutorial but I had to put some code in
here to make the radio buttons grouping
work correctly and that's why that looks
a little different there but all the
source code is intact this thing works
beautiful have a ball adament develop
PHP here with another flash actionscript
3.0 form tutorial in our previous form
lessons we built our form elements from
scratch in this lesson I'll show you how
to simply drag three baked components
from the components library to easily
assemble and program a quick powerful
form keep in mind that using any flash
components is much bulkier than creating
your own custom elements and components
and that's why I show everybody normally
how to create everything from scratch
without using the pre baked components
the same items can take up to three to
five times longer to load in the user's
browser the same file will take that
much longer to load if you use the pre
baked components instead of making them
from scratch but for those who want
clean and easy and quick this is great
for you so follow along so we'll click
the flash ActionScript 3 file now I'm in
flash cs3 professional and you can be in
flash cs4 professional for this as well
so flash ActionScript 3 file open it up
and we have a brand new stage here
and what we'll do is set the stage
dimensions first thing so you go down to
size the bottom there and we'll make it
500 by 500 that's okay
and now we'll change the background
color to what we want
make it a nice dark color there and
first thing we're gonna do is drag out a
rectangle that's gonna be the form
background cosmetics it just serves the
purpose of having a background in the
form for the form now once you have that
on stage and layer 1 the main scene you
right-click it convert to symbol and
name it whole form and we do this press
ok make sure it's a movie clip press ok
and we do this just so that when we're
done making the form its gonna be in its
own movie clip here that you can copy
and paste into other app other flash
files as you have going and if you go in
the library you'll see you're gonna even
right-click it and copy from the library
and then go and paste it into another
flash file so it works nice like that
when everything's in its own movie clip
and I would advise that you put
everything all of your independent flash
elements that can be nested inside of a
movie clip I would recommend you nest
them inside movie clips and then learn
how to code for parent movie clips that
way you can jump up through levels in
flash and code for the different
timeline levels ok so now we can double
click inside of that rectangle and now
let's build our timeline like normal and
so layer 1 will call form a background
because that's where the background is
sitting right now that rectangle we
created the next layer up I press insert
layer it creates a new layer then you
double-click the layer and you can
rename it I'm going to rename it
form elements and then one more will add
it rename it actions and that's where
we're gonna put our ActionScript 3 code
now we can start now we can start
assembling this thing so let's click the
text tool and just make a regular static
text type in my contact form or whatever
you want to title the form if you want a
title for your form maybe you won't need
it or inside of your movie clip here and
then you can go to filter effects and
add a drop shadow effect to that take
the strength down to about about thirty
eight twenty eight about 30 it looks
good and my contact form and this thing
make it just a tad lighter on the fill
color by sliding that color slider up
okay that looks good so now we're gonna
start placing our form elements and we
put the title on our contact on our
actions layer so let's press control X
to remove it off of that put it on the
form elements layer press control shift
V to paste it in place okay now let's
start with the form elements we need
we're gonna drag out another text and
it's gonna be a dynamic text each time
so you select dynamic text and then this
one you make the size a little bit
smaller this is gonna be the status text
field which gives the user the reporting
of what's happening in the form if they
happen to make a mistake I forget to
fill something in or when the form is
successfully transmitted to the parse
file and it comes back with a return
message this is where the return message
winds up so this is very important and
you
instance name it status underscore txt
so now we have a status text field let's
make it what's a good color for that
dark blue okie dokie and you can embed
it with uppercase lowercase numerals and
punctuation press okay that way you
won't it won't look all pixelated and
it'll have whatever text you want to put
it will render that text for actually no
matter how or no matter whether or not
the user has that text installed on
their machine so that's what embedding
texts is for so that way your status
text field will display the way you like
now the next thing we have to do is grab
the text input from the we'll start
grabbing components now the pre baked
components and the first thing we want
is the where is it text input grab one
of those and you can resize those to be
the width that you like and I'm gonna
make ours 150 just to get it a little
bigger
and after I after I put all these
elements I'll go ahead and put the
labels for them here like you see in
most forms actually let's go ahead and
do that now
we'll call this one name let's align it
to the right move it over just a little
bit and we'll make it static because we
don't need dynamic for that it's just a
label
okay so now we have a name field let's
drag it over a bit it looks good
make this a little larger alrighty now
we're gonna copy both of those by
pressing shift while we select items you
select multiple items then press control
C control shift V to paste them in place
let's copy and paste in place
this one will be email will be either
the email address and the next one's
actually for the next one we'll just
press ctrl C on the email label and
press control shift V and then we'll
call this one message
so this one will though then we'll drag
out the pre-baked component which is the
text area for the message the way they
can put multiple lines make sure it
lines up with those good okay let's make
this one 200 a little bit wider that's
good you can make it as high as you want
to just set the height down here okay so
next thing we want to do is add a combo
box for countries we're gonna let them
select countries and we want to gather
the their country data from them so grab
a combo box and that's the stage get it
lined up now I'll take this control C
control shift V move it down into place
and we'll just label this country
now I'm going to be using ActionScript
alone to populate the pull-downs the
drop-down selections that's going to be
in this combo box and you'll see how I
do that a little bit later on in this
video but it's pretty simple okay so the
next thing we want to take this control
C control shift V move it down and this
one we're gonna put up for numerical
stepper so we'll say number of children
last the user how many kids they have
just for the example of numeric stepper
so we'll go into the components library
grab the numeric stepper out now we have
a numeric stepper okie-dokie
now we're gonna couple grab a couple of
radio buttons out of the components
library for their gender the user gender
see if they're male or female they can
tell us what they are let's see where is
it
radio button drag that out slide it into
place wherever you want it and let's
drag out another one and they should
have the both both have the same radio
group name 308 308 okay
let's go to the parameters and make sure
a radio button and group yep and this
one we're gonna make the label you can
double click that right there to save
mail let's make it a capital this way it
shows mail on the form and then this one
change the label here to female and give
it a value of F that way when the form
parse file submits the email to you
it'll say F or M and this one will
highlight and give that an M for value
okay and what's next now we have what
else can we show you how to program into
your form radio buttons numeric separ
country pull down or whatever kind of
pull down you want let's do a check
marks grab a check box out and we'll say
this is for submit to our newsletter
type thing or join our newsletter
listing and this one will change the
label to say join our newsletter and
then it'll reflect it there if it if it
cuts off the words you can just change
the width to accommodate there we go
now let's get some labels in for that
control C control shift V and remember
we highlight multiple items select
multiple items by holding shift as we
select them this one will say newsletter
this one will say gender okie-dokie
now all we need is submit button so
let's go and back into the components
library and grab the button slap that on
stage and we're going to name it give it
a label in the parameters tab here of
submit form and then when you click it
you'll see it changes the name okay I
think that's it let's make them a little
movie clip real quick just type the word
processing and this is I like to create
a little processing a movie clip in all
my forms to let the user give a user a
good indication that they just pressed
the submit button and our form is smart
and it's processing the data they have a
clear indication that something's going
on and they're about to receive some
data back
okay so let's right-click that static
text field we just put convert it to a
symbol and we'll name it processing in
the library press ok and we'll name it
processing MC here this is the instance
name that we'll refer to it in the code
processing underscore MC now double
click inside of it ok now we're inside
of the processing Hamm's
underscore MC movie clip and you can
highlight frame to go up to insert
timeline keyframe and it makes a new
keyframe there on the second keyframe
make it solid black so if you go back
and forth between those two keyframes
we'll see it flashing and that's what
the user will see
when we want them to see when we want
them to see it but this movie clip will
be initially set to invisible so they
won't see it initially when they come to
the forum only when they press submit
okay so now I think we are ready to
program this thing we have all the
elements we need on stage we have our
status text that gives the user the
response when they press submit the PHP
file sends the message back it lands
right there they can add their name they
are emailed a message they can pick a
country after we put the country list in
through the action script the number of
children is already set up to be a 1
through 10 stepper and actually let's go
ahead and make that a zero because let's
say value you'll see the maximum and
minimum is 0 to 10 so let's make the
start value on it 0 because if people
don't have any children and join
newsletter check marks male and female
radio buttons for them to pick their
gender or tell us their gender the
submit button and the processing movie
clip that's everything you need as far
as the form elements go before we put in
this script to make everything work in
the actions layer here we have to give
everything an instance name make sure it
all has an instance name that way the
code can connect to each item on stage
here this one has an instance name of
status underscore txt that's ready to go
this one will give a name of instance
name name underscore txt this one
instance name of email underscore txt
this one the message field MSG
underscore txt this country
combo box is gonna be a country list
that sounds good and the next one is
going to be kids that'll tell them and
tell us the number of children they have
and the number of kids they have and
here we have a radio Radio radio boom
this one is also radio group I'm not
sure if these need instance names or not
or if they use the parameter name here
radio let's make sure that's the same
one you can experiment with that to see
if you need an instance name or not but
I think as as long as the group name is
radio group we can refer to it as cook
in the code is that okay next is the
newsletter and that one will
let's name that newsletter nope let's
name it checkmarks because that's what
it is
okay that is instance name checkbox this
should have an instance name of submit
underscore BTN because it's our submit
button this has an instance name already
of processing underscore MC and we're
good to go now
now we can code this thing out and
everything will work so in our actions
layer we'll highlight the key frame
there press f9 to open your actions
panel or you can go to if you have your
actions panel set up over here you can
just hit that little button I like to
set out all my little tools or my
libraries and tools over here in little
boxes and then you can always save your
workspace by going to workspace save
whatever and alright this program this
thing so the first thing we want to do
is hide that little processing movie
clip because we don't want this thing
flashing by default when they come to
the forum only when they press the
submit button so we have to take care of
that so let's type in a little note and
say hide processing MC and to do that
you type in processing underscore MC
that visible equals false
semicolon now that will hide the movie
clip on stage see if we render out
see there's no flashing movie clip and
if I take that line of code away then
render out you'll see how it's flashing
we don't want that so that's why I added
that line of code now let's move along
to setting up the next set of things in
the next set of things that needs to be
set up is this country
combo box has to have its lists
populated so when they pull down they
see a list right now it's empty
and so let's make ourselves another note
and we'll say this is the custom
function we create to populate the combo
box list
okay so let's just make it a little
custom function here we can name it
whatever we want function add countries
to lists sounds good
that's the function name let's put the
opening and closing parentheses : void
open the curly bracket curly brace what
do we call that stupid thing and then
we'll target what the instance name is
on the combo box and that was country
list dot add item this is how we're
gonna start pushing items into the or
adding items to the component let me
type in label : open parentheses open
double quote close double quote close
that curly bracket and close the
parentheses put in semicolon I'll go
back in between the double quotes and
put it in please choose and that'll be
the default value that is in the form or
you can just have it say United States
by default yeah let's just do that
the United States now we can just
highlight that line and add four more
one two three well add three more you
can add as many as you want up to is I
don't know I think it's unlimited you
can add as many as you want I do not
know if there's a limit or not but I've
never come I've never hit a wall on
adding items to a list Canada oops I
can't spell Canada let's say Canada and
we'll put the United Kingdom in this one
okay so we get United States Mexico
Canada and United Kingdom
that's the countries that will be in the
drop-down list and now we have to
execute and run this function to
actually make it populate the list or
else it'll just be a custom function
sitting there and it won't execute
itself so we have to have it run to do
that we just put the function name and
then open closed parenthesis and
semicolon that will effectively execute
that function let's type in a little
message to ourselves here a little
comment run function above now okay
okay now we're going to build the
variables variable that way we can send
variables with the the form to the PHP
part script spell this correctly okay so
we'll just name it that bar variables
and we'll say URL request URL variables
sorry
URL variables equals new URL variables
new your variables okay so that assigns
a variable name for the URL variables
object here now what we can do is I have
a note setup it says build the send bar
send variable so that's what we'll do
and this is gonna be the URL request for
connecting to the PHP parse file so
let's say bar bar send : URL request
equals new URL request
and then open parentheses close
parentheses and semicolon and in between
the parentheses put in a set of double
quotes in between the double quotes put
your URL you want to connect to and this
is going to be form parse dot PHP that's
gonna be the name of the file I create
for when the form button the submit
button is pressed all the variables all
this data we want is going to be sent to
form parsed PHP file sitting on the
server with this SWF okay so the next
line we have to set the send method
so we'll say var send we'll use that
variable name dot method make sure it's
the post method not the get method and
so this will be u RL request method dot
post all capitals
and then like the next line we're gonna
add the variables right here the
variables object to the the VAR send URL
request
so let's control see there bar send data
equals variables that will send the
variable data with the post to the forum
to the form parse file okay now we're
gonna build the VAR loader variable so
let's make ourselves a note build the
VAR loader variable
now this one is going to be set for
loading the variables object into the
the URL request okay so let's say var
var loader this is the URL loader equals
new URL loader semicolon then we'll type
in VAR loader : oh sorry that data
format equals
URL
loader data format and some of these are
really long dot variables all capitals
here and semicolon then var loader dot
add event listener
open parentheses close parentheses
semicolon and in between the parentheses
type event dot complete and the name of
the function that will run will be
complete handler there so what that did
is it added an event listener to the
stage and it's going to run a function
when this listener fires off it will run
the function of complete handler and
we're going to create that function
right now
so let's type in a note and say handler
for the PHP scripts completion and
return data message in return of message
a return of status
okay now we're going to name this
function right what we named it here in
the eventlistener so function complete
handler open parenthesis this is event
colon event
: void and we'll open the curly bracket
the curly brace I'm gonna find out what
the name of that thing is curly bracket
curly race whatever the hell you are
I'll look it up on wiki shut up okay so
that it is now we're gonna remove the
the processing will be clip because it's
going to be flashing on stage here so
let's say remove processing now the next
line we're going to say processing that
visible visible equals false
that way we don't want the user to see
it anymore because at that point it's
gonna be flashing because they would
have already hit the submit button when
the data comes back from PHP we want to
make sure it's not flashing any more
because the dad is back
that's all that's doing now let's clear
some form fields so they understand that
everything's done and they'll also get a
message too but we just want to be
really clear with the user because
people are stupid you know that
okay so name underscore txt dot txt
equals and make it a blank value by
putting double quotes with nothing in
between them now the next one let's just
copy that ctrl C let's go down a line
paste go down another line paste hey let
me get some space here okay so now we'll
put this one make this a email that'll
clear the email form field and this will
clear the message form field and we can
also clear the the kids number of
children numeric stepper by placing
value equals zero here clear it back to
zero and we can clear the radio group
actually I'm not sure how to clear the
radio group I know we can clear the
check marks check marks that's selected
equals false yeah when I figure out how
to clear the radio group selections and
the the country pull down I'll add those
back in but so but this will clear the
checkbox and the number of children's
filled righty now the important part is
here let's make a note and say load the
response from PHP here we load the
response from PHP here by adding it to
the Status underscored txt dot text
field sitting on stage and this will be
the event of the function that we were
in which is to complete handler event
and this will be event that target I'm
going to target that data coming back
that data dot return message
the reason why we put a variable of
return message here is because that's
what we're going to assign it as in the
PHP script and you'll see that in a few
minutes okay so that's it for that
function that complete handler function
is finished okay now we're going to add
an event listener and create the
function necessary for when the user
clicks the submit button to send all the
data to the PHP file along with all the
variables so let's make ourselves a note
well the comment here and let's say I
had an event listener for submit button
click and that will be submit underscore
BTN that's just instance name on the
button dot add event listener
and open front this is type in Mouse
event dot click all capitals comma and
this is going to be the function name
that I'm about to set up the function
below here type in the function name
let's call it validate and send close
the parentheses and close close it up
with a semicolon now let's write it
alone and say function let's just grab
this here cuz we'll see function
validate and said now let's go ahead and
build that function functions bass
validate and send and open parentheses
type in event dot Mouse event or event
colon
mousey event close parentheses semicolon
and type in void open the curly brace
and close the curly brace now we have
our function setup right here and right
here in between the opening closing
brackets we'll type in what we want to
happen in the function and the first
thing we have to do is validate its form
fields and so let's take a note here and
say validate fields
go one down and we'll say if this is a
conditional statement set up to listen
to see if the name text has any text
written in and if it doesn't we got to
give them an error message in the status
text field saying oops you forgot to add
your name to the form please add it so
we type in the name of the text field
dot length and that gathers how much how
many characters typed into it let's open
the curly bracket
or the function over the conditional and
close it down here and now let's put the
outcome that we want to happen in that
so let's say status underscore txt which
is our status and ever reporting field
dot txt oops
text equals please enter your name put
that in double quotes and close it off
with semicolon okay
now we'll say else if now we're going to
see if they put in any data into the
email field that they didn't I'm gonna
give him a little error message and say
you forgot to put that in the email
phone so we'll say else if
let's just copy this one
let's grab that
so let me say else if paste that right
in and we have our conditional here and
the outcome here and now we'll say this
has to be changed so we can run this on
the email field so email text dot length
please enter your email and if you want
an email validation method or function I
have it for my other two forms that I
programmed before this one there's an
email validation method I have inside of
those two forms that you can get to by
downloading the source files and it'll
show you how to set up the email
validation method it'll check for the @
symbol dot make sure everything is
structured correctly in the email so
they don't give bogus emails and when
they're submitting but in this one I'm
not gonna add it now we're gonna copy
this condition paste it in here and
we're gonna say msg text now msg for the
message text please enter your message
that's if you want to require a message
if you don't want to require any of
these things don't put any of these
conditionals in it's that simple but for
the things you want to require you put
conditionals in here to listen for them
and now we'll type in else if everything
is cool
then we finish it off
let's close that up
and we finish off by sending the data
now now we can add all of the code
that's required to send to the PHP form
right here in this else conditional
because we'll know that all the errors
have been checked for and make it
through okay so we'll send it to the
form now so I'll type ourselves we'll go
down one more time ourselves a note say
all is good send the data now to PHP
okay actually down here let's type
ourselves a note on this closing bracket
and say close else condition forever
handling if you didn't want to have ever
handling in here you wouldn't need any
of these if and else conditions you
could just put the all's good code that
I'm about to put right here alright so
now we're gonna show the the processing
movie clip because this is the function
that actually fires off when they hit
the submit button so if all is good we
show them the processing movie clip
because we are processing to PHP file
now the processing underscore MC that
visible will equal true to make it show
on stage it's that simple
and you can see what we do with that
processing movieclip is we just make it
appear and disappear at the appropriate
times that we needed to it's very simple
and now we're going to type in a note
and say ready the variables in our form
for sending let's get them all packed up
into the variables object that we
created here see this variables object
the URL variables I'm going to pack
these the form variables into it now so
let's type in variables dot username and
this is what we're gonna send this is
the variable name that PHP is gonna pick
up and we're not using this name in
flash you'll notice but this is where
PHP is gonna get the data it's going to
use that that data name equals name
underscore txt dot text that way it'll
add what's in the field to this data
holder and that data holder can be
accessed in PHP now we're gonna set up
the rest let's just copy that press ctrl
C go down a line oops let's see let's
get these under where it should be
okay now we'll say user email and this
will equal email text
do the same thing for oops
for the message the user I guess we call
this msg user msg equals msg underscore
txt got text let's copy those three I
have to add some more here for the other
components now we have a country list
let's see we have a country list stepper
genders in the newsletter so let's say
user country country this one will be
the user kids
this one will be user gender
and we need more see two more should do
it
user gender than the newsletter and will
say user newsletter will name that one
equals will sit those up in a second
let's see let's go back to we don't need
that one because the the checkbox for
the newsletter is the last thing before
the button I do believe yeah okay so now
the user country we have to change the
way we're going to access that value a
little bit so we want to type in the
correct thing there say country list
which is the name of our instance name
of our combo box component on stage
country list dot value and that will get
the value out of that drop-down list for
you whatever it's selected as at the
time they press submit
okay so country list then the kids the
same thing instance name on that
numerical stepper is kids and that will
have to be value as well then the next
thing is the radio group instance name
for that radio group and that will be
value as well
and this one will be for the checkbox
and this has to be selected to see if
it's selected or not you said that I
think let me check yeah selected
and that'll tell you if it's selected or
not by giving you a true or false in
your parts file and the last thing and
the most important thing is to send them
actually send it send the data to PHP
now so this next line is going to shoot
the data to the PHP file so var loader
dot load and we'll put a open
parenthesis close parenthesis semicolon
and inside the parenthesis we'll add our
var sent object that was created here
which is a URL request object and it's
or method and it's posting all these
variables to the PHP parse file that we
designate here and it has to be sitting
in your server and the same directory as
your SWF file in your HTML file that
holds the SWF file it's very important
okay let's see I think I think we're
done
to be close make sure we close that
function yep close validate and send
function but I do believe that wraps up
everything now if we press f12 ah I got
errors let's see what we got
undefined property processing undefined
property checkbox so let's go here make
sure this has the correct name which it
did not had a small B it need a Big B
and processing needs to say underscore
MC wherever I wrote that right here and
that's it that takes care of all the
errors help don't we still have an error
of checkbox
right here that should be a large be
make sure it's all correct checkbox
checkbox
okay now let's publish that's it there
she is now you can see if I try to
submit the form it says please enter
your name and type our name in I'm at
school about the components is they put
a nice little ring around the selected
item that you're typing into then if you
type in your email or if you forget your
email you press submit form it'll save
these into your email so that's how the
error handling works and please enter
your message type in a message and then
that's all the the error handling so
when you press submit form but we have
no PHP farce file written yet so that's
the last step let's go ahead and do that
now okay I just went ahead and wrote out
the the PHP parse file for that form
that we just built and because I didn't
want to sit here and waste another half
an hour of coding when you can just go
and download all the source files for
the whole tutorial package source file
for the flash and the PHP from develop
PHP comm it's a whole lot easier if you
were already intermediate at an
intermediate flash skill level to just
go and get source files in code you can
dig in through the source files adapt
them change them up use them up and it
just seems to be a lot easier workflow
that way but if you want to see it here
it is and you can pause it type it in
there's the first half now I'll show you
what's here down below
and now the very bottom
so if you want to type it in here you
can just pause it and type in those
three sections and have the complete
parse script and you would have to
change your email here and add a couple
of other things that the subject line
should say you know message from your
site whatever so what happens is the
first chunk of code here takes the
variables and it creates local PHP
variables from the flash ActionScript
posted variables you see those names we
assigned we're using them right here
then we just make a new variable name
here and we strip slashes on the typed
in variables the three form fields that
we had where user can type in we want to
make sure that we ship slashes on those
and do any other security checks at that
point you want to do right there
PHP wise and then right here is where
you change a few items to make it email
to you this is the most important line
in the script line 21 where you change
this to your email that way it sends the
form data to you or else you're not
gonna get it if you don't change that
line you won't get any email and you'll
think it's broken so you got to change
that line this can stay the same for the
time being but you'll want to change
that eventually and here is where we
pack all of the variables into the
message then we use a regular mail
function in PHP to send the data to your
email address using the headers that we
assigned right here and right now here
we set the variable string the sentence
that's going to go back into flash and
we use their name right here in the
sentence the name variable C sender name
so it's gonna say if your name was Adam
it would say thanks Adam all the data
has been sent you'll see that in flash
which is really cool and then right here
is actually printing the data to the
browser that way it sends it back to
flash and that's what that does then you
just egg to the script you don't even
have to actually exit the script they
it'll exit itself once it finished
finishes executing but I just like to
exit it up just to clear up resources
right away and that's the whole tutorial
like I said I'll have all the flash
source files the source file for flash
I'll have the source file this PHP
source file in the package and in a
directory structure like it should be
and these files want to be together on
your server the parse file here wants to
be with the SWF file and the HTML file
that holds it on your server same
directory or if you want to use a
different directory you simply go into
the ActionScript and change the URL
request to say say you had a folder
called scripts say scripts slash form
parse that PHP that way it'll look into
a folder on your server called scripts
and use the parse file that's in it
there that's it we hope you find this
lesson on adding form components to your
flash files handy and make sure you
target player 9 or higher for all of the
components to work correctly you want to
be in your settings targeting Flash
Player 9 if you need to get to it you
press settings down here you go to
version Flash Player 9
and I think that's it let me see
I did detect flash version you could
also select that that's everything
all right we'll see you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
