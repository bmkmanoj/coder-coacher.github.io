construct CSS grid layouts for your
projects in the future you cannot apply
it to your current projects yet because
of limited browser support I will lead
you to the official documentation so
that you can get the knowledge firsthand
from the official source and not from a
secondhand source and you'll find that
it's similar to the flexbox layout
module tutorial that we did a couple of
weeks ago but it has different
properties and features that might
better accomplish a task that you have
before you here we were to start with a
blank HTML file and the first thing
we'll do in a style element is set the
body margin to zero pixels that way that
default space around the edge of a
webpage is removed now in the body
element I'm gonna slap in the structure
of my grid and if we render this to
ourselves we'll see it's just a bunch of
normal divs stacked vertically on top of
each other now that's all we're going to
do in the HTML the rest is going to be
CSS that will render the layout using
these divs inside of this grid container
and each div has an ID abcdefgh
then they also have inner HTML content
that reflects their ID just for
demonstration purposes that way you can
keep track of where you are and your
columns and rows in the grid now we're
going to target this grid container by
its ID so we'll put the pound sign type
in grid opening closing curly brace now
what we can do is set the display
property to grid and that's what it will
look like in the future but for now
we're going to have to test in Internet
Explorer because it's only available in
Internet Explorer 10 and greater that's
the only browser you can test with for
now so we'll put in m/s prefix for
Internet Explorer at first let's leave
the prefix off so you can see there's no
change
but now let me change this to the MS
prefix and you'll see that this property
takes effect now refresh you see how
they're all stacked on top of each other
now all of the grid items because we
have to assign the layout for the grid
our grid has eight items in it on the
next line in our CSS we're going to
target the grid columns there's going to
be four columns in this particular grid
so I'm gonna set each column to 25% so
they fill 25% of the space now we'll
target the rows in the grid layout which
is going to be two rows so four columns
to rows gives us eight items so for the
rows they're going to have a height of
50% of the viewport height that means
half of the screen now in the next style
rule I'm just gonna target all of the
child div elements all of the grid items
inside of the grid container so we
target the grid and we specify children
of the grid all we give them each a
background gray border of black and a
font size of 75 pixels if we look at
what that renders let's refresh and
we'll see that they have the look that
we want but they're still all stacked on
top of each other so all we have to do
now is position them so under that style
rule we'll put it in these and each one
effects each one of the grid items by
their ID so we target grid item a and we
specify that it's grid column position
is going to be 1 and then the grid row
position it will have is also 1 so it's
going to be the first box here before I
explain let's take a look at it so you
have abcdefgh and no matter what size
the screen is the grid still keeps its
proportions because of the way that
we've set the sizing here and I'll
change these sizes in a moment to show
you what happens so you see that all you
have to do is target the position that
you want each grid item to live for
instance if I want see
to live in this location where he is all
I have to do is target row 2 column 1 so
let's go to C and put it at column 1 Row
2 and then let's go to e and put it
where C was which was column 3 of Row 1
now you'll see that they have swapped a
position he is now here and C is now
here so you see how I'm targeting where
I want these elements to live inside of
the grid it's very simple all right so
now let's put those values back so
everything is in its proper order but
something like that would come in really
handy if you're making layouts and you
want to allow a client to change the
position of where some column is maybe
swap a left column out for the right
column move the position of menu items
and things like that now I'm going to go
ahead and change these numbers for the
column so this is column 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4 and
you see we have 1 2 3 4 so if I change
this one to 15 and this one is a 35 and
then we refresh you see this one only
takes up 15% this one now takes up 35%
so if I put this on 30 and this on 70
and then refresh ok it's with our values
back now I'm going to also offer you
guys a cool website layout that's made
from the grid module so let's replace
this code with that code now let's
refresh our document you see what you
have is pretty much a website layout you
have an aside element here nav element
or your main page content section the
footer and the header everything in
place and it's scales
to keep everything liquid or responsive
or whatever you want to call it so you
see in the HTML
we're just targeting the body element
and we're making that the grid so you
don't have to actually target a div or
anything like that you can target the
body itself as the grid container and we
use the new html5 header element the new
html5 nav element the new html5 footer
and the new html5 html5 a side element
now I'll lead you to the official
documentation that way you can explore
all of the features involved and you
won't have to rely on some secondhand
source which every other website other
than the one that I'm going to lead you
to now is a secondhand source so you
might as well go straight to the horse's
mouth and get the knowledge from the
same place that educators like myself
universities and everybody else who's
doing good serious educational work this
is where they get the information from
okay the first document that I'm gonna
link you to is the first grid layout
proposal and you can see that there's a
ton of examples with nice illustrations
that show you what what's going on and
it explains every single detail of all
the features involved they give you nice
code examples and there's a ton of
examples there and all the documentation
that you need for if you go down to the
bottom you'll see all of the properties
involved so if you want to get to know
for instance here I'm using a grid
column span so if you want to get to
know what that's doing you just go to
grid column span click it and it takes
us to that point in a document which
explains the spanning or any of the
other features that you want to
investigate and experiment with now
there's also the in the code here I'm
using the fr unit and that might confuse
a lot of people when they see it so what
you want to do is go to the official
documentation and I think it's section 5
let's see there it is
six point five point one fraction values
that's what the fr unit is and you can
read all about it so you don't have to
get any explanation of that from some
secondhand source now the second
document that I'm going to link you to
is the newer grid layout module working
draft now if you go all the way to the
bottom you'll see that the same similar
examples exist here and some different
ones some newer ones and if you go to
the bottom you'll see that there's
different properties proposed now but
you can find that some of these don't
even work but it might benefit you to
see the newer updated documentation
about the grid layout module all right
so I'll have both of these code examples
on the page under the video where it
displays that develop PHP comm and I
hope this information helps you with
building grid layouts in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
