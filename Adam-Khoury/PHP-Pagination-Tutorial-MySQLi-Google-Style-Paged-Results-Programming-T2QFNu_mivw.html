prejudice appreciation hello let's start
with the bare bones of an html5 web
document mine is named pagination
example dot PHP the first thing I'm
going to do is go up above my doctype
and I'm going to put in my opening PHP
tag and then I'm going to go down a
couple of lines and put in my closing
PHP tag now since we're going to be
querying a MySQL database for all of our
data it's going to be paginated we're
going to need a MySQL I based connection
to the database but you have to
establish a MySQL I connection and you
do that right here at the top of your
script or somewhere near the top you
just have to make sure that that is in
place before you try to query anything
from the database and if you need to see
what this MySQL I connection that PHP
file looks like you can look at the one
of the first few tutorials in the social
network building series that we did not
too long ago shows all of the inner
workings of that MySQL I connection file
but I'm just going to assume from past
tutorials that you guys have watched of
mine that you know how to make a MySQL
eye connection to your database so
basically you're just going to include
that connection file right there so I'm
going to place in my SQL syntax and
you're going to see that I'm tapping
into my testimonials table in my
database and I'm going to use that as a
real live example so towards the end of
the video I'll show you the script
working at develop PHP calm to render
out my testimonials in paginated results
instead of one giant list now we run the
query against the database and this is a
MySQL I based query so we put in the
connection variable first and the second
parameter that we put in is our SQL
syntax which you could take all of this
SQL syntax right here and just put it
right there if you want but I like
separating mine out like that now we're
going to access the row for that query
result set because all this query doing
is getting a count of how many rows are
in the testimonials table where approved
field is equal to one and many times you
wouldn't have any conditions in there
you might just be listing out or trying
to get the total count from your
testimonials table or your products
table or your whatever
a table but since I have a little
condition in there I just want to make
sure that the testimonial is approved
before everybody can see it in the list
so in my database I have an email field
called approved and it's set to zero at
first and then when I approve the
testimonial that people write it and
then it becomes a one so I just want to
make sure that I'm counting only the
approved testimonials now in the very
next line we're going to type ourselves
a comment in that says here we have the
total row count by specifying the row
variable here and then accessing its
first and only index because we're only
selecting one item from the testimonials
table which is the count so you're
really only going to have one array item
in that row index so you access the
first one and that gives you the total
count of rows from this testimonials
table so here we have the total row
count on the very next line we're going
to type in another comment that says
this is the number of results we want
displayed per page so let's create that
variable now we're going to name that
variable page rows and we're going to
make it equal to ten because I want ten
items to be listed on each page
basically I want ten testimonials to
come out on each page so I make this
page rows variable equal to ten if you
want only five items to be on each page
just make that a five and you can play
with that number all you want now we're
going to place in another variable well
first let's place in a comment to tell
us what this variable represents the
comment reads this tells us the page
number of our last page so let's put
that variable into place now because we
have to know what is the very last page
of the result set according to how many
rows are going to be laid out on each
page so we name the variable last and we
run the seal function with this which is
a math function in PHP and we say rows
which is the full rows count from the
database divided by ten basically or
whatever you made this number and that
gives you that little calculation result
gives you the last page variable so if
your result set from your database is
page it out in 288 different pages then
this last variable will be 88
and seal is just a way to round the
number up because when you divide this
number or when you divide rows by page
rows don't really want a floating-point
number or anything you want a number
without any decimals that's the only
reason we're running seal on this little
equation here now since some of the
variables are going to be in the URL
that means people can manipulate the
variables and so we're going to put in
another comment that says this makes
sure last cannot be less than 1 so let's
put a little if condition right here
just to make sure that last can never be
less than 1 before our script process is
that variable so this if condition reads
if last is less than 1 then we make last
equal to 1 now let's write it in another
comment that says establish the page
number able so page num is going to be
equal to 1 by default but it's going to
be changed down here in the script when
we gather the URL variable for the page
number so let's write in another comment
to ourselves that says get the page
number URL variables if it is present if
it's not present we're going to make it
equal to 1 by establishing it right here
as 1 so basically you establish page and
I'm very Balazs one here and then we're
going to see if there's a get variable
set of pn because that's what we're
going to name our variable when we send
it through the URL so we say if is set
the get variable of pn then we're going
to gather up that get variable of pn and
it's going to represent a number
whichever page the user wants to go to
we got to make sure that we run preg
replace over that and filter it to where
it's only numbers that can be an etch
URL variable so only if that variable is
set if that variable is not set in the
URL the pn variable then page number is
going to be equal to 1 every time unless
it's set in the pn variable but if it is
set in the URL then page number ria
becomes whatever this pn URL variable is
in the the address bar after you go
through the tutorial you can go ahead
and remove all of these comment lines
and that'll make your script a lot
slimmer and make it look a lot smaller
but just keep the comments there
till you fully understand each line or
each segment of code okay so right under
all of that we're going to place in
another comment that says this makes
sure the page number isn't below one or
more than our last page variable we
don't want page num to ever be below a 1
or more than the last page and this
little condition will handle that we say
if the page number is less than one then
the page number is equal to one so
basically somebody can take the URL
address bar and change it from one or
whatever page they're on to zero and
what you want to do is make sure that
you change that 0 to a 1 so if it
happens to be less than a 1 then we
change page number to 1 else if the page
number is greater than the last page
number then page number is going to be
equal to last so basically if you have
88 pages of results and somebody changes
that 88 the last page in the URL address
bar
maybe they change it to a 92 you just
want to make sure that that doesn't
process in your script and you change
page number 92 that they input to 88 so
this if condition or this if in else if
condition just make sure that the page
number isn't below of one or more than
your last page now let's put in another
comment that says this sets the range of
rows to query for the chosen page number
and that looks like this we make a limit
variable and this limit variable is
going to be sunk right into our next
query remember this query up top this
one was just to find the full count of
how many rows there are so we're going
to need another query that actually runs
a while loop and gets results out but we
have to limit that query because we only
want a certain amount of items out of
the database but only according to what
page they represents you understand so
if you're on page 3 you don't want to
gather all of the first rows in the
database you want to make sure you
gather a result set that corresponds to
that page 3 so you really have to
understand the limit syntax for SQL if
you don't understand the limit and what
limit does in an SQL
query then you're not going to
understand this tutorial so what you
want to do is make sure you look into
and make sure that you understand what
limit does in SQL queries it just limits
how many you're grabbing out of the
database now let me put in the next
comment and the query so this next
comment says this is your query again it
is for grabbing just one page worth of
rows by applying the limit variable so I
say select ID first name last name the
date made from my testimonials table
where approved equals one and I'm going
to order all those results by ID
descending and then my limit syntax goes
on the very end of the query you can see
what my limit syntax is made up of limit
then space and it's going to be two
numbers and the first number is made by
taking page num minus 1 and multiplying
it by page rows basically 10 because we
made page rows 10 up here then the next
number for your limit syntax is going to
be 10 or whatever page rows whatever
value you made the page rows variable
all right so that is all of that
explained I can't explain it any clearer
than that and I'm telling you if you
don't understand what limit does in SQL
syntax then you're never going to
understand this tutorial now finally
let's run that query and the query reads
my sqli query your database connection
and the second parameter again is your
SQL syntax which is right here now the
next line we're going to place in
another comment that says this shows the
user what page they are on and the total
number of pages so I name the variables
text line 1 and text line 2 and we're
going to be echoing these out to the
page in just a moment so the first text
line one says testimonials and then
you're going to put the number of rows
the full amount of rows from the
database so if your database has a
thousand testimonials in it that number
will be right here and then that would
mean since we're making 10 rows come out
per page
means you'll have a hundred pages so
this last will be a hundred and this
page number will represent whatever page
they're on so text line one says
testimonials the full amount of
testimonials and text line two will show
the user what page they're on out of how
many pages there are total in the very
next line we're going to put in the
comment that says establish the
pagination controls variable and that's
going to be equal to nothing when it's
established so we have a variable ready
called pagination controls and what
we're going to do is add to that page
nation controls variable to make all of
the clickable numbers and the previous
and next buttons and all that stuff now
what I'm going to do is just make
everything simple links pretty much how
you would see in Google style results
when you go to Google and you search you
can look at their pagination at the
bottom and we're going to make that
style of pagination or very similar to
that now under that we're going to put
in another comment that says if there's
more than one page worth of results so
let's put in an if condition here if
open close parentheses
opening curly brace go down a couple of
lines and put in your closing curly
brace and we want to check to see if the
last variable which is represents the
last page is not equal to one that means
there's more than one page worth of
results because your database might only
have five rows in it and that means you
would only have one page which is the
first page so you really don't have to
give them next in previous buttons or
little links for numbers of pages to
click because there's only one page so
within this if condition is where we're
going to build up this pagination
controls variable because only if
there's more than one page worth of
results are we going to render those
little things at the bottom okay now I'm
going to put in a little multi-line
comment so this says first we check if
we're on page one if we are then we
don't need a link to the previous page
because we're on page ones - there are
no previous pages and we don't need a
link to the first page which is page one
so we do nothing because we're already
on page one so you don't want to have a
little link that says one
to go to page one so if we aren't on
page one then we generate some links to
the first page and to the previous page
well really the number one will be paged
out in our loop so the if condition we
need to check for all of that is if page
num is greater than one and in that
condition the first thing we'll do is
we'll say previous variable is equal to
page numbness 1 and previous is a new
variable that we haven't established yet
in our script it's just being
established now so the previous variable
is equal to page number minus 1 so if
you're on page 7 previous is going to
represent page 6 and also the first
little bit of rendering that you want in
your pagination controls is going to be
a link that is set to the server self so
whichever page you're on it doesn't
matter you don't have to put the page
name there but you want to make sure you
append to the URL the page number
variable that's the get variable the URL
variable and you want to make sure that
that is equal to the previous variable
remember like I said if you're on page 7
you want to make sure that there is a
link that says previous so that's the
label in the link it's going to be the
word previous and it's going to be going
to whatever the previous pages now we're
going to place ourselves a comment under
that that says render clickable number
links that should appear on the left of
the target page number so here we're
going to use a for loop for that so with
a for loop you're going to feed your for
loop three parameters the first
parameter is what you want to start the
index at so I named the variable I like
we usually do in for loops and that's
going to be equal to page number minus 4
so if you're on page number 7 this I
variable is going to equal 7 minus 4
which is what 3 so in that case if the
user happens to be on page 7 this will
represent a 3 then the second parameter
is our evaluation for the for loop which
is while I is less than the page number
able so let's use that example of being
on page 7 again so if this
would be equal to a 3 so that means this
is saying while 3 is less than 7 then
this loop is going to keep running in
the way that I gets incremented is your
last parameter within the for loop which
is I plus plus so within the for loop we
just want a small condition that says if
I is greater than 0 because we don't
ever want a 0 to render in those little
clickable links so if I is greater than
0 our pagination controls is going to
get more little links popped into it and
the pn variable is going to be equal to
that i variable and then you just put it
in the I variable there as the link
label and that's what gives you the
little number to the person can click on
so basically this code right here gives
you everything you need that is on the
left side of your target number so if
you happen to be on page 7 we want to
have 4 little links that go back to page
6 5 4 &amp;amp; 3 on the left side and we also
want a little word that says previous so
the person can use that as well now on
the right side of the target page number
which let's say for example the user is
on page 7 we want to have four more
links that go to page 8 9 10 and 11 and
then after that we want the word next so
just remember that this code here
renders everything on the left side of
the target numbers so we're going to go
outside of this if condition right here
so down under that if condition where
that curly brace ends for that if
condition we're going to place in
another comment that says render the
target page number but without it being
a link because that's the page that the
person is going to be on so you really
don't want to have that be a link and it
can be styled any way you want but we
just won't really don't want to make it
a link because they are already on that
page so there's no reason to make it a
clickable link so pagination controls
were appending to that variable the
value of page num and then a little
space now after you show down in the
pagination controls the actual page
number that the user is on then you're
going to put in another comment that
says render the clickable number links
that should appear on the right of the
target page number
going to use a for loop for that as well
now let's pop that loop into place and
I'll explain it real quick and you
pretty much have to understand how for
loops work to really grasp the whole
script and once you understand how for
loops work which is a very simple in our
case they might look a little
complicated here because we have a lot
of different code at play but if you
look at a basic for loop it's very
simple to comprehend so I would
recommend if you don't understand how
for loops run to research for loops in
PHP that way you can see it at its most
basic level operating for loops always
get three parameters here so the
parameters for this for loop is going to
be establishing the I variable again or
the index if you will of this for loop
and we're going to make this one equal
to page number plus one the first pass
of the loop so if we're on page seven
this is going to be an eight so I is
going to be equal to eight then we say
while eight is less than or equal to
whatever the last page is then we're
going to I plus plus and run the loop
some more and that's how we're going to
get the four numbers on the right side
of the target page in the pagination
controls while this loop is running we
just add little links to the pagination
controls variable and each link is going
to have this I for loop index as its
label so if you happen to be on page
seven the first time this loop runs it's
going to render out an eight the second
time this loop runs it's going to render
out a nine the third a ten and the
fourth time it runs it's going to render
out and eleven now this loop might have
a larger ceiling than four so what I did
is I just said if I is greater than or
equal to page number four then we're
going to break the loop because really I
only want this loop to run four times so
what I did was I just put an if
condition here that breaks it will stop
this for loop from running after it runs
four times and I also put this if
condition because this loop might only
run twice because if you only have ten
pages let's say you only have nine pages
worth of data and user is on page seven
you don't want to render out page eight
nine ten
eleven because there's only ten pages or
nine pages so you definitely don't want
the ten and eleven numbers there which
is what would happen so basically in
just in certain cases this little if
condition helps you break the for loop
from running any further to render
numbers out there that I don't
correspond to any pages that exist in
your pagination now remember in this
condition we said if the page number is
greater than one then and only then
we're going to put a previous link and
little numbers going back to previous
pages we're going to do the same thing
down here in the last part of this if
condition that started way up top here
so this if condition is going to have
one last little bit of cold popped into
it let's pop that in right now this does
the same as above this does the same as
this condition right here but for
showing the next the little next word
which is a feature that you might want
in your pagination is to have the word
next after all those little numbers just
the same way you have the word previous
before all the little numbers so if the
page that they're on is not equal to the
last page then you definitely want to
have the next button but if they are on
the last page you don't render anything
so this won't this code won't even run
if they're on the last page only if
they're not on the last page will this
code run and you'll get more stuff added
to your page ination controls variable
and the way you make the next link is
you just say page number on page seven
next equals page eight and that's what
gets put into your pn variable here now
after all of that you go down one line
and make sure you're outside of your if
condition that you said if last is not
equal one you see where that ends right
here you go outside of that and here's
where you're going to render your while
loop like you normally do for a MySQL
result set what we're going to do is
first establish a variable called list
because that variable is going to be
echoed out to the page so we're going to
compound that variable with all the data
that we need for each little testimonial
within this while loop so basically you
run your normal while loop here
for this last query that was made right
here so this while loop will grab all of
the rows that you need for that specific
page that the user is requesting to see
those ten items so in the while loop I'm
going to grab the ID out of the database
row I'm going to grab the first name the
person's last name the date that the
testimonial was made and then I'm just
going to put the date made into a more
human readable format and then I'm going
to make my little list which each item
in the list is going to be in a P tag
because I want them separated a little
bit down the page and each one is going
to have a link to the proper testimonial
which will render on testimonial dot PHP
and the ID URL variable will be sunk in
right there and I'm going to show you
guys all of this working in just a
moment so the label for that link is
going to be the person's first name last
name and the word testimonial then the
link closes right there and then I'll
have some text that just says click the
link to view the testimonial or I could
actually put some of the testimonial
that they wrote in here I could put a
few lines in here if I want you can put
whatever you want in here from the
database results and then I put a break
tag and I put written on the date made
and then I finally close my little
paragraph tag for each one that renders
and then the very last thing underneath
your while loop outside of it you're
going to write yourself a comment that
says close your database connection so
we close our MySQL eye database
connection here because we don't need to
be to connect it to the database any
further past that point now let's go
down into our HTML where you can see we
just have the bare bones still there's
nothing in our body tag there's nothing
in our style tag so within the body tag
I'm going to place the following code
which is a div element and in that div
element I'm going to have an h2 heading
and instead of pagination top row I've
got to change those to be text line 1
there's text line 1 there and text line
2 is going to be placed here first we're
going to have an h2 heading that
shows the total amount of results from
the database and then the word paged
then text line 2 is going to render
right here and I already explained what
text line 1 and text line 2 are going to
contain then in the next paragraph
element we're going to put the whole
list which these could be div elements
or whatever you want I just decided to
put them in paragraph elements so they
have a little margin space on the top
and bottom so here is your full list
that's coming out of your while loop
then finally underneath all of that
we're going to put another div with an
ID of pagination controls and then
inside of that we're going to echo out
the pagination controls variable that's
what's going to put out the little
previous all the little numbers and next
now I'm going to put in some CSS it's
going to affect the body element on the
page just to make the font-family what I
want it to be then we're going to target
the div down here called pagination
controls and in the pagination controls
we're going to make the font 21 pixels
and then any a elements that get
rendered to the pagination controls box
those are going to be colored light blue
and we want to make sure that we give
the pseudo selector of visited also a
color of light blue or else you might
get different colors to your little
numbers down there you might not want
that you might want them to stick to one
uniform color so what I'm going to do is
run this exact script on my live server
on develop PHP and list out my
testimonials with pagination you guys
can see this exact script running so you
won't have any doubts to its speed
efficiency or it's working condition so
make sure I save that I'm going to load
it up to my server and run it alright
Here I am a develop PHP calm and let me
pop in the URL to my test pagination
example dot PHP you can see what I have
it says testimonials this is a the text
line one testimonials 105 total paged
and then text line two says page one of
eleven pages then you can see I have ten
different testimonials that I can click
on and go read if I click on this one
you can see that I have gone to that
testimonial pay
is testimonial PHP with an ID of 210 I
click on the next one down I go to a
different testimonial with an ID of 206
now let's check down at the bottom of
our page and look at the pagination
controls now since we're on page number
one we don't need to have a clickable
link for page 1 and we don't need to
even see the word previous on the left
side but what if I click page 2 let's
try that you can see the previous
appears now I have all new different
testimonials for page 2 here and it says
page 2 of 11 in text line 1 or I mean
text line 2 so the text line 2 variable
is going to render out page 2 of 11
because we're on page 2 now down here
you can see that our dead link is
actually the two now which as it should
be so let's click page 3 page 4 page 5
page 6 page 7 so you see how that works
the further you go your your dead link
is going to be in the very center and
you're going to have four links on
either side now let's go to page 10 and
make sure we don't have four more links
that are showing up here because there's
only 11 pages so you don't want to have
10 11 12 13 and 14 to show up
you only want 11 to show up so if I
click on page 11 and if I go to the last
page I don't want the next link to show
up and I want my dead link to be the
last page which is 11 now so if I go to
back to page 7 you can see that I have
everything there showing that should be
showing now if I click 3-1 everything
works perfect see and you can see how
fast that runs it runs pretty pretty
fast and you guys have to remember that
you have to clean your variables because
people can manipulate what's in the URL
and Google is the same way you can
change the URL variables and go to
whatever page you want sometimes but if
I want to go to page 6 I can just put it
right there press ENTER and now I'm on
page 6
says page 6 of 11 you see down here
we're on page 6 so just keep in mind
that people can change these URL
variables very easily and just press
ENTER and your page is going to process
whatever they type in so if I type in
poopoo right there I just want to make
sure it goes to page 1 and our script is
set up to filter all this stupid crap
people might put in up top here so your
script to set up smart if you use this
script because it's going to filter out
any stupid crap people try to put in a
pop to mess with your system everybody
all right ok so I hope this tutorial has
helped you wrap your head around
pagination and all the little aspects
that you might need to work into your
scripts for PHP and whatever kind of
database that you're pulling data out of
and you can also use this same logic
that we used in this script if you want
to use Ajax based pagination so you'll
see sometimes like Facebook and Twitter
they'll have like an ajax based
pagination to where the page never
refreshes and you can make just one
little box
show your pagination results on the page
according to what people are clicking at
the bottom if you guys want I can maybe
put together a script that shows
ajax-based pagination without using any
frameworks it's pretty easy to script
all of this stuff without using any
frameworks because PHP and JavaScript in
their raw form are simple enough for
children to use and the only reason we
use frameworks is when we don't know how
to program something and we need to
accomplish that task but Ajax based
pagination like Facebook and Twitter use
is not very hard to wrap your head
around and I can show you how to do it
without any frameworks you won't have to
use jQuery you won't have to use any PHP
frameworks like CodeIgniter or whatever
people are using it can all be raw code
that you can fully wrap your head around
and script yourself from scratch it's
and it doesn't take too much time so my
point is if you want to see Ajax
pagination from me when you see it from
other people it's probably going to have
jQuery and maybe other frameworks
involved if you want to see Ajax
pagination from me
make another tutorial for you guys you
just got to let me know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
