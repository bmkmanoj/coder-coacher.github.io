actionscript 3 WYSIWYG rich text editor
for input forms forums and anything you
might want to give your users the
ability to format the text that they're
writing that they're typing in okay so
in this one we're going to focus on the
if you want to get to the previous
lessons that's playlist that my channel
especially for this so I'm going to get
the graphics in on this one so let's go
to the dimensions and let's go to I hit
this Settings button down here it brings
up your document properties I'm going to
make mine 700 wide that's what I wanted
on the page in the forums where it's
going to live a develop PHP and I know I
was talking about collaborating with
people on this one but I'm just going to
zoom through it and get it all done and
because I want to use it because bari
and chrome users don't have a cool
posting tool like Internet Explorer and
Firefox users have in my sight that's
not cool man not cool at all so let's
see what the height should be let's make
it five hundred just for now and press
ok now I made a skin in fireworks and I
just wanted to briefly show you how you
can get a skin in on yours let's control
c you can make your as an illustrator
photoshop fireworks and match paint
whatever you want so under the interface
layer we're going to create a new layer
on top of it and then drag it under the
interface layer and call it skin on the
skin layer make sure it's highlighted
press ctrl V because that skin is in our
clipboard ready to be pasted in control
V is paste so now it's pasting it in as
movie clip into the current frame
and now I have a little bit of room on
the edges to make a nice little drop
shadow effect if I 1c so I can put a
drop shadow on that let me go ahead and
do that filter drop shadow filter well
maybe i'll give it a glow yeah let's
give it a glow
blur it out real nice so it looks like
drop shadow and not too strong there we
go now it looks like it has a like a
drop shadow around the whole thing that
is beautiful not even so strong maybe
around 50 48 that's beautiful okay and I
name the develop PHP's custom was rich
text editor now I'm going to position
things around I'm going to make new
buttons design new buttons and then
we'll pick back up and i'm going to show
you guys how to make the color picker
okay I've got my little bold underline
and italics buttons looking the way I
want and they are button instances each
with an instance name and I haven't
programmed in the underlying
functionality yet I'm going to do that
right now before we add any more code I
want to add some code comments here make
input field blank on a rival and we'll
put some other comments in here to
section off different things and then
i'll show you where I comment step out
and then we'll add for the functionality
for the underlining and then I'll drag
out a color picker and we'll program
that in okay now this is a little more
organized here and we can show all of
our our settings a little more easily
when we look at it will be a little more
easy to decipher what's going on where
so what we're going to do now is grab
this whole other section for italicizing
or the whole section for italicizing and
we're going to put it right here
and this is going to be listener and
function that takes care of underlining
and underlining or D underlining
whatever you call that okay so this will
be our underline button grab that right
there put that instance name underline
button make underline
I have that put it here because that's
the function name that's going to fire
off when they select the underline make
this underline click on the line input
format underline which I haven't made
yet i'm going to put that up top in a
second and then format default underline
right here I think that's that
and then we'll just make a new format
right here we'll call it for underlining
and reverse
and let's see format let's get that
format name format underline nope that's
the default format default underline and
then format underline would be here and
here format default underline
I just screwed that all up it's for
italicizing italics italics there we go
default underline that goes here and
here then format underline would go here
and here then we change this to
underline and this to underline okay
let's test out our underlining
functionality by pressing ctrl enter
hello world I want to make a point that
you see this word so if i highlight the
word and press the underlying button
there it is it underlines it now let's
highlight a couple of letters in it and
try and underline those works good it's
underlined the whole word to underline
this section looks like it works fine to
me okay so now i'm going to throw in the
color picker let's get that one in let's
go into the components and grab the
color picker throw it on stage now what
that did in your library is it put color
picker instance there and the component
assets for that component now i'm going
to give it a default different default
color cuz i don't want it to be black
make my purple or something like that a
little more colorful and let's give it
an instance name of color picker
now let's make a new function for that
color picker right here listener the
underlining and grab that whole thing
you'll see
this is listening a function that takes
care of coloring I don't think we'll
need a conditional in here maybe anyhow
in here this event listener is not going
to be a mouse event and actually before
I even do that yeah let me go ahead and
do that I'll show you that right quick
so inside of this listener we have to
select color picker event or we have to
assign that this is a color picker event
or else it won't run like that and then
this will be change so when they change
it we're listening for when they change
the color and we'll name this color
change handler just to have it make
sense so color change handler that's the
function so let's make that the function
name right there functions going to fire
off right there whatever we want to
happen is going to happen right here so
before we do that we have to import the
color picker because you'll get an error
if you don't so import FL dot events
dot color picker event just like we
wrote down here that color picker event
semicolon so now that's imported the
color picker event now we can use it and
so what's going to happen here is we
want to set the format for the color and
that's going to be a variable format so
it's going to be a little tricky so
let's grab this here for italicizing and
let's put it inside of that function
and instead of it saying format italic
it's going to say format color this new
format dot color equals and normally a
color value would look like this if it
would say red right there but we want to
sink in a variable that's going to be
the event target of the hex value that's
coming from this color picker change
event so right here we're going to put
this input field set format right here
and we're going to set it with this
format color and we're going to have
let's see this is going to be tricky uh
okay first let's change this instance
name to what it should be color picker
right there oops
grand ctrl C pop it in place here so
we're at an event listener color picker
event change and this is not a mouse
event it's a color picker event trace
and I'm also tracing that hex value
right there to see if it goes in
correctly like that and I'm trying SBI
and spe here instead of the whole input
field that selection begin index because
we already claimed that up here so we
could possibly use that if it doesn't
work we'll try the other way let's see I
think that's everything we have our
imported our color picker event that all
looks good okay let's try it
it is my output trace it shows us the
hex value now let's see if our Tech's
got colored yes and that was a tricky
little bugger there but we persevered
through it and see if we can color
change that to read this is all the hex
value it's beautiful alright this thing
is really getting there alright so that
takes care of underlining and color
changing add it to the system it's a
beautiful thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
