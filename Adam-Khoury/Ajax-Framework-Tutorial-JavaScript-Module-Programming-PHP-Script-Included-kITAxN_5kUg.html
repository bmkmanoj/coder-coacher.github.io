code the most lightweight Ajax framework
in the you remember zero lines of code
due to power we're going to demonstrate
the simplicity behind creating an ultra
efficient Ajax module to be reusable
site-wide and any pages that need to use
Ajax for data transmissions on your
website but those of you waiting for the
web intersect videos this video is
related to that series because we're
going to use this exact Ajax module of
the social network website training
series
now before we create the most
lightweight efficient modular Ajax
framework in the universe I'm going to
show you a raw JavaScript Ajax request
now and explain it quickly it's just
normal lightning-fast raw unobstructed
JavaScript Ajax and after I explain it
to you tell me if you think that you
need a framework that hides this simple
code from you to perform this simple
task called Ajax or tell me if you are
capable of using Ajax in its raw form
natural unloaded unobstructed like you
see here and after you experiment with
this if you've never used raw Ajax
before you have to make me a deal if you
find that you can easily create your own
Ajax module that works for you you have
to stop using popular frameworks as your
crush for that specific functionality
because now you know how to do it from
scratch and now I'm going to show you
how to make it modular as well so it's
just going to be just as intelligent as
any framework actually it'll be more
intelligent because it'll be a very
efficient lightweight module that only
performs Ajax that's all that your
external file will perform is Ajax and
any page that requires Ajax you just
plug the module right into it okay let's
get all the things that are not actually
the Ajax requests separated so you can
see how many lines there are to it and
how simplistic it is all it does is
transmit data basically from the client
to the server and back all seamlessly
without page refresh okay now let me
quickly explain it to you and you'll see
how very simple it is the first thing
you do is create a new variable with the
name of Ajax
you can name that pooh-pooh i don't care
just change all of these where it says
ajax to pupal if you want so you say bar
Ajax or whatever you want your variable
to be named new xmlhttprequest so what
that means is that your XML HTTP request
object your Ajax mechanism is now
residing in this variable called Ajax
then the next line you run Ajax open
method now the open method takes in
three parameters the first one is the
method you can use poast
or you can use get if you're going to
use get you're not sending any variable
so you would just put
null down here in the send method but
since we're going to use post we're
going to send a couple of URL encoded
variables to our PHP script and the PHP
script is named parser dot PHP which is
the second parameter for your open
method and then true for asynchronous
then you have to set the request header
for the Ajax object and then establish
the onreadystatechange property that
runs every time the ready state changes
is important to understand because the
Ajax object it runs through these five
phases or stages or ready states and 0
is the unsent state it's a request that
has not called the open method yet which
is right here the open method then ready
state one which is opened that means the
open method has been called but the send
method has not been called yet when the
Ajax ready state hits - that means the
headers are received
so the headers and status received then
the third ready state is loading that
means the xmlhttprequest object is
downloading the data back from whatever
PHP script or whatever is sending data
to it back to it and then done means
that all of the data is back from your
server-side script and you can display
or evaluate the data that comes back in
the Ajax dot response text okay now let
me get rid of these because I just
wanted to explain to you the Ajax dot
ready state or your xml httprequest
objects ready state so it's going to
cycle through those states and when it
gets to four and the Ajax that status is
equal to 200 that means the data
transmission is complete both ways so
you sent these variables to PHP and then
PHP sent it back and then you alert
yourself the response text and in simple
terms this is basically the function
that is your data returned complete
listener this function is listening but
when this ready state is equal to four
and the status is equal to 200 and that
happens upon completion of the data
return the last thing you do is you use
the send method and why
I said in here you can send URL encoded
variables like I am C name equals Adam
and then the ampersand separates your
name value pairs and then I put country
equals USA and I can put another
ampersand here but in age equals 12 or
whatever but I'm just going to send two
variables you can send as many as you
like okay now what I want you to do is
take this script whatever you want to
name the file I have my name temp a HTML
and I also want you to have parser dot
PHP alright so I'll zoom in on the code
for partial PHP and you can just type it
in you can see we're picking up the
posted variables coming from Ajax so you
say if is set the posted variable of
name and you're just going to echo back
to Ajax Adam or whatever the name is
being sent is from whatever country so
if we have successful data transmission
we should get back to Ajax the string
adam is from USA and that way that will
confirm to you that you have
successfully sent data from this to this
file this file processed the variables
and then post the data back and whatever
data you want to send back can go back
to Ajax and then Ajax scoops it up here
and where this alert is you can put this
data that comes back the response text
you can put that data that comes back
from PHP inside of a div or whatever you
want to do or you can evaluate it with a
bunch of if conditions in else
conditions and so you take these two
files template CML parse or PHP and you
put them on your live web server you go
to attempt at HTML and all you have to
do is press Enter just make the file run
all you have to do is navigate to temp
dot HTML and you're going to see it
alert data that came back from your PHP
script letting you know that you have
successful data connection between
everything it'll be actually even easier
to use then you see it here and it's
going to make a little more sense
because we can take some of these lines
of code and put them into the module
because if our site happens to use
a JAXA and 100 different files in 100
different places if you don't use it
externally you'll have to have these
lines in every time you make an AJAX
request basically all these lines would
have to be there every time you make an
AJAX request but if your sites going to
do it more than a dozen times on a dozen
different pages that you might want to
externalize it a little bit that's what
I'm going to show you how to do but what
you're looking at here and if you have a
successful data transmission on your
server what you have done now is you
have learned to use raw real ajax
without the help of any frameworks and
it's so simple now I'll ask you now is
that is Ajax really hard once you hear
somebody explain it and you have proof
that it works actually let me prove on
video that it works right so here I am
I'm going to type in temp dot HTML on my
live web server web intersect and I have
the dialogue or the alert pop-up Adam is
from USA so everything's working okay
I'm on my live web server online make
sure you have parser dot PHP and temp
dot HTML both on your server all right
so is that really so hard is that
something right there that code that I
have highlighted is that something that
requires a framework or maybe you just
have the wrong teachers but maybe you
went to the wrong school it took the
wrong curriculum or something because I
know if somebody would have taught you
Ajax as simply as I just put it to you
you would have never turned to any
frameworks for using Ajax in your
applications you would have been like
man it's so easy I can bust that out
without any framework man but like I
said we're going to create our own
framework and you can even allow people
who don't understand the Ajax object
very well to use your external framework
after you get done making it external
and reusable now as I promised I'm going
to show you guys how to create the most
lightweight Ajax framework in the known
universe and we're going to try our best
to gear it in such a way that even a
beginner who doesn't understand Ajax at
all can use it with just a little bit of
direction and then that beginner to be
up and running and he doesn't even have
to understand Ajax at all it'll be like
oh i'm Ajax in my little butt off
they'll think he's awesome but he
squat okay so above the code let's just
put this comment into ourselves and then
down here go down a few lines and we'll
put another comment
it says usage so up here we have modular
portion that we will externalize in a
moment and then the usage portion right
here this is the portion that you would
have in your page we'll set that right
there and the first thing we know we're
going to want there is actually let me
take this comment and put it right up
here right there let's just push all of
that down because we're going to be
taking that out manipulating it just a
little bit to make a framework out of it
that way it can be external reusable and
just a little bit easier to use or maybe
somebody who's not familiar with how the
Ajax really works okay so back up top
let's go ahead and bring this up type in
function ajax obj open closed
parentheses put the opening curly brace
and then go down a couple of lines and
put your closing curly brace and there's
your function nest all set up and ready
to go now the Ajax object function is
going to be externalized and that's
going to be responsible for creating
this xml httprequest object so actually
we can copy this line right there
because inside of it we know that we
want to start assembling our xml
httprequest object instead of calling
this ajax inside of the ajax objects
function let's just call it X so just
make a mental note that this X
represents this new xmlhttprequest
object then directly under that you want
your open method so you can just take
that right there ctrl C put it right
under this line but this you want to
make dynamic and this is the magic
behind the externalizing and modular
functionality really it's just dynamics
its dynamic functionality that makes
this possible so in the Ajax object
function we're going to have to take in
two parameters for the request method
and the URL so up top let's just type in
meth and URL and we're going to take in
those two parameters when this age act
object function is called and we have no
script yet
or no line that's calling that object
yet so we can't pass those parameters
just yet but I will be doing that in
just a second and I'll explain it to you
so what you want to do down here where
it says post is take meThe variable put
it there and the URL variable put it
here and then leave this true for
asynchronous and just be sure to change
this to X because you're working with
the variable X for this new
xmlhttprequest object now the next line
you just want to get this request header
control-c put it up here and just change
Ajax here to X then the last thing in
this external function well it's going
to be external in a moment when we put
it in its own file you want to return X
so when this Ajax object function is
called when it's called to run after all
these lines process the final line is
going to return that xml httprequest
object to the line that called it or
wherever you have called it in your code
or wherever you have called the Ajax
object function in your code this xml
httprequest object will be returned
there now let's go down here to our
usage section we're going to bring all
this code up and you know that we can
get rid of a few things here actually
the Ajax new xmlhttprequest object we're
going to keep that variable named Ajax
but we're going to call the a jacked
object instead now instead of creating
the object directly in the script so
let's put that line in for our Ajax is
equal to call the Ajax object function
right here make it run and pass two
parameters to it the mess method and the
URL you can see we're passing those up
here so if you want to use git you would
just change it right there okay so this
opened the next line the open method
we've already externalize that but we're
going to externalize that in a moment so
it doesn't need to be in our usage
example we can remove that and this line
you can remove that because you already
have it up here all you need is
on ready state change function now
actually this will work exactly how it's
sitting right now I think let's see yes
sir that'll work exactly the way it did
before we changed everything if you run
this script but if you want to make this
usage section really easy and more
humanly readable to somebody who has
never worked with Ajax for instance if
you want to make this brain work for a
stone-cold beginner you don't want to
really have this code that says Ajax out
ready state equals four and Ajax I
status ID equals 200 that's just going
to confuse the framework user the
stone-cold beginner so what you do is in
your modular portion the portion that
will be externalized in just a moment
you put another function and that
function is set up for the Ajax return
to check the ready state so you can have
that confusing looking X dot ready state
equals 4 and x dot status equals 200
hidden away in your in your module where
the user the end user will never see it
so what you do is you just run Ajax
return you can just copy that function
and instead of having that code directly
in here
you just run it like this and then what
you do is so you're calling the function
to run here and this function is going
to return the value of true if the ready
state equals four and the status equals
zero basically if the Ajax request is
done if it's complete it's going to
return this function is going to return
true so you want to say if this function
returned on the Ajax object so you have
to change that X here to Ajax object
because you're passing the Ajax object
as a parameter to this Ajax return
function and it becomes X and it's
scooped up here and it's evaluated here
see how that X is evaluated there then
this function returns true so you want
to evaluate to see if that is in fact
equal to true now this reads let's take
the usage push it down a little bit and
look at it all by itself now this is how
you would tell the newbs
or whoever
how to use Ajax for your particular
framework for instance if you look at
jQuery it shows you a few lines of code
that you can use to use Ajax within the
jQuery system this is the pretty much
the same concept it's just set up a
little different and I wanted to keep it
a little more true to raw programming
that way it's not so abstracted and the
person who is using it gets a little bit
of a glimpse about how Ajax the ready
state change is set up but you can see
it's very you the usage it's very
lightweight and all the user has to do
is set their variable Ajax to call the
Ajax object function and what that does
is creates the xmlhttprequest object
externally and in a way that can be
reused over and over this Ajax object
function will be called many times be
used by many pages and these lines will
never have to be within your application
for the usage section okay now let's
take this press ctrl s and before we
actually externalize this code into its
own file we're going to test it now
because everything should run exactly
how it is here and you should get the
same value that you got before we made
it into a framework okay and I tell you
what just to make sure let's change this
name to equals George now you go back to
your web browser online refresh temp dot
HTML and you can see I have George's
from USA so that proves that my temp dot
HTML my modular based script is working
all I have to do is take this code press
ctrl X and let's say Adams Ajax usage
now you just go to file new JavaScript
and you can remove that initial data
that Dreamweaver might put in and you
just simply place your code the modular
portion that we had in the other file so
you'll have function Ajax object and
function Ajax return I'll press ctrl s
and in the directory for your website
you're going to save this into a new
folder you see we have our images folder
style Boulder are index file that's our
homepage and all that good stuff right
there let's put another Boulder in that
same directory and it's called it j s
now double click inside of it and you're
going to name this file I'm just going
to name mine simply Ajax
save now I'm going to FTP that new jes
folder with the Ajax J s inside of it to
my root directory of my web server
online now you simply tell the user of
your framework that they are to go into
the head document and make sure they put
a link call that script into this file
so basically it's the equivalent of
calling jQuery into your web page and
what you're doing when you're calling
jQuery into your web page is you're
calling all of its code into your web
page which is a lot if you have a look
at the source code for jQuery file
you'll you'll know how much code you're
calling in to your page but when you set
this in here
you know exactly what you're calling it
to your page is this code right here it
will be available basically for use
within this web page and then when you
go to make another file maybe temp to
that HTML template ml whatever and those
files might do totally different things
you can simply add this to make sure all
of that code is readily available if
those other files are also going to use
Ajax on them and you can see the usage
right here so just remember that when
the data gets back where you see this
alert Ajax dot response text is the data
that has returned from PHP and then you
can work with it at that point display
it evaluated whatever you want now let's
make sure this works by loading tempi
HTML to the root directory of web
intersect calm again okay now I'm going
to refresh the page and I get George is
from USA and let me go ahead and view
the page source and so you can see that
what we're doing is basically we've
created a the most lightweight Ajax and
JavaScript framework in the known
universe I don't think you can find a
more lightweight Ajax framework so I
just wanted to show you guys how the
mind
that of a brain work creator works
alright so like I said all you have to
do is show somebody give a little bit of
direction on the usage of your framework
and then offer them the file for
download or you can tell them to link to
the file directly from your server ok so
hopefully you guys now have a more clear
picture of what a framework is created
for why they're created who is creating
them and who they are created for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
