actionscript 3.0 is adding volume
control I find the easiest way to do
this is add a custom slider to stage and
program it to run inside of my inter
frame event so that if the user drags
the volume slider the volume will change
accordingly and instantly and this is
also the very reason why I recently made
this custom sliders for all purpose
programming in actionscript 3.0 tutorial
so you'll go to develop PHP if you want
to grab the file that I'm going to work
with you you click the flash
actionscript 3.0 tab over here on the
left it'll bring you to this page and
right here in the first section working
with the component it's the last
tutorial in the list once that page
comes up you simply download the source
files open it up in flash and you'll be
able to work right along with what I do
and I'm going to pick up right where we
left off in the sound programming video
textbooks last lesson now let me show
you what's in my library anything that
was named symbol 1 symbol 2 I renamed to
actually what they are that way I won't
have any conflicts when I go to import
this custom slider I have here so if you
look in your library you see anything
that says symbol 1 is symbol 2 just
right-click it rename it you can name it
whatever you want but just don't have it
name symbol 1 and symbol 2 or you'll
have conflicts when you try to import
this custom slider so I'm going to go
grab this custom slider ctrl C go right
into this sound application I have here
on this stuff layer I'm going to press
control V so you can see my slider came
in no problem I'm going to put it where
I want it for now I'm a double click
inside I'm going to select the track I'm
going to make sure I make the track
instead of 320 pixels I'm going to
change that to 120 because that's a more
reasonable size for a media volume
control now I can double click on the
stage you go back here into symbol 3
where you have the ball and the track
now let's go up into the code and you
got to change where it says right here
movie clip parent Mouse text because we
don't have that text field here so let's
get rid of that in the code and
everything else is going to
man you don't have to touch anything
else in that code if you don't want to
so now when we press control enter you
should see this a little custom slider
that's not even enabled yet so now you
have a custom slider on stage that'll
work but it's not really controlling
anything yet so to make that control the
sound let's go into our audio movie clip
we have really all the core programming
for the application going on and here
you have your own interframe event and
if you don't happen to have an inter
frame event set up for your sound
application you'll want to add one at
this point to enable this easy volume
control so I'm going to go right under
here where we have our left and right
bar equalizer I'm gonna type in a
comment to myself change volume if they
dragged the volume slider now watch how
little code this takes four little lines
so any custom slider you want to put in
the stage plus four little lines of code
will help you to give you users volume
adjusting abilities for any sound
applications that you have in flash so
the first thing we do is create a new
variable called volume level and that
variable is equal to channel that sound
transform and the next variable is
called new level and that's a number
type variable and that's equal to volume
slider that slider knob dot X position
divided by 100 and the reason why you
have to divide that by 100 and you can't
leave it as volume slider that slider
knob dot X is because flash sound is
based on a scale of 0 to 1 and I don't
know why they set it up that way so
basically if you have a number of 0.1
that means you're a 10% volume if you're
at a number of 0.5 that means you're a
50% value if you're at 1 that means
you're at 100% volume that's why we have
to divide this sliders exposition by a
hundred that way we can achieve that
zero to one scale but this slider is
going to give you output when it's
dragged of 0 to 100 and most custom
sliders you create will so that's why we
divide it by a hundred so then we just
claim the volume levels variables volume
property and give that a value of the
new level the last line is channel that
sound transform is equal to
a volume level that's really the line
that changes the volume all of these are
getting the new volume level ready so
now let's see what that does for us
let's press play now when we press play
remember your volume slider is set to 0
so you're not going to hear anything
you'll have to move your volume up to a
hundred percent now you can go into your
custom slider and just simply move this
to be wherever you want if you want your
volume to start default 50 percent just
put this at 50 then push play start at
50 percent you want to start at 100 you
just put this little ball at 100 so
anywhere you want your default volume to
be that's where you go ahead into your
custom slider and you move your knob to
be that position very very simple very
very simple and you can design this to
look any way you want of course you
would want to go in and change the
design a little bit and it would help
you out a whole lot if you follow the
custom slider creation the whole
tutorial for this custom slider because
I give a lot of insight into how this
slider can be set up and changed so that
my friends is how you can control sound
volume very easily using custom sliders</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
