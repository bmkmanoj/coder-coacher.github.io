another PHP a - ql web development
tutorial and in today's lesson we're
going to talk about emptying or
truncating tables in MySQL databases so
say at any time in your custom
programming in your project you want to
empty the table and set all indexes back
to zero within the table you can do that
through script or through PHP myadmin
and I'm going to show you the script
method first so let's open a create new
PHP file in Dreamweaver and let's just
get rid of all that and save it as on a
desktop as from cake
my table truncate my table dot php' say
and now will code it out first we put
our PHP opening tag x' and let's just go
ahead and put the PHP closing tag and
where you have a nice PHP nest and then
we type include once and here's where
you connect to your MySQL database
through an include file and I showed
tutorials on how to set that up it's
just a smarter way to connect to you or
easier way to connect your - Skrill
database universally through a universal
script so you connect to MySQL you
include the cannot connect to MySQL dot
PHP script so you connect it to your
database and then let's type in SQL
query so we'll just type in the dollar
sign SQL equals mysql underscore query
and then you'll see it change color
there you'll know that it's an official
function then open parentheses close
parentheses and put a semicolon in
between the parentheses we'll put in
double quote double quote in between the
double quotes we'll type all caps
truncate space table space and then you
just type the table name whatever your
table name happens to be and then you
can even write yourself a conditional
here
so if setup an if statement nest and the
condition will be this SQL statement
so if SQL executed we print to the page
table has been emptied and that's pretty
much the gist of the whole script and
index is set back to zero and the index
okay so that will set your table index
back to zero and empty it for you any
table you want inside of the table and
so inside of the MySQL database that you
connect to and the table name goes right
there so that empties it and if this SQL
query happens to fail this condition
won't be met and it will not print this
line to the browser if it runs in an
empties the table it'll print this line
to the browser now let's talk about
doing this in PHP myadmin now I'm
connected to my PHP my admin interface
and this is PHP my admin' is a nice easy
interface for doing things inside of
your MySQL database setting up tables
running operations and you can learn
some PHP in here too if you know what
you're doing but if you're looking at a
table structure say all you have to do
to truncate the table and set all index
back to zero and set the index for the
table back to zero is pressed empty
right here see this empty tab you press
that it says do you really want to
truncate table polls and my table name
happens to be polls press ok and then
PHP myadmin will tell you that it's been
emptied
see truncate table poles you can even
create the PHP code and tear it looks a
little bit different mind but it's
pretty much the same thing okay so
that's how you do it we'll see you next
