processing in PHP we first have to know
what is available to us from the awesome
development team at php.net those guys
are so freaking cool and thoughtful that
they've created extensions and functions
that enable us to complete tasks that
involve image processing much more
easily what they have done is scoured
the tech world and found a few pieces of
handy software that they've been able to
integrate with PHP installations the
software is communicated with using
functions made by the PHP development
team let's take a look at each one the
EXIF extension gives us a way to work
with image metadata metadata consists of
internal information that the file will
store about itself like when it was
created
title size type and things like that the
GD image processing library is the one
that we're going to be focusing on
throughout all the things we demonstrate
within this textbook GD is an open
source code library for the dynamic
creation of images by programmers GD
creates PNG JPEG and gif images among
other formats GD is commonly used to
generate charged graphics thumbnails and
most anything else on the fly while not
restricted to use on the web the most
common applications of Gd involved
website development and that's why we're
focusing on GD image magic is a software
suite to create edit compose or convert
bitmap images it can read and write
images in a variety of formats including
the ffff at all those different formats
you see right there use image magic to
resize flip mirror rotate distort shear
and transform images adjust image colors
apply various special effects or draw
text lines polygons ellipses and Bezier
curves graphics magic is the Swiss Army
knife of image processing comprises of
282 kilobytes physical lines of source
code in the base package it provides a
robust and efficient collection of tools
and libraries which support reading
writing and manipulating an image in
over 88 major formats include
important formats like DPX gif JPEG JPEG
2000 PNG PDF PNM and tip Cairo is a 2d
graphics library with support for
multiple output devices currently
supported output targets include the X
Window System quartz win32 image buffers
PostScript PDF and SVG file output
experimental backends include opengl x
cb BOS os/2 and direct FB so like I
mentioned we are going to focus on the
GD library since that's the one that's
mainly used in web development scenarios
so the next video will start actually
playing with code that will demonstrate
how to use the GD library of functions
within PHP to manipulate process images
I just felt that the textbook wouldn't
be complete unless we explain everything
that PHP has to offer in regards to
image processing but GD is what we're
going to focus on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
