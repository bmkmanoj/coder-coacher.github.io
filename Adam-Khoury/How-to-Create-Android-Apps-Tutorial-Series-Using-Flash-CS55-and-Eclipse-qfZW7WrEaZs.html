handbook which will be a short series of
videos that will familiarize you with
creating Android apps using eclipse and
flash cs5 point 5 apps that you can sell
or offer free from the Android Market so
that all kinds of people using Android
on their mobile device can enjoy your
application for those that do not yet
know what Android is let's quickly
define it Android is a software stack
that renders an operating system
middleware and applications it was
originally created by three men as
Android incorporated in 2003 and built
to be a stack capable of handling mobile
device operations Google bought the
little company in 2005 to kept the three
creators in place and on it continues
fuelled by Google Incorporated now you
and I see an Android explosion about to
take place in front of us and we want to
know how to get our foot in the
profitable door as application
developers before all the great app
ideas are taken and put into place by
others now let's move along to
discussing Android app current
development environments which no matter
what development environment you decide
to use the objective output file type is
an apk file dot apk so when our little
application is finished being created by
us we have to render it out as a dot apk
file using certain development tools
that allow us to do this and what I'll
focus on in this handbook is Eclipse and
flash cs5 point 5 which flash cs5 point
5 is now available as a trial download
or you can just buy the software
directly and eclipse is a free
open-source tool that you can use
now since Eclipse is the more popular
method of creating apk files for the
Android Market we have it listed here
first and when it comes time to create
our first dot apk file for the market we
will demonstrate using eclipse
before we delve into using flash but as
we demonstrate things you'll notice that
Java and actionscript 3.0 are very
similar in structure the code but for
those of you that do not want or know
flash
all I'll cover the use of using Eclipse
and other open source alternatives to
create and render Android Market ready
apps in fact I'll be covering the open
source tools first and between these two
flash cs5 point 5 and Eclipse the more
popular method of creating standardized
Android applications is using the Java
method Eclipse some version of Eclipse
or you can even use the command line
interface to create your APK files in
previous versions of flash there were no
native apk output abilities when using
err you had to install some extension
then in Adobe removed the extension
because they were going ahead with flash
cs5 point 5 so they have that extension
in place would stop people from buying
for life cs5 point 5 so they remove the
free extension that they put for us to
use that would create apk files and now
they have a tool that we can buy I also
feel it's important to let people know
right away before they even get started
in Android app development that you'll
need two accounts a Google account and
then an Android app developer account
which has a $25 one-time fee I think
it's $25 right now to sign up at the
Android Marketplace as a developer who
uploads apps to the market so those are
the things we'll need when it comes time
to put things up at the market and the
development environments we'll need to
build well the most popular ones are
going to be eclipse and flash cs5 point
5 which we are going to demonstrate
using both of those but the focus will
be on flash cs5 point 5 since I'm better
with flash actionscript 3.0 then I am
with Java but like I said you'll see the
code structures are very similar between
the two languages</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
