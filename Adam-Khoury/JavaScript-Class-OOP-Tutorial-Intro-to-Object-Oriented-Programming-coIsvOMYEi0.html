class-based code in JavaScript also
known as oop in JavaScript
object-oriented programming now because
it is a class list prototype based
language special syntax is applied to
our JavaScript in order to achieve OOP
features that we see in languages such
as C++ c-sharp PHP Java Perl Python and
more javascript has no class statement
for establishing your classes like other
popular languages do but this does not
mean that we cannot create class-based
code in JavaScript we just go about it a
little differently now a major focus of
this video is to stress the benefits of
OOP in a general sense and to stress how
up is simply a style of programming and
not always a requirement of your
application to make it work correctly so
we're going to discuss the occasions
when a programmer is required to or when
it would benefit a part of your
application if your code was that way
which is something that a lot of
teachers and professors forget to
explain to students so what happens is
the student learns the basic syntax but
does not learn when and where they must
apply object-oriented programming in
real-world projects now as we're
discussing object-oriented programming
here in JavaScript just keep in mind
that the same general logic would apply
to any language that has object-oriented
features and there are more advanced
topics too in JavaScript that we will
not cover in this video that we might
address in future videos depending on
how this video is rated and commented on
by you guys you might find it extremely
boring or not very useful and in that
case we won't cover it any more and go
into the more advanced topics of it
okay first we'll talk about the basic
syntax for creating classes in
JavaScript then we'll talk about its
benefits and usefulness so create a test
HTML file and let's open up a script tag
go down a couple of lines and close it
now in PHP we use the class statement in
order to establish our classes but in
JavaScript we simply use function so
type in function example class open
closed parentheses put an opening curly
brace go down a few lines and put in
your closing curly brace now here's the
nest already for your class and inside
of it you put properties and methods
that you can tap into when you're coding
instances of this class in your
applications so in order to create a
property within this example class we're
going to type this dot property 1 and
you can name your properties whatever
you want we'll make this one equal to a
number let's make another example
property this dot property - it's going
to equal to the string world and you can
have boolean values in here as your
properties you can have array values if
you want or you can just have a property
assignment like that with no default
value you can just establish the
property if you like and not give it a
default value so it's similar to just
creating your variables in JavaScript
and these properties are only accessible
within the class and your methods are
also accessible only within the class so
now you know how to set up your
properties and in a moment we'll show
you how to access all of this stuff in
your in the front end of your
applications now methods are like
dynamic functions but these dynamic
functions are owned by the class so
creating a method is similar to creating
a function we say this and you give the
method name we'll just name it method 1
is equal to function and you name your
function the same thing method 1 open
closed parentheses open the curly brace
and go down a couple of lines and put in
a closing curly brace now within the
methods parentheses here is where you
can supply dynamic arguments coming in
so we'll name this argument 1 if you
wanted multiple arguments coming in you
can put arc 2
our three and you could really name them
whatever you want but that's how you
supply arguments into that function
dynamically when you're coding instances
of this class
so within method one we're simply going
to return some data which is going to be
a concatenation of argument one and this
dot property two so when we call method
one to run it's simply just going to
return some data to the calling code now
what you're looking at here is the basic
the most basic syntax of a class in
JavaScript for object-oriented
programming and if you're used to
JavaScript and you've ever used closures
in JavaScript you'll see that it's a
little bit similar but the syntax varies
just a little bit and you can also
prototype your methods if you want but
those are concepts that we'll talk about
in later lessons if you guys are
interested in this concept now we'll
demonstrate how to tap into that class
that way you can code against it when
you need to so we'll create a variable
and we'll name it instance one and you
can be naming these properties methods
and variables anything you want I'm just
naming them a certain way so you know
exactly what they are for the lessons
sake
so var instance one is equal to new
example class open close parenthesis
semicolon so now you've created a new
instance of example class and with
instance one you can tap into all the
properties and methods within that
example class now let's just copy that
whole line go down one more line and
create an instance two which is a
separate instance of this example class
object now let's call method one of
example class to run so let's just use
alert we'll just alert ourselves some
data just to see what is returned so
what we do is we say instance one dot
and we apply method one and you can see
method one takes in one argument
so in between parentheses we're going to
put the string hello and that's going to
be argument one when it's passed through
method one it becomes argument one up
here in your class and then it can be
used in the return data or data
processing that you have going on inside
of method one so this string hello
becomes argument one
and if you wanted to send multiple
arguments you just put a comma here and
whatever values you want another comma
and array a boolean value more strings
whatever you want and they can be taken
into method one right here as arguments
okay so now let's run this in our
favorite browser and see what it does
press ctrl s to save the file and run it
in your favorite browser software so you
see I get hello world so if you wanted
to put that in variable form you can
just say var result is equal to and then
just grab this instance one where you
called method one to run on this string
and then you can just alert yourself the
result to see what the result looks like
same thing hello world okay so once
instance one is created you can then use
instance one and dot notation to access
its properties and methods so if I
wanted to access property one I would
just say instance one dot property one
and that's what will be alerted to the
page is the value five I can also change
property values in my code anytime I
want by saying instance one dot property
one is equal to ten and then when I
alert instance one property one the next
line down those changes will be in place
already see so the alert is now ten so
that means the property within that
class for instance one is now ten but
what if I alert instance to property one
because instance two is a whole
different instance of this example class
object so it's property one should have
not changed from five to ten so now
let's run this in our favorite browser
and we should get ten and a five the
second alert is 5 because instance two
property one has not been changed from
five to 10 like instance one property
one has okay so this code up top here is
your class and this is the code that
you're using to access that class and
all of its properties and methods
within it now in order to make this
class code right here we'll just take it
out of this file in order to make that a
class file that is a modular class file
that's external that you call in to your
scripts you just create a new JavaScript
file and in that JavaScript file we
paste this code which is our example
class and make sure we save this file as
example class a s so you see I have
example class J s and my test dot HTML
here so what I'll do is above that
script tag I'm going to open another
script tag and make sure I close it
again and in this one I'm going to put
the source attribute equal to my example
class dot J s so basically what that
does there is it includes all of the
file within example class J s into my
test HTML file so all the code that
lives in example class J s is now
included into my test dot HTML page so
now if I run this I should get the same
results there's the ten there's the five
that means we are in fact connected to
the class so this is how people create
external class files in JavaScript and
it's how a lot of frameworks are also
created so if somebody is new to
JavaScript and they find it all very
difficult to learn they can pick up a
framework that some other more advanced
coder created and put everything into
objects and classes and methods and
properties that the people can tap into
without knowing very much so you as an
advanced developer you can be creating
frameworks for dummies now when they
learn it a lot of people don't really
see the usefulness of object-oriented
programming after they learn the basic
syntax because what happens is
instructors like me and teachers in
schools we will teach you the basic
syntax of object-oriented programming in
JavaScript like we just did but what did
I show you this example class doesn't do
anything interesting in the real world
you can actually do the same things and
get the same data processing and same
data returned
if this wasn't in a class this could
just be
basically a dynamic external function
and work the same way so that's why a
lot of people don't see the usefulness
behind object-oriented programming and
this is where a lot of teachers fall
short for their students but what I'm
going to try and do is go one step
further now to show you an application
that will not work right unless I make
it a class file basically my application
will work the way I intended to work if
I put all my code into a class if I
don't put all my code into a class my
applications not going to work as
intended and this should show you the
usefulness of object-oriented
programming and one such occasion where
it would be a requirement of your
application and not just a code style
that's a preference because even though
object-oriented programming is many
times just a code style and a preference
to the application author and not such a
necessity to the application but there
are some times when object-oriented
programming and class files are a
requirement of the application in order
for it to work right so let me show you
that example now okay now in test dot
HTML I'm going to replace it for all of
this code and what I have here in the
top of my HTML page is a strip that I
wrote for rotating a bunch of cogs
images their cogs and I'll show you what
it does let me render this in a browser
real quick see what it does it spins
those cogs but what's happening is I'm
having a collision in one of my
properties or one of my values rather so
one of my variables this D variable has
a collision because this function
animate does not create new instances of
any objects it just runs the animate
function procedurally so I'm running the
animate function on image 1 image to an
image 3 which you can see right here and
those are my little cogs that you saw
spinning
now the first cog I want to go clockwise
the second cog I want to go
counterclockwise in the third cog I want
to go clockwise so they look like cogs
should see this one in the middle that
should be spinning counterclockwise for
all these cogs to make it look like
they're spinning each other with them
all spinning the same direction it
doesn't make any sense so the one in the
middle has to be going counterclockwise
so you can see my script here that I
wrote it does not allow that because my
D variable is outside of my function but
if I was to take this D variable and put
it inside the scope of a class I can get
the effect that I want now let me show
you that code let's replace that with
the object-oriented style of code for
the same application so basically what
I'm doing is calling new instances of a
class called rotate animation and you
can see my D variable is now inside the
class as a property of that class so now
I'm calling the animate function through
these new instances of the rotate
animation class you'll see what I get
press f12 I'll run this in my favorite
browser now you can see that I have
proper cog movement the cog in the
middle is going counterclockwise like it
should be and there are no collisions in
the degrees variable okay so does that
make sense basically me putting it into
an object-oriented style of code allowed
me to avoid the collisions that I was
having in that D variable so that's one
case that's one occasion where knowing
how to loop and having that in your tool
belt is very handy so even if you're
programming in C sharp or PHP or Java
you're going to have occasions where
you'll have a conflicts and collisions
in the values that you're passing
through these functions if they're
simultaneously handling data so if you
have simultaneous data handling you
might get some collisions within your
data to avoid that you can package
everything up into a class file so
basically this whole script this whole
function rotate animation which is a
class can be put into an external file
called rotate animation j-s and you can
show other people how to use it by
showing them this code which is just the
example code to get their images to spin
by using your advanced external
framework for rotate animations or
whatever
okay now we're going to discuss the pros
and cons which is another thing that a
lot of teachers or professors forget to
do for their students when they're
teaching them object-oriented
programming is explain the benefits and
any negative effects that might occur
from changing all of your code to
procedural over to object-oriented or
class files so let's first talk about
the pros which are the benefits so it
makes your code modular and easier to
share so like you saw how I took that
class and made it into a separate class
file and was able to include it into my
application and use all the code within
it so that's how it makes your code
modular and easier to share I can then
just take that class file and give it to
all of my friends or beginners who don't
know how to code that well if my class
does something really cool like some
kind of animation or data processing
that's really complex or whatever I care
with them really easily and they don't
really have to understand all of the
code at work inside of the class all
they have to understand is how to call
the class and get the data pass through
it so people who are using code
libraries and frameworks are simply
using the modules or the libraries of
code that somebody wrote for them okay
it avoids certain value collisions and
in certain software that you're creating
like you just saw that rotation
animation where I had multiple instances
of an image spinning and I had to have
that one in the middle spin in a
different direction it was very simple
for me to just put all of my existing
procedural code into a class to avoid
the collision that were occurring in my
values which is a point that I have
never heard anybody who teaches
object-oriented programming bring up
this point about avoid value collisions
because it's a very important topic that
is a good feature of object-oriented
programming good a benefit that teachers
never address now it makes your
specialized functions reusable so if you
have a script or you have a website and
on that website there's
to be five different pages that use a
certain function you wouldn't want to
have that function on all five pages so
you can just make a class or a module
out of it and then just include that
function into those five pages that
require it it's a much smarter way to
code now what are the drawbacks or the
cons you might ask and there's really
only one it takes a little bit more
processing power for the server to be
able to call a class file into a script
and then code against it so basically it
adds more lines of code to your
applications so if you do not require it
there's no good reason to use it so
basically if your application is styled
or coded in an object-oriented sort of
way and everything is in class files and
it doesn't really need to be you you're
over bulking your application just a
little bit and you're being dorky extra
dorky when you don't really need to and
all you're doing is adding bytes to your
application because if you can use a
procedural dynamic function in a modular
external sort of way there is no reason
to put it into a class no reason at all
if it works procedurally you can still
make it modular external reusable share
it with your friends and everything
without putting it into a class but as I
showed there was an occasion where my
little application did definitely
require it or it it helped my
application run better when I used it so
I had a good reason to use it but if I
didn't have a good reason I wouldn't put
it into a class okay so I hope the code
examples got your feet wet a little bit
and you know how to at least set up
basic classes for magic functions that
you want to make reusable and if you
guys are really interested in the topic
of JavaScript object oriented
programming I can go a little bit
further actually object oriented
programming is a general a thing to me I
don't view it as just being JavaScript I
don't view it as just being PHP it's
more of a way of coding in all languages
when you have specific tasks where
procedural code just won't handle it or
is not the smartest way to go so at my
site in text format I'm going to be
covering advanced topics for
object-oriented programming like
polymorphism abstraction encapsulation
inheritance and things like that because
you can also make subclasses that are
children to your parent class so there
are more advanced topics that apply to
all programming languages so you'll see
that the concepts that you'll find in
JavaScript object-oriented programming
are the same concepts that you'll find
in PHP C++ or whatever so
object-oriented programming is just sort
of like a universal logic that you apply
to your software your applications only
when they require it and I think a lot
of people go wrong with object-oriented
programming because maybe their teachers
just tell them make everything in your
scripts a class and they don't tell them
why they're even doing it so this is why
you'll see a lot of people who
understand that they can do most of
these things with procedural code you'll
see them arguing with people who use
class files because basically the person
who uses procedural code can reverse
engineer the class file to make a
procedural and it'll work the same way
but with less lines of code so this is
why you have these heated little debates</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
