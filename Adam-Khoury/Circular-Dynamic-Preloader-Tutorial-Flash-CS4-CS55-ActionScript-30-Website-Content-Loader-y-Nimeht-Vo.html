demonstrate what we'll be learning how
to create here it's a true circular
dynamic preloader
for flash ActionScript 3 that has true
listening for file load progress and it
spins around in a circle using a wedge
type animation that has 100 frames
that's directly tied to your load
progress enjoy
create new ActionScript 3 file change
background to black frame rate to 30 if
you're in cs4 your frame rate is already
30 you don't have to touch that you suck
a button now on this layer I'm going to
rename that double click it rename it
shell this is where I'm going to put the
cosmetics that the circular preloader
will display behind so our circular
preloader will display behind these
cosmetics that we put in here oval
primitive tool so you hold down the
shapes tool grab the oval primitive drag
it out the stage and let's give it even
numbers 200 by 200 really the numbers
really no matter and what we'll do is
let's go ahead and pull that Center
radius point out maybe right about there
now let's grab the shapes tool again
oval primitive and put one right in the
center make sure that has even numbers
too on the width and the height let's
make it 140 by 140 there we go and let's
slap it right in the middle there and
let's make sure the X and the y values
the coordinates here are not decimal
that really wouldn't be a big issue
either but I just don't like them to be
decibel all right let's make sure this
is in the center best we can that looks
good enough to me so what will happen is
let's go ahead and close this one off
grab that inner radius point close it
off so what will happen is our loader
will show behind these graphics you can
even highlight both of these convert the
symbol
movie clip that's fine symbol 1 in the
library
we're not going to need to give it an
instance name so it's all good now let's
create a new layer and rename that one
let's call it loader
call it circular loader and drag that to
the bottom so just shale layers on top
of it because we want our loader to be
behind it okay okay I'm gonna make this
just a little darker okay well I just
decide to run really dark gray matte
okay now let's lock the shell layer on
the circular loader layer I'm going to
hold down the shapes tool and grab an
oval tool I'm going to grab the oval
tool and not the oval primitive tool
this time just the regular oval tool I'm
gonna hold down shift to say to stay
perfectly circular with the shape and
draw it out and I'm going to make sure
this one's even - let's just make that
the 280 by 280 just so it's a little
bigger than our graphics there that
might even be too big and say 242 for a
bye - ye alright now let's put that
right there and let's change the color
there we go
let's change that to a white okay so
once that's on top let's get those
coordinates even actually it's
underneath rather but you can't select
the shell layer because it's locked
right now let's make sure this looks
about even that's good now I'm going to
double-click inside this drawing object
to where it's all dots editing the
native symbol there and I want to drag
out a rectangle I'm going to drag out
this rectangle and I'm going to change
the color of it to green or something
and double click inside of it get the
native shape out of it where it's all
dots control X double click back out
into this shape where this is all dots
in this circle press control V now this
is going to punch out this circle so
what we can do is let's just see if we
can get it about half way by eye
and it looks about right
right about there let it go
deselect it select it again and move it
out of the way and you'll see that it
punched it okay
press control X go back into scene one
okay now we have a semicircle a half
circle there and that's what we want to
get this animation started it's going to
be a dynamic animation with 100 frames
so your load percentage can talk with
that animation okay and at this point I
don't want you guys to get the wrong
idea and think this semicircle this
white semicircle is our bar it's not
going to be our circular loader it's
just going to be the mask for our
circular loader so I'm going to
transform it now let's put that Center
the transform dot right there at the
center point and make sure we get the
skew a symbol to come up here on our
mouse on our pointer and then hold down
shift and it will move it at certain
angles fixed angles to where you don't
have a free movement it's fix it at
fixed angles that's what you want now
I'm going to move it over to this side
now I'm going to make sure we're in a
good position here now once that's in
place right-click convert the symbol
let's call this main loader clip
just call it loader clip in the library
and that's good now double-click inside
of it and here we're going to work
inside of it now on the first layer
let's rename this one first half let's
make another layer above that call it
second half and I'll show you why we're
doing that in just a second now the
layer below first half let's make
another layer and drag it below first
half and let's call it
let's call it circular because this is
where the graphics for the circular
loader are going to be the actual
circular loaded the way it's going to
look and it can be movie clip or
whatever you want okay now let's get
those graphics on there let's go ahead
and grab another oval actually we can
grab the one that's there nevermind that
don't make a new one just grab this one
here it's already a drawing object and
it's semicircle that's what we want so
let's press control C control and lock
that layer now you press control C you
copied it now put it on the circular
graphics layer right there and what you
want to do now is take this one and spin
it so where it's on the other side lay
it right there okay now with that piece
there that drawing objects on the
circular load of graphics I'm going to
change that to the color I want my my
load bar to be and I'm going to adjust
the size to where it fits in there
inside of the graphics the skin we made
because that's all we want the show
make it even a little smaller than that
I'm holding shift while I'm dragging
here to make sure I don't distort my
shape okay that looks good
now I'm going to make it to where I
can't see that first half layer I'm
going to grab this circular load of
graphics layer I'm going to rename it
one now I'm going to make another layer
above it and this is going to be
circular load of graphics too because
there has to be two halves this one
modify transform actually let's just go
ahead and hit the transform tool on it
and skew it around holding shift so we
have perfect angles there there you go
now we can bring these together make
sure they're together and then this one
can be circular graphics to there so
pretty much you just want to have of
whatever your graphics want to be if you
want them flashing glowing or whatever
you turn them into movie clips make them
animated okay so let's go ahead and make
sure we can see these again so on top we
have the first half now we put the
second half and that's going to be on
the opposite side and these are going to
be spinning around to reveal certain
things for us when we need them to okay
so this circular load of graphics one
this has to be right underneath the
first half layer circular graphics too
that has to be underneath the second
half layer see how I set that up now
there is nothing confusing about this
you just have to follow along carefully
I'll show you how to do it right okay at
this point we're really close to being
almost about done so let's press
control-c let's highlight this first
half press control-c lock that first
half layer actually lock everything but
the second half layer highlight the
second half layer press control shift V
then grab the transform tool free
transform
and since our dot is still here in the
center that's good we can just put it on
the other side and there you go and this
is what you want so this is the setup
you want and the layering you want and
you can make one more layer on top let's
call that layer actions because we'll
have a stop actions there okay now we
animate these two halves let's unlock
everything this one is going to be from
one to frame 50 so let's go ahead and
make a new keyframe let's go ahead and
extend out the circular graphics one all
the way out to 100 by pressing f5 the
first half layer let's go ahead and
animate that by going to frame 50 giving
it a new keyframe by pressing f6 and on
that new keyframe we're going to skew
this to the other side right there now
here we're going to right-click in
between somewhere there and create
motion tween or if you're in cs4 it will
probably say create classic tween and
that's the one you want okay you got to
make sure see what happened to me see
this dot you're going to make sure it's
in the right spot before you start that
so let me go to backtrack remove between
remove frames start back where we were
right here so I like that make sure the
dot is at the center where it should be
that's how I should have started then go
to frame 50 then right click and center
create motion tween on this one you want
to make sure it's on the other side and
then it will do the motion tween for you
see that so basically what we're doing
is we're making that wedge it's going to
be a mask
well that half that semicircle is going
to be a mask showing this first
semicircle it's going to reveal that
first semicircle in a perfect pie shape
pattern to where to look like a load bar
should okay now let's go ahead and
extend those frames out by pressing f5
I'm going to do the same thing to the
top half now
okay now let's extend circular loader
graphics to all the way out to 100 by
pressing at 5 and that doesn't make a
new keyframe pressing at 5 it just
extends frames to display through that
section okay now the second half I'm
going to drag that I'm going to drag it
all the way out to frame 50 and then I'm
going to press f6 on frame 100 make a
new keyframe on that one in the center
I'm going to create shape motion tween
if you're in cs4 it's create classic
tween I think and then on the last frame
there 100 let's skew it around like we
did the first one first let's make sure
that that is in the center before we
have the same mishap that's the first
time hi
okay now there we go now let's spin it
around it's exactly what we wanted you
see what's going to happen
it might even need to be a little closer
let's move it one and one see how that
is perfect now I think that's everything
let's mask everything now so let's go to
second half is going to mask this layer
first half layer is going to mask this
layer so let's highlight the second half
layer right click it select mask then
the first half layer right click that
one select mask now run your timeline
grab it run it through there you see
what's going to happen see this one
circular the graphics to those shouldn't
show these first frames so grab this
drag it all the way out to frame 50 as
well that's how it's supposed to be okay
it looks perfect to me
looks like I'm frame 1 we need to move a
few things closer I'll see if I need to
fix that now let's put the stop action
up here press f5 let's see if 6f6 st
Opie Opie close parenthesis and
semicolon stop action and we're going to
put a stop action on frame 1 as well so
this thing doesn't play by itself it's
going to be controlled by the load
progress of our file that's what this is
all about but let's press ctrl n to see
what we have see that
that is beautiful that's exactly what
you want
yeah it looks like that first one moves
a little bit so let's go and unlock
everything and run out to Timeline to it
is simple you have a little mishap going
on this one should be this way and this
way yep now it's perfect
okay look at that it's beautiful all you
have to do is tie this movie clip to
your load percentage Progress which I'll
show you right now I'll even make a
little file and I'll prove to you that
it works nice let's go to back to scene
1 everything in here is done I believe
let's look at it one more time yeah
that's perfect
okay I've got this bad boy sunk into my
simulated flash file
my whole flash website and we'll see if
this thing truly acts the way it should
so let's make sure we have an instance
name on it which I gave it an instance
name of circle loader you'll see that's
on the circle loader layer that's not
the skin that's the thing behind it
remember our circle loader that has an
instance name a circle loader now let's
look at the code now instead of my load
text only going and showing the
percentage we want that load bar to as
well this is going to be full real
dynamic so let's say circle loader dot
go to
and play
percent
since we have exactly 100 frames inside
of that movie clip that animation circle
loader animation we're good to go
so circle loader dark go to and play
percent that's exactly what we want now
let's press f12 and put it on the web so
we can actually see it some load
progress on your local machine you won't
see it in a in your full sight it'll
just go straight into your site because
everything's already loaded on your
system but if it's on the web that's
where you really want it to load up so
let's FTP it check it out okay I'm going
to navigate to the directory the test
directory that I have this file and
there you see perfect perfect
functionality beautimous
okay so in the flash pile you see we
have the actions layer that runs the
pre-loading of the site load texts are
just sitting on top of the shell the
shell which is sitting on top of the
circular loader
which is a PI animation of 100 frames
which is directly tied and I change the
go-to and play to go to and stop because
the go to in play did not function
correctly go to and stop is the better
method here so circular loader that go
to and stop percent which is tied to 100
0 to 100 which is what this animation is
and I'm beautiful that's our goals you
saw it here first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
