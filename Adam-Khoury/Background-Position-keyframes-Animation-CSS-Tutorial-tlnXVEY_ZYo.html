backgrounds for documents and in banners
when doing front-end work for clients I
made a tutorial for animated backgrounds
about three years ago that was not
nearly as easy or slim as the approach
that I'll show you today you can get
some really cool-looking results when
animating backgrounds under your content
I'll also show you the 2013 tutorial
that I made for this so you can see the
drastic difference in code reduction and
easier production in this newer approach
your backgrounds can animate in any
direction up down left or right or you
can even combine directions to make them
go diagonally if you want and we'll be
using the CSS keyframes rule and the
background position property to perform
this effect before we get started in the
code let's take a look at the finished
product of some of these effects here we
have a star field that's animating to
the right here is a brick wall that's
animating left and here's a wave tile
that is animating to the left within a
container that can be any size and shape
that you want so you can go across the
whole page or you can contain the
animation within any size banner or
container that you want we'll begin with
the bare bones of a web document the
first thing we'll do is go into the body
element and we'll just put in a div and
make sure we close that div then we'll
give it an ID equal to banner now in the
CSS portion of our document which you
can externalize if you like but I'm just
going to keep it in the document for the
tutorials sake I'm going to target the
body element I'm going to give it to
properties margin zero pixels and
background or black then I'm going to
target this banner in the CSS you can do
that in two ways you can put in div and
then target the ID of banner or you can
just target the ID of banner maybe
you'll have it in a paragraph element or
some other kind of container but I'll
just target the div explicitly
this just helps me know that this rule
this CSS rule is targeting a div in the
document but you can do it any way you
want it I'm going to make the width
equal to a hundred percent so it goes
all the way across the whole page then
I'll set the height equal to the height
of my little tile and let me show you
the tile before we go any further so
here my graphics editing program I have
a brick tile that's a repeating tile and
it's important if you want things to
animate smoothly to have a repeating
tile that has a repeating design that
way it's seamless as it moves you can
see its width is 300 and the height is
also 300 so it's just the square and
these dimensions 300 by 300 are going to
come into play within our code a little
bit now I'll set the margin 0 picks Auto
just in case we wanted to have it in a
centered container but since it's going
to span across the whole width of the
document you really don't have to have
this property in place only if you want
it to be a centered banner or something
like that and if you're going to have a
banner you can also set the overflow to
hidden that way you won't see any
content or background outside of the
space of your container and if you're
going to go across the whole page like
I'm going to do here you can just leave
this property out also and now we're
going to set the background property I'm
going to make that equal to URL of my
brick tile image which is a JPEG then
I'll set the background repeat' property
as repeat X so that repeat X means
repeat along the horizontal axis repeat
Y would be repeating along the vertical
axis up-and-down repeat X is left and
right the horizontal axis now we're
going to set our animation property and
this is what actually animates that
background position for that little
brick tile background we'll name the
animation animate background we'll make
an anime
in a linear fashion we'll set the
animation duration to 15 seconds which
is sort of like the speed and I'll
adjust that to show you how it changes
the speed and then we'll set to infinite
so the animation will just keep
repeating and never stop it will loop
now I'm going to pop in the keyframes
rule that will set up this animate
background animation so we have a
keyframes rule its name is animate
background you can see that we're
referencing that right here in the
animation property so keyframes animate
background and what we're going to do is
go from background position 0 pixels to
background position 300 pixels and I'm
going to give you guys links to pages or
I'll show you pages where you can study
in depth the background position
property animation property and all the
other properties here I'll show you link
to where you can study all of the CSS
properties that I'm using here that way
you can understand what I'm doing with
these numbers now at this point you have
a completed effect you have your brick
wall or whatever kind of repeating tile
that you want moving to the left if I
want that to move to the right instead
of the left I'll just remove this
negative value make it a positive value
300 pixels you can see that it moves the
other direction now and let me see I
think I can repeat both x and y axes by
just putting repeat here and then I can
put a zero pixels in front of the 300
pixels and then 0 pixels here and now we
should have an animation that goes along
the vertical access axis let's check it
out you see now the brick wall is moving
down if we want the brick wall to move
up then we can put negative 300 pixels
here and it will be moving up instead or
animating up does that make sense
and remember I'm going to show you the
background position property the
document that explains that in depth so
you can understand why I'm using these
numbers in this way now let's go ahead
and put some content in this div and
show you how easy it is to layer your
content right in there so just as you
normally would inside of a div you put
some content it can be any elements or
text that you want in there and then
I'll put a little CSS rule targeting
this h1 element that's inside my banner
so div banner target child h1 element
inside and give it a color of white and
padding of 50 pixels and see what that
gives us so you see now we have a brick
wall moving up or any direction that we
want it to move and then we have content
sitting right above it or layered above
it and things are not really layered
because of we're using the background
position property to animate the
background for that div so the content
can just lay in there like normal and
you don't have to layer anything in any
special kind of way now let's see if I
put a value here also of 300 pixels
let's see what kind of effect we get now
we have the wall moving diagonally it's
moving up and to the right we wanted to
move down into the left or any direction
that we want it to go all we have to do
is play with these numbers so I'll just
leave that on zero but I just wanted to
add that little tip that way you can get
diagonal animations or animations that
go any direction that you want so what
if I change the width of this banner to
maybe 600 pixels now you can see the
animation is contained within that space
let me make it go to the along the
horizontal axis instead
see you can contain the animation within
any size container that you want or you
can span across the whole page so I'll
just leave this on 100% width but just
keep in mind that you can contain that
animation in any size container that you
need and that's pretty much it now you
can create your own repeating tiles
within your favorite graphics editor you
can find some online to get some
inspiration and ideas but you don't want
to just take those you really want to
create your own that way you don't get
in trouble for using other people's
copyright images and if you guys want
I'll do another tutorial showing how you
can animate multiple backgrounds within
your container to have a sort of
parallax effect to where one one image
one background image would move at a
certain pace at a certain rate or
certain speed and then the other
background image since we can have
multiple background images inside of our
containers in css3 that means we can put
multiple images so basically above this
brick wall I could have another PNG
transparent background image that moves
at a different speed along with that
creating a sort of parallax effect if
you guys want to see a tutorial like
that just let me know and it'll be no
problem for me to do it now let's adjust
the speed of that so if we go into our
animation settings which I'm also going
to show you all of these in-depth
details about the animation property so
you can learn more about that but let me
just change the speed to maybe five
we'll see that that the wall increases
its rate of movement it's going much
quicker now so as make this a lower
number if you wanted to go fast or a
higher number if you want to slow it
down and that's pretty much it I'll
leave you guys to it to experiment and
have some fun and like I said if you
want to see how to move multiple images
within this container background and
create a sort of parallax effect just
let me know and I'll try and rig that up
and show you the code example for that
- I almost forgot to show you the
references that I was talking about
first let me go to the CSS video
tutorials and I'll show you the old way
it's in the animation rigging section
animated repeating tiled background
keyframes tutorial this is the old way
that I used to do it many years ago
which is not as easy to rig up and it's
not as intuitive and it's just a lot
more bulky and cumbersome and you really
don't want to use this approach anymore
but a few of you might remember seeing
this tutorial and you can see that we're
layering a be a div that's a banner
backdrop and then layering the banner
content on top of that which is not the
smartest way I go about it in 2016 so
for 2016 we want to use the animate the
background position property you can see
we're using keyframes here but we're not
doing it as cleverly in this old
tutorial so that's why I'm updating it
with new smarter code and then you can
go into the CSS properties section and
you'll see the animation property is
here so you can learn about the how you
can rig up these animations using the
shorthand animation property this is the
shorthand animation property but then
you have all the longhand animation
properties and you can use all of those
instead if you like like animation delay
animation Direction duration the fill
mode iteration count animation name the
play state and the timing function so
instead of using the shorthand animation
property like I did in this tutorial you
can use the longhand properties if you
want that's no problem and then we had
the background settings which was the
background position property that's the
one that that we used in the tutorial to
move the add to animate the the
backgrounds within the container so they
have you can use several different
approaches to positioning your
background images within your container
what I use was the length that way I can
use numbers I can animate these numbers
which is so basically the 30 pixels
would be your offset left and right and
then your 10 pics will be your offset
top and bottom so that's your horizontal
axis and then your vertical axis you can
also use percentages and you can animate
these numbers as well if you want to use
percentages and then finally you can use
keywords you might find it easier just
to use the numbers the length numbers or
percentage for animation purposes so
that's pretty much it you can find all
of that within the CSS tab here there's
all the properties and then the video
tutorials if you want to look at other
different things that are unrelated to
this okay so I hope you've enjoyed this
exercise and like I said if you want to
see how to animate multiple background
images within the one container or in
the document body itself creating a sort
of parallax effect where multiple images
move at different speeds just let me
know and I can rig that up and show you
guys how that works too if you have any
questions or concerns you can leave them
in the comment section of the video I'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
