we will demonstrate all about how to use
the html5 canvas tag you can learn
drawing methods or animation methods and
more the canvas tag is aptly named it
supplies you with a means of drawing
things through script and it renders in
a browser things can be stationary or
animated inside of a canvas tag we can
use JavaScript to draw what we want in
the canvas so in this series we will
demonstrate some of the drawing methods
one can use we will also demonstrate how
to animate things inside of the canvas
tag using JavaScript and here is a
rundown of what we will be instructing
throughout the series we can create the
canvas tag and talk about its attributes
then we will enable JavaScript drawing
methods on that canvas we'll show how to
draw lines through the script rectangles
through script circles and gradients all
through script and we're going to draw
text characters through script set the
font size and the font family will show
how to draw images into the canvas tag
through script will show how to animate
things inside of the canvas tag using
JavaScript and towards the end will show
how to intermingle PHP variables and
values into the draw methods that way
you can make everything dynamic or even
database-driven
okay let's begin with a new web page
mine is a web page called example that
HTML but yours can be a dot PHP file if
you need it to be now keep in mind when
using any features of html5 that some
older browsers might not support it and
also keep in mind that html5 is not yet
released as a working standard and you
must also keep in mind that if you want
this page or whatever page you're
working on to validate as valid html5
you would require the doctype tag right
above your HTML tag all right the first
thing we'll do is go into the body tag
of the page and I'm going to pop in my
canvas tag and establish it first what
we're going to do is draw into it using
JavaScript so I gave my canvas tag an ID
of canvas one so through JavaScript
that's how I will communicate to this
canvas tag using that identifier canvas
1 the width of my canvas I can make
anything I want I'll make this one 400
by 300 hi so there is the canvas tag
along with its attributes now let's set
up the script tag in the head of the
document so right in the head tag I'm
going to pop a line in there for the
script tag and then I'm going to go down
one line and make sure I close my script
tag off now in between the script tag is
where I can place any JavaScript needed
to draw into that canvas tag that I
established now since when we draw we're
going to be using a function called draw
so it makes good sense we'll have a
function called draw and when that
function is executed that's when the
items are actually drawn into our canvas
does it make good sense because that's
what we're going to set up so let's pop
in a line in the script tag here and
this line reads window dot onload equals
draw that means when the window is fully
loaded the draw function will execute
and we're going to put that draw a
function in right here you can just type
in the word function space draw open
closed parenthesis then open the curly
brace go down a couple of lines and
close off your curly brace and there's
your function everything you want to
happen inside of the function goes right
here okay the first thing that I want to
occur in the function is assign our
canvas element to a variable so I create
a variable called canvas and that's
equal to document get element by ID of
canvas 1 so I'm targeting that canvas 1
ID of my canvas tag so that canvas is
now in a variable that canvas tag is
essentially in a variable right here for
the identifier for it is any way that
way I can communicate to that canvas tag
to JavaScript more easily just by using
the word canvas that could just be a C
I've seen some people just have that as
C just to make life easier for them but
it could get confusing so I just put the
word canvas now the next thing we have
to do is create the html5 context object
to enable draw methods so we use this
get context of 2d on our canvas and that
is a variable called CTX okay so now
you're ready to use any of the draw
methods that you want on that
t X variable so what would happen is you
say C T X dot whatever draw method and
that's where you put the name of the
draw method and then you put the methods
rameters in between the parentheses and
that's how it works I'm going to show
you how it works right now your canvas
items will be placed by X&amp;amp;Y coordinates
so basically what that means is if I was
to draw a rectangle into a canvas tag
like that
right now I'm in fireworks so I'm just
demonstrating you see how I would be
matched up to that corner that would be
zero and zero I would be a zero X and
zero Y if I went ten x that would be one
two three four five six seven eight nine
ten my object would be there and if I
gave it a position of 20 Y it would be
one two three four five six so that's
where my object would land or would be
drawn onto the canvas by giving an
exposition of ten Y position of 20 X
position of a hundred and something
would be way down here you see what I'm
saying so this is your X plane and
horizontal is your X plane and why the
vertical that's your vertical plane will
just remove this line because that's not
needed I was just discussing things
let's pop in these two lines you can see
these two lines are just code comments
that I put in for you and what that does
is show you how to set up your
parameters for these methods and what
we're doing here is we're creating a
rectangle which is drawing a rectangle
to the canvas one of the most basic
things you can do in the canvas tag so
the first line is we target the CTX
object and we set a fill style using RGB
a values so you have red green blue and
alpha
that's your opacity the last parameter
is your opacity the other three are red
green and blue
that way you can get any color that you
need for your drawn item the next line
is how we actually draw the rectangle
into the canvas tag you can see I put a
little code comment in there for you
that shows you which parameters you want
to target for certain adjustments
your x-coordinate where it's going to
live in its X plane where it's going to
live in the Y plane the width of your
box and the height of your box so I can
make my box Square by going 22 make sure
its width and height is equal 22 22 so
I'll have a square now instead of a
rectangle it will be sitting at
exposition of 36 and a Y position of 10
so now let's press control s make sure
we save this so let's run this in say
Chrome let's try it in Chrome you can
see it drew my block out to the canvas
tag using javascript to draw it and
let's also run it in Firefox okay so you
can see there is my little green block
and keep in mind some older browsers or
browsers that do not support html5 fully
yet will not render that block now what
if you wanted two blocks you just copy
that line and change its position to
have a different x position in Y
position or you can have the same x
position but just a different Y position
so let's change the Y position to
something like 50 on this one and now
let's run that in Chrome you see we have
two blocks now if you wanted that second
one to have a different color you would
just put this CTX pill style in between
those and let's put hey let's put this
one 200
let's put 200 here make this one zero
again save that run it in a browser
that's for html5 you can see now you
have two different color blocks and
that's how it works so now you've seen
how to set up and start drawing using
JavaScript into the html5 canvas tag
we'll start to show you all the
different things you can do all the
different things you can draw ways you
can animate and things like that we'll
also show you how to intermingle PHP
variables into the values of things that
you're drawing okay which is a very
important aspect for advanced developers
who like to do things
dynamically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
