module our main JavaScript module will
be the general-purpose file that
externalizes the most frequently used
JavaScript tasks throughout the entire
website the beauty of the modular
approach we will be taking to JavaScript
is that you get a nice extensible
framework that you can build upon very
easily by yourself or with others and
most importantly you will understand
every line of code being called into
your pages
they open your index dot PHP file which
is the home page of your website go to
file save as and just name this new file
test dot HTML save and I'm going to get
rid of all of the data within the body
element and all of the data within the
head element now within the body element
I'm going to place three divs so I have
div one div two and then dip three on
the head element we'll open up a script
element now pop this function into place
its function underscore the name of the
function is simply underscore now in
JavaScript the only two characters I
believe you can use in JavaScript are
the dollar sign or the underscore if you
try to use any other characters in there
you're going to get a syntax error so
you can use either dollar sign or
underscore whichever you choose I'm
going to use underscore and this
function takes in one argument which is
whatever element ID that we want to pass
through the function as a string and
what the function simply does is it runs
the document.getelementbyid e method for
that variable and it returns it to the
line where it is called so what you can
do is let's grab the script element up
here let's go down under our divs and
let's open up a new script element now
let's see if I can use my get element by
ID function named underscore to target
div 1 plus 8 underscore open closed
parentheses and inside of the
parentheses I pass the parameter that's
going to be picked up as X when it runs
through the function parameter I want to
pass as the string div 1 which is the ID
of my first divyam on page then I simply
say dot inner HTML is equal to howdy
doody pilgrim so if everything goes
right with our document get element by
ID dynamic selector function we should
get the string howdy doody pilgrim
placed in as inner HTML into div 1 so
press f12 to test and there you go howdy
doody pilgrim that string got placed
into the inner HTML of that div so let's
target the next two divs change this to
div 2
in dip three now this will show you how
this function is running dynamically for
any elements that you want to select
make these say something else press ctrl
s and run that in your favorite browser
so there you go
you get how to do the pilgrim hello
world and pie is good now like I said
you can make this a dollar sign and then
now this will look very familiar to you
down here doesn't it yes that's the
jQuery type selector but we're going to
make ours underscore because I don't
want anybody getting confused between
the two different systems ours is going
to be a very modular system whereas
jQuery is a very heavy one file solution
so let's make sure this says underscore
again and that shows you how you can
create a dynamic function that we're
going to externalize right now so let's
take this function ctrl X and remove it
let's go to file new javascript press
ctrl s and if you don't have a j/s
folder yet for JavaScript files create
that now jas and inside of it name this
file this new javascript file main so
now you have mange a s and you just
paste in your document dot get element
by ID selector function you press ctrl s
and then here you just make sure that
this script element has a source
attribute or in the Jes Boulder we have
mange a s then you can bring this right
back up here and that shows you now that
mange is is a module it is in fact the
main module of a website and it's going
to also get some more functions that
we're going to place into it like toggle
function because you would want to open
and close boxes on your website or maybe
slide them in and out on probably most
of your pages nowadays when you want to
show people some content that's not
readily visible in the page you want
maybe a magic box to pop up some HTML
content full of whatever you want just
magically appear maybe you want it to
fade in or slide in or whatever like
that you're going to need some kind of
toggle mechanism so we're going to have
a table
function in here as well for our content
containers on our website and we'll make
that part of this main jas module
because it's also something that's going
to be used pretty frequently throughout
the whole website so in test out HTML if
you run this now you should still have
your selectors functioning so let's run
it
we sure do everything is working really
nice when you want to use document get
element by ID and maybe you have to use
that ten times within one little script
on a page you don't want to have to
write that in every single time you can
just use a small selector like that and
actually this function in main is it can
be named whatever you want you can name
it X you can name that capital D if you
want to name it capital D that's fine
you can name it get LM by ID if you want
to but it's best to keep that a very
very short name like underscore okay you
can close test HTML and in your
index.php what you want to do is before
the head tag closes you want to call the
main jes file because main j s will be
used on most every page and take index
dot PHP once again go to file save as
and now you're going to save this as
sign up this is going to be the page
where your sign up registration form is
going to be so you can change the title
here to sign up and you can see that
we're already tapped into our main CAS
and on the signup form you know the form
where people are going to put in a
username create a password when they
initially register to the website now in
your form if you want to have things
like fading effects sliding effects
expand retract effects which my form is
probably going to have some fading
effects and it's also going to use the
Ajax j/s that we created so we have to
go and grab all of these J's files and
they're already created so we don't have
to go through that process once again
we're just going to go and grab them
right now
okay go to develop PHP calm and in the
JavaScript video tutorial section we're
going to first grab the Ajax if you
don't have that already from that video
we did yesterday here it is Ajax ejs so
I'm just going to grab the code just for
that go into Dreamweaver where I have
mange s I'm going to go to file save as
Ajax save and then replace the code with
what I have in my clipboard press ctrl s
this expand retract let's grab that one
is there expand + retract animations
let's just grab that code or the expand
retract j/s module + ctrl C and
Dreamweaver you go take Ajax J's file
save as expand underscore retract save
and put the proper code in place and
press ctrl s now let's grab the auto
scroll animation because we might use
that one as well
let's see auto scroll touch a s let's
grab the code for that ctrl C take
expander track go to file save as auto
scroll C and put the proper code in
place ctrl s and here is the JavaScript
html5 custom fade animation it says this
code is for the external file name fade
effects j/s so let's grab that code ctrl
C file save as beta FX save press ctrl a
and then control V to paste in the code
for the fade effects and ctrl s okay now
take fade effects auto scroll expand
retract Ajax J s modules and FTP them up
to your live web server into the J's
folder we go to file open you can see
our folder structure we have our index
page here
root folder and we have the images
folder the style folder PHP includes and
now j/s with these one two three four
five modules that you want to FTP up to
the web into this j/s folder now in the
next video part six we will have
actually inside of signup to remove
everything within the body press ctrl s
and in the signup page we're going to
have mange a s loaded in and we're also
going to load in fate of XJS Ajax EAS so
this page signup dot PHP is going to use
Ajax and maybe some animations that we
choose I won't even use expand retract
I'll just use fade effects in my form
well I'll see what I want to use when it
comes time to make it but like I was
saying the signup form they forgot your
password form the login form those are
things that you might want to give fade
effects that correspond to your Ajax
requests in your forms whatever you want
to do and I know how you guys like to
use your framework so you can also just
use whatever frameworks you want in
place of these modules if you'd like to
go a different route with your
JavaScript so in part 6 we'll begin
creating the user interfaces the initial
forms for your website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
