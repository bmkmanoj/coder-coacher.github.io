gonna get to this point to where you
have pretty much a full working
application go to pants put on some
pants and go to hats put on some hats
hello welcome to part two of creating a
flash dress-up application and this one
will be applying some simple code to
bring the application together to get
the window buttons active and the
garments in those windows clickable to
be applied to the doll so let's not
waste any time talking and we will now
pick up at the exact point we stopped in
yesterday's video part 1 okay my first
objective is to get this little
rectangle primitive or this big
rectangle primitive rather that's going
to hold all of my clickable shirts to be
applied to the character I'm going to
change that into a movie clip so I'm
gonna right click convert to symbol it's
gonna be a movie clip symbol and it can
be named whatever you want your library
listen aim this shirt pain actually you
can just name it
windowpane whatever you want to name it
let's make sure that has an eye there we
go okay
now that's a movie clip and since this
one is going to hold my shirts in it I'm
going to give it an instance name of
shirts window one so an instance name
that shirts window one and when I make
the next one for the pants it's going to
be pants window one and so on and so
forth now let's double click inside of
this new shirts window one movie clip
that we just created and now you can see
the inside is just our rectangle
primitive that we had there right click
that and convert that to symbol too and
just call this window BG in the library
and we're doing this because you're
gonna have the same window pane in all
of your other clothing categories so you
might want to change it down the road
and you don't want to have to change it
in every one of those window movie clips
you just change it in one and it'll
change in all the other corresponding
ones and I'll show you how we do that so
press ok and now right on top of this
let's call this window BG this layer
right here
and make a new layer above it and call
that clickable items now in your library
is where all of your clickable items are
sitting because we imported them so you
can see I've got my doll there and here
copy - that should be a shirt this is
probably the black shirt so I'm gonna
drag that out to stage it's a movie clip
that is the black shirt and I don't
really want it so big I don't need it so
big since we're using this method the
clothing that the person can click on
can be any size you want it can be
actual size like it is here
or you can simply make it smaller so
let's hold shift and drag it from the
corner here so like I said you can leave
yours actual size and you also have the
choice of making a little bit smaller if
you want maybe you want to stick more
items in there without having to make
extra windows you can make the items a
little bit smaller and people will still
understand what's going on alright so
this movie clip we're gonna have to give
it an instance name of whatever it was
named in that movie clip here we have to
go check here shirts MC let's go back
out into shirts MC and here we have
black t see that name of that frame
label let's grab that name of that frame
label let's go back here into our
windowpane for the shirts and skip this
little movie clip an instance name that
matches black t so that has an instance
name of black T and we can place it
where we need it to be in the window now
let's do the same for the next T let's
close that one open this one and that
should be the green shirt drag that out
and that one I'm pretty sure was
instance name green t so we can just add
that frame label name as the instance
name for this movie clip these can also
be button symbols if you would like to
just right click these convert the
symbol and make them a button symbol
that way they have the little cool Mouse
thing and you can put over effects on
them maybe you want it to move a little
when the user puts their mouse over the
item or whatever but I'm just gonna
leave mine as movie clips and I'm going
to make them have the little hand symbol
when the mouse goes over them by
applying a little bit of code so we'll
have them wear when the mouse users
Mouse goes over the item it turns into
the little clickable hand because
usually if you don't enable that with a
movie clip the mouse won't turn into a
little hand symbol for the user and they
might not know that they're over a
clickable item so in the code we'll be
sure to make that enabled okay since
these are two same kind of shirts I'm
going to match my dimensions on this the
dimensions on this or eighty 1.75 and
height is 78 so I can just change that
eighty 1.75 and the height is 78 so now
it matches the other one and let's just
put it next to the other one so the
important factor to remember is that
we're giving each clickable little movie
clip instance name that corresponds to
the frame label that this shirt would
represent within the shirts movie clip
sitting right here long as you
understand that when we put the array in
the little loop to add all the event
listeners in a really slim sort of way
we're using these methods to make the
code more slim so that way we can use an
array and Advent listeners through a
loop in just a few lines of code then
rather than having let's say if I had a
t-shirts or maybe 20 shirts I don't want
to have to add an event listener for
each one of those I'll I'll wind up with
a ton of code so what we're gonna
attempt to do is use an array and loop
through the code to add event listeners
through the loop which I have a tutorial
for a develop PHP comm we're just going
to simply attempt to apply that code in
this situation because this is where
that kind of code would come in really
handy okay before I apply the code I'm
gonna go back into the main timeline
here and where it says shirts MC it has
an instance name of shirts so I'm gonna
go shirts underscore MC so things make
more sense because this button is named
shirts one we don't want to get confused
so we'll name this shirts underscore and
see now let's click back into our shirts
window one movie clip where all the
little clickable shirts are and let's
apply the code to make the magic happen
let's highlight the clickable items
layer add a new layer double click it
called as3 and highlight that key frame
and press f9 or you go to window actions
once your actions panel is open we're
gonna start putting in some code now and
you guys are gonna like this code a lot
because what its gonna do is enable you
to add your all your event listeners and
make all of these items clickable in
just a few lines of code no matter if
you had 50 of these items sitting within
this shirts window pane you have 20 you
have 50 you have 5 it doesn't matter
this code which is just a few lines is
gonna make all the magic happen for all
the items there and I'll even show you
where I'm gonna snatch it up it's at
develop PHP comm if I go up to the
search bar here and I just type in add
event listeners and I search that I
should get the first result easiest way
to add event listeners to stage objects
or buttons using a loop I'm gonna go
down and I'm gonna grab this little bit
of code right here now let's highlight
this keyframe open it up pipe in that
code that we just took from develop PHP
comm let's indent those right here and
let's just change up what this says a
little bit let's call this my garment
array to where it makes more sense to us
in this situation and the garments are
going to be black t which is the
instance name for that black t button we
also have a green tea and they don't
have to be in any specific order next
one was a blue t and the last one I had
was a black tank for my black tank top
this last ray element I can get rid of
so if you have 50 buttons shirts or
whatever in there you put all 50 within
this comma separated array okay so each
item gets separated by comma now in the
for each loop here let's say for each
bar garment so it makes good sense to us
in my garment array we're gonna add an
event listener to that garment so let's
just take garment right here put it
their garment that add eventlistener
Mouse event of click so let's name this
on garment click which these are buttons
so you can leave it actually the way it
was but I'm just rewriting it to make
more sense
so the function that's going to fire off
when any of the garments are clicked our
function on garment click then you
simply instead of going to pages movie
clip we want to go to shirts underscore
MC underscore MC and shirts underscore
MC is sitting in the movie clip parent
timeline so let's go movie clip open
parentheses close parentheses put a dot
and in between parentheses put in parent
and what that's going to do is allow the
code to go out of this movie clip so say
if we double click back into the main
scene it's gonna go out of that movie
clip into the main scene and effect
shirts underscore MC make sense that's
how it works
ok if you were to just say remove this
and say shirts underscore MC that go to
and stop event that target name and that
means shirts an underscore MC would have
to live within this timeline but it
lives in this apparent timeline so you
have to say movie clip parent okay so
let's leave that in place so what this
is doing is going into the shirts movie
clip go to and stop the frame label for
whatever the name is of the garment
that's being clicked isn't that slick
that's why we put the frame labels to
match the actual garment instance names
so the garment instance names here match
the frame labels within that shirts
movie clip now the last thing we have to
do is make sure that these little items
are enabled so let's run this code and
see what happens if I click the green
shirt it's applied to the character if I
click if I click on the black tank that
gets applied the green ones removed
that's how it works ok now we want to
make sure that these items are mouse
enabled you see when I put my mouse over
those items they don't give me the
little clickable hand thing and I'll
show you how to add that very simply to
each one of those items within that same
loop of code
let's go back into the code and right
here in the for each loop right under
when we add the event listener we can
make the button mode for that garment
true
so now let's test by pressing ctrl enter
you can see when I go over them now I
get that cool little mouse hand
clickable thing to let me know that that
is a clickable item on stage so you guys
okay with this code all you have to do
is basically put each one of your
garments instance names within this
array of elements and then for each loop
through those array elements and adding
event listeners in a very slick sort of
way to each one of those items and the
fact that we use the same name for the
instance name of the buttons or the
garments as we did for the frame labels
within the main movie clip book for that
item makes everything nice and simple
okay now let's go back into the main
scene and this pants movie clip we're
gonna name pants underscore MSD instead
of just pants so things make more sense
as well so that's shirts underscore MC
this is pants underscore MC now this
movie clip which is instance name of
windowpane in the library is called
shirts window one as an instance name so
what we're gonna do is go into the
library and find the instance of
windowpane which is sitting right here
I'm gonna duplicate that now right-click
it duplicate it let's call it window
pane pants okay now let's drag it out
from the library now where this one is
living is fine because this is going to
be my default garment window when the
application loads with the user to dress
me so it's location is just dandy now
what I'm gonna do is go into the library
where I just duplicated that windowpane
and made windowpane pants I'm gonna pull
that windowpane pants out and you'll see
that now that I duplicated it if I
double click into this one and I change
anything let's say I press control X and
I remove that black one in the green one
you can see that they stay within the
original movie clip and that's because I
duplicated it I didn't just pull out a
copy of the same window
and then try to edit it what's inside of
it and expect everything here to stay
okay if you do that everything here is
gonna be removed too because it's the
same instance of that object unless you
duplicate it like I just showed you how
to do you right-click in your library
any object you go to duplicate and then
once you drag that object out to stage
you can then alter its inner timeline or
whatever so this one we're gonna give an
instance name like this one has shirts
window one we're gonna make this one
pants window one pants window one and it
is going to live off to the side outside
of our stage so nobody can see it until
they press this pants button so let's
see where the x position or the y
position rather is for this y position
is 71 so let's make this one the same 71
and then you can move its x position to
be outside of the stage sitting right
there and I'll double click inside of
that just go ahead and remove all the
shirts and in the code go up to the code
and make this say pants underscore MC
and we're gonna have to change what the
garment names are and I don't think I
even have any pants imported into the
stage yet oh yeah I did
let's see let's make sure yeah I have
black blue and green pants let's make
sure those frame label names
okay black pants blue pants green shorts
okay
so I can go back into my pants movie
clip here or the pants windowpane and I
know that I have black pants blue pants
and then the last one was green shorts
I'm gonna drag those items out of my
library pop them here in the window and
then they'll be clickable just like the
shirts were and I'm gonna make sure I
give them the instance name that they
are corresponding to those frame labels
okay just like we did for the shirts
okay drag them off from library now
let's give them instance names that are
correct black pants blue pants
this one green shorts all right they
have instance names the code is correct
I believe yep everything's good going
into the correct movie clip in the
parent timeline and to the corresponding
frame label that matches these instance
names now all we have to do is make sure
that when these buttons are clicked up
here they control the locations of these
window panes okay because as it is now
the user will never ever get to be able
to click on any of those pants until we
make these buttons up here enabled
okay now let's bring it all together
let's highlight the dynamic garment
Clips layer add a new layer and let's
call that window let's call the as3
window changing code let's highlight
that layer or actually highlight that
key frame and press f9 or you can go to
window and actions and open your actions
panel pop in this code and before we
explain this code to you let me just go
ahead and show you what it'll do let's
say I'm put a black shirt on them or a
black tank top or whatever then I want
to click pants you see the pants pane
comes right in to view the shirts pane
the window pane is out of view now and I
can put shorts on them or pants or
whatever I want I can go back to shirts
and change this up so it works really
cool like that
and you would just want to make sure
that your shirts and pants are layered
correctly so if you don't want them on
the same layer maybe you want the shirts
MC in the pants MC the garments on the
doll to be on different layers so maybe
your shirts are always above your pants
or your hats are always above your
shirts and things like that you can set
them up like that or you can just
highlight one of these and press
control-shift up or down arrow keys to
manipulate the hierarchy where they are
on the same layer all right now let's
explain this code and you guys should be
good to go and before I explain the code
to you
the logic of what's happening shirts is
here by default when the app loads up so
if the user was to click pants
afterwards we want the shirts to move to
exposition of 9:50 wear the pants now R
and we want the pants to move to an
exposition of 308 C 308 exposition
that's where we want this pants movie
clip to wind up when we click the pants
button and we want the shirts to move
into its position over here at 9:50
exposition so that's what our code is
set up to do I tell you what I'll just
add the don't believe it like this
because you guys saw me produce this
whole app so this code makes good sense
so what we're doing first up top is we
create an array and function for hiding
all the windows so when a button is
clicked we hide all windows then just
reveal the target window immediately
after so my shirt's window one is here
in my window array and my pants window
one is also in that array if I want to
put my hats window one I just type that
in right there and for however many I
have just put them in a comma separated
you just come and separate each one then
this function called hide all windows is
really called to run within all of your
button click functions so when I click
this button called pants this code is
going to execute right here and see hide
all windows it runs that function at
that time so this function called hide
all windows what happens inside of it is
a little for each loop that will hide
each window that's in this array and
then immediately after in your button
function you just say pants window one
dot X wherever you want to put it and
it's that easy
so if I wanted to have another function
here for my so when I want to put in
hats I'll just add the last two I'll add
the hats window and the footwear window
and then I'll show you the code how it
looks complete for my little application
and we'll have a finished working
product here actually before I do that
let me type in a little note to you guys
you can also okay you can also choose to
use the
visible property of elements on stage
rather than moving them like I'm doing
with the exposition property so there's
something called window dot visible
equals false and that will actually make
it just disappear you say window dot
visible equals true it makes it reappear
so whatever you decide you can you know
do this one hundreds of different ways
all right I just added my hats MC so if
you go inside of that you'll see I have
it set up just like my other ones very
similar and I also have this hats window
one movie clip which inside of it has
the hats that are clickable and then the
Hat array and all that good stuff going
on now all I have to do is go into my
as3 window changing code since I added a
new section and here I go I'm gonna add
hats window one to that array that way
it gets hidden with the rest I'm gonna
add an event listener fur hat swindle
one right here let's make that say hats
window one and this hats one cuz that's
the hats one button when that gets
pressed we want to move hats window one
so we just need another little function
here function that has to say show hats
one sure hats one show hats one down
here and that is hide all windows that's
fine and then the hats a window 1x is
308 and let's see if this all works now
so this has an instance name of hats
underscore MC this has an instance name
of hats one as a button so that should
do it
and all you have to do is make sure this
has an instance name of hats window one
and then press control enter hats there
you go
and then you can go to pants put on some
pants and go to shirts and stick on some
shirts that's pretty cool yeah let's put
them all in black let's go to hats black
hat okay man
all right now you have a better idea of
how to put the whole application
together as a package and have you a
nice little dress-up game or dress up
application where you're dressing up
dolls or avatars whatever you want to do
and here's a little hint for some of you
guys if you happen to have a movie clip
that is being designed by somebody in
real time on the stage your user that
movie clip ActionScript 3 can export any
movie clip through code you can export
any movie clip as a JPEG image so say
you let somebody finish dressing some
character or avatar or whatever once
they hit a button called finish you can
have ActionScript export a jpg image of
whatever they worked on them the
finished product and another little tip
for you guys who are paying attention if
you want to have a button up here that
says clear or undress or restart
whatever you want to name it you can
just make that button have direct all of
these movie clips to go to and stop on
frame label default so if you want to
make a button like that you just direct
it to go to each one of these movie
clips and go to and stop default and
that'll make your character naked again
or put it back to its default state of
being okay like it is here that's
default if I dress him up and then I
want to and I put all these things on
them and I want to just clear it and
start over you can have a button there
and says start over click it and then
once they click it you make all these
movie clips go to and stop default
alright so that should give you guys a
real good look into the simplest way to
make a character dress up with nicely in
code and you can have as many items as
you need within these windows and you
get
clean code inside of these windows in
the loop that's making the magic happen
to dress the character so you can have
50 items in here and it's just a few
lines of code that apply all of those 50
items to the character alright I hope
you guys had fun and we'll see you in
the next lesson series this one is
wrapped up and you're ready to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
