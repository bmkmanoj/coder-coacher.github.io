bunch of people have requested to see
how to apply a loading screen to their
web pages or their web documents
whatever their home page so that's what
we're going to demonstrate I'm just
going to demonstrate something very
simple that you guys can expand upon if
you're interested by what I have here is
my index page from my my home page for
Adam Cory comm now I have the stuff in
the head and stuff in the body all
collapsed up so it doesn't get in the
way visually of what we're doing so I'm
just going to go into my body element
right here and I'm going to add a div
with an ID of load screen then inside of
that div nested inside there's a child
div with an ID of loading now I'm simply
going to go up into the head of my
document and I'm going to put in some
style to effect the load screen and it's
child loading div so these properties
here they affect the load screen itself
so it would be black full opacity you
can put that on 0.5 if you want half
opacity basically what you're doing is
putting an overlay until the window is
ready so inside of this overlay you're
going to have another div that you can
do anything you want with you can put
text in it that is flashing all you have
to do is use a transition or an
animation my keyframe animation to make
some text flash saying the document is
loading or within this element you can
remove the text and just put a little
graphic that might be a little loading
icon but make sure it's not very heavy
it has to be a fast loading graphic
that's why it's best to just put text
and maybe some CSS that will make that
text flash and I have tutorials about
how to make text flash and pulse and
things like that now in this case I just
made the loading screen really high that
way it fills the whole viewer window
vertically it's only going to last for a
split second anyway so now underneath
the style element we're going to add a
script element so what we're doing here
is we're adding an event listener to the
window object and the event is the load
event
when the window is fully loaded and the
DOM is ready then this function
whatever's inside of this function is
going to execute so we just get the load
screen object reference and then we say
document.body
dot remove child of load screen so we
just remove the load screen child
element from the body which is this div
right here at load screen and whatever
is within it its child elements will
also get removed all right so let's run
a live test what I did was I ft peed my
new index file up to Adam Cory comm and
now I'm going to navigate to it and I
would make sure that I cleared my cache
but I cleared my browser cache and I'm
going to navigate to my site and keep an
eye on the screen you see it says
loading document in a black screen and
then when the document is fully loaded
and ready then that screen goes away so
you effectively have a loading screen
that you can do whatever you want with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
