spring summer 2011 curriculum of kind of
like the lineup or what's going to be
coming out of the flash building channel
as far as video tutorials go this
curriculum has been approved by the
united states education system united
nations learning centers and rich guys
and sheets everywhere so if you're
somebody that's interested in the videos
that come out of the flash building
channel you might be interested in what
we have coming up so that's what this
video is going to be all about another
first thing which I should be starting
sometime this weekend is going to be web
intersect forum tutorials so i'll show
you how to program in simple forums into
your website that will be custom for
your social network that you have going
then after that little series however
many videos it takes it should only take
a few because it's not very complex at
all after that we're going to do
tutorial and file sharing tutorial for
web intersect then I'm going to step out
of the system and I might just come back
into it as somebody adding to or
contributing a script here there to do a
certain thing okay so after those two
tutorial series are done I'm going to do
flash and actionscript three tutorials
so I want to start doing some as3
programming basics on video and that
will be mostly procedural programming we
might touch on object-oriented
programming just a little bit but mostly
I'll show you procedural programming to
get things done within the flash
software within the frames and i'll also
keep continuing putting out more flash
application video lessons like I've
always been doing just random things
that people are requesting and then
beyond that random webmaster tutorials
which would be whatever most folks are
requesting to see so we'll pepper that
in there as well but I'm going to really
mobilize to get the web intersect
website too where all of us coders can
be in there sharing more than just it
all being my code that everybody is
looking at we can get everybody's code
in there for whatever they've written
for the system and that would be really
cool and I will also contribute further
scripts to that whenever I get the time
but like i said i'll be just one of many
contributing scripts for that hopefully
and I definitely want to get some flash
actionscript 3 programming lessons out
support so I've had a lot of people
requesting to see action script
reprogramming lessons more so than you
know building a website or whether they
want to know how the programming
actually works at its core ok so that's
what's coming up if you want to give me
some feedback I will definitely read
your comment and soak it up and if a lot
of people requesting one certain thing
in specific I'll definitely have to try
and deliver that to the folks out here
on YouTube ah ok I'll talk to you very
soon we're going to start this forum
tutorial series the web intersect
whoever is interested in that you can
stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
