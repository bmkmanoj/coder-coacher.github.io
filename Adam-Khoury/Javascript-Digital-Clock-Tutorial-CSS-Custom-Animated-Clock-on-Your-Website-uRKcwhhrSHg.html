product of what you'll be learning how
to program from scratch into your web
pages using raw JavaScript and some CSS
it's a custom-built digital animated
clock that runs in real time on your web
pages and you can see here that it
clearly works in all the major browsers
here it is ticking along in Google
Chrome and here it is ticking along in
Firefox and Internet Explorer so that's
the three most used browsers on the web
and I'm sure it works in all the other
let's use browsers the design of it is
up to you 100% you can change it and
alter it any way you like using the CSS
and I'll show you that the programming
logic behind how it runs is not very
hard to understand and I'm going to take
you through every little bit of how it
works
as I'm programming it you'll be a master
JavaScript writer in no time at all all
this code logic was derived from my
ActionScript 3 digital clock tutorial
for flash so that is proof to you that
programming is becoming more universal
master 1 good web programming language
and you'll master them all all right
let's rock and roll and show you how to
program this thing it's easy man don't
worry ok the first thing we'll need to
do is create a new web document so on my
desktop I'm just going to create a new
folder call it my website double-click
inside that new folder I'm going to open
up notepad plus plus and I'm going to
save this as my desktop my website going
to call it index that'll be the page
name and I'm going to make sure that
it's an HTML document save alright now
I'm going to place in the beginnings of
an HTML document which is the HTML tag
inside the HTML tag we have a head tag
and the body tag we're going to assume
that you have basic knowledge of HTML
and CSS and the way that a
CML and CSS interact together in a web
document the JavaScript
I'll explain every bit of the JavaScript
within an HTML document everything you
want to display in the page pretty much
goes inside of this body tag so that's
where we'll start we'll create a div tag
so open and close a new div tag and
inside of that div tag is where we're
going to place our little clock that's
where it's going to show to the user and
for just getting it set up and styled
we're going to put some default static
value in it to pretend it was a running
clock okay so we can go to run see what
it looks like in chrome you can see we
just have a default a static time
sitting there but we're going to animate
that and style it so we'll animate it in
JavaScript and style it using CSS so on
this div tag we want to make sure we
give this an ID equals clock display
this is where JavaScript will
communicate with this div using that ID
and here we're going to put a class
which is equal to let's just call this
clock style and this will use to
communicate with this div in the CSS and
style it up to make it look any way we
want now let's start to style that up
with CSS in the head tag we're going to
go ahead and add a style tag make sure
we close that off and inside the style
tag I'm going to add all the styling for
that class which is o'clock style
open the curly brace and close the curly
brace now in between the two curly
braces we put CSS attributes and values
and I'll show you how it changes your
style up
hey let's press control s save it and
run in Chrome so now we can see we have
a nice look for a digital clock you can
see it's not yet animated we're going to
add the simple JavaScript here in just a
second to get that animated in real time
and we can also run it in Firefox see
what it looks like in Firefox same thing
okay and Internet Explorer alright looks
good so now you can see we have our div
in our HTML body and up in the head tag
we have some style class definitions so
let's bring this up make it nice and
neat that div on one line but now when
we put the JavaScript in we're going to
remove this static text we have here
that we just put in place for styling it
up and the JavaScript will sync text
into that div every second it'll update
the text that's displaying in that div
when working with JavaScript we have
some options of where we want to put our
scripting we can put it in the head tag
along with the styling there or we can
put it directly in the body tag in this
instance I'm going to put it directly
under my div tag here now when putting
JavaScript at work on a page you have to
put the script tag so we'll put the
opening script tag which has typeset to
text JavaScript and language set to
JavaScript and right under that we can
close up that script tag and inside of
the script tag is where we start coding
here the first thing we'll do is create
a function now this function we can give
it any name we want I'm going to call it
render time because that's exactly what
it's going to be doing
open the curly brace go down a couple
lines close the curly brace off and
there's your function nest all ready and
set up now everything that is going to
occur inside of render time is going to
happen once a second because we're going
to set it up that way so let me show you
the line that will make this possible
we're going to use the set timeout
method in JavaScript and it takes two
arguments the first one being the action
or command that you want to occur when
the timer limit is reached which in this
case we have it set to one second for
1,000 milliseconds which is one second
so every second set timeout is going to
make render time run again so you see
how that works let's put a little
indentation there
now if you were to run this page right
now this function render time would
never fire up to get that function
render time to fire off you just execute
that function right under where you code
it out that's how you execute it so this
line right here that i just put in when
this line is read it's going to fire off
this function called render time and
then inside of the render time function
set timeout is going to make render time
function keep happening every second
that's how that works this way we can
update this divs display let's just get
rid of this we don't need it
javascript is going to be adding that
for us now we're going to access the
date object in order to get the
variables we need here so let's create a
new variable to hold that data object
let's call it current time which is
going to be a string that will hold the
time and date and we can pluck values
out of it that we need to create little
burials variables for the hours minutes
and seconds
so first let's create a little variable
before we get the hours minutes and
seconds out of that current time
variable we're going to create one for
the am/pm functionality I'm going to bar
diem and that's Latin and let's start it
as a.m. by default the next variable is
where we're going to start plugging out
the hours minutes and seconds from the
data object so we'll call the hours H
I'm going to take this current time
variable which is the data object and
from it we're going to get the hours so
we'll type in dot get hours
and for the minutes and seconds it's
going to be very similar so we can just
copy and paste those lines change this
variable to an M this one to s so that's
minutes in that seconds so this one you
just change to get minutes the last one
get seconds so what that's going to do
for us is put the hours into a little
variable called H the current minute
that it is into a variable called M and
the current second into a variable
called s you can see the developed page
B we have some information on the date
object in JavaScript down at the bottom
you'll see the properties and methods of
the data object you can see we're using
get minutes get seconds get hours and
those are methods of the date object
just so you know get hours get minutes
get seconds right there okay we're
almost done we have our variables and we
have our little timer method set up
there so here all we have to do is put
in the logic because the time is going
to be in military time we need to have
some if statements in place to evaluate
whether or not let's say if the hour is
three we have to be sure we put a zero
in front of the three or if the second
is 2 we have to make sure we have a zero
put in front of the two and also since
the time is going to be military-style
it will have numbers like 16 for the
hours which is 4 p.m. really so we have
to do some conversions for that so if we
get this hours variable returns a value
of 16 we have to make sure we turn it to
a 4 and make sure we turn DM 2 p.m. you
see what I'm saying because we'll know
it's 4 p.m. because 1,600 military time
is 4 p.m.
and once we program those little if
statements in
this thing's ready to run I believe okay
so let's lay out this logic here if each
variable the current hours is equal to
zero and we know that H must equal 12
else if the current hour is greater than
12 like I said if it happens to be 16 or
18 or 22 we have to convert it so to do
that is very simple we just say current
hour is equal to current hour minus 12
so if you happen to have current hour
coming back 16 in military time then you
just make the current hour 16 minus 12
making it 4 and here we have to put
another line in to make DM variable
equal to p.m. because at that point
we'll know it's p.m. if the hours are
greater than 12 that's with this
evaluation saying if the current hour is
greater than 12 all right now we're
going to evaluate to see whether or not
the hours the minutes or the seconds
require a zero in front of it if they
happen to be a single-digit number like
anything under 10 anything under 10 we
have to throw a zero in front of it so
our digital clock displays correctly so
let's put in an if statement that's
there the hours one for the minutes
actually let's just set the first one up
and then we can copy the other two
because they'll be very similar if the
current hour is less than 10 we'll make
the current our display is equal to zero
put a 0 in front of whatever that number
is so you can just put + H that's how
you stick a 0 in front of the number if
it happens to be less than 10 let's just
grab that whole little statement there
go down one line
put one in for the minutes one in for
the seconds let's just change this H to
an M here this one as well and this one
and now you're all set up for your
minutes this to an S this to an S and
change this one to an S and that's it
you're all set up now now the last thing
we have to do is tell JavaScript to
place the values of these hours minutes
and seconds in the p.m. and all that
stuff into this div container that we
set up here that's all styled up using
the CSS that we already set up and these
lines are very simple right here we're
going to put a variable that says
variable name my clock and it's equal to
document dot get element by ID o'clock
display so we're using the get element
by ID function to target this div with
an ID of clock display see it's very
simple
so my clock is equal to pretty much that
element on the page so in the next line
we can actually sink the value into that
element on the page so we say my clock
first one will be for Firefox put two
lines in text content because I notice
that in Firefox clock won't display if
you have inner text or inner HTML being
used so we'll use both lines so this one
is for firebox equal to the hours plus
which this plus sign isn't adding
anything it's just bringing the string
together for display so right next to
the hours we're going to put a colon
then right next to the colon we're going
to put the minutes on the other side of
that colon then we're going to add one
more : put the seconds
then I'm going to add I guess just a
space and then we'll add diem which will
be the little AM or PM variable now this
right now if you run this page right now
you'll see it works in Firefox but maybe
Internet Explorer in Google Chrome won't
work let's try it out run in Firefox
see it shows up in Firefox just nice now
let's run it in Chrome it shows up in
Chrome real nice let's run it in
Internet Explorer this is the one where
we probably won't see it it doesn't show
up at all so the next line will be for
Internet Explorer only so that first
line there is where I guess all other
browsers we're using text content to
place it into that div here we'll use
inner text or you can use inner HTML now
let's save it ctrl s and run it in
Internet Explorer and there you go and
you wouldn't have to allow that ActiveX
if you're online that's just when you're
on your local computer so you can see it
running in Internet Explorer there just
fine now run it in Chrome it's beautiful
run it in Firefox looking good now let's
take a look at this document we have
here now that we've assembled
everything's done
you are now finished with your clock and
that wasn't much code at all not very
difficult to understand either okay so
there you go that is how you can create
a digital clock using javascript raw
JavaScript and CSS and have it work in
all the browsers hope you've enjoyed
this JavaScript tutorial and maybe now
you have a little more insight into how
the variables logic and evaluations
and things like that work how to access
properties and methods of certain
objects that you have available to you
in JavaScript and things like that we'll
see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
