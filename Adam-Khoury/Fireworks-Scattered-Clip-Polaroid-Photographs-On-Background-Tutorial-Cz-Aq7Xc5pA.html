going to be creative I have some fun
we're not going to mess with any code
will show you how to use fireworks to
create this fun scattered polaroid photo
effect on any background image that you
want and yes this is me here and I made
this scattered polaroid photo thing
thing out of this picture of me yes I'm
very pale I'll have you guys know that
if I go out in the Sun I'll die I don't
really appreciate any comments about how
pale my skin is and I also drink blood
so those are things to take into
consideration but anyways you got this
really cool effect that you can make and
I'll show you and I also did my wife so
let's rock and roll I'll show you how to
do it okay you open up any image that
you want using fireworks and once the
image is loaded in then you just go
create a rectangle draw it out and I
like to have my width even and my height
even you see mine is 284 by 284 so
that's good it doesn't have to be any
exact certain size and if you go to I
think it's view view tool tips you'll
see your width and height as you're
dragging out items like I did actually
you'll have tool tips for all of these
tools if you go to view and show
tooltips because a lot of people they
don't show tool tips and then when they
drag out a rectangle this is what they
see you see that width and height is not
there now let me go to view tool tips
now look at the width and height you can
see it when you're dragging it out
that's why the tool tips are handy so
turn them on okay now inside of this
little rectangle that you have we're
going to draw another rectangle to be
the you know the inner photo part and
you want to make sure that's an even
with to you don't want to have odd
numbers in the width because you want to
make sure that it sets in there right
now let me bring up my properties bar
here and I'm going to change that
rectangle I made to black that way you
can see it real good and make sure it's
even in there and it really doesn't have
to be a perfect thing so you'll
highlight both together if
zoom out you'll see everything to zoom
out is hold ctrl down and mouse wheel to
zoom in and out but you can click off to
the side here you can just select the
items you want so I'm going to select
both of those rectangles by holding
shift as I select items and I'll select
multiple items so I'm going to zoom back
in now by holding ctrl down and assuming
it I'm going to go to modify with those
both selected combined paths and then
going to punch so you can see what they
did it punched out a nice little window
so now I can put this little Polaroid
anywhere I want and I can also skew it
so you can go to the scale tool you can
use the scale or the school tool just
put it on scale and you'll be able to
skew and scale if you want but usually
when you have the scale tool selected
you'll have the little skew icon there
so you can turn this thing like that so
that's how we'll start out I'll start
right here so I have that object there
on top of my image now what I'm going to
do is zoom out a little so you guys can
see what's going on I'm going to select
over here in the grey part so I deselect
everything now what you see down here
and is everything in your document you
can see the photo and you can also see
the little graphic that you put on top
right here and when you select path you
see that you have path selected down
there so what I'm going to do is just
select the photo you see just the photo
selected the bitmap alright so I'm going
to zoom into a hundred percent and if I
click off to the side here in the grey
area on the canvas I'll have nothing
selected but now i'm going to select the
image and it's just the bitmap that i
have selected here now you see i don't
have this little graphic that i made
select it at all just the bitmap is
selected right now i'm going to go to
the lasso tool and if you have lasso
selected like that just hold it down and
select polygon lasso then you make your
first point right here in the corner
somewhere you're just going to make a
square like this click down you don't
have to hold you can just click down and
let go and then click down here and let
go click here let go click here let go
and then wait till you see a little
block up here you see that little black
bloc that appears when they meet
that's what you want to have showing
then you click down last time to meet up
all four edges pink and then you'll have
a cutout right there so what you're
going to do is press ctrl-c to copy that
region of the bitmap picture whatever
picture you're using back there you
press ctrl C while that dashed line is
moving around that copies it to your
clipboard then you're going to press
ctrl D to deselect that then you press
the pointer tool up here and then you
press ctrl V now you see what they did
it put that little image i cut out right
inside of there perfectly so now we'll
grab this thing press ctrl-c ctrl-v and
make another one now I'm going to skew
that a little bit maybe like that I'll
go up here and get part of her eye and
I'll do the same thing I'll deselect by
selecting the canvas over here or you
can just press ctrl D to deselect
anything and i'm going to select the
bitmap image which is the picture in the
back and i'm going to polygon lasso one
more time pink pink pink pink and meet
them up pink ctrl c ctrl d pointer ctrl
v there you go don't move it though I'm
just moving it to show you i'm going to
press ctrl z to put that back because i
didn't want to move it ok so at this
point all you have to do is remove the
picture I mean you put as many of these
as you want in any configuration that
you like so I'll put a couple more okay
it is enough now at any point in this
process if you want to see any layers
you can just click your layers button
over here or you go to window layers and
it will pop open for you and you can
also lock layers all right so at this
point I'm going to take the image and
just move it I'm going to press ctrl x
and then I can import any image as the
background for that so let's go to file
import any picture I want like this
field of flowers pop that on stage I'm
going to press ctrl shift V to make it
go to the back or you can go to your
layers and you can mess with the layers
just like you wouldn't photos
opera illustrator or anything you can
also lock things so if you select that
you go to layers you'll see what's
selected there and you can just lock it
that way you can't click it or anything
you can't move it nothing so let me
unlock it now okay let's zoom into a
hundred percent and what I'm going to do
is I'm going to select each set so I'll
select this graphic that I made and this
photo I'm press ctrl G to make it a
group this one the same and that
controlled G this one and that one and
I'm holding shift to select multiple
items as I go ctrl G select hold shift
select ctrl G alright so now I have all
four in groups there's one two three
four now I have all four selected right
now because I held down shift while I
was selecting those so I'm going to go
to filters shadow and glow interglobe
and I'm going to adjust this to where
it's not so dramatic i'm going to bring
that down bring this down maybe two
about thirty-seven percent put that at
about five that looks fine and now i'm
going to drop shadow and all four of
those so i'll select this one this one
this one and that one hit the plus sign
of my filters down here go to shadow and
glow and i'm going to drop shadow on
them i'm going to bring that up to a
hundred percent bring this down to about
three and that's good for me let's get
this properties bar down by double
clicking here and i can see what i could
get better now you can take that upload
it to Facebook or whatever you want have
a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
