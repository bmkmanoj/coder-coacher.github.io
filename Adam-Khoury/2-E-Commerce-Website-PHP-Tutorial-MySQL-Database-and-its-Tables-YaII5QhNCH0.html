our lesson series on creating an
e-commerce website system for ourselves
or our clients in this part we're going
to focus on creating the MySQL database
and the tables needed inside of that
minus QL database that are going to hold
all the different pieces of data for our
store okay before we get started on that
I just wanted to let you guys know
something that I'm going to stick to my
guns and give you guys six video
tutorials by Christmas day but I think
we're going to extend things a little
bit because I was carefully reading
through the comments for part 1 of this
video series on YouTube I was reading
the comments and Mathias
v9 one said well this tutorial include
an admin system where we can add
products and so I thought about it and I
said you know that would be a handy
thing to add to the system in case
people wouldn't know how to make an
admin panel for this code of thing to
where people who don't know HTML CSS and
PHP and all this crap can add inventory
products so say somebody in your office
that works in the office that you want
to give privileges to to get in there
and add inventory and deal with the
managing the store online you can create
an admin panel for them which will be as
part of the store in the backend that
will be secured and it will have a
secure login for that section so it's
probably going to go past six tutorials
in total but I'm going to stick to my
guns and make sure you guys have six
tutorials for the series by Christmas
day I've decided to use Adam Corey calm
as the place where this is all I have
right now is this one page and there's
really not much even on it so I'm just
going to strip this page down and use
this as my store example
so Adam Corey calm is where you can see
this progress live online and that's how
I'm going to build live online that's
how I mean we're going to test my test
all my PHP scripts live online against
my MySQL database that's on my server so
in order to get the MySQL database for
your website set up on your live server
online go to
your hosting account online so wherever
your hosting account is you log in you
go into your cPanel now maybe you're
hosting with GoDaddy or something like
that and GoDaddy uses a custom cPanel to
where it's not the regular cPanel that
you see on most hosting providers so
what you have to do is go into your
GoDaddy cPanel and look for MySQL
databases if you're in cPanel like I am
finding is very easy it's right down
here in the database section you just
click MySQL databases and like I said if
you're on something like GoDaddy you
might want to ask for assistance from
the people at GoDaddy if you're having
any trouble finding any of these things
to click on or any of the connection
information for your MySQL database once
you create it so you get to the page for
MySQL databases and just take the time
to read all the information on this page
now right here it says create new
database and mine is going to have a
prefix of Adam KHOU underscore so I'm
going to put my store all one word all
lowercase letters and this will have a
prefix my store will have a prefix of
Adam cool underscore there so on some
hosting providers in the MySQL creation
MySQL database creation section they
might automatically add a prefix to
yours like that now I'm going to click
on create database and I already have a
couple of databases in there but maybe
yours has none yet but that's no biggie
so it says added the database see Adam
cool underscore my store now I'm going
to go back and I'm going to make sure
that this database has a user so let's
make ourselves a new user for this
database username the new user for this
database is going to have that prefix as
well I'll just put the word builder so
that'll be the user name and I'm going
to create a password now and you're
going to need to have the user MySQL
username for
our MySQL connection file that we're
going to create in just a few minutes so
you'll need to have the database created
you'll have to have a user and a
password okay so I added my name and
made a password and then I created the
user now I have that new user right
there and I have my new database right
here so I have to add that user to that
database so let's go to add user to
database make sure we get that builder
my store ad and I'm just going to give
it all privileges for right now make
changes go back all right now you have
your database set up it's ready to go
it's waiting for you to program stuff
into it and there's the user so now we
can create the script we can pretty much
exit out of here get into the main
screen of your cPanel again and you can
go into PHP myadmin
to view that new database but it won't
have any tables set in it yet you can
create tables manually within PHP
myadmin but what we're going to do is
set up our tables to rescript
okay now we're going to get the MySQL
connection script going make sure we
have the proper data inside of it so we
can open our store files again a
Dreamweaver I'm going to go to file open
store scripts connect to MySQL I'm going
to go to develop PHP comm learn MySQL
section and here there's connecting to
your database I'm going to grab this
little script Deepu right there back in
Dreamweaver make sure I'm in code view
get rid of all that and pop in the
script I grabbed from develop PHP and
for me my database host I know is
localhost because that's the type of
server I have pure on GoDaddy you might
have a host string that looks something
like this
but for most people using cpanel is
localhost so my DD host is localhost my
DB username was I think Adam KHOU
underscore builder and I'm going to put
my password right here and my database
name was Adam KHOU underscore my store I
think let's see I wrote it all down and
you should have wrote all yours down to
yes so now once I put my password in
here this script this script will
connect to my MySQL database okay now
that my MySQL file is all set up the
proper data inside of it needed to allow
me to connect to my mysql database
online I'm going to have to test that
real fast so under the example of
develop PHP where it shows you how to
connect there's a test file so you can
make sure that you're connected I'm
going to grab the code press ctrl C go
back to Dreamweaver file new PHP go into
code view remove all of that and replace
it with control V with the code that you
grabbed from the site so what this is
going to do is require connect to MySQL
dot PHP and if there's any problems the
script will not process past that point
if it does it's going to echo out to you
success in database connection happy
coding so once it brings in connect to
MySQL this file is going to let you know
if there's a connection error by the
data because of the die functions within
connect to MySQL dot PHP those die
functions and the errors will display if
they happen to be any if not you'll get
this success message so let's file save
as I think it was MySQL quick test let's
just name it that MySQL quick test
so name it MySQL quick test save now
we're going to FTP things to the server
and I'm using FileZilla so let's connect
and this is the directory at Adam quarry
comm and here I'm inside my storage
scripts folder I'm going to add this
MySQL quick test I'm going to overwrite
the connect to my SQL file that's
already there so now on my server online
is to connect to my SQL file and the
MySQL quick test so all I have to do is
grab the name of that file go actually
online with a browser to that script and
run it and see what happens let's go to
Adam quarry comm or whatever your site
is forward slash stores store scripts
forward slash and that file name- cure
quick tests let's see what happens
success in database connection happy
coding that's what you should get if you
don't get that you get some kind of
error output that's generated from the
MySQL connection file then you'll know
you have problems with some kind of data
that you put into the connection file
it's not correct or your database wasn't
created before you try to run this file
or something now using this same file
I'm going to show you how to create
tables for your system which you could
go into PHP myadmin and create them
manually if you like but I'm going to
show you how to set up scripts that will
help you do it faster so let's take
MySQL quick test file save as actually
we're going to delete MySQL quick tests
off of the server right now you don't
want that hanging around you don't need
it anymore now this one we're going to
save as create admin table this is the
file that's going to generate the admin
table inside of the new database the
admin table is going to hold login
credentials for the various people that
you want to let into the system to
manage the stores back-end
if it's just yourself then you just put
yourself into that database table if
it's multiple people you put them all in
now let's just get rid of this make sure
we keep require connect to MySQL there
we're going to pop the code in right
here that's going to be needed to create
the table to the script okay now before
I explain this piece of script I'm going
to test it very quickly make sure it
works before I start explaining it
because so after I explain it if I go
and test it it doesn't work I'll feel
like a nincompoop so I'm going to put
create admin table up on the server on
the live server I'm going to copy that
name and I'm going to paste it into my
browser back on my live site let's go to
store scripts forward slash we're going
to be removing a lot of these scripts
that we're putting up right after we use
them so let's press enter your admin
table has been created successfully and
I'm going to go into PHP myadmin
on my server in just a second and show
you how it looks inside of the PHP
myadmin software and now let's discuss
the script very quickly first what we're
doing is requiring the connect to MySQL
file that we set up then we build an SQL
command which is pretty much the syntax
that communicates to the MySQL database
this is SQL structured query so what
we're doing is feeding a certain syntax
to create table table name is admin and
inside of that admin table is going to
be certain columns or fields first one
is going to be ID with it's an integer
type field the value of 11 not null
means it cannot ever be empty and
they're Auto increments that means each
time one is added it will auto increment
a unique ID for each admin so if it's
just you you'll have just one admin
inside you'll have one ID for yourself
there's a few admin each admin will have
a unique ID user name this is going to
be bar char 255
actually we could make it
a lot smaller than that say 24 this
one's not null as well that means it can
never be empty 24 not null for the
password
that's a varchar' as well that can that
means it can be this field can hold a
mix of symbols numbers letters whatever
various characters I like to just call
that various characters when I look at
it and then last log date that's going
to be the field name for the date field
that will hold and update each time the
admin logs in so if it's multiple admin
inside you can see what when what day
each person logged in last to manage the
store and then this one is set to not
null as well that means it cannot be
empty the primary key on this table is
ID field unique key is username so we
want to make sure each username inside
of this table is unique so after you set
up your SQL command you can set up an if
and else condition statement that will
actually execute the command for you and
inside of the if condition you just
write in the MySQL query function and
you feed it your MySQL command or you
feed it your SQL command so what will
happen is if it's successful in the SQL
command and the query it'll echo your
admin table has been created
successfully else there will be an error
something was not right with the query
or the command and you'll get this
critical error and you'll have to
investigate that on your own I have no
idea it should just work
okay Here I am back on line on my server
host control panel I'm going to go to
PHP myadmin in the database section now
it's going to redirect me to PHP myadmin
where I can then log in my password was
fresco and there you are in your
database I'm going to click on the left
atom to underscore store and in there
there's admin table you notice I didn't
create this admin table inside of
phpMyAdmin we created it through script
entire code now we're going to make a
few more tables we can close out of here
I just wanted to show you how PHP
myadmin works and how you can get in
here and manually adjust things and
create tables just like we did through
script you can do that manually you just
go click on the main link here and there
it says create new table on database but
we're back so if you prefer working in
PHP myadmin manually I sometimes - even
though I know how to write scripts that
interact with my database I like to go
in manually a lot and do things I don't
know why I just like to maybe I'm more
of a visual person I don't know all
right let's close out of that and let's
close out of that and so what I'm going
to do is make a few more scripts ok now
we have two more scripts to create two
more tables once called create products
table dot PHP the next one is create
transactions table dot PHP and I decided
to keep the create customers table out
of the mix since we're going to be
gathering their the person's email
address and the first and last name and
some other data that you can use within
your system to see who bought things
from you if you like the only reason you
would need a customer databases to know
who bought things from you when and
that's all going to be within the
transactions table and I'm going to
explain that script in just a second
first let's talk about the products
table this one's going to be created
when we run it through our browser and
it's going to create a table called
products into the database on our server
it's going to have the first field is
going to be ID in not null Auto
increment the next field in that table
is product name and that's going to be
the unique name that you give the
product you can see down here I have
unique key product name
that's going to make that filled in this
table require that each addition or each
item within the table have a unique
product name no two can be exactly the
same the next field is price that's
going to be bar charged sixteen the next
field is details anything you want to
have if you want to write paragraphs
about a certain product however much
information that you want to put on the
product page when the person goes to
view that product you can put into this
text field here which will give you ten
thousand characters up to ten thousand
characters the category and subcategory
fields the only reason I put category
and subcategory is to show you guys if
you wanted to have say a main button on
your home page that said clothing and
then within that when they click
clothing they'll see subcategories like
pants socks shoes shirts whatever and
you can you can be as flexible as you
need to with breaking down subcategories
into subcategories of subcategories
however your catalog needs to be set up
you're going to have to set up your
table customize for your needs I mean
you can't expect me to know exactly how
many subcategories of items you're going
to have and script my tutorial to be
that way so I'm just going to make it
one general sort of way
you guys will have to be intuitive
enough on your own to create however
many trees of subcategories you need to
but when you see me set up my items
you'll understand what I'm doing and you
can expand upon yours date added will be
the date that this inventory item was
added to the store so primary key is ID
unique keys product name that's all
there is to the products table for now
and I'm flexible to where I can keep
this I can have to add two more things
you know maybe I'll realize a few hours
into production that I need another
field in this table I can go back in and
put it in it's no problem and if I do
anything like that I'll show you guys
now the create transactions table is the
one that talks to the PayPal ipn script
that we're going to set up
and this is going to be gathering data
behind the scenes when people actually
purchase things through your site using
PayPal and I'm going to discuss all of
these variables you can see what's here
or pay or email first name last name
payment amount down here MC P shows you
how much PayPal took out for their
percentage for doing the online
transaction which is a very reasonable
rate
I think PayPal gives good rates for
online transactions but I'm not even
going to go into trying to explain all
these fields just just yet until we
build the PayPal ipn script later on in
the lesson series we're going to build a
script that talks to PayPal behind the
scenes and all those values are going to
be popped into your transactions table
right now all we need to do is get that
table made so I'm going to FTP these two
files create products and create
transactions and like I said we're not
going to create the customers table
because within this table you're going
to have all the names of your customers
anyway and their email so I'm going to
put these two I'm going to FTP these two
to my server just like I did create
admin table I'm going to use my browser
to execute them and they'll create the
tables when I do so let's go to your
site make sure you FTP those files store
scripts navigate to create products
table your products table has been
created successfully put that file name
here create transactions table now press
Enter your transaction table has been
created successfully so now let's check
in phpMyAdmin and make sure PHP myadmin
click on Adam Cory store here and there
you go there's your three tables admin
table products table transactions table
let's get these two show up here in the
list and there you go there's all three
you want to click on transactions to see
how the structure set up you can see
there's nothing in it yet there's no
transactions yet but it's ready to start
storing data so that concludes creating
the MySQL database and all three of the
tables that we're going to need in the
onset here of a system like this and now
we can start actually adding inventory
to our site we'll create a little admin
page in the next lesson in part three
we'll have to create an admin login page
that way we can access the backend page
that's going to allow us to add
inventory items upload the picture for
the inventory item and put in the
details price all that junk and each
time we press submit on that it'll put
it into that products database so for
some of you guys who are I'll show you
those scripts once again if you happen
to be in a hurry in you or you want to
produce your system as I'm producing
mine in real time I'll show you the
scripts here you already saw a create
admin you can full screen and HD this on
youtube to see all the various
characters there in the script
here's create products table and here's
the create transactions table since this
one's a little long I'll show you lines
1 through 23 right there you can see all
of those clearly now here's line 23
through 39 or 24 through 39 you can
pause anytime within there if you want
to type it all out but like I said I'm
going to have all these scripts
available for you guys if you want to
just wait till the end and download them
if you happen to be typing things out
things go wrong for you or whatever you
want to see my exact syntax I'll have
everything available at the end of the
lesson series free for download but I'm
not going to put a download package
together until the end of the series so
if you wanna if you want to produce with
me as I go you'll have to type it in and
pause and stuff like that so these are
the three scripts that create the tables
and once they're created
you remove those from the server the
live server you don't want those three
there so delete them and there you go we
can close that out so in part three
we'll create the admin area for the
person or people we're going to manage
the store items and various things to do
with the store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
