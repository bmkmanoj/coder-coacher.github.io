object-oriented features there's a
concept known as inheritance inheritance
is when an object inherits all the
properties methods of its parent object
in order to become a specialized version
of the parent object so in JavaScript we
use the prototype property to establish
subclasses that will inherit the
characteristics of our main parent
classes it is very easy to domain so
this results in a specialized subclass
that can retain its own properties and
methods as well as inherit all of the
properties methods of the parent class
let's open our code editors and write an
example now that will shine a light on
this concept well first create a test
HTML document then let's put a script
element in place now let's write
ourselves a comment here to establish a
parent class so let's type in function
parent class now we can establish
properties and methods within this class
so we'll say this dot parent underscore
property 1 is equal to the string of
hola now let's say this dot parent
method 1 is equal to function parent
method 1 open close parentheses opening
curly brace and put in the closing curly
brace and in between the parentheses
we'll scoop up any dynamic arguments
being sent into this method as argument
1 if you wanted to have multiple like we
said before you just put argument to
argument 3 however many you want to take
into this method then as return data for
this method we're going to type in
return Arg 1 and we'll concatenate that
into a string
adding parent method 1 return data to
any dynamic arguments coming in and
you'll see the dynamic argument I'm
gonna send into this function
or into this method in a moment now
let's place another commented neces
establish a child class what I'm going
to do is just copy the whole parent
class and establish the child class
using that as a sort of template and
I'll just change where it says parent to
child and everywhere which says parent
I'll change to child
I'll change where it says Ola for child
property one
- adios so now we have child class
inside of child class it has child
property one with a value of adios and
child method one which is set to intake
one dynamic argument and then return
that dynamic argument concatenated with
the string of child method one returned
data okay very simple now we have to
make the child class inherit all the
parent class characteristics using the
prototype property so let's go down one
line and place a comment to ourselves
again says make the child class inherit
all the parent class characteristics by
using the prototype property explained
in depth in this YouTube video tutorial
which was the one right before this
video tutorial where we talked about the
prototype property more in depth so now
we're going to make this child class
inherit all the properties and methods
this method and this property from the
parent class so we target the child
class dot prototype property and we make
that equal to new parent class that
allows the child class to inherit all of
the properties and methods of the parent
class so now let's create a new instance
of the child class so we save our
instance one is equal to a new child
class now we're going to put in some
code that checks to see if instance one
is an instance of both objects the
parent class and the child class so we
alert instance one instance of parent
class and instance one instance of child
class and these will return true or
false according to whether or not
instance one is actually an instance of
parent class and the child class so now
let's run this in our favorite browser
and see what we get true and true that
means instance one that we just created
here that is a new child class instance
is both an instance of child class and
parent class that means it can access
all the properties and methods of both
classes and in normal situations it
wouldn't be able to but we made it
inherit all of the characteristics of
the parent class using the prototype
property here okay now let's go ahead
and comment those out now the next line
down I'm going to put a comment that
says access the instance methods and
properties now to be sure we can
actually access all methods and
properties within both classes with this
instance one we have to write some code
that does that so let's alert instance
one dot parent method which is the one
up here in the parent class and the
dynamic argument that we're sending in
to the parent method is this string of
result and a semicolon in space so if
the child class in fact did inherit all
of the characteristics of the parent
class we should be able to target the
methods and properties of the parent
class directly through the instance of
the child class so that's what we just
did here we're targeting the parent one
method using an instance of a child
class that does not have the parent one
method within it okay so let's see what
we get now run that in your favorite
browser so we say result parent method
one returned data okay so that lets you
know for sure that instance one which is
a new child class instance in fact did
inherit all of the methods and
properties from the parent class because
we told it to using the prototype
property here in this line so now we can
take that same line that same alert and
show you how we can just access the the
child method so we should get parent
method one returned data and child
method one returned data so you get
result parent method one returned data
and then result child method one
returned data so you can see that the
child class has access to both parent
method one and child method one now
let's also alert ourselves the parent
property one and child property one of
instance one you can see parent property
one's up here and child property one is
here in the child class parent property
one is in the parent class so run that
in your favor
browser and you get both results from
the child and parent method one and then
holla and adios that means instance one
of child class is able to access all the
properties and methods within both
classes in the script because we made
child class inherit all the properties
with the parent class okay so now before
we end this little tutorial we're going
to add one more little piece of code
that shows you how to override parent
method one in the child class so
basically we're going to use the
prototype property again to add a parent
method one into the child class which
will override the parent method one in
the parent class you can see how we're
returning different data I have
overridden parent and method one and
then we're going to alert ourselves the
same alert that we used right here
you'll see how we have different results
now because parent method one will have
been overridden at that point so we get
result parent method one returned data
child method one returned data
whole la adios and then result I have
overridden parent method one so
everything works as expected now you can
see how the child class inherited all of
the properties and methods of the parent
class by assigning it to using the
prototype property that means any
instances of the child class that are
brought into the script will have access
to all the properties and methods within
both classes or both objects okay so you
see how that works it's not a very
difficult concept to wrap your head
around and you really only have to
assign new methods and properties
through prototype here when you want to
overwrite the functionality of anything
that happens to be in the parent class
and just an extra side note if you were
to name both of these property one and
property one here you would get a slight
conflict in data handling because this
child class is told to inherit all the
properties of parent class so you have
to make sure that if you're going to use
inheritance that you use separate names
unless you want the child class property
to overwrite the parent class property
okay that was the last concept that I
will document on video regarding
JavaScript object oriented programming
features we covered the key concepts of
JavaScript OOP in this and the previous
two videos so in these three videos we
already covered the key concepts of
JavaScript object oriented programming
and actually if you want to think about
it in a broader sense the concepts of
all object oriented programming in all
languages that have object-oriented
features now more terminology and
examples on this topic authored by me
will show up in text page format added
to my JavaScript code library at my site
you can all go there and view all of my
code libraries free that are text-based
there I've been adding a lot of modern
information in text format there in the
code reference libraries so as all of
these technologies evolve I will keep
updating and adding to my text-based
libraries there so don't miss that
important constantly evolving feature of
develop PHP com and soon I'll be
completely revamping the PHP code
library and I'll reapply the MySQL code
library with all the new updated code
examples from MySQL I now in some other
unrelated news the live on our Google
hangout we had scheduled for last
Wednesday got snafued by Google because
we were trying to broadcast directly
during the time that Google changed the
whole layout of Google+ and the way that
they honor hangouts worked and it was
during the commencement of the Google
i/o developer stuff so basically Google
didn't allow our hangout to go on-air
we tried like 5,000 times so we're
rescheduling the on air hangout for next
Wednesday May 22nd at 2:00 p.m. Eastern
time that's two days away so I'm going
to try my best to keep a regular weekly
Wednesday 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on our
hangout going to cover different hot
topics each week so hangouts on air will
be a weekly Wednesday 2:00 p.m. Eastern
Time feature on my channel from
I want and I'll try to stick to that
schedule the best I can so get at me on
the social networks to find yourself
placed in a hangout with us if you got
nerdy skills kid alright I'll see you
guys in the next tutorial bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
