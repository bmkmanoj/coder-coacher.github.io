has this ever happened to you where your
page in your website gets renamed or
removed and then maybe it's already
indexed in the search engines and yahoo
and google is still pointing people to
this page and they get this error
message
404 error message web page cannot be
found or is missing so I'm gonna show
you if you run a Linux site online and
if you're using PHP and MySQL dynamics
especially on your Linux hosting site
you can set up custom ever pages let's
take a look at some examples let's go to
develop PHP let's type in up top poopoo
HTML okay so I'm handling it well and
I'm telling people in a custom way we're
using my custom graphics my custom page
oops file not found
and I said Adam is recently buy you can
read all that blah blah blah blah blah
and then I assure them to search here or
browse here now that's a good way to
handle it you don't really want to have
it looks very unprofessional if you have
any pages pop up that are missing and
they give you the user that error of
file not found the generic one it just
doesn't seem very professional they've
seen it a thousand times when you're
dealing with MySQL and PHP dynamic type
websites that a database driven then
this is going to be a concern of yours
at one point or another because pages do
disappear say you have a member database
and a member wants to delete their
account but their account their page is
already indexed in Google and Yahoo
Google Yahoo aren't just gonna remove
the page at the moment the member
deletes their account you see what I'm
saying there's gonna be a time lapse
there when the page is still going to be
active in the search engines and people
are going to be going to it and
not gonna be there okay so let's look at
the way YouTube handles it youtube.com
pupu it's not HTML
we're sorry the pager requested cannot
be found that's the professional way to
handle it and see what Facebook does and
YouTube puts their search bar right in
there or Google I should say puts their
search bar right in there which is even
more professional let's I might do the
same thing let's see what Facebook does
they do similar things like I do it
develop PHP they just give a custom page
that says page not found and then lead
the user with links but it's more
professional to have a custom page all
right now let's take a look at DQ'd okay
and I have a little playlist going of
server tips and htaccess tricks and
everything like that a little tiny play
that's going on the YouTube channel if
you look all the way on the right under
the playlist there you scroll down
you'll see server tips and tricks bubble
ball and there when I discussed making
all requests have the WWE in them to
make sure all your scripts connect
that's what that code is doing right
there so now let's go down a couple
lines and put it in our new code let's
put in a pound sign and tell ourselves
what we're doing this is a comment if
you put it in a pound sign so it won't
be parsed out it's just a comment made
for humans to read and the script won't
execute it create a custom file not
found page
and we're gonna point to it here so ever
document you just type in ever document
no spaces ever look document 404 forward
slash and I'm naming mine file not found
you can name it whatever you want dot
PHP and that's it that's how easy it is
and all you do is go into Dreamweaver
make a little page design it any way you
want use your custom graphics from your
site name it file not found dot PHP or
missing without PHP whatever you want it
to be named and that page will be
rendered when there is a cut when there
is a a 404 error thrown to the browser
that page will be pulled up showing to
the user and it'll look a lot more
professional and a lot of you guys that
may only have a static 8 page web site
that never gets pages renamed or removed
you would never have to worry about this
but many people nowadays are using PHP
and PHP and MySQL driven dynamic
websites where pages come and go see I'm
saying you got habits all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
