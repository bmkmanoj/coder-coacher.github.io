demonstrate how you can communicate
between flash ActionScript 3 and PHP in
a two-way communication example all
these files the PHP file the Fla file
and everything you'll need is in a free
download on the page where this tutorial
is at develop PHP comp and you can go
there and download it free that way you
can get it all the files to see it
working yourself once you put it up on
your server and remember PHP won't
process locally PHP has to be on a
server equipped and ready to handle PHP
processing whether it be your local
environment on your Windows or Mac
machine you'll have to have PHP setup on
your Windows or Mac machine to work
locally and not on the web but if you
post it up on the web and you test your
files in the web you'll see that most
host servers process PHP automatically
so it'll work on the web but if you try
it on your local machine on your local
Mac or Windows machine then it probably
won't work unless you have PHP
configured to run on your local machine
so let's talk about the Fla file first
what happens is it sends a well let's
see if I can go to open up the forum on
the web ok here it is in the browser and
I'm gonna put my name in Adam I'll press
submit
and says the name filled with the
variable of Adam has been sent to PHP in
his back Adam is also set and variable
to from PHP so this is variable one this
text field and variable two here so we
show you how to bring back to part two
variables from the PHP file and I'll
show you the PHP file right now well let
me show you if I type in David try
submit it all change it'll send another
request to the server and little process
in the PHP file and render variables
back out you can see how it says David
here and so if you use the form on the
site in the demo you'll see that it'll
change those names each time you hit it
for Sarah and it changes the name every
time so you can see the communication
happening and so that's what happens
when the user is using it and in the
file in the ActionScript I have it all
pretty well commented what it does there
and it just sets up a URL request and
you are a loader and send some variables
we set up the URL variables here and we
pop them into the values name and pairs
there's two of them right here that will
go get posted to the PHP farm and you
put the URL reference location to where
the PHP file is living on your server
right here in this line and here is
where we put the two variables that we
get back from PHP we put them in two
local variables and flash here and then
we render them out in the two text
fields that are right here and right
here
and you can see they have an instance
name of result one text and I'm a result
to text and let's see let's look at the
p2p file now and in the PHP file when
you look at it after you download
everything you'll see that it's
commented above I commented the lines
above where things are happening and
you'll see that the first line checks to
see if it's in this script will only run
if it's sent from a request is sent from
flash so every won't it won't run if
somebody goes directly to it on the
server if they navigate to this page and
what happens is after we find out if
it's sent from flash everything is ok
then we put the the user name into a
local variable in PHP and then we print
out variable 1 here and then to print
out it's when we print out variable 1
and its value excuse me and it's
variable here and then we put the
ampersand here and we add variable 2 to
the string going into flash and its
values here and you can see how we use
the variable username here or you name
right there and we put it right there
into the sentence and that's what's sent
back to flash and in the form of two
variables then if you wanted to put more
you could easily put more they would
just have to process them back to flash
okay so that's that and I think that's
about everything
it's a it's not too complicated the
process but it's a little a little
complicated but once you do it a couple
of times if you want to make a login
form a contact form site registration
form anything that PHP would handle
maybe to send data to a MySQL database
get data back from a - Creole database
according to what is sent you can do
that there's many many things you can do
with this type of programming in flash
so what I use it for usually is
community to have PHP communicate with
my MySQL databases and render out
dynamic data that's usually what I use
this kind of coding for in a flash this
is kind of ActionScript 3 ok we'll see
you guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
