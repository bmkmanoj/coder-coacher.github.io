add assets to your canvas in an
object-oriented manner to where each
thing placed on the canvas is an object
with its own properties such as its
coordinates on the canvas its fill color
sizing and more this allows us to more
effectively treat our canvas assets as
distinct instances of objects and it
really helps avoid value collisions when
we're animating many things
simultaneously in the canvas this code
exercise will begin with the same exact
code we left off with in the very last
exercise where we discussed animation so
if you missed that lesson or you don't
have the code you can go and watch that
and click the link to get the little
lesson code ok so the goal is to add
these two rectangles to our canvas in an
object-oriented manner and then we'll
discuss its usefulness so the first
thing I'm going to do is go up above the
animate function and type in function
rec obj short for rectangular object
open closed parentheses put an opening
curly brace and then your closing curly
brace now what we're going to do is
start setting out the properties needed
for this rectangular object so the first
property is this dot X and that's going
to represent its X position on the
canvas equal to zero then we'll put in a
comma and since it's related we'll put
another property called Y we'll make
that equal to zero as well now the whole
point of object-oriented your assets is
so that these properties can be
different for each of the little
rectangles so even if I have a hundred
of them on the canvas up this has to say
Y sorry about that so even if I have to
put a hundred rectangles in the canvas I
can create new instances of this rect
object and each of them can have
different x and y-coordinates and they
change over time in your animations and
that's why object orienting your code is
very handy now the next thing we'll do
since we have our properties laid out
let's establish a method of this object
and we'll name it render so type in this
dot render is equal to function and this
function will allow us to in take some
arguments let's get the curly braces in
now the first argument we need this
function render to
take is going to be the CTX object and
the next argument it will intake is the
rectangles exposition so we'll type in
our X and we need to know the rectangles
Y position so we'll type in our Y we
need to know the rectangles width and
the rectangles height and very last it's
color okay so now inside of this render
method that's where we're going to see
TX dot put the fill style and that's
going to be equal to CLR which is going
to be our color argument that's coming
into this function when it's called and
then finally we put CTX dot fill rect
and for this we need our X the
rectangles Y position the rectangles
width and the rectangles height and keep
in mind that the rectangle width and
height can also be made as properties of
this object I'm just keeping it simple
for this basic demonstration now we have
our rect object all set up and ready to
go now we can create new instances of
that object and as many as we want so
I'm going to type in a note that says
establish assets outside of the animate
function to avoid recreating them each
time the animate function runs so that's
what we'll do type in VAR rect 1 is
equal to new rect object open close
parenthesis semicolon now let's create 2
because we need two rectangles we'll
name the second one rect 2 and it's also
an instance of rect object that means it
will have an X property equal to 0 and a
Y property equal to 0 and it will also
be able to call this render function or
this render method now sometimes you'll
see people creating new objects within a
loop so you can set a loop to run 100
time and create 100 different objects on
the canvas using 3 lines of code but
instead of doing in the loop I'm just
going to create each individually so we
don't get ahead of ourselves
ok so now what we'll do is go down where
these two rectangles we're establishing
the fill style and drawing the
rectangles to the canvas we're going to
remove those lines and for the first
rectangle will type in rect 1 dot render
method we're going to pass the CTX
object through it and these are all the
parameters that we're passing to it
so we can actually just copy those let's
put those right in place here now the
CTX object is available within the
animate function so we can pass that up
into the rect objects render method so
that's why we're passing it through
right there and it's coming from right
here so our first rectangle had a static
exposition of zero but it had a Y
position that was dynamic so we type in
rect one dot y and remember rect 1 dot y
is a property of the rect object that we
can access right here this dot Y now the
width and the height I want to be 50 and
the first rectangle was a magenta so now
to get the other rectangle drawn to the
canvas and animated I'm going to type in
rect to access the next instance of the
rect object and this one had a dynamic X
position so we type in rect 2 dot X and
it had a static zero Y position and it
was also 50 by 50 and it was blue it had
a blue fill now instead of saying Y plus
plus and X plus plus what we're going to
do is say rekt 1 dot y plus plus and rec
2 dot X plus plus now you'll see that
you get the same results as before if
you refresh alright so what I'll do is
add rect 1 dot X here rect 1 dot X
property and for rect - we're also going
to add its Y property we should get the
same effect now what that shows you is
that this got Y and this dot X are
remaining independent so if you had a
hundred rectangles on your canvas they
would each reference their properties
through this rect object but they would
all have different values for those
properties now I'm going to make these
go the same way sort of like they're
racing across the screen so I'll put
rect 1 X + + change it from y + + 2 X +
+ and let's see what that gives us on
the right on top of each other so I know
in order to get that effect that I have
to make the blue rectangle start at a
different Y position than 0 so what I'll
do is I'll go up above
my animate function and I'll simply say
rec to dot y equal to 50 actually let's
make that 100 so it has some spacing in
between the one above it and then
refresh so you see now it looks like
they're racing across the screen we can
see both of them together now if you
wanted the second one to go a little
faster you can just times to multiply
some other speed factor onto its
exposition refresh and now it's winning
the race now like I said these other
values like for instance the width the
height the color of the rectangles can
also be established as properties of the
rect object so that means right when you
create your new instance of those
objects you set its properties so for
instance for the width if I want to say
rec 1 dot W and let's do the same thing
for the second rectangle rec to W that
represents its width so that means we go
up into our object we put comma this dot
width is equal to zero and then when the
object is created we type rect 1 dot
width equal to 50 and we also have to do
the same thing for rec to width so you
create your instances of those objects
you supply them with any properties that
they need that are different from the
defaults that you have in place so if
they need to be different from the
defaults that you have in place within
the object then you establish them here
now we run that there we go if there was
a collision in this and the second
rectangle was inheriting the Y property
of the first rectangle you would see
problems in your application this allows
you to keep all of your properties for
all of these object instances and
separate and different
okay so that's how you can add assets to
your canvas in an object-oriented manner
which allows you to use one constructor
for many many many different assets and
you can more easily keep tabs like on
the x position and y position of where
things are so if you're programming a
hit test function you have to know where
the x and y coordinates are for each of
the assets on your canvas within that
function that's when it comes in really
handy you just type in whatever object
dot X and you get its X position</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
