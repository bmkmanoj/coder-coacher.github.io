session of Q&amp;amp;A with adam k today's
question comes 21 hours ago from jordan
male and jordan asks i need an image
that when you click on it it changes the
image there are plenty of code online
but i need one that switches back to the
previous image none of them do that
here's the idea image 1 on click change
to image to image 21 click change back
to image 1 can it be done in JavaScript
I had something like this ok Jordan I've
taken your exact code and I just change
the image file names to match images
that are in my folder or on my server so
let's see what I get when I test this in
the browser I get my image 1 but when i
click it my image to doesn't come into
place now what we're going to do here is
go up into the function and you can
always debug values using alert or
console dot log so what we'll do is
we'll debug this value right here and
we're also going to shorten all this so
we're not calling document get element
by ID so much in there but we're going
to alert the source let's run that again
click it now you can see the source is
to the full path of the image on the
server so that's why it's never going to
match the source is never going to equal
this because there's that whole string
there ok so let's remove that alert and
actually what we're going to do is we're
going to go into where we're calling the
change image function and we're just
going to put this that way we can
reference this object within this
function then within the function we can
just put IMG here now the first line
within the function we're going to get
the image file name only by using the
split method and then popping the last
element array off and that'll give us
just the image file name from this image
object so we access the source the full
string of the path and then we split it
and then pop it now we just say if image
file is equal to image 1 then we say
image that source IMG the IMG object
which is coming in dynamically through
this here and then we can remove that
and
put IMG there as well IMG save
everything and then run that now when I
click the image image 2 comes into place
and then when I click it again image 1
comes back in and it just revolves like
that click click click click now the
reason why yours wasn't working is
because you had the full path you were
evaluating the full path here to see if
it matched just the file name so really
you have to get the file name out of the
full path and then try to match that and
you can remove all that document get
element by ID stuff just by putting this
right here and then your function will
have a reference to this image object
dynamically all right Jordan I hope that
answers your question and gives you what
you need to proceed and it looks like
you're changing a play and pause button
so you would just put your play and
pause PNG image references back in this
source code here and here you know what
to do with it now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
