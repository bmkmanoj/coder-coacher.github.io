in this lesson I will demonstrate how
you can import mp3 or WAV sounds into
your library and then use them anywhere
within your ActionScript and it's going
to be action script based linkage that
we're gonna use for sounds in the
library so what I'm gonna do is put it
on the buttons here because that's what
they're this is most commonly used for
what I'm about to do but really you can
use it for anything it doesn't have to
be on a button and ActionScript can be
told to play the sounds at any time so
if an animation ends or if a movie
begins you know movie clip begins you
can play a sound or during a movie clip
or whatever you want to do with it so
I'll show you here the button code is
already set in place for over function
out functions and down functions the
click functions so for each three
buttons and the listener events are all
in place already and so actually you can
learn how to code buttons here from this
tutorial give them over and out effects
and you can see inside of each button
there's an over and out effect going on
and so let's go back here
let's see now what we're gonna do is
yeah let's just go ahead and import the
sound into our library you see there's
two items in my library and now I'm
gonna and neither of them or a sound so
now I'm gonna go to file import import
the library and we'll just grab any
sound here jingle button it sounds good
now once it's in the library you go to
the jingle button or whatever it's sound
is and you double click that right there
and let's bring this over here and down
here and linkage if it's if it you will
see if you see this view right here hit
advance to open it up and then down in
the bottom you click export for
ActionScript and then I'm gonna name it
give it my own name here roll over sound
this is my roll over sound and then I
just press ok
and it says the definition class could
not be found in the class path so one
will be automatically generated in the
SWF upon export ok all right now now
that the sound is ready and the action
script has linkage to it now we can go
in and actually code it now we'll just
go above our button code here and line
one and we'll claim a variable of /
sound
let's see : this is will just name it
are what we have it identified in the
in the ActionScript in the linkage it
doesn't have to be this can be a custom
name actually
all right looks good yeah
and then we claim new same name
okay
I think that's it
let's give ourselves a comment above it
and say to find sound from our life
define sound from library now we can go
down here in our overstates and place
over sound so we can just double click
that press C over here press B over a
sound dot play so now to play when our
buttons are hovered off over and you can
press control C highlight that line do
it for the button to overstate just
control V and overstate on that one and
button three same thing now when we
publish out let's see if we get any good
results Oh
I must have a name differently in my
linkage rollover sound you'll see Toby
let's open that back up in the library
yep I had a name wrong so let's put the
right name in there and press ok
okay and now when we publish out let's
close that first one now you can see
that we have let me get my microphone in
my headset so you can hear so now you
can see how as I go over the buttons
they had the sound on them and that's
what we wanted to accomplish so that is
pretty much that and if you look at the
action script for that you can see how
you can use this right here over sound
up play over sound dot stop and all of
that good stuff would work
I believe in any part of your action
script and it doesn't have to be on a
button like I said it can be when your
movie starts it can be when any movie
clip fires up could be when a page comes
into view anything you really want to do
with it so we hope you find this one
useful and I will
let's see yeah I think I'll put this fla
for download at develop PHP so you guys
can go ahead and get at the code and
test it for yourself and so you can make
sure it's working that way you don't
have to take my word for it you can get
the file and actually test it for
yourself
and you'll have all the code you don't
have to watch the video to type it out
or anything okay so we'll see you guys
next lesson
oh wait before I go let me show you one
quick thing if you create a symbol
that's a button and say let's right
click this symbol now convert to symbol
button symbol name it whatever you want
press ok now it's a button symbol if you
go inside of it you have three states
here press f6 f6 to put this symbol on
all three states and then on the
overstate you can put that same sound
that easily on that and it does the same
thing so to manually put it inside of a
button symbol it's very easy from your
library and then to put it in movie clip
instances and also use anywhere in your
action script then we put the linkage
and we we define it and then we use it
but to put it just on a button that's a
button symbol by itself it's very easy
to just go inside the button symbol and
the up over state and choose it from
your library here that's much easier but
if you have no button symbol and you
need it for movie clip symbols that's a
the way we showed you previously is the
best way to do it okay we'll get see you
guys next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
