replying to the comments on the video I
put up about five minutes ago and I want
to address one of your comments in video
format in order to demonstrate the way
in which a coder can bounce between PHP
and JavaScript without much trouble when
the need arises
since both languages have similar logic
and let's check out the comments here
it's from Ryan J and he says would there
be an advantage to using JavaScript over
PHP if a user has javascript disabled
this would not work however it would
with PHP and yes that is true a user can
disable JavaScript in their browser
software but as I wrote in the reply you
can see not many people would disable
JavaScript today because the they would
disable almost everything cool and
interactive on the web today so
basically if somebody disables
JavaScript in their browser today
they're they're pretty much shutting
down the web for themselves which is
something that they can choose to do and
that's fine so that's why we're gonna do
a tutorial right now that shows you guys
how to program the same thing we just
did in JavaScript but using PHP instead
that way nobody has the option to turn
off your scripting on your web page now
the first thing is this file will have
to be a dot PHP file instead of a dot
HTML file if we wish for PHP code to
execute inside of it so that's what
we'll do we'll go to file save as test
dot PHP so now you see I have test dot
PHP if I run this the JavaScript will
still work exactly the same way it does
in test dot PHP
the same way it did in test out HTML but
like Ryan J was saying people can
disable JavaScript in their browser
software so now that this is a PHP file
let's simply turn all of this scripting
from JavaScript into PHP and you'll see
how similar JavaScript and PHP are for
this type of scripting so you can change
this script to a PHP block and then make
sure we close the PHP block now we can
just remove all this get the current
year stuff in JavaScript and here where
it says year I'm just going to put date
in PHP the date object and the parameter
I'm going to put as a capital y to get
the full year so what that does it'll
render the number that represents the
current year and then you just +1 to
that to make sure that you get all the
years that you want that way the form
shows the current year as the last year
now here everywhere where you see var I
let's just change that to a dollar sign
i dollar sign i dollar sign i and then
down here also up dollar sign i dollar
sign i and change your plus signs
two dots because in PHP we concatenate
into strings using that instead of the
plus sign and instead of document.write
we simply echo and then we take off this
closing curly brace to have proper
syntax here and now all we have to do is
test this in our favorite browser and
you have to make sure that you're in a
PHP enabled server if you want to run
PHP within your files now when we run
this in the browser software we see that
we get the same exact output that we did
in JavaScript but now this is something
that the user can't turn off this is
magic that the user cannot turn off in
their browser because it's PHP now
instead of JavaScript and you can see
that a very similar loop produces this
for us but keep in mind that a lot of
people not not even many people know
that they can turn off JavaScript in
their browser software it's just us
nerds that talk about it in our nerdy
circles that people can shut off
JavaScript in their browser software but
99% of people don't even know about it I
think maybe 95 percent of people don't
even know about it and somebody would be
seriously nuts to turn off JavaScript
and expect to have a decent experience
on the web today that would that's just
crazy
but now you have a different tool to
produce this kind of thing if you're
worried about such things</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
