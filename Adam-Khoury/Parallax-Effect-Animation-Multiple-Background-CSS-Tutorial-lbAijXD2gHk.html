Dave I'm afraid I can't do that what's
the problem I think you know what the
problem is just as well as I do what are
you talking about this mission is too
important for me to allow you to jump in
this exercise you will learn to rig up
parallax effect animations using the new
css3 multiple backgrounds capabilities
keep in mind that it may look choppy due
to my video recording framerate but when
you run these types of animations on
your computer or website they will
appear much smoother we're using a
single div element to make all of the
magic happen pure CSS and no complicated
scripting I'll give you hints about when
and why you would want to control the
CSS behavior using JavaScript at the end
of the lesson what you see on your
screen now is the finished product of
the lesson we're able to animate
multiple background images inside of
this container because css3 provides the
capability to easily layer multiple
images using the background image
property each layer is set to move
different distances or speeds if you
will which creates the parallax effect
and a cool 3d depth perception the
rocket you see is just a simple
stationary image element inside of the
div and I think you're going to like how
simple the code is to make the magic
happen and it's all pure CSS you can
integrate sprite animations inside of
the div to make even cooler effects in a
future playlist of videos I want to
deliver the contents of the sprite
programming mastery book that I wrote a
few years ago so all of you for free on
videos to help you turbocharge your
keyframe animations to an expert level
that book was only available for a short
time because I wanted to deliver it to
everyone free in video format after
few years the people that bought the
book way back then will have learned
those skills already a couple of years
ago but I think delivering the
educational material in video format
will be much more empowering to everyone
that upcoming series of videos will show
you how to use css3 and JavaScript to do
magical user interactive things in your
documents such as game development in
the dom or on the canvas google type
animated doodles interactive animated
applications and much more but we'll get
into all of that later on when I begin
that new series of videos so if you take
a look at the Stars you'll see that the
furthest layer in the back is moving the
slowest then the layer of stars on top
of that layer is moving a little bit
faster and then you can see as the
planet rolls along it's moving faster
than both of those layers so we have
planet one dot PNG then stars one dot
PNG and star two dot PNG the stars are
star layers when you see how few lines
of CSS it takes to make this happen
you're going to turn and slap the person
that's nearest you if nobody is near you
or in your house you will go outside to
find a stranger to slap you might even
slap several people we're going to start
with the bare bones of a simple from and
to keyframed animation so for this div
down here in the page with an ID of
banner we have an animation property set
on it to run the animate background
keyframes animation in a linear fashion
the duration is going to be 50 seconds
or whatever you want to set it adds and
it's going to run in an infinite loop
and let me show you what this renders is
just the structure of the page and we'll
just add a few more background
properties and we're going to use
longhand background properties so
after background-color with that div
we're going to put the background image
property and in that will set the first
URL the first image background which
will be the planet and mine is named
planet one dot PNG then we're going to
set the background position and for the
planet I'm going to use minus negative
120 percent that way the planet starts
off the screen and then 70 pixels down
into the div so this is my horizontal
axis and this is my vertical axis left
and right up and down then I'm going to
set the background repeat' property as
no-repeat for that planet because we
just want the planet to render once and
not repeat and that's it for the planet
now if you were to render this you
wouldn't even see it because it's
sitting off the screen now all we have
to do is animate it from these original
coordinates so we'll set background
position to these original coordinates
in the from and then in the two we'll
just copy that and change it up to where
we want to animate it to and I'll
animate it to a positive 20 percent
which will move it all the way across
the screen and we'll just keep this at
70 pixels oh no this needs to be set to
positive 120 and this needs to be
negative 20 to go from the right to the
left so now let's see what we have now
you can see the planet is animating and
that's a background image inside of that
div it's not an element you can see
that's going to animate all the way
across and you can fiddle with those
numbers to make a travel a further
distance on and off the screen so just
fiddle with these numbers if you want to
change that behavior at all or the
location that it starts and ends at now
we can add the next thing that we want
to have under that so you can think of
it as
building from the top down you're
layering from the top down starting with
the planet then we can add another URL
for another image this is how we can add
multiple images to the same div as
backgrounds and then the background
position will set for that one will just
be zero pixels zero pixels for both the
vertical and horizontal axis and then
the repeat will be repeat because we
want that star field to repeat all the
way across the screen no matter how wide
the screen is before we go any further
let me show you those images here's the
planet one PNG in my graphics editor you
can see it has a tramp it's a PNG file
with a transparent background then the
star let me expand this a little bit the
star one image is let's see it's
dimensions are about a thousand by five
hundred and then the star two which is
the final background layer that has a
500 by 500 the canvas size is 500 by 500
so that's star 2 dot PNG this is star 1
dot PNG and you can see star 1 has a
transparent background that way you can
see right through it and planet one also
has transparent background so you can
see through these edges of it and it's a
nice round sphere and then here's my
rocket dot PNG which will be a final
little element that we stick inside of
the div that will sit stationary all
right so now that we have the planet 1
dot PNG and the star one PNG set as the
background image for that element we
also can animate the background position
property for that starting from zero pix
0 pics for the horizontal and vertical
axis and we're going to go to negative
1000 pics on the horizontal plane and
then 0 pics on the vertical plane so
it'll just move to the left so over 50
seconds it will move 1000 pixels to the
left and that was star one which is this
image which is a thousand the canvases a
thousand pixels wide let's see what we
get so now you can see we have the star
field the first star field moving at a
different rate than the planet the
planets moving a little bit faster which
gives us a 3d parallax type type of
effect for depth perception now all we
have to do is add the last one so we'll
put another image as the image
background for that div and make that
start to PNG this one will also be
positioned by default at zero pixels
zero pixels and this one will also
repeat across the entire screen and
we'll do a similar thing down here when
we animate it we'll start it at zero pix
zero pix and go to instead of a thousand
we're just going to go negative 500 pix
and zero pixels and that's because this
star r2 is only a 500 pixel canvas
across ok that makes sense so we're
going to move that one over 50 seconds
we'll move that one only 500 pixels to
the left now let's take a look so you
can see we have two star fields moving
at different rates and then the planet
is moving at a different rate from those
others as well and it's really because
of the distance they are traveling since
they're all traveling at different
distances and they're all different
sizes you wind up with a parallax effect
and finally I'll go into this div banner
and I'll put the image which is source
of my rocket P&amp;amp;G and I just put the
style directly in here because it's just
a temporary object in there you can also
set its CSS up here in the style element
and that will just sit stationary
somewhere near the middle we can put
that on something like 45 and it will
sit somewhere near the middle of the
screen see there's our ship we have both
star fields rolling along and there's
our planet and look at the amount of
cold it takes to do that it's nothing
and it's so simple and it really css3
giving us the capability to add multiple
images as the background image for a
single div container or any kind of
container and then you can use
background position for each one of
those separated by comma and then
background repeat for each one of those
separated by comma and then in the
animation the keyframes animation you
just change the background position from
to whatever you want and it's that
simple let's take a final look at the
finished product
now using JavaScript which you will
learn in the new series of videos that
I'm about to produce you can learn how
to do things like create video games you
can do Google style doodles animated
doodles interactive animated
applications the user can have buttons
somewhere on the screen or you can use
touch events to move this rocket ship
around you can change the rates that all
of these layers are moving you can stop
a layer stop all of the layers and that
can all be user interactive so that's
what you'll be learning in the new
series of videos that's coming up pretty
soon this is just the tip of the iceberg
and it's just pure CSS what we're going
to dig into is learning how to work with
the keyframe animations more in depth to
an expert level and that would be the
CSS portion of it and then we'll learn
how to work with JavaScript to control
all of this stuff and a real expert
and we'll also take a look at how to do
things on the canvas that are similar
the html5 canvas element can also
contain animations that are user
interactive and we'll be getting into
all of that good stuff so I hope you've
enjoyed this exercise and I'll see you
when we start that new series of videos
