far ask me how I made my logo text thick
like that how I gave it texture and
shine and I'm gonna show you when
fireworks so let's go to create new
fireworks document let's make it maybe
200 350 by 200 let's make it five
hundred by two hundred five hundred wide
two hundred high and the text I'm using
for that hey let me write out my text
sample text okay there's some sample
text and now all you have to do is get
any font that you can download online
you don't free fonts whatever and for
this one I'm gonna show you what I use I
have Oliver's Barney which I love this
font I love it because it's fat and it's
thick and you can get nice textures in
it so let's make it a little bigger now
we go perfect now we're gonna go to the
color value and click that now you're
gonna go to the fill options and click
that this is what everybody misses click
fill options and you take it from solid
to gradient now once you're at gradient
what I did was for my channel the
graphics on my channel on my logo I just
moved it up like that and moved the
gradient and then I adjusted the
gradient to put a nice white shine in
the center and then you know a little
darker on the top
maybe right about there something like
that actually it was more like this
a little darker on the bottom and it was
on top okay so say you have something
like that and then you want to make it
textured inside so all you have to do is
go back to your fill options see how it
says edge you pick whatever type of edge
you want and then you give it a texture
what I gave it was a metal texture it's
also how I made those galvanized looking
blades that I have on my channel you see
these galvanized looking blades same
effect it's just done on shapes so let's
see the next thing we want to do is add
let's see let's go back to those fill
options make it not so not so full okay
so now we have a texture on it and all I
did let's see I don't think it was so
bright in the center you can change your
color values easy a lot of people don't
know how to change the color values
easily in fireworks you can choose any
color hues you want it's so simple okay
so now let's put an edge on it a color
for the edge just to make that edge come
out a little more not so much I'm so
great right there is about good now
let's add a filter effect of drop shadow
and there you go that's pretty much how
I made that right there you see it's
just a drop shadow textures and gradient
and it doesn't look exactly like but you
get the idea that's how you can make
texture and you can change it to any
texture you like if you go to back to
the color value click it go to fill
options and change it from metal to line
diagonal see now you've got nice sharp
smooth diagonal lines on that it looks
really good and if you make it really
dark on one edge you almost can't see
the lines
and then make it white on top where it's
white you won't see the lines and it'll
Grady it gradiate let's move that say on
top you can't see the lines but as it
gradients and gets darker the lines
start to appear you can do all kind of
cool stuff and you can modify this drop
shadow turn it make it do whatever you
want my channel it's about like that
something like that but that's how it's
done we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
