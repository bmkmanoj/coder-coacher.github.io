about how I scripted my new experience
level renderings on develop PHP comm
member profiles so I'm going to lay it
down on video since the simple script
example needs to be coupled with some
discussion and a quick demonstration and
in the example I'm going to use it's the
forum posts amounts that determine the
users level so how many posts they have
in the forum database but you can use
any number you want and this base logic
is very handy for something like RPG
game programming and you can also
transfer the logic into other
programming languages or other scripting
languages that you are more comfortable
with if you don't want to use PHP maybe
you want to use JavaScript or
ActionScript to lay down the logic to
tally up somebody's experience level so
what I'll show you how to do is script
it in a static sort of way at first just
so you can see how the script operates
and then we'll turn it into a dynamic
script that actually gets information
from your database I'll show you how to
query the database to get some kind of
count for a user so that way you have a
number to turn into an experience level
the first thing we'll start with is
three variables the first one is called
user name and that's equal to a value of
Jeremy and that's just a static value
because like I said we're going to be
just using static values so you can see
how the script logic runs before we
connect to a database now the second
variable is count this can be any value
that you want to pick to experiment with
but in reality you would get this value
this variable would represent a value
that came from the database or for a
certain user right here it's just
statically hard-coded in and the third
variable is level which by default each
member will have a level of one until we
evaluate the count and see what level we
should place them on but by default we
set level as one now we're going to take
this count and evaluate this value in
order to change this level from 1 to
whatever it needs to be and if they're
count is very low it will remain at 1 so
let's place an if condition here that
says if count is greater than
or equal to 50 and we're going to change
the level variable to equal to that way
you know that user is on level two if
the count is greater than or equal to 50
so we know Jeremy is definitely above
level 1 because he has a count of 127 so
he would fall into level 2 at this point
but we have to put a few more if else
condition statements here to make this
all make sense so you can evaluate for
higher levels and watch how easy this is
I'm just going to copy this line I'm
going to go down one line type in else
paste in the line that I copied right
here so I'm going to change the one on
top to say 3 and this to say 100 so for
my user to get to level 2 they have to
have at least 50 in their count in my
case I'm counting forum posts from the
database so if the count is greater than
or equal to 100 the level is equal to 3
and you just copy that top line ctrl C
put it right above that other line in
the previous line you just put it else
and you just keep going like that pretty
much doubling each time you go change
this to a 4 so this is how you make it
to where it's harder for them to get to
the next level once they reach a new
level by doubling the count value that
it has to be to become that level
alright so if the count is greater than
or equal to 200 this user is at level 4
so you can see Jeremy is not at level 4
yet he would fall under level 3 so if I
run this script right now I'm gonna get
a level value of 3 for Jeremy but don't
stop there you keep it going and each
time it raises it's going to double so
you really won't have to have too many
of these in the end just put that line
there just like before we'll put it else
here and then change this one to double
the one before it
and that becomes level 5 I'm going to
copy that line I'm going to do it again
put it right under it else
this becomes 800 now this becomes level
6 now I'm going to do that a few more
times you saw the rhythm of what I was
doing ok so now you see what you have
you have all the way from level 1 to 10
set up already and if none of these
conditions are met then it's going to
remain level 1 so let's say Jeremy had a
count of 0 he would definitely be level
1 because none of these condition
because none of these conditions would
be met in order to change this level
variable so just for testing purposes we
can now echo this to the page username
is level whatever level number it is
with this many experience points so
let's give Jeremy give them 287
experience points and we'll run this
script and see what output we get
okay so this is the output that I get
from my echo statement
Jeremy is level four with 287 experience
points and in the script you can see
that he would definitely fall under
level four because his count is greater
than or equal to 200 and we know he's
not up to level five yet because he
hasn't met this condition for passing
400 yet now very quickly I'll show you
how to render the Stars all right let's
go here on the bottom under where we
echoed out there now I'm going to put in
a little bit of code just these few
lines here I just placed in let me
explain them real quick you can see I
put a comment and it says render stars
or any graphics images according to
dynamic level number so the first thing
we do is we set two variables one is
stars and that's just initializing the
Stars variable and the second one is
creating the iterator variable we set
that at a default of 1 now the while
loop is setup to evaluate while this
number is less than or equal to this
number then the while loop executes it
runs so if this starts at 1 at first
it's going to the first pass in loop
it's going to be while 1 is greater than
or equal to and in Jeremy's case he's
going to be level 4 so that means while
1 is less than or equal to 4 this loop
is going to process so that means this
loop is going to process 4 times you say
I plus plus and that makes I add 1 to
itself so each time this loop runs I is
not going to be equal to 1 it's only
going to be equal to 1 the first time
this loop runs the second time it runs
it's going to be equal to 2 and once
this reaches 4 then this while loop is
just going to stop processing so
basically you're just pumping out stars
while this while loop is processing and
we know for Jeremy's count that he's
going to get 4 stars because this while
loop is going to run 4 times so now
let's take this echo control X and we'll
put it down here at the bottom and don't
worry I'm going to have this script
available at the page develop PHP where
this video is playing underneath the
video so now we can just add the Stars
variable right here to the front
just put stars and a brake tag or
whatever way you want to design it
whatever you want to put in and it's
important to keep in mind that these
stars can be like the HTML character
like I'm using here or develop PHP I'm
using custom images so you can just put
an image tag in here image source
whatever image on your server that you
want to use and it will render however
many times it needs to render to match
with their experience level so now let's
run this and see what we get to refresh
the script you can see this four stars
Jeremy is level four with two hundred
and eighty-seven experience points so
really when you take a good look at this
script these if and elsif condition
statements are the ones that are really
supplying all the logic and if you're
working in JavaScript or ActionScript 3
you would do the same kind of logic and
actually if an else--if works the exact
same way in ActionScript in JavaScript
and these operators also apply in
ActionScript in JavaScript the exact
same way as they do in PHP so this code
could be pretty much copy and pasted
straight into ActionScript or JavaScript
except for you'll have to claim your
variables differently in JavaScript and
ActionScript ok you can see mine tops at
twelve thousand eight hundred for the
count and that's level ten so that they
get way above this they're always just
going to be a level ten which is my
maximum level at the site but if you
wanted to get up to a million it
wouldn't take you very long all you'd
have to do is stick in a few more lines
because these keep doubling each time so
if it's growing exponentially like that
I bet you within three or four or five
more lines or three or four or five more
evaluations you'll be up to a million
and whatever you want to set your level
numbers for whatever now there's also
one more thing we have to discuss this
count would not be really a static
variable in there that you would just
type in a number it would be a dynamic
variable for each member of your site or
each user of your game or whatever so
you got to get that value out of the
database for that user I'm going to show
you a little bit of code that you can
apply to get that count dynamically out
of your database and here you go there's
the three lines that you'll need
so you
a little comment that says connect your
database like you normally do then
target a member ID to get account for so
this member ID variable you have to have
that available somehow in your script
here I'll put up on top another code
comment it says connect to database and
be sure you have a dynamic member ID
ready in script if you're somebody who
wants to create an experience level
rendering for your members you you
definitely already know how to get the
member ID or access to the member ID you
put that in a variable called mem ID and
you simply query your database select
count all from posts where member ID
equals this members ID or die with a
MySQL error so posts is the table that
you want to evaluate to see how many
things this member has put into that
table now that's only for if you have a
forum situation and you want to list
members and how many times they post it
and make an experience level out of that
that's all I did at the Bela PHP but
really you can use any number for this
count it doesn't have to be forum based
or whatever this could just be a number
that you tally up each time somebody
does something you maybe will change a
number in a database it could be that
number whatever so what I do is I put
the MySQL fetch row function at play on
that query and I make that a local PHP
variable called row so you can access
that arrays first index or the first key
in that array by just putting 0 there
between the brackets on that variable
you put that into a new variable called
count that's how you get the count out
for anything you want to query from your
database so you select count all from
whatever table you want where what
member ID equals this member ID okay or
maybe you're selecting a field that
you're tallying a number in that you
just keep compounding to so you would
just say select number field or whatever
field whatever you named your field
like you can call this XP field or
whatever
select XP fields from posts so maybe you
just have a number in one field that you
want to pull out and you don't really
want to count how many posts or things
that they have applied to your website
that's how you can change that up so I'm
going to comment out these lines and
make sure people know that this is only
to be applied if you want to gather that
count number from a database query but
for now I'm just going to leave it
static so people could just run the
script they can just copy and paste this
whole script run it on their server and
it'll show how the logic runs okay so
that's pretty much all I did and I
explained how to change this HTML star
character into an image you just
basically put an HTML image tag in there
put the source to whatever kind of image
that you want to use and that's
everything you need to know so that will
help you give your site members an
experience level according to some
dynamic number and it makes it harder
and harder to get to each new experience
level from the last one because
everything doubles and remember like I
said all you need is really just a few
more lines in here a few more else ifs
and you'll be up to a million or
whatever because these are all
compounding very quickly because this
number is doubling each time all right
so I hope that wasn't too confusing and
I hope this helps anyone who wants to
display experience numbers or experience
levels for the users or maybe you're
creating a game and you want to render
out an experience level from some number
in your database this can be used for
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
