the series this is the final group of
selectors and they're called attribute
selectors they're not part of the pseudo
selector groups they are their own group
and they allow you to target elements
for styling according to the elements
attribute and attribute values in this
first example this style rule is saying
P elements with a language attribute are
going to be colored red you can see we
have one P element that has a language
attribute and it doesn't matter what the
language is as long as it has the
language attribute so the paragraph with
a language attribute got styled and you
can put any attribute that you want to
here so if I change this to title and
then I give this paragraph a title
attribute say hello then that's the one
that's going to be styled if I put my
mouse over it's going to say hello
because it now has a title attribute so
you put any attribute name that you want
right there and it's that way for all of
these attribute selectors okay this next
example we're targeting button elements
that have the attribute type with a
value of reset so let's see what we get
so the one button that has the value for
of reset it's a reset type button that's
the one that got selected so what if I
remove the value portion and we just say
button with type attribute you can see
all three of them have the type
attribute here so all three of them will
get selected so that's why you can
specify the value that way if it's only
a certain type of input or a certain
type of button okay now the next
attribute selector uses the tilde key
and what the little squiggly symbol
means that designates that this value
could be any one of a list of space
separated values so you can see for the
value property
we have space separated list of values
so what this rule is saying that in the
value attribute if the token thee is
found anywhere in this list of space
separated words or space separated
strings so you can see this one has the
word thee or the right there this one
does not have the word the so it will
not get selected but the first one will
because it has the word the so it
changes that field to read if the word
the is found so remember this one is for
a space separated list of tokens and
this next attribute selector uses the
caret symbol it's a little symbol above
the six on your keyboard now what the
caret symbol means before the equal sign
there is that specifies that this value
must lead the value here so we have 3a
elements and they all have href
attributes so if any of them begin if
any of their href attribute values begin
with HTTP then they're going to get
selected
if HTTP is not leading the value then
the element will not get selected you
see the ones with the full absolute URL
starting with HTTP are selected and this
one's not so just remember this symbol
means that this value has to be leading
the value where it's found in the
element on this next attribute selector
uses the dollar sign symbol right before
the equal sign and that's very much like
the last one but with this specify is
that this string must be found at the
end of the value so you see we have com
gov and dot org at the end of these href
values so the one that has the dot gov
is going to be selected because it ends
with that string govt and we get the
expected result
now this next attribute selector allows
you to select elements if anywhere
within the elements title value there is
this substring found so let's look in
these title values down here to see if
this substring is in any of them it's
not in that one and there it is right
there
econ so that means the second one is
going to be selected because that
substring is found anywhere within its
value and there you go now if I wanted
to take this substring right here
copy that and put it right there and
that means only this element should be
selected now right correct and this uses
the asterisks the star symbol and it's a
way to target elements if the specified
attribute has the substring anywhere in
its value ok we've come to our final
attribute selector and the final
selector in the entire list now this
selector uses the the bar symbol before
the equal sign and what that specifies
is that you are looking to match or
select according to a - separated list
so you can see we have P elements with
language attributes and only one of them
has this token right here so this is the
element that will be selected let's
check and see yep so if we change this
to Fr it should target the first element
and there you have it so that completes
all of the CSS selectors now they'll be
more added to CSS with the selectors
level 4 so with CSS 4 there'll be new
selectors and then when they put out CSS
5 &amp;amp; 6 &amp;amp; 7 there'll be even more new
selectors that they add to the
technology but for now you have just
learned if you've watched all of these
video
in this short series you've just learned
all of the CSS selectors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
