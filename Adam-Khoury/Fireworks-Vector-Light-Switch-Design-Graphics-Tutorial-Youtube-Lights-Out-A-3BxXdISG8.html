application that you two had running for
Earth Day as well as a theater mode
example that darkens everything on the
page except the video that is playing
now if we're going to do this just like
YouTube did their lights out application
using an actual light switch interface
that you can toggle up and down we're
going to need a light switch we're going
to need to create that ourselves in a
graphics editing tool because we can't
steal YouTube's because that's a
copyright violation we can model hours
off of YouTube's and make it look
similar but it can't be the exact same
graphics because that is a copyright
violation that you will go to jail
YouTube will send a black sedan to your
house because they can afford black
sedans being sent to your house to kill
you don't steal their buttons now if you
don't want to understand how these kind
of graphics can be custom made by you
then you can just skip to the next video
where we'll begin programming the
application now just to let you guys
know before I show you how to create
this mine is really large and the reason
why i created my vector graphics very
large i'm going to go to modify and
flatten i'm going to shrink it down a
little bit is because the more you
shrink it down it looks better if you
created big and then shrink it down so
let me show you what I'm talking about
I'll control x I'll bring it over here
and compare it to YouTube's we put it in
place here and shrink it down to be same
size as that one and I'll see if it
looks ok I'm professional enough so go
back to one hundred percent and mine
looks pretty much almost just like this
there's differences to where you can see
my edge is darker and I did that on
purpose and I have other differences in
mind that I put there on purpose to
differentiate mine from theirs that way
they know I didn't steal their exact
graphics because even if I took their
graphics and maybe change the color or
the hue a little bit still wouldn't come
out looking exactly like mine you see
mine has deeper crevices here darker
crevices and the the actual switch
itself it's a little more pronounced
okay so if you go back into one hundred
percent and even if you flip that bad
boy you can see it looks decent in its
up position and the down position and it
has like a 3d look to it but you can see
that it doesn't leave the bounds of this
rectangle you see how it has a 3d
appearance but it doesn't leave the
bounds the top of the switch it's still
within the bounds of the rectangle you
see so it's really slick the way they
designed their light switch and I
modeled mine from theirs I'm going to
show you how to create that right now
and I'm using adobe fireworks but you
can be an adobe photoshop or illustrator
or gimp or any graphics editing tool
that you're comfortable with that you
have mastered that way you can follow
the same steps but just using a
different software but if you're using
Fireworks you can follow my exact steps
and you won't have any problems now the
first thing i did was i drew this outer
rectangle you can see it's a solid dark
gray rectangle so let's create that now
and I'll just put everything right next
to that one and let me see how wide this
one is it's 121 so let's make this one
121 as well alright so we have 121 294
if you want to follow my exact
dimensions then I put a black rectangle
on top of that you can see the black
rectangle that I have selected here is
89 with 262 height so let's draw that in
right now what was it 89 with 262 you
see my little tooltips there next to my
cursor you can enable that and fireworks
if it's not enabled for you already by
going up to view tool tips that way you
can see the dimensions of things as
you're drawing them out so right about
their looks good just so that it's off
of the edge a little more on this side
than it is on the other you want the
black rectangle on the inside closer to
your bottom left edge than it is to your
top right edge now you're going to
highlight that rectangle press ctrl-c
ctrl-v to put another copy right on top
of itself see but don't move it leave
right where it is you're going to
highlight the one on top and then the
large rectangle on the outside together
by holding shift you can select one hold
shift and select the other and you'll
select both of them then you go to
modify combined pads and punch now what
you've done and you don't want to move
it like I'm moving it now I just want to
show you what you've done you punched a
hole in that shape using the other shape
if you move it press ctrl Z it'll go
right back now this I stuck a bevel on
you can see I have an inner bevel set
and it's set to 51% 560 and six so let's
go ahead and give it those settings
right now bevel inner bevel put that
around 50 that was on something like
five I think put the angle to this
direction or whatever direction you want
really and this was something like five
or six right yeah that's close enough
now all we have to do is draw in four
shapes and we'll start with a rectangle
so you can go to your shapes tool hold
down get the rectangle and we're going
to start in this corner here in the
bottom left corner and we'll draw up and
in till we get to about may be right
there it doesn't have to be precise and
remember at any point you can adjust the
size of your shapes or the exact point
so if I wanted to move this point say
over here I could do that at any time
and then if I don't like what I did
press ctrl-z now let's highlight this
rectangle and will manipulate it to fill
will give it a gradient of linear what
I'll do is I'll just take it like that
and go to something like that so it
matches the look of the other one
sitting there next to it something like
that maybe a little lighter now I'm
going to draw the top shape which is a
rectangle or you can use your pen tool
as well I'll show you you can just grab
the pen tool and I'm going to start
right about here to where it'll be about
at this point on this one but over here
click down let go and you can hold your
shift key if you want straight angled
lines
if you let go of your shift key it'll be
a free-floating line but I'm just going
to hold it down so it's nice and
straight hold shift down and I'll click
down here let go keep holding shift I'll
go over the route may be right there it
doesn't have to be exactly remember you
can move your shape points around at any
time then you go back up and you go
right there and you see how mine is
jagged if you zoom in you'll see I'm
jagged there so I can just move that
point grab my sub selection tool grab
that point move it up and then
everything is perfectly straight on the
shape it looks like this one has to be a
little wider to match the width of that
other one so let's make it a little
wider just highlighted those two points
by holding shift ok now I'm going to put
a third shape in between these two to
connect them which is this shape here
I'm going to grab my pen tool and you
can even zoom in if you like you can
select one of your shapes zoom in by
holding ctrl and mouse wheeling in and
out you can zoom in then you grab your
pen tool you just go to this point right
here you can start at any point that you
want then you go down to right here and
then you go across to here you can hold
down shift to make sure it's a straight
line click down let go then you go up to
here click down let go and go across or
in my case my line is jagged so I can
move that point that's that selection
just that point up to make sure that
line is straight now this you can see is
not all the way in the bottom so i can
grab sub selection tool grab that point
and that point by holding shift while I
grab them together and move them both
down simultaneously now this thing I
just want to be a solid color so i can
actually go to solid and then just
replicate that color right there now
this gradient has to be a little bit
different this linear on the top where
it's white I want it to be dark like
this one and then light on the bottom
edge like this one now I'm going to take
a rectangle and make that crease this
crease that you see going across right
there you're going to put a rectangle
right here maybe make it two or three
pixels I make sure that solid and not so
bright or may not so dark make sure it's
only maybe three pixels in height okay
now the last shape you have to draw to
give this a good effect is this shape
that you see right here by zoom in you
can see it a little bit better see it
just gives everything kind of like an
edge so you can zoom in on your graphics
a little bit if it helps you out you
grab your pen tool and we can start up
here at the top and what I'm going to do
is go right about here and I'm going to
click down let go I'm going to hold my
shift key so I make a perfectly straight
line as I go down and I'm going to meet
this point right there the edge of that
line click down let go then I'm going to
come down to maybe about right there
click down let go then I'm going to come
into the shape a little bit to about
right there click down let go then I'm
going to go all the way up to about
right here and then all the way across
to there and then I'll have a shape that
I'm going to give a solid fill and I
think that's just about the right color
so you see where it is there and look at
the bottom you want to make sure you
points match up my needs to move over a
little bit this one needs to go over one
to the left and down this one needs to
go down one there now if you look at
everything you got that shape is on top
of the others and you just want to make
sure this shape this rectangle this
rectangle and this rectangle so you have
four rectangles they need to be on top
of that other one so with those four
selected you can press ctrl shift and
you're up arrow key all together at the
same time ctrl shift up arrow key it's
like bring to front or you can use these
up here see send backward bring forward
the same functionality as those now you
zoom in on that you can see you have
like a shadow effect or really an edge a
3d edge effect may
for that switch alright so now if you
take your graphics that you've just
assembled you press ctrl-c ctrl-v you
make a copy and then you go to modify
flatten the copy that you just made and
then you can scale it now once you scale
it you can see how it'll look here and I
have a black rectangle there just to see
how we look on a black background now I
can take that press ctrl x and reference
it do these others and make sure it
looks okay at that size so I'll put it
right here zoom in a little bit resize
it scale it and let's see if we've done
good work that's beautiful looks good
enough and then when it's in its up
position it's going to look like that so
whether you draw it initially in its
down position or its up position you can
just flip it to get its counterpart okay
now here's what you do you want to make
sure that this main file that you're
working in with your editable graphics
you save that that way you always have a
backup you can change these graphics
later if you want change the color the
style but you want to take a copy
actually you want to get it at the size
you want it to be so really that's the
size i want mine to be because I'm
emulating YouTube's so I'm just going to
take that one that I have in place right
there this one that we made just now I'm
going to flip it back to its down
position I shall leave it in its up
position press ctrl x go to file new
okay ctrl V and make sure it's fit into
the camp as well and then I'm going to
go to file export wizard continue
continue exit then I'm going to make
this PNG 32 just so it looks really nice
or you can make it jpg and then up the
quality a little bit make it look sharp
I'll make a JPEG 90 quality export and
in my folder website here I'm going to
put it in my images folder so let's make
an images folder
because I don't have one yet if you have
one you can just put it in there and I'm
going to name it light switch up save
now I'm just going to grab it highlight
it and go to flip vertical up top there
now I have it down counterpart so go to
file and I'm going to do the same
process export continue continue exit
I'm going to go to make sure it's a JPEG
put it on 90 just like the other one was
and export it in this one I'm going to
call light switch down or you can choose
to call yours light switch on a light
switch off I just prefer to name mine up
and down instead of on and off you can
do whatever you want okay I really don't
need that vile anymore so I'm going to
close that file in fireworks and now
we're ready to begin the next two
lessons where we're going to show how
YouTube pulled off their Earth Day
application and there's some things i'm
going to have to talk to you guys about
because it might not be what you think
it's there Earth Day application isn't
really an overlay it's it's really a CSS
manipulation application and I'm also
going to show a theater mode video so
we'll do two videos will show you the
earth day application the way YouTube
did it to darken up the web page and
we'll also show you a theater mode
overlay that shows you how to do
something like have a video on the page
and maybe your web page is white you
click the little switch and it will make
the web page have a dark overlay similar
to the one we did in the last video but
instead of the overlay coming in and
darkening everything on the page the
video will not get darkened but
everything else in the page will the
video will not be affected and it will
then be the focus of attention on the
page it's just like theater mode for
videos and multimedia alright so i'll
see you guys in the next two videos and
I hope this one helped you guys see how
maybe the YouTube designers are working
and how they're creating some of their
vector
graphics okay so we'll see you guys in
the next two videos where we'll be
creating some cool applications using
these graphics that we just created</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
