create tutorials using flash and PHP and
MySQL that show people how to create
membership type websites where people
can join your site then once they
remember they can upload things and
input data into the various forms on
your site and even if you have just a
contact form you want to be aware of PHP
security practices so what I'm going to
do in this video is show you where you
can go and research in full all the best
practices for PHP and MySQL website
security and I'm going to admit right
now that I am in no way shape or form a
PHP or MySQL security expert but I have
my fair share of dealings with
douchebags and knuckleheads that like to
think that they that it's okay to just
go and try and hack somebody site just
for the hell of it to see if it's secure
or not those people are foul creatures
they're foul beasts of the earth so have
you ever come up against them what I do
is I ban people who do that and in my
websites Terms of Use I state that if
you even attempt a security hack that
I'm going to ban you from my whole
network so if anybody is attempting any
security hacks into any of my various
websites I'm going to let you know right
now I'm going to ban you from all of the
networks so I would advise don't try it
on develop PHP comm because I have
measures in place that record who the
foul creatures are that try these things
and the reason why I'm not a PHP and
MySQL security expert is because I'm not
a douchebag I don't go around trying to
hack into people's websites or see if
those websites are secure I'm more a
creative type person that focuses more
on design and yes I'm I'm into coding
pretty hardcore
because coding is a big part of design
nowadays so here are four resources for
you that I think are the best for
learning about PHP and MySQL security
first we have the PHP net manual
security information then we
have the Yahoo developer security
information and PHP freaks has a really
good PHP security section and then
finally PHP security org or PHP SEC org
has a nice PDF that you can check out
and research all about now once you
become familiar with all these methods
that means you're going to be a hacker
or somebody that has the ability to hack
other people's websites just don't do it
okay just make your site secure against
douchebags
don't become a douchebag I've got little
kids at my site that try and hack it all
day long and some of them do
successfully get hacked in and then they
show me the holes that I need to close
up so you're going to be dealing with
this tool if your sites become even
halfway popular you're going to be
dealing with people who claim that they
are security experts and will try and
hack into your site I recently had a guy
who hacked into the site and instead of
realizing that the site had holes in it
had a security hole in it what he did
was he just told everybody out in the
open he should have came straight to me
in private and said hey I found this
security hole you might want to plug up
but what he did was he goes into the the
central chat that's on the home page and
he says hey look I can take over
everybody's Aikau hey look look at how I
hacked the site boasting and bragging
about what a scumbag he is so if you
know anybody that is good with PHP
hacking and they're a good decent person
they're going to come to you in private
and they're not going to go into your
sites forums or into your sites chat and
tell everybody how weak the site is
because they can hack into it okay
that's not a nice person that is
somebody who is out to make themselves
look cooler they're not out to help you
have a more secure site and I'm going to
have all four of these links in the
video description area so you can just
go expand under the video and you'll see
these four links you can just click on
and go and check it out and I kind of
feel it's my responsibility since I show
how to make a lot of
member system type websites that I
should show this information as well so
good luck and I hope your site does not
get hacked by a douchebag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
