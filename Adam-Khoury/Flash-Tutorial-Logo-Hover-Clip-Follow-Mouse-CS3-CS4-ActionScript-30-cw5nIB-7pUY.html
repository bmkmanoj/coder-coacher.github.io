tutorial this lesson I'll be working in
flash cs3 professional and you can be in
flash cs4 and we'll be working in
actionscript 3 and this comes courtesy
of Scotty boy in our forum requested a
tutorial in our requested tutorial
section and reads I was wondering if you
can create a tutorial on how you made
your logo I like the effect of the text
oval coming out or coming in and
following your mouse movement thanks and
this is what he's referring to appear in
my logo you can see how it has a an
animated rollover movie clip that comes
into view in an animated fashion when
you go over the logo and that's what
I'll be teaching you how to do today so
let's go into flash go ahead and close
that out and click actionscript-3 create
new actionscript-3 file and the first
thing we want to do set our stage
properties let's turn is black and let's
make it about 120 high about 680 wide
yours can be as wide and highs however
big you need it maybe your flashlight is
very large it doesn't matter just as
long as we're going to be working around
your logo region so let's bring out an
oval primitive create the logo movie
clip
and by the way with oval primitives I
don't know if you guys know this or not
but you can grab that little dot make it
a doughnut that's what that's for and
you can also grab this dot a little
Pacman effect there and drag it all the
way around see that's how the oval
primitive works okay
so let's grab a text and a static text
type in our business name there
make it beer
sighs it
we sure will make it
white then we'll make this red there we
go ok there's the logo now we'll
highlight both of them right click
convert to symbol name it logo in the
library it's a movieclip registration
top left ok now let's give it an
instance name of logo underscore MC now
we just need one more element ok now
we'll build the little actually let's
grab a rectangle permitted we're going
to build the little hover clip
we'll give it around this
one hundred percent and I'll make it
look just like the one I have
make that white
I'm going to see that edge a little more
up to two and two make it the same color
as that let's make it a bright color so
we can see a really good how to take the
opacity the Alpha on the fill down and
then you can place some text on top of
it
static text field
adjusted to what to make it look like
what you want just it to make it look
the way you want I'm a retard sometimes
the way I talk sorry okay so let's grab
both of those and convert that to a
symbol and this is going to be over logo
underscore MC and registration top left
movie clip okay alrighty now what we
have to do to make it a little bit more
like the one of my sight is double-click
inside of this now and convert that to a
movie clip again convert to symbol name
it whatever you want blab blab dad okay
you can name it inner clip or whatever
and then once you have that we can take
this and make a new keyframe on frame to
then another keyframe I'm frame 15 maybe
12 and then right click between create
motion tween and on the end we want
alpha full and frame to keyframe we want
alpha 0 and also
for key frame 1 alpha 0 okay so now when
the logos rolled over that thing will
fade in that's how I have mindset and
let's see
I'm going to move this stuff over a
little bit the inner elements the text
field I'm going to move this over a
little bit because it gets a little
buggy if the mouse and this clip overlap
and you would see what I mean if you if
you didn't move that over like I just
did so now inside you can see it's
offset from its origin point now back in
the main timeline I hope that wasn't
confusing but it's really not a very
necessary step but you'll see once you
start building if you see it's a little
buggy you know one change things and
before we start coding out now we have
both of our elements here and before we
start coding out let's go ahead and just
put this guy right about there and he's
on you have to make sure this one is
above this in the layer or you can
create a new layer and just take this
control x and put it on the new layer
ctrl shift V just to make sure that it's
on top of this other movie clip you can
rename this over logo and rename this
one logo and then we'll create another
layer on top of over the logo will name
that actionscript 3.0
okay now we have our elements we can
start coding it out let's see this is a
movie clip if you want to make it show
the mouse symbol you could code into the
wheel just wrote it in to show the mouse
symbol because right now if I you'll see
that oh yes that's right we have to make
that not loop go inside that movie clip
on frame 1 you put a stop action let's
make a new layer for the actions that
way that inner clip doesn't keep fading
in and out in a loop and then here we'll
need another stop action so we press f6
f9 to go into the actions panel and type
sto p open parenthesis close parenthesis
semicolon stop action that makes things
stop wherever you want in the timeline
okay so with that logic we won't see it
until we roll over a logo and then it
will do this shipping and then it'll
stop there that way it's always visible
and then when it rolls out when the
mouse rolls out of the logo will program
into the script to make this thing
disappear it's that simple okay now
everything is ready give instance name
instance name on over logo what seems
make sure we get that in now we're ready
to code
and before we do let's go ahead and
bring the frame rate up to about 30 so
we have a good animation it's not choppy
okay let's highlight the ActionScript 3
keyframe press f9 let's go into our
actions panel and start codons sucker
out first thing we're going to do is
import the transitions will need between
effect that's on the over logo MC
transition start tween
and do the same for the next line except
here i'm going to change this to easing
doll okay now first thing bit of logic
is we want to make sure the over logo is
not visible and inside of it you really
wouldn't even need this animation it
would you can just have one keyframe
inside of here and it wouldn't have to
be invisible on it I just do that for
the effect I think it's a nicer effect
okay so we want to make sure this is not
visible which it's not on stage by
default but we want to make sure maybe
yours would be visible on frame one this
is what I mean if yours was like this
see in the main timeline you can see it
that's so if you wanted to not see it
what you would code in and what I'm
going to code in anyway because it won't
hurt mine is over logo underscore MC MC
dot visible equals false it's that
simple to make things visible and
invisible by claiming false and true
anywhere you want your scripts any any
elements buttons and movie clips that
can be controlled through action script
okay so next is the function for when
the mouse rolls over so let's go ahead
and set that up set up the skeleton for
it anyway then the structure will set up
the structure for all three listeners
and this is going to be event
colon mouseevent
closed part this is colon type in the
notorious void all right now we have
structure of our logo over function
ready let's make function for logo out
and logo click that and okay so this
lame this one click this one will go out
so now we have our over out and click
function structures ready let's just go
ahead and add the listeners now its logo
underscore MC I'm going to need to
listen for the over out and click add
event listener and this is mouse event
dot roll over all caps underscore over
and just put the name of the function
here which was logo over and I close up
that print this is sin the semicolon now
we'll just copy that do two more similar
way 12 we'll just name this one out this
one will be logo click OK I think the
base structure is ready to go alright
now we're going to on the logo out this
will be very simple we'll just say over
a little girl underscore MC that visible
equals false because when their mouse
goes out from the logo we want to make
sure they don't see that over the logo
movie clip anymore so we just claimed
false again there and in the over logo
the logo over function that's when we'll
turn it to visible you'll see what I do
there and here I'm just going to type do
whatever crap you one on click a logo
and usually in my case at the Vela PHP I
have a get navigate to URL function or
method set up inside of my logo click to
take you to my home page no matter what
page you're on ordered all of the
hundreds of pages there if you click
that logo you're going back to the
homepage ok so and i'm not going to show
you how to do that because i have like
10 other tutorials that show you guys
how to do that to make them navigate to
URL so that's it for out and click now
we just have our function logo over to
code out let's get some room inside of
that thing
and let's hop to it okay so the first
thing we want to code out inside of this
function is to make the over logo on to
score MC that visible true so we can see
it the next line is going to be let's
see / logo MC that go to and play too so
that will make it go to and play its
frame too if you click over logo MZ and
double-click inside of it there's frame
too so its commanding it to start at
frame to and play that's what it does
okay so now we go into back into our
actions panel in the main timeline let's
say we don't need it down so far all
right now let's go to the next line and
here we're going to type in function
that reports mouse coordinates okay
let's create that function call it fort
stage mouse open parenthesis this is
event
mouse event
this reports anytime the mouse is moved
at all and let's go ahead and close that
one up now inside of it we're going to
type in we're going to claim the
variable and claim a variable and set it
for the let's call it my stage X this is
going to be the exposition up where the
mouse is every time this function this
reporting function is is run which is
every time the mouse is moved even just
a little bit this number equals the
event that stage X and we're going to
have to round the math I'm not sure if
you have to but I like to in these these
type of situations just to make sure I
have stability some stability so event
that stage X and
so what that does is takes the event
which is the report mouth stage or
report stage mouse and its exposition
whenever it's reporting wherever the
mouse is at that moment this number is
rounded we put it into this variable now
we can use this variable which is that
number okay so next line down it's going
to be very similar it's going to grab
the Y position of where the users
Mouse's at that very second or that
split second rather so my stage why so
it's the same kind of thing but we're
just claiming the Y position now okay
and we don't have much more here let's
say we have to do now is set the tweens
the to tweens and that's why we imported
these transitions here to tweens that
are going to make the the X&amp;amp;Y movement
that we want for the overload oh I'm see
so we'll say bar call this one x tween X
tween colon 16 equals lutein
and the object is over logo on the score
MC axis is X strong
ease out and now we're going to put in
the starting coordinates with the x
position movement and that's going to be
over logo MCS current exposition so you
can just put over the low mcx and where
it wants to wind up now is my stage X
very simple so that's going to be the
movement is created between the two
points beginning point is over logo MCS
current exposition and the movement will
stop the tween will stop at where the
mouse is moved to where the reporting
happens then we'll just claim the
duration which is like speed value and
true and now we close that parenthesis
and the semicolon now we can just do a
very similar tween on the X the X X 0
the y axis sorry change that to why
change that to why change that to Y and
change that to a big why I think that's
it yep now all we need is a little
listener for the stage and event
listener for that reporting function to
run so we'll type in mouse event
and this is mouse move all caps and the
scroll move and the function name which
is report stage mouse right there so
you'll notice we have a function inside
of a function I'll point that out right
now okay and see we're in church one
that's everything I think it's done
let's hopefully won't have any errors
let's check it one more time all right
right here is the function logo over
remember we created these three
functions in the beginning and inside of
that logo over function we put in
another function which is the report
stage mouse movements now let's go ahead
and render out see what happens press
f12 cross our fingers oh I got an a
roller line one and two expecting it to
prior before deduct what did I do
oops I forgot my FL FL import FL now
one day I'll be an error-free coder it's
not working let's see why do do do i'm a
goober see here i forgot to change that
to out and i forgot to change is to
click now publish out f12 there it is
now you can see when it rolls up
disappears when it rolls over comes into
view slides into place and it follows
their mouse so what happens is each time
the mouse is moved on the stage when
it's over that symbol that logo that
little movie clip is going to follow it
in a tween a nice easy tween okay that's
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
