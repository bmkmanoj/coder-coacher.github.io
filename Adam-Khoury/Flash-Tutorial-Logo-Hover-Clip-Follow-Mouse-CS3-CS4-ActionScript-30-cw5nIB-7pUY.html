tutorial in this lesson I'll be working
in flash cs3 professional and you can be
in flash cs4 and we'll be working in
ActionScript 3 and this comes courtesy
of Scottie boy in our forum requested a
tutorial in our requested tutorial
section and it reads I was wondering if
you can create a tutorial on how you
made your logo I like the effect of the
text oval coming out or coming in and
following your mouse movement thanks and
this is what he's referring to appear in
my logo you can see how it has an
animated rollover movie clip that comes
into view in an animated fashion when
you go over the logo and that's what
I'll be teaching you know how to do
today so let's go into flash go ahead
and close that out and click
ActionScript 3 create new ActionScript 3
file and the first thing we want to do
set our stage properties let's turn this
black and let's make it about 120 hi
about 680 wide yours can be as wide and
highs however big you need it maybe your
flashlight is very large it doesn't
matter just as long as we're gonna be
working around your logo region so let's
bring out an oval primitive
just create the logo movie clip and by
the way with oval primitives
I don't know if you guys know this or
not but you can grab that little dot
make it a doughnut that's what that's
for
and you can also grab this dot a little
Pacman effect there drag it all the way
around see that's how the oval primitive
works okay so let's grab a text and a
static text let's type in our business
name there
make it beer
besides it
they sure will make it
white then we'll make this red yeah
there we go
okay there's the logo now we'll
highlight both of them right click
convert to symbol name it logo in the
library it's a movie clip registration
top left okay
now let's give it an instance name a
logo underscore MC now we just need one
more element okay now we'll build the
little actually let's grab a rectangle
permitted we're gonna build the little
hover clip
we'll give it around this
100% and I'll make it look just like the
one I have
make that white
I'm gonna see that edge a little more
you know - yeah - make it the same color
as that
let's making a bright color so we can
see it really good now I'm gonna take
the opacity the Alpha on the fill down
and then you can place some text on top
of it
static textview
adjusted to what to make it look like
what you want just it to make it look
the way you want I'm a retard sometimes
the way I talk sorry
okay so let's grab both of those and
convert that to a symbol and this is
going to be over logo underscore MC and
registration top left movie clip okay
alrighty now what we have to do to make
it a little bit more like the one at my
site is double click inside of this now
and convert that to a movie clip again
convert to symbol name it whatever you
want blah blah blah okay you can name it
inner clip or whatever and then once you
have that we can take this and make a
new keyframe on frame two and then
another keyframe on frame 15 maybe
twelve and then right click between
create motion tween and on the end we
want alpha full unframed to keyframe we
want alpha zero and also
for keyframe one alpha zero okay so now
when the logos rolled over that thing
will fade in that's all I have mine set
and let's see
I'm gonna move this stuff over a little
bit the inner elements the textfield I'm
gonna move this over a little bit
because it gets a little buggy if the
mouse and this clip overlap and you
would see what I mean if you if you
didn't move that over like I just did
so now inside you can see it's offset
from its origin point now back in the
main timeline I hope that wasn't
confusing but it's really not a very
necessary step but you'll see once you
start building if you see it's a little
buggy you know one change things and
before we start coding out now we have
both of our elements here and before we
start coding out let's go ahead and just
put this guy right about there and he's
on you have to make sure this one is
above this in the lair or you can create
a new layer and just take this control X
and put it on the new layer control
shift V just to make sure that it's on
top of this other movie clip you can
rename this over logo and rename this
one logo and then we'll create another
layer on top of over the logo and will
name that actionscript 3.0
okay now we have our elements we can
start coding it out let's see this is a
movie clip if you wanted to make it show
the mouse symbol you could code into the
wheel just wrote it in to show the mouse
symbol because right now if I you'll see
that oh yes that's right we have to make
that not loop go inside that movie clip
on frame 1 you can put a stop action
let's make a new layer for the actions
that way that inner clip doesn't keep
fading in and out in a loop and then
here we'll need another stop action so
we press f6 f9 to go into the actions
panel and type sto pops4 enthis
semicolon stop action that makes things
stop wherever you want in the timeline
okay so with that logic we won't see it
until we roll over a logo and then it
will do this shipping and then it'll
stop there that way it's always visible
and then when it rolls out when the
mouse rolls out of the logo we'll
program into the script to make this
thing disappear it's that simple
ok now everything is ready you have
instance name instance name on / logo
one seams make sure we get that in now
we're ready to code
and before we do let's go ahead and
bring the frame rate up to about 30 so
we have a good animation and it's not
choppy okay let's highlight the
ActionScript three keyframe press f9
let's go into our actions panel and
start coding this sucker out first thing
we're gonna do is import the transitions
we'll need between effect that's on the
over logo MC transitions dot tween
and do the same for the next line except
here I'm gonna change this to easing dot
all okay now first thing bit of logic is
we want to make sure the over logo is
not visible and inside of it you really
wouldn't even need this animation it
would you can just have one keyframe
inside of here and it wouldn't have to
be invisible on it I just do that for
the effect I think it's a nicer effect
okay so we want to make sure this is not
visible which it's not on stage by
default but we want to make sure maybe
yours would be visible on frame one this
is what I mean
if yours was like this see in the main
timeline you can see it that's so if you
wanted to not see it what you would code
in and what I'm gonna code in anyway
because it won't hurt mine is over logo
underscore or M C and C dot visible
equals false it's that simple to make
things visible and invisible by claiming
false and true anywhere you want your
scripts any any elements buttons and
movie clips that can be controlled
through ActionScript okay so next is the
function for when the mouse rolls over
so let's go ahead and set that up set up
the skeleton for it anyway then the
structure will set up the structure for
all three listeners and this is gonna be
event
: mouse event
close parentheses : type in the
notorious void all right now we have
structure of our logo over function
ready let's make function for logo out
and logo click that and okay so this
lame this one click this one will go out
so now we have our over out and click
function structures ready let's just go
ahead and add the listeners now its logo
underscore MC I'm gonna need a listener
for the over out and click add event
listener and this is Mouse event
dot roll over all caps underscore over
and just put the name of the function
here which was logo over and then I
close up that Brent this is Cinda
semicolon now we'll just copy that and
do two more similar way one two
we'll just name this one out
this one will be logo click OK I think
the base structure is ready to go all
right now we're gonna on the logo out
this will be very simple will just say
over a little girl underscore MC that
visible equals false because when their
mouse goes out from the logo we want to
make sure they don't see that over the
logo movie clip anymore so we just claim
false again there and in the over logo
the logo over function that's when we'll
turn it to visible and you'll see what I
do there and here I'm just gonna type do
whatever crap you want on click of logo
and usually in my case at develop PHP I
have a get navigate to URL function or
method set up inside of my logo click to
take you to my home page no matter what
page you're on or all of the hundreds of
pages there if you click that logo
you're going back to the home page okay
so and I'm not going to show you how to
do that because I have like ten other
tutorials that show you guys how to do
that so you make the navigate to URL so
that's it for out and click now we just
have our function logo over to code out
let's get some room inside of that thing
and let's hop to it okay so the first
thing we want to code out inside of this
function is to make the over the logo
underscore MC that visible true so we
can see it the next line is gonna be
over logo MC that go to and play too so
that'll make it go to and play its frame
two if you click over logo MZ and double
click inside of it there's frame - so
it's commanding it to start at frame two
and play that's what it does okay so now
we go into back into our actions panel
on the main timeline let's say we don't
need it down so far all right now let's
go to the next line and here
we're gonna type in function
that reports mouse coordinates okay
let's create that function call it
abort
stage mouse open parentheses this is
event Mouse event
this reports anytime the mouse is moved
at all and let's go ahead and close that
one up now inside of it we're going to
type in we're gonna claim the variable
and claim a variable and set it for the
let's call it my stage X this is gonna
be the x position where the mouse is
every time this function this reporting
function is is run which is every time
the mouse is moved even just a little
bit this number equals the event dot
stage X and we're gonna have to round
the math I'm not sure if you have to but
I like to in these these type of
situations just to make sure I have
stability some stability so event that
stage X and
so what that does is takes the event
which is the report mouth stage or
report stage Mouse and it's exposition
whenever it's reporting wherever the
mouse is at that moment
this number is rounded we put it into
this variable now we can use this
variable which is that number okay so
the next line down it's going to be very
similar it's going to grab the Y
position of where the users mouse is at
that very second or that split-second
rather so my stage y so it's the same
kind of thing but we're just claiming
the Y position now okay we don't have
much more here let's say we have to do
now is set the tweens the two tweens and
that's why we imported these transitions
here - tweens that are going to make the
the X&amp;amp;Y movement that we want for the
overload oh I'm see so we'll say bar
call this one X tween X tween : six
tween equals new tween
and the object is over logo underscore
MC axis is X strong ease out and now
we're gonna put in the starting
coordinates for the x position movement
and that's gonna be over logo MCS
current X position so you can just put
over them over MC X and where it wants
to wind up now is my stage X very simple
so that's gonna be the movement that's
created between the two points beginning
point is over logo MCS current x
position and the movement will stop the
tween will stop at where the mouse is
moved to where the reporting happens
then we'll just claim the duration which
is like speed value and true and now we
close that parentheses and the semicolon
now we can just do a very similar tween
on the X the X X the y axis I'm sorry
change that to Y change that to Y change
that to Y and change that to a big why I
think that's it yep now all we need is a
little listener for the stage
an event listener for that reporting
function to run so we'll type in Mouse
event and this is mouse move all caps
and the scroll move and the function
name which is report stage mouse right
there so you'll notice we have a
function inside of a function I'll point
that out right now
okay and see that's everything I think
it's done let's hopefully we won't have
any errors let's check it one more time
all right right here is the function
logo over remember we created these
three functions in the beginning and
inside of that logo over function we put
in another function which is the report
stage mouse movements now let's go ahead
and render out see what happens press
f12 across our fingers oh I got an error
over line one and two expecting it to
fire before deduct what did I do
oops I forgot my FL at Bell import a
bell now
one day I'll be an error-free coder it's
not working
let's see why doo-doo-doo I'm a goober
see here I forgot to change that to out
and I forgot to change this to click now
publish out f12 there it is now you can
see when it rolls up disappears when it
rolls over it comes into view slides
into place and it follows their mouse so
what happens is each time the mouse is
moved on the stage when it's over that
symbol that logo that little movie clip
is gonna follow it in a tween a nice
easing tween okay that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
