the extend keyword to add related
programming logic to an already
established class file so you can make
subclasses of your base class
we're going to continue with the player
class that we left off with in the
previous video and we're also going to
add a little bit to our demo PHP page in
which we created player 1 player 2 and
we had them melee attack one another and
we had the fight results listed so let's
extend class player so let's go down
outside of the closing curly brace for
our class player and let's type in class
inventory extends player then we put an
opening curly brace and go down and put
a closing curly brace and now we have a
and now we'll have an inventory object
reference that extends the player object
now in this class I also want to have
property I'm going to name this property
items and it's going to represent an
array because it's going to be like a
satchel or a sack the inventory object
is going to be something that they can
put many items into so I'm just going to
have an array called items and you can
even add items to it by default so let's
put two items in it let's give each
player flint and a torch now let's
create the first method that this
extension can handle go down one line
and type in public function add item
open close parentheses opening curly
brace go down a few lines in closing
curly brace now in our application when
we call this method add item for the
inventory object is going to be passed
one argument so we have the scoop up
that argument in our class file here and
let's represent that as a variable
called new item now if you are familiar
with working with arrays all you have to
do to add that new item to this existing
items array is array underscore push
function which is one of the built-in
array functions of PHP so within the
array push function we're going to
reference the this identifier and that
player's items array and then the next
parameter is the new item we're pushing
the new item into their existing items
array and that's it you have now
extended your player class
it now has an inventory subclass now
back in demo dot PHP let's make the
magic happen so we can go down a couple
of lines and let's actually just go
ahead and collapse this that way it's
not in our way now the first thing I'll
do is echo a horizontal rule just to put
a line dividing everything on the page
now I'm going to create the prize and in
my case it's going to be an enchanted
ring that the winner of the fight will
get so if Brutus wins the little melee
attack and has more hit points after
they both attack each other and he's
going to win and enchanted ring and
we're going to take that enchanted ring
and put it in his inventory so his items
array after he wins will be Flint torch
and enchanted ring while Mysterio does
not get any prize because he's a sucker
but okay so now let's create new
inventory objects for player one and for
player two so we'll create a variable
called p1 underscore inventories equal
to new inventory and we can just grab
the inventory class open close
parenthesis semicolon you can just
highlight that copy it go down one line
and make it player two inventory is
equal to a new inventory now we want an
if condition to see if the first player
won the fight so we say if p1 hit points
it's greater than player two's hit
points then we're going to grab this
player one inventory object reference
and run its add item method and the
parameter that we want to send through
that or the argument is prize the
enchanted ring so if the player one hit
points it Brutus's hit points are
greater than Mysterio's hit points after
the little melee battle then Brutus will
get an inventory item added and you can
just highlight that line and say else
and inside of your else condition you
can say
to inventory add item of the enchanted
rings so that would be adding it to
Mysterio's inventory because his hip
points would be greater now what I'm
going to do is add some code that puts
new horizontal lines in and basically it
shows the inventory for both of the
players I have little for each loops
running over the player one inventory
items and the player to inventory items
to dynamically list them out so you can
see after all of this code runs who has
the enchanted ring in their inventory
and it will be the winner of the fight
that took place up in this code so now
let's run this script in a PHP enabled
server ok the fight went down and you
can see that Brutus ended up with the
enchanted ring in his inventory because
he won the melee attack so that shows
you how to extend onto a class that you
have if you're going to have related
programming logic you might as well just
extend that existing class and we'll
touch a little bit more on this when we
cover the built in functions in PHP for
object-oriented programming and
basically what wound up happening is
that a new item was pushed onto the
winner's inventory items array and the
loser of the battle did not get any
enchanted ring so you can see how all of
the items in here can stay separated
between each of your object instances
that are accessing them so this items
array would be a very dynamic thing for
each object that is referencing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
