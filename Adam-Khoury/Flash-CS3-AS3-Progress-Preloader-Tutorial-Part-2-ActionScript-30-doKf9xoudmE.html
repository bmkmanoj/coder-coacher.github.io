one we gave on flash and actionscript 3
progress bar and text and this one will
be showing you some cosmetics that you
can place above your bar like a border
and we'll also show you a masking
technique that will also serve as a cool
effect all right now first thing we're
going to do is can select the load bar
and low text layer and rename that load
bar and the next step is to create a new
layer above it and we're going to rename
that border and text I'm going to make
sure it only has one frame by right
clicking the second frame there and
select remove frames so we're going to
grab our dynamic text field on stage
here I'm going to cut it by pressing
ctrl x and now select that new layer and
press ctrl shift V to paste the dynamic
text in place so now we have our text
there now let's make a border and we're
going to pull out a rectangle primitive
drag it out to be 200 pixels wide and 8
pixels high and once that's set we have
a thickness on the border of 2.75 and
you'll notice there is no Phil and we're
going to make sure that's sitting right
above our movie clip that we made in the
first video and so what will happen is
that movie clip that load bar movie clip
will grow right underneath and in
between that border and so that's one
method of cosmetics and the second
method is you keep your border there and
everything and select a movie content
layer and create a new layer there and
we're going to name this one load bar
and you'll notice now we have two layers
named load bar so we're going to rename
the load bar layer now mask
we're going to keep the item the movie
clip though is on the mask layer and on
that layer and that's going to serve as
our mask now now with that logic our
mask is now going to logic or our mask
is going to dynamically grow and not our
load bar we're going to put a new movie
clip here to be our load bar so
highlight the second frame and
right-click it and select remove frames
on the load bar layer the new load bar
layer and in our library I already have
a symbol a movie clip symbol name my new
or my new bar and I'm going to drag that
on that load bar layer that we just
created underneath both of the other
layers there and now i'm going to select
a mask layer and right-click it and
select mask from the pulldown and now
what happens is our dynamic movie clip
that we made in the first tutorial is
serving as a mask that's going to
magically grow and show us that bar and
i'll show you the bar i created now you
can lock all these layers and just
select that green bar with the dashes
and i'll show you inside of it is whole
just a whole bunch of rectangle
primitives that are 5 pixels wide and 8
pixels high and they're put right next
to each other to make it a dashed line
looking thing and that's it so now
you'll have when you go ahead and
publish this save this and publish this
and you go into your get it up on your
web server you'll see that you have a
new cosmetics for your load bar and it
looks more like a load bar than it did
before okay we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
