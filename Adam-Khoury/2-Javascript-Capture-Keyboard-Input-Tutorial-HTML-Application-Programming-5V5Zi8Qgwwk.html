JavaScript video lesson we demonstrated
how a programmer can detect exactly what
keyboard keys the user is pressing in
that video I said we would do a
follow-up lesson that shows the simple
logic of how to program things to happen
in document according to specific keys
being pressed for this exercise I'm
going to target the users W a s and D
keys which are popular for controlling
movement in games and such Here I am a
develop PHP comm and this is the code
from the previous lesson that I just put
out with the capture keyboard input
tutorial that shows you how to detect
what keys are being pressed so I'm going
to grab all that code I'm going to go
into my code editor which I'm using
Dreamweaver but I'm going to be in code
view the whole time so you have you can
use any code editor you want WordPad
notepad whatever okay so if I press f12
or if I run this document in a browser
it's going to show me what keys it's
detecting what keys I'm pressing it
shows me the key pressed and the key
code that corresponds with the key being
pressed so that's all well and good now
we're going to add some code right here
right under the status where we updated
the status to show what key is being
pressed we're going to add some
condition logic because it really does
us no good to detect keyboard keys if
we're not going to detect specific keys
being pressed and do and run a specific
code for those specific keys so this
shows you how to do that we have just
simple if and else if condition logic
going on here first one the first
condition is if key press is equal to w
and remember when I said you can use the
key code if you like also that way you
can target the enter key or the shift
key if you want to use the key code
instead of the actual key label you see
I'm using the key labels here just to
keep things simple so if key press
equals W is this condition here this
next condition is else if key press is
equal to a then if key press is equal to
s and we have if key press is equal to D
so we have all four of those conditions
set up now if the user happens to press
W I just put an alert to run
says foot script to run specific for W
key here so you would run your specific
script for the W key right here in this
area you run your specific script for
the a key in this area and so on and so
forth with the s and the D as well
because somebody told me that on
Facebook when you press the L key I
think it is or one of the keys lets you
just light an image if you're looking at
the image you can just press the L key I
think and it likes it automatically so
that this would be how Facebook is doing
that they're targeting the L key or
whichever key automatically likes a
picture when the person presses the
keyboard key they're targeting it in
this sort of way and they're running
their specific code for their L key when
it's hit in the area they had designated
here so I really can't show you what
kind of code to run because my
application is not really doing anything
it's just detecting the keys being
pressed but you would run any kind of
JavaScript that you know how to run
anything that JavaScript is able to do
you can do in these areas okay so let's
see if this works
we should get an alert if we press those
specific keys I'll hit some other keys
just to show you nothing happens when I
hit those but if I hit the W a s or D
key I get an alert that says put script
to run specific for the W key here all
right so that pretty much shows you
everything you need to know and we're
not going to waste any more time I'm
going to get into making some other
videos today I'm going to do a couple of
PHP tutorials and maybe a few other
things okay I'll talk to you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
