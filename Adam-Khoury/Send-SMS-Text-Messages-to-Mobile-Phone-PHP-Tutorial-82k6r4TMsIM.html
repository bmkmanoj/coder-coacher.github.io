use PHP to send SMS text messages to
mobile phones programmatically
and automatically you can use this to
send text messages to your website
members your clients or customers from a
web-based platform SMS is an acronym for
short message service fire up your
favorite code editor and get yourself an
example dot PHP file ready to go and the
first thing we're going to do is put the
two variable in place that's going to be
equal to the mobile phone number that
you want to send the text message to so
I'm just going to put five five five
five five five five five five five at V
text com and this is for a Verizon
carrier and you'll have different
carrier domains that you'll have to put
in place for people that have different
phone carriers so here is the phone
number that you want to send the text
message to then the @ symbol and then
the carrier I'm going to replace this
with my actual phone number when I run
the test in just a moment because I'm
going to send this text message to
myself and I'm also going to give you
guys a list of carriers the domain code
for popular carriers next variable is
going to be the from variable I'm going
to make that equal to an email address
that is established on the server that
I'm going to be sending this message
from so if you happen to have a website
or something you want to make sure that
you establish the from email address on
that web server so I'm just going to put
XXX x at adam quarry comm and when i run
my test i'm just going to simply put the
actual email address that I have on my
web server the next variable is the
message the actual text message itself
and that's going to be equal to whatever
string whether it be static or dynamic
lead arrived so just for this quick
demonstration I'm just going to put a
static message and it's going to say
this is a text message then I put a
backslash n to signify newline and then
I just typed in newline if you want to
put new lines in your text message
you can just put backslash n and when
the person gets the text message they'll
see this on one line and then this on
the next line now the very next variable
is going to be the headers and inside of
the headers I'm just going to put from
colon space and then the from variable
which is right here and then we put
backslash and there just in case you
want to have more information sent
across the headers and I'm going to be
giving you guys some tips after we get
done testing the script regarding some
important information pertaining to this
so stick around to the end if you want
to hear all that
now we're just going to fire off the PHP
mail function which is the function that
we use just to ordinarily send emails
the first parameter is going to be the
two variable the second parameter is
going to be the subject and we're just
going to make that blank so you can put
two single quotes or two double quotes
I'll just put two single quotes here the
next parameter is going to be the
message variable and then the last
parameter we'll need is the headers and
you can put additional headers in place
and I'll discuss that at the end so
basically that's the gist of it now what
I'm going to do is change this to my
actual phone number and I'm going to
change this to my actual email address
that's established on my server and then
I'm going to make sure I load this up to
my live web server and give it a test
alright Here I am at my live web server
using a browser and I have input example
dot PHP into the URL address bar now I'm
just going to hit enter to make that
load again and then I'm going to wait
and see what happens to my phone there
it is now I'm turning on my phone
opening it up and there is the text
message it says this is a text message
and then the next line down it says new
line now don't bother navigating to that
URL because I've already removed the
file so you'll just get a 404 if you try
to do that now where I have this script
available at develop PHP comm I'm also
going to have this listed on the page
which are popular SMS
Gateway domains and you can see that I
used v-tex because I have Verizon as my
carrier so here's the verizon gateway
domain v-tex com Virgin Mobile Alltel
AT&amp;amp;T boost republic Wireless Sprint
t-mobile and US Cellular
now there's also something called HL our
lookup API which you can research on
your own which is something that will
allow you to automatically detect what
carrier is related to the phone number
the mobile phone number that the user
gives you so I'll leave you to look that
up on your own and since that can get
sometimes costly in a little complex you
might just want to request the carrier
from the person from the user so you can
request a carrier for instance I would
tell the web platform that I have
Verizon Wireless that way the program
knows to use v-tex comm as the carrier
gateway domain so that can be an easier
workaround instead of using an HL our
lookup API but that means your user will
have to give you more information which
I don't find so bad now the very last
thing we have to discuss is additional
headers oh and by the way you can just
spend time researching more of SMS
gateway domains that you might need this
is not a full list this is just the more
popular ones now finally let's discuss
the additional headers so if you go to
develop PHP comm we have the PHP video
tutorial section and in that section we
have the social where is it down here
the social network development series
and here in the signup form you'll see
that we're firing off the PHP mail
function let me get this a little bigger
right here we put two from subject
message and this is an HTML formatted
email and here are all of the headers so
you can see we're setting the from
variable in the headers in the mime
version
and also the content and also the
content type which in this case was text
HTML so depending on what you need to
send you can put additional headers in
place but if you want just plain text
messages then this is sufficient now
let's quickly discuss how to automate
all of this whenever is some kind of
interaction or maybe a form being submit
occurs you might want to automatically
send text messages to people and what
you can do is just request the person's
phone number and then that can be
gathered out of your database at any
later time to send that person a text
message anytime that your web platform
needs to and you can also dynamically
put in information for the message it
doesn't have to be static information
like this it can be gathered from a
forum or whatever so that's how you
would automate the text messaging from
your web platform and that about wraps
it up that should give you a good start
into sending SMS text messages from your
web platforms to either your clients
customers or just your website members
and it would all happen programmatically
and automatically happy coding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
