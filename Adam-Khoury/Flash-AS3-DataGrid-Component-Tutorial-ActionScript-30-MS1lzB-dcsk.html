tutorial that's accompanied by a free
source while we're learning how to
dynamically program the data grid
component and make special
customizations to it to make it look and
render the way we needed to let's click
on create new ActionScript 3 file and
we'll adjust the size of the stage to
680 by 340 should be a good size and the
first thing I'm going to do is place my
little background graphics
let's give it a rounded edge 1.5
that should be good and let's make it
nice dark blue okay now I'm going to
lock that layer create a new layer and
call this my task text that's all that's
going to be on that layer and now the
ActionScript 3 layer that's where we're
going to have our ActionScript 3 on the
task text layer let's create a dynamic
text field by clicking the text tool
make sure a dynamic text is set it's
going to be multi-line selectable
aligned left bold 16 16 point now let's
name it task underscore txt that's going
to display the choice when the user
clicks one of our data grid items choice
is going to be placed into that text
this text field here and now we can go
ahead into the ActionScript 3 layer well
before we do that let's grab the data
grid out drag it to stage and then just
press control X and that's a good way to
get the component assets into your
library and the component itself because
it needs to be in the library before we
start coding it out if you want to bring
it in dynamically like we're going to
show you how to do or render it
dynamically on stage ok now we're going
to import the data grid control
we're going to create some items now
that are going to be inserted into our
data grid you can have as many as you
like these objects are going to be
multi-dimensional arrays of sorts so we
open the curly brace close curly brace
semicolon now within the curly brace
we're gonna have each we'll have title
each item in the multi-dimensional array
we'll have title and value and you'll be
able to access those or the data grid
accesses those rather so let's say the
first one is June 26 with this which is
today June 26 2009 and it's a string we
close that off it's already closed off
now we place a comma and the next item
can be a lot like this item so let's
just grab all of that
actually let's just type it out this
won't be time use the title of that one
or the key and that's going to be a
string of say 5:30 p.m.
now we put another comma and the last
column that's going to be in our data
grid furthest to the right will be the
task and that will be a string of
whatever the task is I'm gonna save me
Kayla downtown for dinner
okay so that is how you assemble each
item that goes into each row of your
data grid and each one of these the date
the time and the task is going to be a
column in your data grid so now we're
going to create two more of those just
for the example keep it nice and short
you can have as many as you like let's
just change this to object to object
three change the date to 27 this is can
be like my schedule of events what I'm
gonna be doing just my calendar you know
a data grid is great for that let's make
this one in a.m. time maybe 8:30 a.m.
this one can be 2 p.m.
and this task will just change change up
these items in them we'll get going okay
now we have three items that are going
to be placed into the data grid for us
now we're going to claim a text format
as well just call it my text format and
this is going to be text format equals
new text format
so that claims a new text format object
and it has a name of my text format now
we can give it the properties we want so
we just say my text format dot whatever
property whatever value dot bond let's
make the font Comic Sans
comic sans ms make sure that's an N okay
now we say my text format and this text
format that I'm creating right now is
going to be the list items these string
items the dates all in blue here
whatever is in blue there okay so now
formatting these string items or we're
building the format that's going to be
applied to those string items if that
makes sense okay so once we get that
we're gonna color the items claim 0x and
a hex value of six six six six six six
and that'll be a darker for a gray color
I'm kind of kind of dark gray color and
now let's set the my text format size
dot size equals 14 so the text in the
grid in those columns will be 14 pixels
Comic Sans with this color okey-dokey
and that's it for that now what we have
to do is create the data grid object so
we save our data grid
this is data grid equals new data grade
and now what we're gonna do is claim a
list of properties that were going to
place on the data grid this dynamic data
grid that we're creating and I'm just
gonna paste them in and explain each one
line by line so we don't waste too much
time watching me type out okay we've got
all the properties and values so we want
to place on a data grid set in place
here and I'll explain them line by line
this line the move property places the
dynamic data grid at certain location
coordinates on stage 20 X 50 Y the width
attribute sets the width of the data
grid the height sets the height row
height sets the row height that each of
these items will have each item will
have a row height of 35 and I'll show
you how to tweak out the sizes and what
happens and how scrollers automatically
appear and all that stuff in a second
and then we claim the columns date time
and task and it picks those up using
these item arrays when the data grid
items get sent in and I'll talk about
that in a second
so here we claim the columns that we
want and here we can access the columns
indexes to claim the width for certain
columns so the first column that holds
the date will be 120 wide second column
the holds to the width sorry that holds
the time will be 70 pixels wide and then
the last column will just be the rest of
the grid till we reach 480 pixels
because the whole grid is 480 wide and
we claimed resizable columns true that
way the user can take their mouse and re
position where the grid where the grid
is
where each column ends and starts and
then you can set that to false if you
don't want to allow them to be able to
slide the grid
columns and then we sent the set render
style which uses our my text format here
and applies it to those items each item
in the list in the data grid each one of
these items will have this my text
format applied to it and the data grid
gets items added to it here
finally all three of these these object
items that are it makes like a
multi-dimensional array that gets fed
into the data grid and so once we have
all of that then we can just add child
in this whole place effectively place
your dynamic data grid on stage right
when you claim this line here or execute
this line now the last thing we want to
do is create a change event handler but
when somebody clicks one of the items
inside of our data grid because data
grid items are made clickable okay so
that's the last little thing we'll
program here and then we'll see what we
have okay so all we need is to claim an
event listener a change event it's going
to be on the data grid so let's grab the
data data grids instance name here data
grid dot add event listener
and it's going to be event dot change
all caps and let's give it a function
it's going to fire all on that change
event let's name it grid item click it
sounds like a good name to me let's go
down a few lines and now let's write
that function in its claim function grid
item click this is going to be event
that event colon event
close parentheses : Boyd open curly
brace close curly brace and there's our
nice grid item click function all nest
it up
okie doke now what we're gonna do in
there is use our task text right here to
display something we're going to display
something in the task text when they
click one of our grid items so let's put
test X dot txt equals this will have
just a string value plus this event dot
target dot selected item so you can use
the selected item method here to grab
what the user has clicked on the value
of task
right there if you wanted the value of
the date or time that's what you would
put there you put date and that would
grab the value of the date and now we
want to let's put the task first though
the task now we can put plus open a set
of quotes double quotes and put
backslash N and that'll put a line break
into the text field the way we can
append to it because when you use the
append text method to put the other
items in for display
okay so let's grab this actually we have
to put something you know put tasks in
all capitals
yeah that looks good okay now the next
line
it's going to be a pending text so
instead of using that text property
we're going to use a pen text and this
won't have an equal sign it will just be
in parenthesis and it will get appended
to that text field along with that first
line and we don't want the tasks again
we want the date this time it's that
easy to display it all in one field
let's make it a line very similar to
that one appending we make sure this is
D and this would say time and this would
be the the time so we had task date time
we'll all be displayed within this text
field each on separate lines because
we're claiming the line break there
using backslash n now let's publish see
what happens
okay there we are we have three items
now let's see how we can manipulate this
with the numbers a little bit okay we
don't need it 200 hi didn't need that
much - just those three items so let's
make it 120 hi let's render out okay you
see what happened if we make it shorter
in its height property then is able to
hold all three of those then it gives us
a scroll automatically which is a nice
feature of the data grid now if I click
one it's not updating my text field
let's see why not
tasks underscore txt grid item click and
then change
oh the text is blue there we go see so
each one you click it shows that
information there now let's get it to
where it's just right maybe the height
would be 130 perfect so there you go so
you can make this thing as wide as you
need to as high as you need to and it'll
give you a scroller if you haven't just
to have you know a small amount of real
estate that you're working with on your
page and you can also have things happen
and functions by off when these items
get clicked and their values can be sent
okay so that's how you work dynamically
with the data grid component flash in
ActionScript 3 we'll see you next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
