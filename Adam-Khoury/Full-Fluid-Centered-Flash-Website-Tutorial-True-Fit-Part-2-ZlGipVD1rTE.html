fluid liquid flash website in
actionscript 3 and i'm working in cs3
and you could be working in cs4 for this
example 2 and don't forget to watch part
1 if you're coming to this video and you
see this video first you happen to see
this video first this is a really
comprehensive part one that shows how to
set all the stuff up from scratch so at
the end of part 1 we ended off with the
on enter frame I mean the resize
listener here and this is what would
happen every time the user resized their
browser window and that's all well and
good but you notice that when you first
output it doesn't if you have this on
the web and you go to the site the users
the these elements won't be in the
position snap to the corners like they
need to on the first entry of the site
every time so to make it really mean and
work the way it should I'm going to
highlight all of this i'm going to show
you how to set up an on enter frame
event listener we're going to put that
on frame 1 we're going to move all the
code here for the resize event listener
on the frame to that way when the site
initially loads all of these things will
snap to the place they should be okay so
all you have to do is grab all of this
code press ctrl-c now let's make a new
keyframe on frame on actionscript layer
there on frame to make a new keyframe
and press f5 on frame two of the site
elements layer just to extend it out you
don't want another keyframe there so you
can see how it's set up there's no new
keyframe here but there is a new
keyframe here because we want different
code so let's go ahead and slap that
code back let's get rid of these three
lines because that variable and its
attributes already set on frame one
remember right here
and now those attributes are already set
so we don't have to claim them again
referring to so let's let's just name
this initial display initial display
press ctrl-c rename it here that way we
won't have a duplicate function name
because you would get an error if you
left those function names the same on
frame 1 and 2 and this needs to be on
frame 1 just an add event listener for
the for the file itself and this is
going to be enter frame instead of
resized so you say enter underscore
frame all caps that's it so that's
initial display setup then very
important thing to do here is on the
initial enter frame of the site you want
to say after it does all the math and
puts everything where they need to go
you want to say go to and stop frame too
that way it'll run this code one time
just one time go to and stop one frame
too so let's make sure we have a stop
action here just to make sure it stops
and that should do it now I'll show you
how to code in some transition effects
sorry about the phone ringing
actually I gotta dip out for just a
second but i'll do a part 3 that will
show the transition effects but right
now let's surrender out you can see on
enter the site all the elements are
exactly where they should be now and
which is the way the application should
work so in part 3 i'm going to show you
how instead of these things just staying
put really tightly to the corners i'm
going to show you how to make transition
effects to where it all flies smoothly
to those new coordinates all the nice
buttery effect okay so that'll be part 3
and that concludes part 2 and part 2 was
just to show how to make the site
initially load correctly put all the
elements in the correct place with a non
enter frame event and then it snaps to
frame to wear our resize display happens
constantly every time the user would
resize the browser all right so look for
part 3 if you want to see how to make
these things have buttery movement okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
