demonstrating how you can access your
common libraries folder and dig through
it and see everything it's got inside of
it because i'm finding out that there's
a lot of people who don't even know it's
there so i'm going to show you how to
access it we're going to open to create
a new fireworks document and we're in
cs4 so if you have cs3 and ate our flash
or fireworks aight you won't have these
these libraries with these exact items
so let's make 400 wide by a 250 press ok
and our stage is set now you may see the
common libraries folder open here
already but if you don't you go up to
window and select common library or you
can hit have seven as a hotkey but
you'll see there's 2d objects animations
buttons flex components HTML components
mac components menu bars web and
application components and windows
components i think that means windows
components but the
so what I'll do is I'll go through and
show you what's inside of these things
and how they can work for you and at the
end of this tutorial I'll show you how
to bring the animations one of the
animations on to the stage render it out
then import it into flash to use as a
preloader loading animation so let's
open up the 2d objects folder and i'll
just select a few of those so you can
see what they are and these are two D
flat graphics for quick loading and
there's all kind of cool graphics in
there for web-based applications and you
can dig through toes and see what they
are and you just drag them out to stage
if you want to use them and there they
are and now that's 2d objects now the
animations folder we have ready-made
animal H animation so you drag those out
to stage it's going to say the animation
the symbol extends beyond the last state
of the document automatically add new
States and you say okay and then you
press play on the play button down here
and there it is it's a nice animation
and if you were to put a globe or
something behind that that would look
really cool okay so let's get rid of
that one off the stage there and there's
also loaders and a couple of other
things and i'll be showing you how to
bring this loader right here in to flash
my press play so you can see it it's a
cool little loader animation that you
see on a lot of websites and you can
have it quick and simple and easy if you
follow what I do the end of this
tutorial
okay so let's get that one off the stage
then we have a buttons folder and these
are ready-made buttons that you can
tweak out the design on and then add to
your applications and we have flex
components these are all the familiar
graphics that you would see in the Flex
component or the Flex graphics for their
components HTML kind of looks like flash
graphics to me but oh well in the mac
folder there's a i'll be using this
because this is really cool you can make
your flash applicate applications or
your HTML applications look like default
Mac browser interface so the Mac browser
scrollers the you know the cool cool
looking scroll ballers pull downs radio
buttons and checkboxes you can have all
of that and you can import it all into
flash and make it look like it's an HTML
Mac document instead of a flash document
so that's pretty cool then we have some
menu bars and these will probably be
probably be the most used out of all the
folder items here by people once they
discover these you can just drag the
menu bar out you can see it's got nice
graphics ready to go you double click it
and then you can edit labels and the
graphics
so that to that and then we have the
windows folder pretty much the same
thing there's sliders all the graphics
that yugioh on windows components for
the web and here we have web and
application graphics and these are
really nice 3d ish type graphics a
camcorder little contact email man all
kind of other things in there that you
can dig through okay so i think i'll do
it apart to to this lesson i'll show you
how to bring one of these animations
these loader animations render it out
and fireworks and then bring it into
flash for use and your flash projects</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
