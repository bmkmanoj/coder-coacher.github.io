your own custom JavaScript WYSIWYG rich
text editor text area replacement from
scratch or enhanced text input in your
site applications okay so you have your
HTML form and all of your JavaScript
calls ready to go which has all been
discussed in video one now all you need
is your JavaScript file that powers the
application so go to file new JavaScript
let's go to save as
now once you're in the directory where
your parse file and your form is let's
create a new folder that's called what
you see is you get WYSIWYG then we'll
double click inside of that folder and
this javascript file that we're about to
create is going to be named W Y s IW y
gee-whiz e b-- save and you can remove
if you're in Dreamweaver you can remove
that line now you can see in video 1 we
placed a connection to our WYSIWYG jas
file so already in the head tag and the
certain elements within this HTML page
that are calling on functions within
that JavaScript file ok WYSIWYG das in
this file you're going to see a
JavaScript method being used a lot named
exact command an exec command has
command identifier for doing things such
as but not limited to bolding making
links coloring things inserting images
and formatting text so let's take a look
at the full list of command identifiers
that we can use with exec command before
I show you how to apply the ones that we
want the particular JavaScript WYSIWYG
we're creating for this tutorial now
I'll just keep blabbing away as you guys
scan this list with your eyeballs and
the ones that I have highlighted in blue
and underlined here the ones that we're
going to be demonstrating with in this
tutorial series within this video
actually we're going to knock all of
these out the blue underlined ones and
then you guys can do further research on
your own to implement all of these
things if you want to experiment exec
command is one of the methods associated
with the rich text editing feature of
browsers where it executes the command
on the target document a target document
element or the given selected range of
text that a user has highlighted in an
suitable content container is also
supported by all current major browsers
so what we'll do is go through the HTML
file we made in video 1 and start
scripting out the JavaScript functions
that its elements call one by one if you
don't know what I'm talking about please
watch video 1 within our HTML file the
first JavaScript function being called
to run is this iframe on function so
that's the first one we'll build let's
just copy that go into WYSIWYG and let's
type in function iframe on open your
function with a curly brace and then go
down a couple of lines and close it off
with the curly brace now let's go into
the HTML and count exactly how many
functions that we're calling that one
there's another right there 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10 11 12 and then the submit form
function so that's 13 so we'll go back
into the WYSIWYG KS and we know that we
need 13 functions so let's just go ahead
and make those shells or skeletons for
those functions so we'll copy that one
highlight the text ctrl C and then ctrl
v down another line control V just do
that till you have 13 in place now you
guessed it you're going to change the
name on all of these iframe on functions
down here to where only the top one is
called iframe on and the rest have the
corresponding names from this HTML file
so let's put ibold here I underlined
goes next and I'm going to do that for
all of them okay so you can see I have
empty function shells set up for all of
my function calls that this HTML file is
going to execute the iframe on function
gets this line of code what we're doing
is we're targeting the rich text field
in the document and we're making its
design mode property equal to on that
way people can type in it if you didn't
do that people wouldn't be able to type
in it and edit the content that's within
it so you're targeting the iframe
because in the index file you can see
our iframe has the ID and name of rich
text field not our text area our text
area has the name of my text area so in
the
big file we're targeting the rich text
field that's the iframe design mode on
when the ibold function we have this
line of script and here we start using
that exact command method so we target
the iframe we use the exact command
method upon it and we set the proper
parameters that we need you can see
there's three parameters going into that
method and the identifier is bold the
command identifier in this case is bold
now for the I underlined function we're
going to have this line of script we're
going to target the iframe once again
use the exec command with the command
identifier of underline the I italic
function same thing now for the I font
size function you have to get a value
from input some kind of input for the
user has to use to give you a value of
what size that the font is supposed to
become so we're going to use two lines
of script let me explain those to you
now the first one is creating a variable
called size and that's equal to a prompt
window so you guys remember in part one
when I was showing you the final
finished product of what we're going to
be creating you saw those prompt windows
coming up where the user can enter in
information that's what that is and
after they enter the information in and
press okay whatever they put in is
placed into this variable called size so
then we just run an exec command on the
iframe targeting the font size command
identifier and we put size here in the
value parameter now it's a very similar
set up for allowing the user to change
the font color or the color of items so
you can just make a VAR color that's
equal to a prompt window that says
divine a basic color or apply a
hexadecimal color code and then you just
take that color and apply it as the for
color using exec command and some people
choose to put a color picker there's a
lot of free Java Script color pickers
out there you can create your own color
picker if you like but for this basic
one I'm just going to use a prompt once
again to take in some kind of value so
the user can type in gray blue
we're gold they can type in all those
basic words for a color and they can
also put in a hexadecimal color code for
advanced coloring now let make the
horizontal rule function work you can
see that's very much the same as the
others up top we're using the exec
command method and the insert horizontal
rule command identifier now the
unordered list and ordered list is very
much the same I told you guys this is
easy we're going to run an exec command
insert ordered list is the command
identifier and we're going to give that
a value the name of that list is going
to be new oh l new ordered list the I
ordered list function same thing now for
the I linked function we're going to do
a similar thing that we did up here
using a variable and a prompt window so
we're going to use a link URL variable
that's going to be equal to a prompt
window where they enter in the URL for
the link they want to make then use that
link URL as the value parameter where
they create link command identifier of
the exec command method now the I on
link is very simple you just run the
unlink command identifier with the value
of null now for the function I image I
chose to put in another prompt window
that's going to allow them to put in the
image location and that's stored into a
variable called
image source but this time I put in an
if condition statement that says if the
image source is not equal to nothing
that means if the value is actually
there then we're going to use the insert
image command identifier with the value
of image source so that's just a little
quick example of how you can check for
null values before you actually run an
exec command ok now this last function
was a little bit tricky to assemble and
you guys better thank me finish crap
because it's just not so easily thrown
out there in any documentation that I
found anywhere on the web so here you go
what we're going to do is take the form
and use document.getelementbyid e on my
form which is the name of the form that
we're using C name my form ID my form so
now we have a variable called the form
which is an identifier for that element
now what I had to do to target the text
field I wanted to take the value of the
iframe and
into the text area that way my form can
process like normal when it's submit so
I said the form that elements and I
targeted my text area which is that
hidden text area that's hiding and
really it's just sitting and waiting in
your form for when the form gets
submitted because right at that very
moment when the form gets submit you
take the contents of this rich text
field and you place it into this my text
area then you submit the form and
everything works like a normal form
would so that's why we're doing this
here we're targeting the my text area
that value and we're making it equal to
what's in the iframes rich text field
iframe and I had to use window frames
rich text field
document.body that inner HTML to grab
all the data that's within the iframe
and place it into the text area it
seemed like such a simple thing to do
but it really took me like 30 minutes if
not 45 minutes to assemble this one line
of code through trial and error then
finally the last thing the last line of
your WYSIWYG to make everything work is
the form dot submit and that's how you
actually submit your HTML form goes to
my parse file dot PHP like it normally
would in the action but you're able to
use some JavaScript throw in a couple of
lines there to put the value of this
iframes all the HTML text that's in that
iframe you pop that into the my text
area real quick and then you submit the
form that's why we're submitting the
form through JavaScript that way we can
do that little bit of trickery at the
end there you get it that's how it works
so now what you have when you combine
index dot HTML with WYSIWYG das and my
parse file dot PHP which all three of
these scripts are going to be available
from at develop PHP com whenever I get
these pages up I'm just going to have
the full application source code under
each video for this lesson series that
way
nobody's like where's the screw where's
the script I'm going to have the full
script for everything under each video
so these scripts will be available
develop PHP comm when I get these pages
up there
I'll have the index.html the WYSIWYG j/s
and the my parse file dot PHP now in
video number three which is going to be
the final video of this lesson series
we're going to focus on this PHP file
we're going to talk about converting
HTML tags to their HTML entities for
security sake or just display sake we're
going to talk about filtering and we're
going to talk about some database
security and then you should be good to
go
but now try everything out because I'm
not going to release the source code for
until I get done with part 3 so you guys
can code yours out and you can see how
easy it was create this function so you
guys can code yours out by yourself
without having to copy my source code
but if you have in trouble all you got
to do is wait a day or two and I'll
finish video number three and we'll have
everything all the script and source
files available at develop PHP comm in
the JavaScript video tutorial section</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
