web community using PHP MySQL and flash
brought to you by develop PHP calm and
before we get back into the edit profile
page and parsing these little forms here
for them to for the members to change
their profile data I'm going to create a
new page well in the register page I I
remove the phone number field because I
don't want to gather the users the
members phone numbers somebody asked me
at YouTube why was i gathering phone
numbers and it occurred to me I have no
idea there was no rhyme or reason for
that I was just throwing random things
in here there's no set purpose this is
just like a demo site but it's gonna
have pretty good search engine indexing
and all those good things like any other
website where you can join as a member
to help spider and promote your web
entity so I grabbed the phone number
field and I went into the code of the
register form and the register script
and I removed all the things that dealt
with the phone number field and adding
it to the database and filtering it and
all that stuff it's all gone so now what
I want to do is go into the database and
change the phone field because when we
created our site if you open let's go to
scripts when we created our table
remember we had we placed a phone field
so now there's a phone field sitting in
a database with it's not going to be
used so
well what I want to do is change the
name of that field in the database to
stylesheet that way I'm going to show
you guys how to let your members just
pick a style a whole ready-made profile
pimped-out thing they can stick with the
default or you can give them these cool
styles to pick from and that's what I'm
going to show you so we're gonna change
this to style so to do that we're gonna
make a new script so let's just close
that script and say file new PHP script
remove all that actually let's replace
it with our little script and then I'll
explain the little script so I'll order
magically pop it in and here it is and
let's file save this as in the scripts
folder alter table alter underscore
table dot PHP actually it'll give us the
extension automatically so it's press
alter table and press save so now we
have our table that PHP script in our
scripts folder and we're gonna send it
up to FTP and what we're gonna do is
change actually I have to swap these two
well let me show you inside of
phpMyAdmin you can also change it right
from here in PHP myadmin and you can log
into PHP myadmin
from your your host server cPanel or
whatever kind of admin panel they used
at your main host servers log in when
you log in at your host server there's
an interface called PHP myadmin where
you can manipulate your database
directly through a nice easy-to-use
interface you can just change phone
right here press edit and change the
word phone to stylesheet and it would be
that easy and so what I'm gonna do is
show you how to do it through a little
script if you didn't have the ability to
go into PHP myadmin
and will be able to see if this changes
from phone to stylesheet so let's say
let's put phone in the front here change
yeah let's just put stylesheet here
changes the phone so it's gonna change
phone to stylesheet and give it all
these these attributes and so and then
it's going to run the query and if the
query runs successfully and there's no
hang-ups then we get print success in
table field manipulation else it'll say
script failure so let's go ahead and put
this bad boy up via FTP alter table and
I already tried a little experiment just
to make sure it would work and sure it
does so now our script is in there so we
can go to content type
it's up on the web now like we can
navigate straight to it just by going to
our website wherever your website is
then you go to your scripts folder
scripts navigate to alter table
and it says success in table filled
manipulation so that means good things
so now let's refresh our database and
look at and make sure it really did that
so let's just my members see after zip
it said phone
now it says style sheet that's what we
wanted now I'm gonna let the members
pick the style sheet and so that was
that we can close that out everything is
good now at the edit profile page which
we are currently which is the point
where we are at in our tutorial series
we're gonna now show you the parsing
mechanisms for all of these little
things and I'll explain them all these
little tables that you see here they
each have a form inside of them for all
the things you want let the user
manipulate and you'll see this source
file when you download the if you want
to download the source file package and
you'll see that each one is nested
inside of a table each form is nested
inside of a table and it has its own
submit button so when they the reason
why I did that it's for efficiency I
believe I think if you have one submit
button down on the bottom to refresh
everything you're going to be running a
larger SQL query on your database to
update things then wouldn't would be
needed all you have to do is run what
they want to change no reason to change
all of this nonsense and unless state
actually put a change into one of these
fields and press submit on that section
so it will just run a little leaner to
do it that way and this account settings
link is not even active yet which I just
put a pound sign in there to make it
blue with an underline and like an
active link so now I'm going to show you
how I'm gonna put in the code to parse
all of those little forms when they
press submit
and here's our default code that adds
all of that data to those fields in the
forms there and this one's gonna stay in
it's gonna add a little space here and
here's where I'm gonna code all these
queries in and I'll show you and explain
and then you download the source files
and and look further or maybe look while
I explain it whatever you want to do
okay okay so I've created the mechanism
the parse mechanism for the member
picture when they attempt to upload or
replace their profile picture and it
looks like it's line 23 251 so I'll
explain those lines in just a moment
first I want to show you what it does
see let's edit profile ok so right now I
have you see my default member picture
because I don't have a picture yet so I
uploaded the new edit profile page with
the new parsing mechanism and I'll show
you on that the parsing mechanisms for
the name location website this should
say YouTube are not even coded yet I
just kind of put the little condition
nest there or the function nest for the
that if statement and what happens
inside of that when the parse is going
to be database updates but when they
upload their picture there's no database
updates needed for our simple system
here so I'm going to show you how this
works now and then I'll explain the code
for that image upload script the parsing
mechanism so we go to browse as a logged
in user and we go to thumbnails when we
find a picture that's less than 50
kilobytes because we have a 50 kilobyte
max set and we're not doing any image
resizing in this application later on
down the road in some separate tutorial
I can show you guys how to do image
resizing it's really easy and you can
also rename them and reconfigure the
file to be a dot JPEG if they happen to
upload a dot
gifts or dot PNG but your say your Flash
gallery would only allow the JPEGs to
run in you know so you might want to
convert them I'll show you how to do all
that in later tutorials but for this
system we got to get going along here so
I'm just gonna show you how to get it
upload so I press submit mm-hmm and you
see how it shows this green text here
your image has been updated it may take
a few minutes for the changes to show
please be patient plate please be
patient no need because the image
already shows the change and if I go to
view my profile booyaka so that's how
that works and we're just setting the
profile image dimensions in the page
oops in the page that shows the the
profile data and this one is set to 100
and it shows on the profile as 250 so if
you were to happen to not browse for an
image and press submit like I just did
you see red text here error text it says
please browse for an image before you
press submit or if they try to load one
that's way too large we don't know if I
have a really large one No
let's see images here we go
I don't have any large images
yeah that one's huge that's an 81
kilobytes there we go now I'll press
submit and it's going to tell me your
image was too large please try again
alright so let's talk about this so what
renders out all of these errors and
success messages and actually uploads
the picture to my spot in my folder
where it belongs and then renders it on
page is right here lines 23 to 51 and on
line 23 we check to see if the post bar
equals pic and what I did to make coding
easier for us is I added a a an input to
the form to pick one form a hidden type
input and the value is pick so on each
one of these little forms down through
your page you just put a I'll show you
for the next one I haven't even put that
in yet so I'm gonna load it here and
it's going to right before the submit
button and this one is going to be named
so the parse variable is named the
hidden parts variable is named in this
form the hidden parts variable is picked
you see what that does so that way in
your form you can just process that
piece of data and not the whole page or
whatever you know what I mean so when
they if so we say if the parse bar
equals pick then we run another
conditional these are error conditionals
here to say this one says if there the
file the field is basically if the image
is not there when they press submit then
we say please browse for an image before
you press submit and we lay out this
error message and this is very important
right here we claim I even wrote you
guys some nice comments out through here
it says now let's create some devolve
are so our script does not return errors
when we try to print them to page they
cannot be missing so error message is
right here it's claimed as with the
value of nothing success is claimed here
with the value of nothing so at least we
claim their variables
because on the page on the HTML section
you go to the design you'll see that we
are printing right there success message
and error message so if you go to the
page you press edit profile' there's no
error message and no success message
there because there's no need to show it
it's only in that conditional if they
try to upload a picture that's how that
works so if they try to upload a picture
they're definitely going to get an error
message or a success message either one
is definitely coming their way
and that's when we printed out the page
so if the page is set to always by
default print that ever message and
success message if those variables
weren't set up here
by default the script could return
errors to the browser and you don't want
that so that's why I said those okay so
inside of the mechanism to change the
picture first the error message we print
out is please browse for an image before
you press submit if they happen to not
browse and then press submit then if
that condition doesn't meet and
everything's cool there then we claim
the max file size to be 550 1200 bytes
and that's equal to 50 kilobytes so you
can set your size your max file size for
any size you want to allow them to be
the max file size and then you check to
see if the file size meets the criteria
so if the the actual picture being
uploaded happens to be larger than the
max file size we give them this error
your image was too large please try
again you can see my font tags right
there where I make it read and then if
it's success here success message I make
it green okay so the next error would be
to check the preg match so if the preg
match does not meet for give JPEG PNG
for this file trying to be uploaded here
then
we give them this error message your
image was not one of the accepted
formats please try again
on length of picture like we did up here
on link just removes it from the
temporary upload bin or wherever the
temporary storage is for uploading files
then we just put out the that's the end
of the error messages so if all of these
error messages or the error conditions
do not get matched up everything's cool
so we are going to now parse the picture
or upload it and move it to the place in
on the server where it belongs for this
member in their folder and we're going
to rename it whatever they named it
let's see if they load of PNG I'm not
sure if this works but we're going to
test it out if it doesn't I'll fix it up
but I'm gonna test to see if they upload
a PNG or at that gift if I can just
transform the extension name to dot JPEG
if that'll work it might knock out the
functionality of animated gifts that
might be something that has to be fixed
but for now we're going to roll with it
let's see so what we do is we claim the
name for the new name of the pic and we
run the this place file variable which
at this point right when the script hits
this it's going to run this function
move uploaded file and here's our file
name for the file that the user is
uploading and it's temp directory and
then we take the folder we have to
access the directory path members folder
ID is going to be that members ID they
each member has their own folder and
then we just sync in the new pic
right there and then success message
yeah we print success message so no
error message would come to the user
only a success message because these
conditionals weren't be met and pretty
much that's it then we closed this else
right here just last else then we close
the else that checks if the file exists
that would be this guy right here he
gets closed right here and then then we
close the main one up top
actually yeah this one right here and
that's the whole shebang so what I'm
gonna do is add the rest of these
mechanisms and the rest of these are
going to be database you notice here we
didn't do any database queries or
updating but here all the rest of these
are going to be database oriented and
they're very simple
and you'll see it's just simple updates
and I'll explain those
okay I've got the rest of the parsing
mechanisms scripted out
and it was pretty simple and let's go to
the web let's look at this thing
I already FTP the page up and I'm on my
edit profile page and let's change North
Carolina I already tried it out it works
good too
it's just say New York and then if I
press submit it says your location data
has been updated and we get a nice green
text 6x success message then we go to
view profile and voila I am now from New
York edit profile make this you know put
it back to North Carolina because that's
where I live submit
vacation that updated view profile okay
so we know everything's working right
now let's go to edit profile again and
I'm just going to mention that I removed
allowing people to change their name if
they don't put their correct name into
the form where they register to the site
and register form and these these files
will be updated in the zip package when
I put it up later actually before you
can even view this video the source
package will have been updated so you
can go right to it and get it now okay
so I removed middle name gathering
middle name from the register form
because I realized I don't even want it
I don't know why I was gathering that so
it's not in use in the database anymore
and on the edit profile page they cannot
change their first and last name if
somebody gets married and they changed
their last name and they want to change
it in our system they can delete their
account because I'm going to show you
guys how to allow people to delete their
accounts and start over if they need to
but a lot of people wouldn't even ever
need to change their name especially men
and that's probably what's going to be
mostly joining this site it's gonna be a
big sausage fest here because males are
mostly developers and geeks and stuff
like that
okay so most males won't need to change
the name I'm not even gonna put it and I
removed it from all the parsing
mechanisms and let's talk about this
location parsing mechanism now and this
is the mechanism that runs when they use
this submit button in this form it'll
update all those four fields and I show
you how to do that here so first thing
we're going to do is check if it's the
location parse bar and if that's good
then we run it and we bring the all the
location variables posted variables into
PHP locals and then we run error
handling from any missing data we want
to make sure watch if I take this
state field and make it blank and I
press submit I get an error it says
error read text please do not make the
field or fields blank in that section so
they know and you put North Carolina
back in for them see there now if they
press submit all the four fields are
there and says your location that is you
know that would be normal functionality
ok so that's why we check to see if any
of the missing data or any of the data
is missing then we give them that error
message right here see it please do not
make the fields blank in that section
that's very simple else if all the data
is there and everything is good then we
take the state city and zip because
those are the three fields where they
can actually type something in and try
and hack your database so you go to
replace well first thing I do is I run a
replace for any apostrophes if they
happen to put you know if they're from
st. croix or I don't know maybe some
locations have an apostrophe in them you
want to preserve that so we put in the
hex value for that symbol and just make
an apostrophe become the hex value and
it displays as an apostrophe on the page
and same for the little squiggly little
mark above the squiggly key tilde key
and because that's used in dated
database queries sometimes as well so
you remove those and you make them
apostrophes then we run MySQL real
escape string to clean and filter the
data before we make any queries with it
or update our database and same for
cities that city and zip we replace
apostrophes run the filter place
apostrophes run the filter then
everything can go into the database nice
and safe
so we say this query is saying
update my members set country set state
and set city with those values that the
user is placed in and the zip is here
also and you can just use a comma to
separate all the values there and you
can update as many of the fields for
that member that you'd like in one query
like this where ID equals this user ID
and that's with that that's how that
query works so we say here right after
the query is processed in the script
if SQL update is all good font colors
green your location data has been
updated else font color red error
message that's very simple then we just
close off our else conditions up top
there close it off here and that's it
for that now get to this section if they
post the VAR of website that means if
they hit this submit button
to change your website address the URL
then we just bring the posted into local
we run the replace like we did in the
register script so we don't if they
happen to put the HTTP colon slash slash
then we remove it because we added for
them when we when we're gonna render it
on their profile and we want to make
sure that's not in there when they when
they said it so then we run the replace
for any apostrophes that might be in it
which there should never be any
apostrophes in a URL but just in case
somebody's doing something screwy we're
gonna replace those with the hex digits
and run MySQL escape real escape string
to filter then we run the update which
says MySQL query update my members table
set website equals this new website
value that the users trying to update
and so we replaced that value or we
replaced that that filled a column with
this value here and then we're ID equals
this members ID and we run the same kind
of if and else condition to give them
the success or error message it's very
simple and now the next oh I guess I
should mention that none of these will
run and I put in Nice comments here that
tells you that none of these are gonna
run unless they hit that particular
submit button I hope that makes sense to
you because it's very simple the way
this all works but this is probably one
of the more complicated scripts that
we're going to have in the whole system
and it's really not that complicated you
can you can get your head around it
pretty easily if you dig in especially
if you have a little bit of knowledge on
PHP already so or any kind of
programming for that matter so now for
the next one we say if the post war is
YouTube we run our regular things and
replaces and filtering then we do the
MySQL update it's going to update the my
member set YouTube to the YouTube value
that they enter we're ID equals this
users ID and then we run the success or
error message handling here next one is
for the bio body the About section so if
the post war equals bio body we put it
into local then we well we put the post
variable into a local variable here and
we do that so we can more easily you
know you don't have to use this you can
just use this anywhere in the script
below making local variables out of
posted variables or things like that
just helps you minimize your your
scripts when you're trying to access
that variable and do conditions on it
and things like that or run functions on
it
it just helps to have them in local
variables but it's the same value that
value is going to be placed into this
variable so then we run the replace and
for the apostrophe thing filter it and
then here I run a nl2br and HTML special
chars I run two functions there that are
native and PHP that you can research
from PHP net I'm not going to explain
all the things that these do because
it's already documented very nicely on
the pages at php.net all you have to do
is sink this into the search field for
the function list up top and it'll show
you everything you want to know you
don't have to ask me a darn thing okay
so SQL update my member set bio body
with this new bio body where or the bio
body value that the user is placing in
where ID equals ID and then we run the
success or ever and that is it
and here I like making a nice visual rep
separations in my code you can see that
here each section where they're gonna
update has a nice bar here separating a
nice three line bar and then down here
where we're finished doing the parsing I
put a little for section dash bar and we
talked about all the parsing has ended
by this point in the script so query the
most current data for the member this
will show the Refresh data to the users
so they do not see old data after making
changes it's really simple the way the
script works but it might seem really
big and it might look complex the first
few times you look at it but don't let
that get to get you down this is so
simple the way this thing works it runs
exactly the way we program it to so then
the final default query is here we get
all the information on the database
that's current and we display it to the
page that's how it works so we will I
guess this would be part 11 so in part
12 we're going to delve into back into
the profile display page because right
now it looks like crapola so if we go to
view profile this is not the way I want
this to look so I'm gonna do a little
bit of tweaking and now I'll talk to you
about what we're doing there and show
you how to embed the YouTube channel a
couple of other cool things yeah we'll
see you in part 12 I just wanted to
mention to you guys in this part of the
series I did a couple of changes to the
CSS file and I added one little thing
see how it says form fields here it's a
class definition for form fields I just
named it form fields you can name it
whatever you want really and I'm using a
certain text color and a background
color to make my forms look the way I
want see when you go to that it
all the form fields are but like a light
blue and the register page as well and
all I had to do to achieve that was set
this in the CSS file which is going to
be in the new uploaded package the
updated package today and if you go to
the register form and click on that you
can see it has a class down here set on
it a form field it's very easy to do
you go to the code you see it right
there class form fields and that's set
in the CSS file and that's why you see
all my fields in blue I just thought I'd
mention that to you so you weren't
confused about why you see blue fields
in mine and not yours you got to get the
new package it's got the new updated CSS
file ok see you in part 12</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
