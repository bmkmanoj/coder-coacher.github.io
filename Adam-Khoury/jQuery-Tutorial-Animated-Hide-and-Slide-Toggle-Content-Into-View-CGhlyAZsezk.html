to serve two purposes one is going to be
showing you how to do these hide and
slide toggle containers and you see this
kind of functionality on YouTube and
Facebook and Twitter a lot let's say if
I'm in my comment section at YouTube and
I slide that down you see when I click
the subject line the whole thing slides
down and it shows hidden content that
was hidden in a container underneath the
subject line just pushes everything down
on the page pretty much okay so we'll
show you how to do something like that
and I'm going to be showing you how to
go and get the jQuery library there's
some things you can't do with jQuery
that you must turn to for flash but
there's also a lot of things that you
can do on a web page that it's like
standardized functionality now thanks to
YouTube Google Facebook and Twitter all
having this kind of functionality on
their sites and their sites being so
popular so many people being used to
using this kind of functionality it's
just a good thing to know so if you guys
don't happen to know jQuery yet or work
with jQuery yet
the second purpose of this video is to
show you how to go to the jQuery website
download the latest version I'm going to
show you how to implement it into the
root directory of your website so it's
all ready to go
all you got to do is read their homepage
check a few things out see how jQuery
works tutorials all this stuff but what
I'm going to be showing you is how to
grab the file grab the code and set it
up in the root directory of your website
so you're all ready to use it I'm going
to show you how to implement it as well
in this tutorial where I'll show you how
to do these hide and slide toggle
containers like that we got to go to
jQuery and grab the latest release and
you can use previous releases and
actually I had this code working on
version 1.3 point 2
and let's try it with 1.4.2 now and when
you're going to download it is one
important thing to know there's a
production version and a development
version the development version is all
the functions kind of laid out in a
human viewable sort of way but it takes
up a lot more space because there's the
line breaks and the spaces and
everything and if you get the production
version you can see how much smaller it
is in kilobytes and it's minified and
gzipped and this is the development
version which is the good human readable
and editable version where you can
further add two things there or try to
understand what's going on in the code
with this version the production version
is what you want to use on your live
website the development version is what
you want to use if you want to develop
the jQuery library any further or
manipulate it for your needs what I'm
going to do is grab the development
version and grab either one you like and
they'll work the same so let's press
download and there's the file I'm just
going to ctrl a grab all that code and
copy it and I'm going to go to
Dreamweaver and let's go to file new
JavaScript wherever that is right there
and let's control V pop all that code
right in there you can see this all kind
of stuff going on in that which handles
all kinds of things in JavaScript and
the library is made to where if you have
let's go back here
the job the jQuery library is made in
such a way to where all you have to do
is make function calls and send certain
variables through those functions and
the jQuery library is going to do things
automatically for you so we can go ahead
and close this and like I said go ahead
and check out their home page tutorials
and all that good stuff
okay now let's save this file save as
and I'm just going to put it on my
desktop I'm going to make a new folder
I'm going to call it my website inside
that folder I'm going to make another
folder for housing any JavaScript files
that I might put on my website now and
in the future so let's put that called
j/s and right there we're going to name
this jQuery - one point four point two
and let's make sure that we make it
javascript extension so it says one
point four let's make that one point
four point two Jas you can name you name
this javascript file whatever you want
you can name it poo-pooed ijs if you
want but I'm going to name mine what the
actual version of the jQuery library is
here that I'm using so I'm going to
press save and now that's all setup and
ready to go now I'm going to take this
code that I wrote to make this hide and
slide happen and all this code is going
to be available in the I'm going to put
a link in the YouTube description area
which is now under the videos you can
expand it down actually it uses hide and
slide to span that to expand that
content out so if you go under the video
YouTube and the information area there's
little toggles there you hit the toggle
and you'll see the link to where I'm
going to have this code available so you
don't have to try to code this out in
the video you'll just be able to copy
and paste all this code and grab it up
and experiment the way so I'm going to
name this file let's go to file save as
let's go to desktop that same folder my
website this would be the root directory
of your website and I'll just name this
index so say it was the homepage of my
website and let's make sure that's an
HTML extension save it
update links no okay now let me explain
how the hide and slide code works here
in relation to the jQuery library that
we just set up so you'll see that you
have your website this is will be your
website on your hard drive inside you
have your index file and maybe you'll
have a style folder or an images folder
for your website that would be sitting
here in this directory so you have your
homepage of your website and any other
subfolders that go in there and all I
have right now is the jas subfolder so
now I'll explain to you the code and
we're done
okay and I just want to reiterate one
more time that this hide and slide code
is going to be under the YouTube video
where you can hit the little hide and
slide toggle button and see the video
description and the tags and all that
that's what you want to see and you'll
see the little link active link sitting
there you can click on and go and get
this code now let me explain the code
here we have a an HTML document that's
just like many any other it could be the
about Us page in your site contact page
the home page
whatever so here you see you have the
HTML opening tag and then the head tag
of the document within the head tag of
the document we have the script source
bringing in the library that is the
1.4.2 the jQuery library so you just run
this line here to make sure that you're
importing or bringing in the jQuery
library for use and then this next line
sets up a JavaScript block here and we
can put some JavaScript code inside of
that block so the first thing we do
inside of that block is we run the
function below once the Dom which is the
document object model is ready and what
the document object model is is the way
XHTML is
laid out on the page okay so when the
document is ready and it's all read by
the browser what we'll do inside of that
function is we trigger the function when
clicking on an assigned element anything
with the toggle clasp so you'll see here
have a span here called toggle and here
let me go ahead and output this again
let's go to file preview in browser
Chrome or Internet Explorer or whatever
you want to use and you can see that
here is content section one show hidden
container link there is the code within
this first span here is content one well
the link is within that span because
that's going to be the element that I
want people to click on to expand the
content down so whatever element you
want people to click on to expand the
content down you can put a span class
toggle wrapped around it and you'll
notice that there's a div tag underneath
it and what this div tag has in it is
any custom content I want as much as I
want in any web page elements that I
want to put in that div that's going to
be hidden that's the stuff that's going
to slide down and show to the user when
they click whatever is in your span
class toggle element here so that's what
this means
so we trigger the function when clicking
on an assigned element which is the
toggle span element and you can have as
many of those toggle spans on the pages
you want you see I have span class
toggle right there span class toggle
right there if I wanted 100 of those on
the page it's no problem
when that when that is clicked we run
and if an else statement to evaluate
whether it's already hidden and we need
to slide it down to show it or whether
it's showing and we need to slide it up
to hide it so we say if this next
element is hidden
what that means is the next element
after the target span so if it's this
span that I've clicked on then that
means the next element would naturally
be this div in the in the document
object model so the next element after
the target span is basically with this
line saying if this next element is
hidden then we slide it down using this
line of code which means this next
element slide down now here we're
telling the jQuery library to run the
slide down function with the value of
fast as the variable being sent through
that slide down function now if it
happens to be down already they've
already clicked it and it's showing
already they slid it down that means
what we want this function to do is
toggle it to slide back up or hide the
content now what you can do is say this
that next element on the page hide and
that tells the jQuery library file to
hide that content now the way the
content is hidden by default is this
style tag here you see the style block
right there and inside we have hidden
div class so we have a class CSS class
set up for hidden div and it has
display:none that's how we look at the
page and we see nothing showing by
default but when we click on something
with javis what the JavaScript library
is going to help us do is then show and
animate that content okay
that's exactly how it works and you can
see down in the div it says div class
hidden div and you can have a hundred of
those on the page to see both of my divs
have a class of hidden div so nothing
has a unique ID or anything they just
have class definitions
so basically that's the whole document
this is really nothing more you need to
know you you bring in your jQuery script
make sure that's being brought into the
page and then you run this this
javascript block right here this set of
functions inside and your experiment
whether you change whatever kind of
content you want to have in these hidden
areas whatever is in the span maybe you
want a button and not a link to make the
things go down or an image whatever you
want okay so I'm going to put this code
on develop PHP and then I'm going to
upload this video to YouTube and in the
description area of the video yeah you
can toggle the hide function on YouTube
to show you the link you go click on it
grab the script up just make sure you
have you go to the jQuery site and grab
the jQuery library like I said if you
have JavaScript library or the jQuery
library one point three point two it's
still going to work for you just the
same but I would recommend getting the
latest release of the jQuery library so
with that you have everything you need
to start making applications kind of
like the Big Boy sites do ok so we hope
you find this useful and maybe you can
get your hands dirty with jQuery it's a
nice substitute for flash for a whole
lot of things you'll have better search
engine indexing on the content within it
as opposed to flash and it'll be cross
browser compliant all the way across the
board as long as javascript is running
in the browser it'll work everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
