a short informative newsreel adobe is a
brand new web motion and design
development tool for us to preview and
evaluate it's called Adobe Edge this is
preview one that was just released
yesterday so it's currently free to
download an experiment with it allows
you to create an animate web-based
content using a web standards approach
as opposed to using something like flash
that is non-standard here's the link for
you to go and download the preview
another resources or Adobe Edge and I'll
also put this link in the video's
description area and it'll be a
clickable blue active link that you guys
can just tap on and let me know what you
guys think about it after you play with
it a little bit video comment area
because I'm interested in what you guys
think and whether or not you think this
will replace flash and whether you think
the animations are smooth and good
enough to replace flashes animation and
things like that so in the video comment
area please let me know what you guys
think after you play with this thing now
I haven't even tried it yet i just
downloaded it yesterday but i'll let you
guys know whether or not i will be
cheating on flash by using this tool for
my web based animations after i
experiment and if it's really nice i
might even do some tutorials on it so
what we'll have to do is judge whether
or not it is easy to animate using this
tool as it is with flash and whether or
not HTML and javascript can render exact
flash like animations that industry
professionals are creating today in
flash really smooth really nice
attractive animations really i think
using flash and after effects together
is the ultimate eye candy but we'll see
what adobe edge can do so don't forget
to let me know what you guys think about
this new standards compliant web
animation tool after you experiment with
it and a lot of you guys are flash users
so you can relate using this tool to
using flash and you can tell me whether
you think it's easier or whatever you
know let other people know if it's a
great thing or not if you think it's
really crap then let people know it's
crap we'll be back in tutorial mode real
soon okay by me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
