of PHP maybe in this PHP programming
lesson we will demonstrate how to get
the fav icon image icon from a URL
dynamically we can look at YouTube
itself for a real world example of how
this would be a handy thing to know for
awesome interactive site builders now
YouTube has a real world example that
you can look at really quick and see
what I'm talking about so when somebody
puts in their web links say in their
header graphics up top YouTube
automatically grabs the web links fav
icon image I didn't put this image at
YouTube they're doing that dynamically I
didn't put any of these other images for
these other site links either YouTube's
doing that dynamically so I'm going to
show you something similar to that to
where when your users or anybody that
puts a web link on your website you can
fetch or get the fav icon image for that
web link dynamically as long as your
application has access to that web link
ok create a new test file called test
dot PHP now before we talk about
rendering a favicon I'm just going to
show you a really quick simple script
that you can use that will check to see
if a file exists somewhere on another
server on the web somebody else's
website first you want to create a
variable that represents the external
file that you want to see if it exists
so the one we'll use in this example is
develop PHP coms fav icon ICO file then
we're going to get the headers for that
URL into an array that array is going to
be stored into a variable called headers
and this is what the PHP manual says
about get headers returns an array with
the headers sent by the server in
response to an HTTP request so now with
the headers array we can run preg match
over the first index the first item in
the headers array and we're going to
check to see if we get a match of 200
then we will know the file exists if
there's no match for the 200 then we can
say the file does not exist so let's
just save that file control s and run it
on our PHP enabled server now it's
important for you guys to keep in
find that you can run this sort of
script to see if any kind of file exists
on some other server on some other
website maybe you're looking for an
index.php file or maybe you're looking
for an index.html file to see if that
exists on their website or maybe you
want to see if I contact HTML exists or
whatever you're looking for on an
external website any image file or any
text files documents whatever okay so
when I run this on my server I get the
file exists because that fav icon dot
ICO file was seen but let's say I name
my fav icon file something like logo dot
ICO and if i refresh it says the file
does not exist so what that means is
you're successfully looking on an
external server to see if the file
exists so let's change that back to
favicon dot ICO so let's just change
this up a little bit to be more like the
scenario where you're letting users type
in web links and you want to get the fav
icon to display on your website so we
can just create a new variable called
web link and make that equal to the web
link that you want to access the fav
icon of now we can just remove that and
then change this to fave icon URL and
then this part of the string will remove
the site the web link part of that
string and we'll add it to the front
dynamically like this with a dot we are
appending to that string the web link
now you want to feed the get headers
function the fav icon URL instead so
this is going to be the web link that
your user puts up or an example of the
web link that one of your users would
put up and you're going to check to see
if the fave icons at ICO file is in fact
in place now later on in the same video
tutorial I'm going to show you a whole
different other approach that lets you
get the exact name of the fav icon file
so if somebody names their fav icon logo
dot ICO you can still access it in the
script I'm going to show you in the
latter part of this video so you're
going to get two scripts for doing this
this first one is a very basic way that
you can just see if the fav icon exists
and if it does you can render it alright
so basically if
the file exists I'm going to echo out an
image tag so I can just change all of
this I'll put this in between single
quotes open myself an image tag for the
source of the image I'm going to make
that equal to babe icon URL because it
was found so since my string here is
encapsulated in single quotes single
quote dot and then my variable then dot
single quote so I'm just putting my
dynamic variable in the image source
attribute and then you can say else the
fav icon does not exist or just do
nothing you can just remove this else
condition altogether and that way an
image just won't show up or you can put
an image source to a default save icon
that you have in your images folder on
your server you can just show a default
image if it's not found now let's run
this will refresh our test page you see
I get develop PHP coms fav icon now that
just happens to be because develop PHP
does in fact have fav icon named Save
icon ICO which most websites I would say
95% of websites are going to have a fav
icon with the name of favicon dot ICO
but you'll have some that don't have
that exact string as their icon file
name so let's change this to Adam Cory
let's run the same file refresh it you
see you can get any fav icon from any
website now what you can do is package
this up into a little function that will
let you call on it dynamically every
time you need to render the little icon
for dynamic web links now I'm going to
show you a totally different approach
altogether that does the same thing
pretty much but it's a little more
targeted and advanced and it lets you
get the exact name of the favicon dot
ICO file or whatever it might be a dot
PNG so whatever the name is you're going
to be able to access it regardless of
what the name is so this one is a little
more refined and better than the first
approach that we just looked at all
right so what you have here is a
function that I wrote called get Fae by
time now this function can be loaded in
externally you can include it into any
scripts that needed and it can be a PHP
module of sorts that you can run every
time that you want to get the fav icon
for any dynamic URL you see these lines
are the usage of it so here is where
we're actually using the get fav icon
function we have a website which is the
dynamic URL the person is putting into
our website you're going to want to make
sure that you strip any HTTP colon
forward slash forward slash WWF might be
on the front of any strings where your
people are putting in dynamic web links
so that's what I'd done I just made an
example for you where all of the things
in front of the URL that are commonplace
on the web usually you can just strip
that out and get it down to where it's
just the dot-com or the dotnet and the
root name of the domain and you pass
that through the get fav icon function
here and that's in a variable called fav
icon okay so now let me run this and
when we see that it's working I'm going
to explain all of these lines of code to
you very quickly okay let me change this
to web intersect that way we see a
change in our script and when we refresh
it refresh and you see so that one also
this script also gets the fav icon but
this one does it in a more targeted way
and it doesn't matter if the fav icon
for a website is named poo poo P&amp;amp;G it
will still grab it you'll be able to
access that image because we're actually
accessing the the mark-up of that file
so when the get fav icon function is
called to run here by your application
and you're feeding at the site the URL
is the only argument that the function
takes in so what you do is you run file
get contents on that URL and you want to
make sure you add the HTTP /ww all that
stuff if it's not already in place in
the URL so file get contents all the
contents of that web link all of the
HTML code inside of it is packed into a
variable called HTML then we create a
new Dom object by specifying new Dom
document and you can check out the PHP
manual for Dom document so on the Dom
object we're going to run its method
load HTML and we're passing it one
parameter
of the HTML that we got from that web
link then we create an array of all of
the links in the page now let me show
you what I'm talking about links and not
talking about a tags like clickable
links I'm talking about the link element
so say for instance I'm at web intersect
I can go and view the page source and
you'll see that in my head element of my
web page I have a link element and that
link element is to my fav icon file I
also have more link elements one here
that's to my stylesheet so you'll have
sites that have more than one link
element depending on what the site is
accessing externally so don't confuse
links in our code here with clickable a
tags these are the actual link elements
so you're creating an array called links
and you get that array by running get
elements by tag name link over the Dom
object so all the link elements on the
page would be in this array then we just
initialize the favicon variable and we
run a for loop over that array the links
array to access all of the items within
it now while this for loop is running
each of those array items are going to
be accessed and we can access them and
put them in a local variable called link
for each one by specifying the links
array and going into it and getting the
items that we want according to how many
times this loop is passed to the first
run of the loop the first item comes out
second run of this for loop the second
item comes out so on and so forth then
you run a condition that says if the
link rel attribute is equal to icon then
you know that you have access to that
fav icon by accessing its H ref
attribute so here let's go back to the
source code of web intersect for example
you can see I have a link it has a rel
attribute it's equal to icon then it has
an href attribute that's equal to
whatever the file name is of my fav icon
and I could name it logo or a favicon
dot PNG or logo dot gif if I wanted to
but that wouldn't be very smart but
people do that sort of thing so this
little script lets you get the actual
value of the href attribute so no matter
what the fav icon file is named if it's
there you can get access to it and then
you just return to the calling portion
of the script that called this function
to run right here you're returning the
favicon so that's why we put it into a
local variable called fav icon and then
you can set up your image tag for the
source of that website and it's fav icon
the name the exact name of its fav icon
file and this script shows you a way
that you can go into the the HTML of any
website basically and access things that
you want to access within the document
object model so these two scripts have
demonstrated two different approaches
for getting the favicon dynamically for
any external web links that might be
placed into your website one is a little
bit more effective and targets the name
of the file a little bit better which is
this second approach ok so that shows
you how to create your own functions
called get fav icon or you can run it in
line like we did with the first script
we just ran an inline script we didn't
make a function out of it but you can
easily wrap that into a function called
get fav icon so remember the first
example is very quick basic just takes a
couple of lines but it's not as
accurately going to get the name of the
fav icon your script pretty much relies
on the fav icon being named favicon dot
ICO but if you want a more targeted
script you can use the second one okay I
hope you have enjoyed this PHP
programming tutorial I'll see you in the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
