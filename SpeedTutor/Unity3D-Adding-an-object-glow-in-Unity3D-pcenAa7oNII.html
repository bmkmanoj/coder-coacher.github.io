a quick tutorial in unity about adding
laws around objects because often in
games you get glossed on round objects
which can be picked up and things like
that and it can be used in your game
this is something very very simple by
other assets on the asset store which do
a better job but for now what we're
going to do is we've got three objects
and we're going to put different gloves
around each one so you need to do is you
click on an object that you've got and
you seen you want to click component and
then if you go to effects and you press
healer and what you can do here is it
adds almost a halo glow as you can see
when I'm moving the actual virtual size
down and what we can do is change the
color to red and we get a really small
red halo round object you can make it
big you can make it smaller you can
choose how big you want and you can do
it with as many objects as you want
again with this with this other sphere
make this one a little bit bigger will
make it yellow then we'll do something
different with a box or leave we'll
leave that one gray so in the end you
can mere make depending on your object
glow in objects within unity as a basis
to Y times that you could possibly pick
up in again so thanks and don't forget
if you like the tutorial rate comment
and subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
