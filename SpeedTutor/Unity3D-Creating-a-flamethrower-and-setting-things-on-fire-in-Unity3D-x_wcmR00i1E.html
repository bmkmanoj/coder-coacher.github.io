you how to make flamethrower in unit 3d
and this can be done in any version of
unity then it's pretty simple to do and
pretty basic because I like using
particle effects and I think that it's a
good way to achieve some things and what
I'm going to show you is creating a
flamethrower with its particle effects
adding the sound and then maybe setting
stuff on fire depending what you want to
do with it if you want to use it at all
so I love getting my scene is the first
person controller my main camera I've
got a flamethrower style sort of weapon
that are modeled in about a minute in
3dsmax implied that in and I have
attached that to a main camera by just
importing it throwing it in the scene
and just added in it on top of the main
camera and on top of that I've got my
normal terrain with everything that you
normally see I've got one special thing
which this time I've got it is called
the flame Collider what it is is just a
box Collider so I oh Justin added a game
object a cube and then took away the
mesh renderer and just added it so it'd
be just doing a front of the actual
flamethrower
and what I've done is added a rigid body
and set is kinematic because it's not
going to move and then I've created a
tag on that called fire so you can
create an add tag if you don't have that
you open you tags and create one called
fire and just scale it down to however
you want because we just want it to
interact with stuff now I've got another
particle I've got a particle now which
is going to be the actual flames the
flamethrower and that's from the simple
particle pack and if you go in the
resource and directional you'll find
torch what you can do if you want to
impart that you can go window assets
don't find a simple particle pack and
you can change that up and I've got both
the flame Collider and the torch
attached to the parented to the M
flamethrower which is then parented to
the main camera
so it's all set up like that I've got
something else in my scene just a box
it's got a box Collider on it and it's
set is trigger and I'll remove that
scripts will create that later
and then what I've got is an actual
particle effect on that which is just
the torch one as well and we're going to
use that a little bit later on so first
of all we want to actually um do
something with the items because when
you play the scene you'll see that
everything will just play as normal but
won't actually do something and can be
able to control it so if we create a new
script call it JavaScript
unruhe Carly this one call it hello my
new because I already have a script
called flamethrower and then if you load
up monodevelop
and when it's open what you want to do
is add a variable called flamethrower
and set up the type particle system with
a semicolon
then write a variable flames and set
that to an audio clip I'd use that a bit
later then you can write function start
in curly brackets and if you write
flamethrower
make sure you name it with the uppercase
and lowercase from your variable dot
emission rate equals naught point naught
F with a semicolon and then what we want
to do is say game object dot find open
brackets flame colliders this is what we
named our flame Collider so the box
Collider that we added and then we say
get component Collider so the collider
actually on that dot enabled equals
false so all we're doing at the minute
is when we start we don't want the flame
to appear on the gun we don't want the
collider to be enabled on the
actual flame itself because we're
starting out will not press anything and
overwrite function up there in the two
curly brackets and infrared MF input dot
get mouse button open brackets zero
close you've to bracket all this means
is when we left click we're going to do
something so we can say audio dot play
one shot and then we can say flames then
we can copy this same line up here that
flame for it emission type our mission
rate is equal to a hundred and fifty
I'll set it to whatever you want and
then we can say the same as here it's
that we had the collider and we find the
collider and we set that to true and
then what want to say is else and then
open up the curly brackets or do that
stop and then will copy these two lines
again Pierce them in because all we're
saying is if we're pressing the button
play the our deal have the actual
practical effects start again finally
Collider set to true and then if not we
stop the sound we stop that and we turn
the Clyde off what we could do is we
save that out and what we can do is we
can add this to any sort of component to
our em objects so I'll just add this
script to my main camera what you can
see I've got the particle effect here so
what I can do
set this to the torch particle and then
I can add one of my sounds which is the
fire and then when I play the game
because I forgot so I always again is we
need to actually add an audio source or
component audio audio source if you
don't do that it won't play what we can
do is you'll see that box already set
sets on fire and what we do nothing
happens unless we click when we click
you're here you hear the sound effects
and you see the particle effect now
that's all nice and basic but say you
want to set something on fire so you
want to actually make something do
something so all i've got is on my box
and i've got the actual particle effect
parented to the box I've done is if you
remember the box is the box Collider is
is set to its trigger and then what we
want to do is when I just create a new
script so create a new JavaScript and
call it something like flame box
whatever you want then we can open this
up and then we can say variable set set
on fire as a particle system and then
also function start start with the
capital put the curly brackets in and
then set on fire dot stop so one when we
start the scene the fire doesn't play
and then function on trigger enter open
brackets or pop call as Collider and
then open up our brackets and if call
dot tag is equal to fire then set on
fire dot player
so all that means is when the collider
that enters the trigger that we're going
to set to the box and it's tagged fire
it will actually set that off so what
we'll do is we'll click on the box that
we've got with the collider or say add
the flame box material I mean the script
then add the particle system in there
and what you've got to remember is the
flame collide up here it's got to be
tagged as fire so now we'll start the
scene and we'll walk over you can do
some fire and nothing happens but when
we actually use that and click it you'll
notice that that sets on fire so that's
pretty much it in creating a just a
simple sort of flame for a splinter
effect and actually adding some scripts
to make things give the illusion that
you're actually setting it on fire
so thanks very much and if you like the
