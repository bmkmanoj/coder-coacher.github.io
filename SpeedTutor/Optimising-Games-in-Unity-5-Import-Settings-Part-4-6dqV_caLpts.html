zation series for unity 5 and today
we're gonna be looking at import
settings are importing models from your
native 3d program into unity looking at
custom collisions and looking all the
settings that we'll need to do inside of
unity when we're gonna bring in a new
model and it's just some key areas to
focus on so this is gonna be my example
today so here's a sort of simple
basketball and I will show you what the
things that I normally do and it's not
really dependent for 3ds max o which I'm
using here you can use any 3d program
and it all basically is sort of equal to
the same thing so what I usually do is
if say I've got my object I would select
it I would file X bar and I would X bar
the model
I'll choose where to export model so I'm
going to export it to this folder and I
will export as a dot FBX and you could
export any other native 3d program you
could even expose a 3ds max file but
it's best if you use it FBX or even
object I'll say that was basketball and
press save and it'll will bring up some
options and we don't really need to
focus on these options I don't really
embed media because I'll bring my
texture in separately because we'll
create the material separately so one
we've done this while B was press ok and
we'll go inside of unity and what want
to do when I want to go inside a unity
I'll usually create a new folder I'll
create the folder called basketball I
will import a new asset by
right-clicking on the folder and saying
import new asset I'll go to whether or
wherever I exported my object I will
choose the basketball you can see in my
folder I will have a materials folder
created and the actual object itself so
you can see you can't really see
anything going on and the material is
the basketball UV diffuse
so what I want to do from there is for
the material or the texture that I have
got for this this is a PSD for now what
like to do is save it out I'll choose to
save this amount as my session folder on
what I'll do is I'll save this out as a
tag and I'll save it out as basketball
UV defuse whatever it was matched in the
PSD doesn't really matter we can save it
as a 24-bit image I'll go back into
unity again and then in the basketball
what I'll do is I'll import a new asset
and I'll choose the basketball UV defuse
and you can still see on the basketball
it has no material on my material I can
now drag my UV diffuse to the albedo
diffuse on the color map slot and when I
add it in you will see that it will be
applied to my object and then when you
click on your actual basketball object
you will see that it's applied with
however it is and we'll go into sort of
tweaking the shed and another part of
the series now from here you will get
import settings which you will have the
scale factor so you can scale it up or
down if it's too small too large what we
can do is we can bring it in for now and
I'll just drop it there
and you'll be able to see it in the
scene and if we click back on the
basketball you can click that you don't
really want to do mesh compression these
things will be ticked by default and it
will do a lot of things for you to sort
of optimize for the game engine generate
colliders is not really that beneficial
because if I did that it would make a
mesh Collider for this entire object so
if I look at this you can see that the
polygons it's made out of it's fairly
high poly so it would make a collision
for every single one of those polygons
and that wouldn't be very optimized at
all so we don't want to actually do that
we'll make our own custom collision and
I'll show you a couple of ways of doing
that if you're going to be doing light
Maps or you want to be this to never
move and set to static if you want to do
with the baking you're going to have to
say
you want to generate light mapping
movies you can go into the advanced
settings if you feel confident with
doing that why to do is hit apply once
you do that you can leave the normals
and the tangents the same you can choose
to import materials or not so if I
choose to own tick that it wouldn't have
created this I won't have this material
anymore and what I'll do is on the rig
what we do before we can switch we'll
just press apply because we've generated
those light maps we've got an animation
type and we've got non emission
animations it would import animations if
that was already in there for us now if
i zoom in all the way to my basketball
here and I click on my texture you can
see this 1024 by 1024 map now the max
size currently it's 2048 we want to
optimize that texture when we import
every single asset so if I take it down
to a thousand 24 you won't really have
seen a resolution drop we could to even
take that down to 512 and maybe you
didn't even see a drop again but again
it's like I mentioned in my previous
video
it'll be minimizing the size it will be
compressing the size you can choose a
different compression if you don't like
the way it's compressing your actual
texture if it's losing too much quality
you can if you brought in a normal map
you will need to set the different type
but for this the texture type is the
what it is normally and one thing that
you can do to optimize something
particular is if you've gone the mesh
renderer you can say whether or not you
want it to cast or receive shadows so if
you think this is an object that will
not be really important or it will not
be near a light take off that it casts
shadows because the more shadows that we
cast them or shadows that we receive the
more draw calls that we're gonna seep
within the game so it's really dependent
on what type of asset you're making and
whether on whether or not you want
shadows on I did say that we might want
to actually
eight a custom Collider for this now
there is a couple of ways we could do
this we could as I said when we went on
the import settings for the basketball
we could say generate colliders but we
don't really want to do that we could
click on the basketball now go component
physics and we could use ferric or
Collider and you'll see that it will put
a spherical Collider all around our
object but you see that you can see
that's how it's made up with those green
bounding lines and you can see that
that's quite an optimized collision
because there's not many things taking
it up if we remove that we could even
add something which is even more
optimized in the sphere Collider we can
have a lock box Collider on there if
it's just gonna sit there and you're
just gonna run into it but it's really
dependent on the type of object and the
type of thing you're doing so say we
wanted this ball to actually roll around
we'd need the spherical collider physics
and sphere Collider so it would roll
because this is contoured to the actual
object itself and we can edit that
however you need it to be and remember
if your object needs to be static you
can take that a static at the top one
thing that I normally like to do is you
can create a prefab out of this or say
I've already put a sphere Collider on
I've checked whether I need to do the
receive or cast shadows I can create a
new prefab and prefab that up so I could
use it as many times as I need rather
than having to bring out this every time
and the actual imported model won't have
the collider so it won't be the finished
article that we're after so what you can
do easily that's right click create
prefab rename your prefab to basketball
underscore prefab something like that
what you could do is you can drag you
game object of prefer your game object
into the prefab slot there and you will
see that it has been now made up of that
and any time we actually edit said
this original object you can see there's
a prefab up there so say we for instance
remove the sphere Collider press apply
it will now update our prefab according
to however we created it originally so
for instance if we now put physics and
box Collider on it hits apply our actual
prefab will be changed so we can pull
that out as many times as we need it to
with custom settings now one last thing
I was going to go into mentioning is if
you you're back into your 3d program and
you wanted to make yourself a custom
collision say your objects quite
complicated and it's made up of a lot of
different items and you can't exactly
put one particular collision on it you
could make yourself an a custom
collision so say I've got the sphere
object in 3ds Max here and I just pull
it over my sphere this is an example and
I will just show you the wireframe
because we don't want this many polygons
in a collider so I could take this down
take this down set this down to a point
where I feel that that's acceptable
so that could be acceptable therefore
our collision we could rename this to
basketball collision in the same way we
did before export this out bring it into
unity within the same way pop import
into this folder you could delete the
materials from the object you could
remove the mesh renderer from that and
just use it as a custom collision and
what you would need to do then is pop
physics component physics and you would
need to put a mesh Collider onto this
onto this object so I'll show you
quickly I'll run through export and all
spot this as basketball Collider I don't
want it to bring anything with me I'll
just press ok I'll go back into unity
while do is on the basketball I will
import a new asset I will choose the
basketball Collider
what I'll do is I will untick import
materials because I don't want that and
you can see that when I pull this out
into my scene you'll see it there and so
on my object here if I go component
physics and mesh Collider and we make it
convex so we can see that it's going
around the mesh accordingly to how we
want it then what I can do from there is
remove the mesh renderer component and
you will have yourself your own custom
collision is an example for a custom
collision mesh that you might want to
use for a more complicated object now
like I said it doesn't really matter for
this basketball specifically because
it's already if you use in the sphere
Collider pretty well optimized as it is
so they were just some quick tips that
when you import objects you want to
check the import settings make sure it's
scaled correctly you can generate UV
only generate colliders if it's very
very simple geometry you can look at the
material and we'll go into this a
further in the future look at your
texture and compress it compress the mac
size down we can choose the object make
sure that it's got a collision mesh on
it if you think it needs it because not
all objects - you can choose to receive
our cast shadows you can set it to
static if you need to create a prefab
for the object if you want to be able to
use it multiple times and then you can
create a custom collision if you need to
be done so hopefully this I end a lot of
things out and help you impart a lot of
things into unity 5 so thanks very much
