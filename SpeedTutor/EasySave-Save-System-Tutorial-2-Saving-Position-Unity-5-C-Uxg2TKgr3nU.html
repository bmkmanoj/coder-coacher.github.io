tutorial today and this is going to be
the part 2 of the save system using the
easy save system that we started in the
first part now in the first part we just
went along and looked at simple loading
and simple saving of basic variables and
billions now I'm going to go into
something more if it's not necessarily
any less important but we're going to be
able to serve the players position and
also save what scene you might be in if
you need to load a scene if you need to
load the position that you play hours
previously at then we'll be able to do
it so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
open up the easy or the simple save
script whatever you might have it called
ok so what we did before is we were
looking for the manager script that
we're looking at and we using the easy
save command to save something from the
file that we're looking at I'm putting
it into an actual file that we wanted to
be able to then pull the information
from so doing an actual saving a
position is very simple and it's very
similar to the thing that we did in the
previous video if not even a simple
we'll start off by adding our public
variable to reference the player that
we're going to be keeping information on
so right public and game object with two
capsules and then we'll have this as
play with a semicolon then in here we'll
say inside our save function will set ES
2.0 similarly to how we did it before
then we'll open up our brackets and save
player dot transform don't position and
then we'll add a comma and in course we
can write whatever we want so you can
write player position just like that and
have a semicolon on the end and that
will just create a player position file
and it will save the transform position
of the player to the x and y and z
position of the player itself
and so I will show you in this as an
example if we right-click in the same we
go to easy save to Settings tools and we
go to the open up that default save you
can see there's nothing there currently
we've got the elmo broken our magazines
now if we press play and we drop down
into the scene you can see that we've
got everything we can press save and
we'll have an error so we'll say that
it's not found The Associated player
that we're looking for
so on our Save button on our set button
here we'll need to add our player so
we'll just drag in our FPS controller
and we'll drag that in and everything
should be fine there and once that's
done is when we press play again we can
go up to save this shouldn't be an error
we can check that and go to easy save to
settings tools open up the default
folder and you'll see player position
now you think well how do I go about
loading this so it's very similar to how
we did it before with the loading so the
saving is just using the easy save to
save that we're saving the player
transformed opposition and then put it
into a file and loading it's extremely
similar what we'll do again is will
create another public game object and
have this is type player and then inside
the public void for the load will save
player dot transform dot position equals
ps2 dot and then in angled brackets we
can write vector three and in brackets
then in quotes we can call or name the
file that we just created so we'll call
this player position with a semicolon
so like we did before is that we're
saying we're gonna be giving so whatever
the player dot transform positions to
the X Y Zed values are going to be equal
to whatever vector three we're going to
find from the player position and the
vector three is just the 3d vector that
we can find or the position in unity
that we can find to put straight back
into the transform position and that's
what you use a vector three to do
transforms and things like that in 3d
space so this should realistically work
for us so what we need to do is we'll
minimize that go to our load button your
wait a second for it to appear then what
I'm going to do it's going to add our
first person controller
what we do is the whole point of me
doing these multicolored squares is
though so that we can see where we've
actually moved to so we've status on the
black square I'll run over to the yellow
school over here and we can say it will
press save and no no errors appeared we
can um play it again we could press play
again and we'll drop in for no one can
do is ruin crash load and you'll notice
that we appeared over on the yellow
square other yellow plane whatever you
want to look at it with whatever
variables we might have already needed
to load from the previous script but
seen as though we ended up having
nothing in the manager when we run the
game again and we just saved out as a
row
it's puts us in the position that we
wanted so I'll do another example so you
should know that I am NOT making this up
on the red one I save and I can run over
if the game is running and we choose to
be able to load on the fly we can press
the load and you can see that we moved
all the way over to the red point so
that's all well and good that's nice
isn't it so that works perfectly so say
we want to do it as soon as the game
loads for instance so as soon as the
game starts we can just write void start
and then two brackets two curly brackets
below and then we can just
really call the load void function and
it will load that seriously so what we
do we expect we'll start on this black
square like we always do but we actually
want because as soon as the game starts
it will spawn us at the Red Square while
we just previously served it so we can
spawn it and you'll notice that I'm now
at the Red Square so if I show this I'll
now save the game at the yellow now it's
saved close that off play again now I'm
at the yellow and if you say you were
saving a lot of different variables
outcomes whatever you could do a fade in
to the scene so you make sure that the
player doesn't realize that we just
moved you off to another part of where
of you started from so that's just an
extremely simple way of loading the
player's position and then loading it
back in and that's just using the
player's position player to transform
position learning it unserved it
accordingly to how we need it and then
we can save it and load it directly when
we start the scene or whenever we choose
to load so this is it for just saving
the position so thanks very much for
