and this is because somebody suggested
something that they wanted and I'm not
sure it will be for everybody but I
suppose we can make it work in different
ways and it's going to be a bow and
being able to go through an actual wall
if you're tagged as player so say you're
not tagged display say if you're in a
multiplayer game or something like that
and you weren't tagged player oh you had
multiple characters in a game and are in
fact if there was AI characters that
would not tagged as player then they
wouldn't be able to go through the wall
it could be in a mechanic in a game like
a ghost or something like that but
really what we've got is I've got a wall
you know just which is a box with a box
Collider in it and then I've got a
trigger which is actually a box but I
remove the mesh renderer and I made sure
it is set to is trigger and I put the
Box all the way around the wall that
I've got so and it goes all the way
through so that when you can enter the
collider you'll be able to go through
the wall as long as you are actually
tagged player so my first person
controller you know obviously has a tag
of player and now what we need to do we
to create two actual scripts to make
this work so I've one JavaScript cold
walk through and then i'll have another
which will be called wall trigger so
we'll open up both in monodevelop and
then what I'll actually do is in the
walkthrough script i'll delete those two
lines and we'll just create a variable
called ghost mud set that as type
boolean and set it equal to false and
then leave that for now so that's okay
now if we go into the wall trigger
script what want to do is we want to
start so we can reference the other
script to change that value so we can
actually walk through the wall
so we'll start by creating a private
variable called walk script and set as
type walk through so we're calling it
that the script that we've just named
and then we'll save function start open
you two brackets add two curly brackets
and we'll say walk script is equal to
game object dot find and then my wall
was actually named wall get component in
brackets walk through close the brackets
add the semicolon then what I'll do is
save function on trigger enter open
brackets call column Collider cause that
bracket open up the two Kelly back and
set if call dot tag is equal to player
which we close that off properly add two
curly brackets there then we'll say walk
script.google.com oh I actually said
that goes mud equals false so that's
fine for that unball trigger script so
that's what's going to happen we walk
into the actual trigger now we actually
need to change something on the wall so
we'll right go back into the walkthrough
script and safe write function up there
two brackets in two curly brackets then
we'll set if ghost mod is equal to true
then we will actually say game object
dot find open brackets and we'll find
wall again but one will do get component
once more but this time we'll save box
Collider so actually find in the box
Collider which is on that wall and also
dot enabled equals false and then what I
like to do under here is leave a couple
of bricks and put else and two curly
brackets under there i will copy exact
but exactly the same line from there
pest in here but instead of false will
say true i'll save that go back into
unity and what we'll do is on the
trigger will add the wall trigger script
and then on the wall will add the
walkthrough script and now what you'll
notice is if i leave in the the with the
inspector at this side if i press player
you'll notice that the box collider is
on the wall and what be able to walk
through it but if I then walk into that
Collider it will go off which let us run
through it as long as with tag display
and you'll see that it goes on and off
here when I'm inside and not so if I
untok that and go to my first person
controller and set play a result not
flammable from what my other tag is and
I walk into this wall it won't let me
through anymore so you're gonna make
sure that you know you tagged whatever
you want the tag to be so that's pretty
much it that was a simple to tell what
somebody asked for hopefully it can help
other people make some you know
interesting things to be able to walk
through walls maybe add some mechanics
two games but that's all thanks very
much for watching and if you liked the
