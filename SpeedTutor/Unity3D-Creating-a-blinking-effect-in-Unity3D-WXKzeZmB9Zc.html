that somebody asked me quite while ago
and it was about almost making a
blinking effect and um it was in another
game which the person suggested to me
and it was about you know when you
blinked it got rid of sort of an enemy
or something like that now you know it
could be used in a horror game now I'm
just going to show you simply this might
not be the best way to do it but this is
just the way that I found it and so all
I've really got in my scene my first
person controller and with main camera
and just my normal just anybody's normal
assets that you'd find now what I've
actually done is added two cubes to the
scene
so obviously game object career of them
then go to cube create two cube one cube
and then put it you know slightly above
your character controller and then just
slightly below duplicate and make
another what I've done here is I have
actually made just it just named middle
marker so I can actually tell what's
going on and where I need to actually
change the animations so you know I've
placed these as if they're going to be
eyelids so the top one obviously it's
going to be the eyelid top and then the
eyelid bottom now what you can do when
you have the main camera you can adjust
it so that if you click on this and you
know you pull it too far up you'll see
the main camera you'll see it in the
main camera so if I bring it back down
and go back to the main come you'll see
nothing's obscuring it at the moment and
you can see by this little bounding box
that you can see just where the focal
point comes out from the camera and what
I've done I've added my middle mark just
so I see how you know roughly how far to
pull it down when we're gonna blink for
the game so that's pretty much it you
just need to position the two boxes you
know in front of the main camera
slightly above so you can't see it and
then you can have this you don't have to
now what I've done I've actually deleted
the box colliders off them because when
you run around in your scene it can
sometimes collide with a floor and make
it difficult to walk so just delete any
colliders on it and leave the mesh
render
what I've done is created a new material
by going career material and just making
like an eyelid material which is just a
solid black so you know it's all on any
color also you might want to take off
anything if the mesh receives our cast
shadows because you don't want to do
that you just you know want it to be a
sort of visual effect now we're going to
go ahead and make the animations now so
if you click on the whichever lid the
top lid at the moment go to animation
will create a new animation and we'll
call this blink top for ease of sake
click on transform select them all
create a new keyframe at one girl um
possibly ten to the second along pull it
down sort where the middle of your
marker is maybe a little bit further
then go back to go to a twentieth of a
second and pull it off roughly where you
know you think it needs to go
you can put another marker to see where
your first bit ended so you know you'll
play it and you'll see it'll do just
that sort of effect now that's all well
and good make sure that play
automatically is on ticked because you
don't want it to play automatically
we'll do exactly the same thing for the
bottom so we'll go window will go on
ammunition will create a new action
animation called blink bottom save that
click on transform add a new keyframe
the beginning slide across 2/10 of a
second pull it up you know to about
roughly in between move the scrubber
cross to 20th and then go back down you
know roughly as we had it before and you
know you get a similar effect now what
I'll do is add these two animation
system a blink folder and then we
actually need to create a simple script
which is going to hold letters you know
click and blink almost so make a script
and call it blink and then what we'll do
is open up in model develop
once that's open we'll delete the two
functions or what's a variable top top
lid as type game object and variable
bottom lid as tap game object and then
we'll say function star add the two
brackets add two curly brackets inset
and top lid equals game object dot find
and then whatever your game object that
holds the animation is called sir eyelid
underscore top close up then we'll say
bottom lid equals game object dot find
up in brackets quartz eyelid on the
skull bottom this is just for me you can
never be one and then under there we'll
save function update at the two brackets
add two curly brackets and say if input
dot get mouse button down up and bracket
zero close the two brackets add two
curly brackets underneath and set top
lid dot animation dot player open
brackets in quotes top sup blink top for
our animation and bottom lid dot
animation dot player open brackets blink
bottom close that up put a semicolon
save that out if we go back into unity
on the main camera add the blink script
we're going to need to add our two game
objects so top top lid and bottom lid
and then it would press play you'll
notice there's nothing that appears in
front of the screen until we left click
and you'll notice that you know there
was a blink that we had it in front of
the screen and it just plays the
animation of the two boxes essentially
now you might know it's a little bit of
edging from
either of the two so that's obviously
where the animation has ended so what we
can do is if you need to change it
select the object to go back to
animation then you can go to the end of
your animation set and just pull it up a
little bit more go to the bottom one
click animation scrub back just scrub
across to the end where your last
keyframe is and just pull it slightly
further down close it off play again and
you'll notice you know the bath golf the
end of the screen nicely so that's
pretty much just the basis of creating a
very simple blink script and all it all
the script does it finds the two objects
that we want to find and it just plays
the animations on those objects when we
left click so that's pretty much it
