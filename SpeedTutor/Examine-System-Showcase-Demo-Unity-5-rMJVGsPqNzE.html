video and this is going to be a showcase
of one of the assets that I have made
quite recently and it's called the
examine system now all it is is like
you'll see in many games whether it be a
horror adventure game where you'll be
able to click on an object and you will
be able to sort of interact with it and
spin it around it will be able to give
you an indication of what the items name
is let you rotate around and you know
drop it and you've got some highlighting
and effects to go with it so I'll give
you an example of this working so you'll
see it here in the scene you can see it
down the bottom we've got item name
about you you don't need you can hide
that if you just delete the text out of
the UI element you can see that when I
highlight over different objects it will
be crosshair will turn to red and we
will get a highlight on the objects
because it's just using the emissive
value in the standard shader and you can
see it on more on more gamey assets over
here so if I choose to hover over this
cube that I've got I'll click it will
it'll be called a red cube you can
choose to change that as you wish
there's a blur in the background you can
left-click to rotate around this object
however you see fit
you'll right-click to let go and you can
again choose blue one spin around it the
yellow one spin around and you can
change the name however you like again
with this one on this side it'll be
exactly the same we can set the position
we can spin around it and so on you can
see that it's a medical box there's a
tin of fish and we can spin around that
and drop it and you can see that the
textures go wage time and we lock the
character every time we try and interact
with something so you can accidentally
go in and out and it will switch the
object back to its original position
once we click back on it because there's
no point in doing so there's no point
letting go of it and it'll being on
might be in a weird position so all it
is from the sort of original base is
that the package comes with all the
materials prefabs a few scripts basic
sounds just for setting it up and just
some additional content just
that you started it comes with full
documentation so you can check that out
showing you how to set it up how to and
how to sort of go about extending this
one thing I'll care to mention is that
when you're importing this asset you
will need the standard assets characters
unless you choose to use your own
character system and you will need one
of the legacy the legacy image effects
which you can find on the asset store
and it's just the blur you will just
need to import the blood and import the
information from the editor folder fall
and legacy image effects and once you've
done so it will all work with the blur
in the background because if not you
won't get a blur and you can use your
own actual blur shared if you have one
of those but this is just a way to do it
all for free but it comes with a range
of objects which these are the objects
that you want interact with from your
scene you put one script on these and
you'll give them a name and you will
just link it up to the same object which
is parented to a camera on your main
camera so you've got your main camera
here you've got an examined camera which
is only filtered by depth which means
that it will only Brenda this object
that we're going to specify on a layer
and it won't render anything else so
what give any overhead on your game and
you'll have all your objects parented to
that camera and then you just choose
what rotation speed that you want for
each of your objects and link it back to
the original object which is the one
that's going to be solved the one that
you can interact with it will help you
make a basic interaction system with
just a few scripts and a few sort of
clicks here and there once you've set it
up all you need to do is literally drag
my items in here just link two of the
scripts up and then I'll where you go
and you can add as many items as you
need to within your scenes so thanks
very much for watching don't fit
