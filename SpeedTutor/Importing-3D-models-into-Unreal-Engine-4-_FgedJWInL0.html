Unreal Engine 4 tutorial and this is
like I mentioned last time we're going
to look into importing new assets within
the engine now if you've seen the other
video that you'll notice that I talked a
lot about unity and if you followed me
along in the post I usually do unity
tutorials so I'll always sort of relay
it to how it's similar or it differs
from unity now for this particular video
it's quite actually quite similar and
the sort of the way that Unreal changed
since I use the Unreal development kit
it's actually got a lot simpler to do a
lot of things that you would do on a
regular basis like in part in assets so
I'm going to do first of all is show you
my cardboard box I've got in 3ds max now
you this doesn't have to be done in 3ds
max it can be done in any sort of 3d
software put it in blender whatever it
may be if I go to my material editor all
my box has is a UV map of my texture
that I've got and I've just applied it
to my object which is just literally a
square now once we've got that and we've
applied as many textures as you want you
can bring any normal Maps as I said this
is going to be one example this way is
going to be showing you how to sort of
import your asset and then it's going to
automatically bring your materials with
you and create one in Unreal Engine and
then I'll have another tutorial which is
about creating your own materials which
is a better way because then you have
more control over what it does but this
is just the simple concept
so you've selected your box or whatever
object you might have in 3ds max we want
to export selected if you've got it
selected and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to find the folder that I want to
save this in and just save this as
cardboard on the score box and it's
going to be as type FBX it needs to be
FBX so we can bring the materials with
it and then what we can do is if you're
familiar with exporting as FBX don't
know how it differs in other programs we
can just take embed media on what we
need to include we don't have to include
anything
else really that important we just need
to make sure embed media is ticked we
could press our care and then we
shouldn't get any problems and that was
created our FBX for us now when we want
to go back into Unreal Engine we on our
left hand side of the bottom corner
we've got content and we've got the
static content if you brought it in and
whatever scene you've started out on I'm
going to right click on the content
folder and create a new folder and call
it models and then in there for now what
we'll do is right-click models and I'm
going to create a folder inside there
and call it cardboard box but unreal
brings you up some nice warnings to just
mention that them you can't leave spaces
and certain characters in now when I've
got that cardboard box folder selected
what we do is click import and then what
we want to do is find where we've got
our model saved so it's there cardboard
box one FBX if we double click that it
will bring in the FBX import options we
can also generate collision which means
if we've say we have an object which
isn't many polygons and we would just
put some sort of box collision over it
we can say it will create a collision
based on the mesh files and then you can
set the transform if you need to you
might want to bring the collision
already created for your object in the
future you can click this little drop
down and you can look at some advanced
settings and you can combine meshes if
you've got multiple meshes in one your
one those combined into one particular
object on ticket if you don't generate
like mapping movies which is similar to
unity because that's what Unreal Engine
does it bakes it's lighting out into a
texture unless it's a true real time
light we can set how we want it to be
transformed and we can import materials
and import textures now this is like I
was mentioning before you can leave
these two ticked if you want to create
your material and texture manually but
soon as though we clicked embed media we
want it to bring the material in the
textures from 3ds max of which I've
already created just to make things a
little bit simpler so what I'll do is
I'll click import and one thing to
mention for the
is if whether you bring in this film
3dsmax or something else you want to
make sure that you enable export
smoothing groups when you're about to do
the FBX exporter so for now that is a
really matter for this model in
particular but for the sake of this just
for the future make sure that you have
smoothing groups enabled when you go to
export so anyway now we've brought that
you can see the little preview of my
cardboard box if I open it up and you
can see it when I double-click it in the
little viewer or editor that we've got
in the Unreal Engine and it's got the
material my UV map and it's created as a
material already now this is what I'll
go into further and down the line in the
future because what you do in this
rather than immunity it was all in the
inspector on the right hand side you
have nodes like the visual scripting
where this is similar if you're using
the editor in 3ds max is that you attach
the UV or the sample texture or the
texture we've got here to the actual
slot that we need for the particular
material because unity really does this
behind the scenes so you don't see this
so if you had a normal map or something
like that and you had it here you could
click on that normal map add the texture
sample here and link that to the normal
map slot and we can change the settings
down this side but for the sake of this
it's already created our material you
want to make sure that if you do do any
edits that you click apply and save to
the actual material itself and it'll
save out for you
then we can close that down and for the
sake of this we can bring in our box if
you will press F you were going to zoom
in on your object and we can obviously
grab the scale tool and maybe scale this
up a little bit so we can see it there
and then if we press play you'll notice
that you can see it in my scene so
really all it was was a simple thing of
exporting your 3d model as FBX and use
embed media if you've got the option
make sure that you export with smoothing
groups possibly have a collision already
done for your model I'll go through that
in the future but all we need to do is
click import import your FBX you can
tell it what settings you want you can
tell it to bring in the materials and
the texture if that's how you want to do
it now other people work differently and
you might have a folder called models
which will just have your base model
which is just a box here then you might
have one called materials and called
textures so you all love that in nicely
arrangement but this was just a way to
show you how to pull it all together
into one nice scene so hopefully that
helped people just get to grips with
just stunning part in your own models
into here and getting them into the
scene so thanks again for watching don't
