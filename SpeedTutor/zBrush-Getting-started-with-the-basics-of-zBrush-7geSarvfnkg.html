how to use zbrush my Zed brushes for our
five you also might be quite similar but
in fair it should all be the same so
what you can do is either up and
something from a project panel like
you're like a cube something like this
anything but what we'll do is we can
hide that option and we can actually and
get a shape that we're after so if we
select a cube and then we draw this in
our scene you'll notice that I'll be
able to draw another if I click again
but if i press t you will go into actual
object editing mode and then we'll be
able to write it if you hold your click
you can rotate around if you go over to
the left side and left click on that
panel you can move your object scale it
up and down and rotate around that's
very much like the basics of just moving
about what you want to be able to do is
actual sculpt on the object now when
you've imported something like this
you'll need to make it a polymesh 3d
I'll tell you to do that and when I
sculpt on it you'll notice that it's
rather rather block you can see all the
polygons now what we can do is press
control D and you'll notice that the
active point so then what the mesh is
made up of so if we subdivide it a few
times you'll notice it's made of two
million active points so now if we
sculpt on it it's much much smoother you
can also change your brushes over here
if you left click you'll have a lot of
different options for bushes so you can
choose anything like Claire tubes and
you can start drawing on there just like
them what you can do is you can click C
sub and it'll take it from you mesh ziad
obviously adds it if we turn the
intensity up it will be a more intense
if we increase the draw size you'll
notice that we can draw all the way over
the object
with a really big brush size it looks
really weird you can also inject a
change if you go to the standard brush
you can change the way that you actually
draw on the object so you can draw with
a sort of rectangle you can change
alphas which actual change the effect of
what you drawing them you can one of the
ways that you control control all your
different tools often as the object
might be made up of is the sub tools on
the left hand side you can duplicate the
tool like that so you've got two of the
same one we can do is hide it I'll move
it and we can delete specific tools and
if you go on geometry you can control
how much its sub / so that's real low so
you can see the polygons if you pull it
all the way up you can see that the
points move back you can also go to the
defamation tab and you can change the
size of the overall object and lots of
different parameters really they're the
key things about just important and
different things in just doing some
basic sculpting now beware that I
usually like to save my objects if you
go to file and save as you can just save
it as a dot zpr and you can open it the
same way if you go file open because if
you save as a document or you export as
a tool gets a little bit complicated and
important it back in but say you've got
a new scene and you want to import
something you can import model from an
external application like 3ds max
awesome I've got that I've got a model
that I just imported in and you can see
that and then we can you know sculpt on
this is we need to remember you need to
subdivide it because it's it was only
really low and then we can add whatever
we want to it
but the way you can actually hold the
geometry shape is if you go to geometry
and you go to take off smart subdivision
and we'll just subdivide it without it
actually smoothing the object down
something now will notice we can still
do everything to it but it doesn't
affect the actual shape of the overall
object if you double-click move you can
actually bring it into frame again one
of the key things is when you rotate
around if you hold shift it will snap to
a particular face that using which makes
it easier to work around with and I
think I've really covered most of the
basics that you want to create I'll show
you if we open previous ZBrush file
I want to impart one of my previous
models you can see you know that we've
got a solve one away concrete barrier
that i created a while ago in ZBrush in
our to give it the illusion like that so
you can create a lot of different varied
assets in ZBrush and it just takes a lot
of experimenting and playing about but
that's pretty much it thanks for
watching and if you liked this uttar
