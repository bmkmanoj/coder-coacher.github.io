video today and this is just update
everybody on you know what's going to be
going on with the channel in the next
sort of a few weeks I'm going for some
eye surgery tomorrow as of today's the
13th of November 2017 and tomorrow bring
the forties I'm going in for my surgery
cuz I suffer from an eye condition
called glaucoma and it's sort of an eye
condition everybody has a particular eye
pressure in their eye and only when you
have this condition there's some of the
pathways to lowering pressure and for
drainage reasons does it sort of stop it
and the pressure can increase and with
pressure increasing it can cause damage
to your eyes over time and this is just
a really important soft piece of surgery
for me I've had various other ones in
the past to try and keep it under
control so this is one where it might
well be a longer operation than I'd
normally have but hopefully fingers
crossed that it will you know try and
sort stuff out for the meantime and you
know hopefully I won't need anything in
the future so I'm just wanting everybody
that you know will tell me a little bit
of time for the actual recovery and I
will have some stuffs off scheduled for
videos scheduled so there will be stuff
that you'll still see every week but
until I'm back you know I'll let
everybody know when and I'm back into
you know doing things as our what
normally so it could be anywhere between
one two three four weeks depending on
what happens so thanks again for
everybody for spoiling the channel and
coming back to watch all the tutorials I
hope you continue to come back and watch
everything that I put up so thanks again
for watching don't forget son like come
in and subscribe
Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
