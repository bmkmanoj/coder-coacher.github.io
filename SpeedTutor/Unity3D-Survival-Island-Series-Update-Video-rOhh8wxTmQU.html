update video for the survival island
other survival tutorial series I know
everyone's really excited to watching it
and I'm I'm excited to start doing it
but I've just been I haven't had a great
deal of time in the past week or so I've
spent the odd hour or so on different
parts and trying to get things working
so this is quick video to show you what
I've been doing to make sure that you
can all realize that I have been doing
something and hopefully I should have
the video next video out or the first
video should I say and this weekend
hopefully now this is just going to be a
run-through of the things that we're
going to be learning and obviously
people can give me some ideas I'll tell
me things that the dot like so first of
all I'll show you Ram I'll run through
the things really quickly so obviously
this is just basic placeholder create
some hands rigged it really fast and put
some animations on it now they only
change it and they all need updating but
obviously I haven't had an awful lot of
time now the box in front of me is going
to be sort of like four maybe crafting
something like in the forest when you
can put a fire down then you've got to
build it no obviously it's green now in
front of me obviously these are just
placeholders and it all needs updating
but if we go near the terrain you'll
obviously see that we can actually when
it goes red we won't be able to build it
so if I click we can't build anything
now how it goes green you'll notice that
it places an object obviously as i said
just placeholders now obviously i'll
show you how to make a sort of basic
terrain show you our import hands
animations show you how to incorporate a
simple style infantry system and as i
said this wasn't going to be that
complicated it was going to be fairly
straightforward so as i said it's going
to be wood stone Claire and we might
have other things to collect or whatever
and that's how you're going to be able
to build you'll be able to collect fish
or food depends what it is obviously I'm
just really delegating on what needs to
be done and then you'll be able to eat
and drink water or use a bandage if
you've managed to create
it obviously I've done it so that you
can look around i'll do anything move
infantry and also we're going to have a
crafting so obviously it's going to take
whatever you've got in your infantry and
allow you to craft some basic items and
the other thing that I've got to show is
the player min GUI so the purple bar for
now is stamina so if I sprint it takes
it down it goes back up if a jump
stamina goes down obviously this one
would be the thirst hunger and then your
health obviously I might change the
colors but show you how to make stuff
like that these animations look a bit
dodgy but obviously like I say I've got
a chit I've got to change it one thing
I've been working on the tree chopping
so we can actually use some terrain
objects and then cut down as many as we
want because the raycast sometimes we
have a problem with actually cutting
down as many as we actually want so I've
chopped that down the tree falls and
then obviously we might get some water
logs out of that obviously that just
instantiate the objects above it so
that's not really what we wanted but as
I said now we can cut another tree down
obviously had some sound effects when we
need to and obviously do that and then
obviously with it I'm going to go
through obviously picking up items doing
other things but as I say just this
video giving an update on everything
that I've been doing give me some ideas
give me stuff that you don't like or
maybe stuff that I could improve upon
but as I said I'm not going to go crazy
on the infantry or crafting because I
really don't have the time to put hours
and hours and hours and hours and I was
into it so hopefully everybody likes the
video and hopefully I love something up
this weekend so thanks very much for
watching and as ever don't forget to
like and subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
