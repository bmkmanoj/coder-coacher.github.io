this is going to be one about
post-processing effects or things that
you'd see in your game usually when you
finish creating your game you might add
these effects to add a little bit of
realism so I wouldn't normally do this
because it doesn't really follow on with
the tutorial series but seen as all
loads of people have been asking me this
can just be a shot ish video showing you
how to add a little bit of extra you
know effects and realism because loads
of people keep wanting to know what I
use and how to do it
now this is just going to be a tips and
tricks video so hopefully will be shown
so I'll get right into it right one of
the things in my scene is I've taken
everything away so it looks really dark
and rubbish all I've got first of all is
obviously a directional light and on the
directional light I've just made sure
that it has soft shadows I'm not sure if
you can use those in unity 3 but I think
you can use one light with shadows and
I've just made sure that the color is a
nice warm soft color so you can see it
so it sort of reflects the color of the
sand and things like that one of the big
things that I like to add which is good
say with matter rain that I don't want
to because if I start playing this I've
set my camera culling so we don't render
the whole to rain all at once because it
gets quite taxing so you can see it
popping in in the background so one
thing you do is add fog and it stops as
effects so if we got edit render
settings and then we can enable fog now
obviously it adds a sort of I've added a
bluish fog which matches in with the
sort of color of the water and the color
of the salt of the sky so you know as
tropical look I've set the fog mode to
linear the density to not point not one
and you want to adjust the fog start and
end values so that you can you know
adjust way you want you fall off for
your fog to be so you know when you get
an T scene you can notice that the song
the will be fog
here and the bee fog you know behind the
trees at the back and behind where
they're going to start popping in one of
the things obviously very obvious is if
I enable all my effects again in the
scene is that I have got a skybox all
you do is add your skybox material there
so I'm using Sony skybox 3 and obviously
I've added in my water you can use
whichever water that comes with it but
I'm using the water for example that
comes with the unity assets when you
import the water packaging and somebody
did say that you can use it in unity 3
somehow maybe you want to experiment
I'll look into that but that's it for
those basic things and a lot of things
that people ask is you know what effects
that I use on my man come now if you can
see in my scene you know I'm not doing
anything crazy except the normal things
that you do with the fog with the skybox
now one thing that I do like to add is
something called fast bloom sometimes
when you add these image effects it
flicks it upside down until I add a
different one so I'll add Sun shafts as
well so you'll see with the fast bloom
in the game it sort of adds a bright
intensity to all the different sort of
colors and things that you'd see and you
can you know increase and decrease the
threshold the thing is I like to mask
this a little bit by using dignity and
obviously get a darken around the
corners of your screen so if I on tick
this on and off a few times you'll
notice that it solve soothes or softens
the areas where it's really intense
obvious you can change that up either
after I like to add Sun shafts as well
and you get a little bit of you can get
some shafts and things coming through
the trees depending on where your
directional light is sat and you can use
Sun shafts by you make that them the
actual light that it's looking for your
directional light and then you might see
some sort of light rays coming through
the trees using that you can use color
correction but avoid that this time
because I don't really like it so all
you ll have really done is obviously I'd
really
- mainimage effects which is a fast
bloom and the vignette in because it
just balances it all out and makes it
look you know more tropical and more
sort of exotic the setting is very
really because you can see there the
intensities you can have s2 and the blur
no problem but these are really things
that you'd have to test for yourself and
if you can't use the unity Pro image
effects obvious if you don't have unity
Pro you can try getting in diversion of
image effects and I might make a video
on showing people how to get those and
get those working within unity but
hopefully this sort of clears up some
things that you can do so obviously you
want to add your skybox
add some fog make sure your directional
lights got shadows if you can enable it
add some reflective water if you can
then if you've got hold of image effects
as I say use the fast bloom piglet in
what you can do is if you click on your
main camera then you go to component
image effects you've got a whole host of
image effects that you can try and make
things look more special so as ever
