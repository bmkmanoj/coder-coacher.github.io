tutorial today is gonna be look at 3d
nice sounds and how these actually work
so a lot of people - to take advantage
of 3d sounds and when you bring in a
sound you can either choose to make it
2d or 3d and 2d being no matter where
you have it in you scene it'll always be
the same volume whereas 3d is sort of an
example of spatial sound and usually the
further away you get from a 3d or
spatial sound the less you are likely
hearing now there's a few different
examples of the type of ones that you
can use so all i've got here in my scene
is I've got some barrels which are from
the PBR a free PBR barrel pack which you
can find on the asset store and I just
got a gas burner sort of stereo for sort
of audio effect so you could hear that I
will show this again on my fire complex
particle effect you only need to do is
you can add an important add a new
component add audio source if this is
each way you choose to add your audio
which is probably a good place to sort
of keep it unless you have themselves
offering of something else you'll get
the default settings as they are now so
what you can do is you can drag your
audio or any of the audio that you've
got there which you might have cut down
and clipped out and you can put it in
the audio source the audio clip slot you
can choose whether to mute it bypass any
of the effects usually you'll want
something like a particle effect like
this if it's the fire burns all the time
is to play on awake and then you want it
to loop so it's always making a loop as
long as you've looped the audio yourself
you can leave the priority as it is you
can leave the volume as one because you
can adjust that if you really need it to
you can leave the pitch and the stereo
panned the same because they're only if
you want to make tweaks so some of you
know like the pitch to make it higher or
lower if you really need to do that but
the big thing that you want to look at
is the special blend and that's where
you can choose to strip set whether it's
2d or 3d
now it's normally by default set to 2d
so we'll slide that all the way across
so we make it 3d sound so what we expect
is to have some fall-off over time you
can
Reverb zone if you choose to do that but
now I'm more interested in the actual 3d
settings and we have a graph down here
and the graph indicates the fall-off
that we'll have over time and you can
leave the effects in the spread as they
are by default but you can choose to
adjust the roll-off the min and the max
distances with depending on how far and
how far away that you'll be able to hear
the sound and it's based on this graph
and it will show you a few things I will
link the unity documentation all about
the audio sources and the effects which
you can have a look at all the time
but we've got a three different sort of
volume of Roelofs that which is just
sort of pre-made ones by default which
are most commonly used we've got the
logarithmic or a LOF and what that means
is it's a sound which is loud when
you're up really close but the further
away you get from it it decreases in
sound a lot faster than the other
roll-off so we'll leave it on this for
now and you can see that this little
indication here you can just about see
the box that we've got this little
circle and that's the actual minimum
distance of the audio that we've got
which is normally set to what and it's
just based on within the minimum
distance that sound should actually stay
rather loud and then as you sort of move
away from the minimum distance it will a
sort of attenuate and this sound will
decrease so you can essentially make
this minimum distance larger if you want
to make that sound louder because you'll
be able to hear it so it's most loud
furthest away so we'll leave out one for
now and then you've got something called
the max distance and then the max
distance works by the it's the distance
where the sound actually stops attenuate
and gonna beyond that point it will stay
at the volume of which you set sort of
the max distance units so if we choose
to do if we so if we choose to do the
fall-off all the way to zero at the end
it will cut off but after we get outside
of that max distance so we can use that
as a way to decide that if we're a say
these are the barrels over here then we
want the sort of the sound to attenuate
away all altogether so you can see the
max distance is currently 500 and that's
too big so what you can do is you when
you pull it all the way back
you might have to pull it back quite a
far way and you can actually then see me
making this abounding bigger or we can
set it to sort of maybe just behind
those bot barrels and that's just around
safe 14 and a half and you can see the
curve here that it starts off high and
attenuates quite fast down to a sort of
low level and it doesn't ever you know
disappear so what I'll do is I'll play
this and then you can listen out for
what happens and so what we do when we
play is that you'll be able to hear the
sound and we're sort of in the middle
now if we get closer
you can hear that actually got louder
and as we get further away it will get
quieter as it attenuates away and when
we get soft past the barrels it doesn't
ever get any quieter than you know we
actually specified until we get really
close again but what we can do on the
actual audio effect is on this graph
we can just set that attenuation curve
all the way to the very bottom so when
we get outside it will just cut out so
you can hear it hear a noise and move
away past these barrels you can't hear
the sound on only when I move back in
and get really close can you hear of it
if I'm out of that zone I can't hear it
anymore so similar with that is that
we've got another thing that's quite a
nice one if you want to do the
attenuation under a curve and you can
adjust the curve as you want to because
I'll move to a custom roll-off at that
point and you can you know adjust it
here yourself for some reason if you
wanted it to get really loud sort of at
the midpoint you could do that but we've
got another example is we've got linear
roll-off and linear roll-off is just as
I've soft specified with the previous
one a type of roll-off which is just the
further away you are from the actual
audio source and the less you will hear
it discuss it just attenuates from being
fully loud gradually gradually over time
until you get to nothing it won't
so it gradually does it often time
rather than being a big attenuation you
get say halfway and then you get all the
way to the end so you know whatever you
decide to do and then you have your
custom roll-off like like I said if you
overdid the curve then you can create
your own roll-off and on your curve you
can add new keys and you can adjust as
you need to however you need the actual
curve to go so you can have spikes in it
lower place then it depends what you
need to do so really are all 3d sounds
making sure that you've got the special
up to 3d you choose the specific
logarithmic or linear rail off and you
can adjust that roll-off according to
however you want it to be you can use
the minimax distance to decide and what
minimum distance you want to hear the
sound and the sort of maximum distance
you want to hear the sound and you can
choose the different the soft two men
were all offs to decide if you want it
to attenuate with the linear one just
gradually over time all the way to zero
so when you get outside of the max
distance you won't be able to hear
anymore which might be good for savoring
in water or things that you hear all the
time oh the logarithmic one when it'll
be really loud when you're close and as
you get further as you get just a little
bit away it will attenuate quite fast
and become quite quiet so that maybe
that can be another one it just depends
on the situation because if it's a very
subtle sound very small sound the
logarithmic one might be very good let's
save some sparks or something that you
might only hear in one room and it
doesn't really so that's pretty much
just the basis to the soft 3d sounds and
the effects that you can do
so hopefully this helped you out thanks
very much for watching don't forget to
