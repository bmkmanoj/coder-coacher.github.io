tips video on this is gonna be about
common issues that you've people have
been commenting about on my videos and
so this is to iron out any issues that
people have had so I've got three common
issues that people or maybe four common
issues that people have when they import
my asset
now I'm gonna import the assets like you
could from the website so I'll literally
go through what you might see as a
problem and then hopefully that will
sort it out and sorry about again sorry
about the delay but the survival next
part the service areas will be coming up
soon so keep an eye out for that but
this is just for everybody who's been
having problems so this is a different
unity scene completely different to my
survival series one it's the one that
you might see if you've just seen the
general tutorials from me and what we
can do is I'm gonna just import all the
assets that I've got that you can
download from the website so what I
usually do is just right click here and
then I'll click show in Explorer and
then it'll show all your files that are
in your project because all it is is
made up of folders in a way so you can
see that it's in my assets and you can
see that they match up with all my files
down here and I'm just gonna paste in
the actual all the assets that we need
for this episode so it's just going to
be the survival on the scar Island and
the scar assets that you can extract to
wherever you want and you can just drag
that straight into unity and then you
want unity to finish off impart in it I
would say that this is probably not the
best way of adding everything in because
there's gonna be duplicate script and
the ones later down the line so if part
5 has the same script as part 6 you'll
probably want to use part 6 script
because it'll be more up to date but I
just left all the scripts together so
you don't understand them so first of
all when you import everything you'll
notice that it will now moan about as I
said there's multiple things with the
same name so depending on which one you
want to use you make the decision so I'm
going to get rid of the part 5 1 and I'm
gonna get rid of the crafting power in
part 1 so
have the part 2 version so now all those
issues are gone and now it's gonna
complain as that the player GUI does not
denote the type valid and also with
things like that and I've had people you
know complain about this issue before
now if we click on it in the console to
bring up where the error is looking at
player GUI doesn't deny anything it's
because that player GUI what we're
looking for is this one here which is in
part two it's because it's named updated
16th of January lie so you guys knew
when I was updating if you just delete
that and name it play GUI it will
absolutely be absolutely fine and then
it'll say that sometimes that in the
tree chopping there's a line where which
wanting to find can swing in the player
control script now it's showing it's
from this script because that's where
the line of code has the problem but
what once do in power 3 with the
animations we have player control
because that's what it's referencing so
player control can swing so what we need
to do is we double click on player
control open that up in my develop and
once it's open if you haven't already
done you need to make sure that can
swing is public so you can delete that
private and that public and then what
can do is we can save that out and go
back into unity again and then the error
should have gone now that'll sort out
all the errors that we've got so far now
a lot of people have been asking that
the objected to rain script doesn't
necessarily work for them now as I've
said before that that isn't actually my
script I got that from browse and on
Google I've just got it and all you have
to do is put it in you ready to folder
so I've got nothing up here which says
terrain now if we go to the part one and
we see object to terrain script all I'm
going to do is I'm going to drag it into
my editor folder if you haven't already
gotten when you've imported assets it'll
be there and you'll notice that it
hasn't added anything now if I click up
here it'll avoid it for me it's now
added the object to terrain script icon
for the top usage bar the navigation bar
for this so now as long as you've
clicked up there it should add it up
there and then you can use it however
you want so really they're just the sort
of far far things that I've noticed that
throughout the comments people have been
having issues with and if you do all
those things that I said literally just
renamed in the script so it doesn't have
a date on it having cans when making it
a public variable and then object a
terrain you need to make in put it in
Ed's folder and make sure that it
appears at the top by clicking at the
top here so again thanks very much for
watching and look out for the next
survival series tutorial coming up very
soon thanks again
