miscellaneous assets and this will
include materials sounds and textures
and other things which might in be
materials and shaders so you can check
out all the assets that we feature along
with the ones in this video I will leave
a link in the description and it will
take you to my lists for this month so
number one is the free music bundle by
New York ray and this comes with 18
tracks with various you know types of
music whether that's from chill-out to
techno and it's got a whole host of
sound effects which might be suitable
for any number of games whether that be
space
disco things in a particular environment
so you can see and have a look at that
number two it looks like a pretty cool
and it's called the bar shared as simple
and this will allow you to use this
shader to animate bars or filling up and
going down whether you want to use this
to you know indicate somebody's stats in
the game or a health bar something like
that and you can animate the Phil used
and there's a demo and interaction for
you to test this and pick a lot and
number three is the dissolve shed or the
dissolved edge and you can see it in the
video playing here and it will be a
transparent shader which will dissolve
the edges of a particular texture or
material that you're currently using and
is also available on a practical system
so say you wanted some burning paper
over time that's quite a cool asset to
have a look at number four is the black
and white achievements packet and it
comes to the range of 2d icons which are
40 around and 40 square with various
ships and stamps for something if you
want to add some quick achievements or
maybe even some placeholders for your
game until you might want to make your
own and number five is the ice shared -
tutorial and this is probably one of the
coolest ones that thing I've seen is
pretty much an ice shader which you can
see from the various screenshots you can
simulate a lock of ice on various
objects which pretty much acts like a
glass shared with refraction and
transparency and you know with the solve
of edging of the lock of ice number six
is the six a free textures pack and this
comes with six textures for concrete the
gravel grass and the regular things you
might expect and it comes with you know
tile ability and you know to variably
seams and number seven is the pseudo sss
which stands for around base subsurface
scattering and you can see by playing
the little video here it's a shader
which allows you to create the sort of
illusion of the subsurface scattering
especially on the skin when you have a
light behind directly behind your skin
you will see it sort of light up in
areas and it helps you simulate that in
a way this is only it supposedly limited
for free for a limited time but i think
it's a really cool asset if you're
looking to create maybe skin or maybe
something on a lampshade which would
lock in that kind of way number eight is
a variation of game icons and it's
twenty-seven resource icons which
suitable for pretty much any number of
game it could be a strategy it could be
an RPG and it comes with various 256 by
256 PNG images you know that you can see
here that you can just add in and they
look quite nice number nine is the
footsteps for snow and grass and it
contains a thirty seamless loop steps
through snow and grass and six the
single ones and these are quite nice if
you've seen my other tutorials and you
want to vary up you footsteps across
various terrain whether it be running
sprinting walking very slowly but it
helps you add a lot of diversity scene
so you can take a look at this and it
looks pretty cool and number ten is the
dark monsters and mega pack now there's
no images to sort of give you a direct
example of this but it's a pretty much a
pack which lets you customize the images
of little monsters whether that be the
colors and the variation
of how they look and you can export
those out as PNG and things like that as
many resolutions you require for
different programs unless you sort of
create a variety of little maybe in-game
monsters thanks very much for watching
and if you want to check out any of
assets that I've featured for June 2017
