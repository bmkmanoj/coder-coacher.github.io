the new UI features for substance 2000
18.1 now i've recording this video is
fairly new and algorithmic have done a
rework of the entire sort of substance
pen to whole UI sort of ethos um work
flop everything in its entirety works
the same as it previously did but now
it's just streamlined in a way that you
can modify all the little doc panels and
things like that and just really made
life a lot easier with being able to
customize and use the way and use
substance the way you exactly want to be
able to use it so I'll just go through
the key features really that when you
first open it you will see it like this
and it might look different to those who
have either used it before or new users
but like I say it's pretty much the same
across the board now most of the items
here you can move around and you can
dock them in different places like you
can grab the texture set you can grab
the layers and you can put them
elsewhere and you can dock them in other
places now sometimes you might have
moved these and they might go to places
that you did want them to go up can
essentially close all of these items up
but just by pressing the little X and
they'll be docked to this right-hand
side so you never have to see them if
you don't want to so you want to work in
a massive workspace just like this and
see your entire model you can do or you
can choose to undock them as you see fit
so say you want to look at your text you
set settings you can click and I'll
bring up a little roll out blog pop out
you can do the same with the layers and
you can choose to rescale and resize and
with the thing with the actual item
being docked at this side so therefore
you never have to see it if you don't
want to on the left hand side you will
get most of the tools which were
previously along the top left and you'll
have all your pen settings so let's say
we want to bring out our layers and I
usually like to have layers in an item
all by itself just for the fact that
that's it's easy to see like that and I
will select something on my folder and
you can see that I can still get access
to my paintbrush eraser projection
polygon fill all the things that we'd
commonly be able to use previously
there's a new sort of context or menu at
the top for you would have to bring our
something like your pen settings to
adjust the size the flow and
what-have-you of D different brushes
that you would want to paint with but
instead now we have access to size flow
stroke opacity right at the top here so
we never have to move away from I'll
find another menu I can say if you like
me and you want to bring the Shelf out I
usually like to have the Shelf docked at
the bottom so I can see all my materials
and items at glance and I like to bring
it out my just my pin properties and I
will usually dock that to the right hand
side here and then you'll have a full
list of everything that you would
commonly need to access because just
quickly to adjust your pen settings if
you use that a lot and layers cursor the
layer stack can also get quite long but
again it's up to you and you can choose
to close these as you see fit now
another great thing that they've added
with this release of substance painter
is that you can right click on anywhere
in your sort of viewport you've got and
it will bring up a pop-out easy makan
texture menu where you can get a quick
access so you can adjust everything that
you would commonly find in the paint
settings so you can adjust the brush you
can adjust the Alpha and the materials
that you've got available so you can
adjust the brush settings the alphas the
stencil and the material they're all
almost a one big long menu but these are
just shot cuts as you see when you but
go up and down it will just quickly snap
to these areas that are the most
commonly used things you can't actually
adjust the size of this contextual
pop-out but it's really great because
you can just choose something paint we
can go to the material section change
the color and do so with ease and then
stamp painting on your object again when
you bring out your menu you can
left-click once off the actual menu
itself and it won't actually paint
directly onto your model because
sometimes in other programs you might
have accidentally painted on something
that you didn't mean to but you can
actually do that in this version because
it will actually give you one sort of
area of click error so you don't
accidentally just stamp painting on
things that you don't want to is
just little things that make life easier
with you can Justin dock things as
required you can bring up the easy menu
by pressing on the right they have done
a couple of other things which include
in the display settings which would be
control your environment and things like
that they've condensed the camera
settings and the viewport settings into
just one sort of display setting so it's
just condensed everything so there isn't
as many menus and things for you to have
to move around in so again it just makes
a little by little everything really
nice and easy just how you like to use
it they've added a little little a few
icons in the top right-hand corner here
which allow you to change your if you
are looking at single channels for your
materials if you're looking at mesh maps
or if you're just looking at the sort of
model as a whole as a material you can
still cycle through with all your should
keep on shortcuts with C to cycle
through your channels or m to bring it
back up you've got the same
functionality as you would when you use
f1 to bring up your UV map next to it
and you've got these at the top where
you can look at 2d 3d mode 3 D mode only
and you've got the perspective views and
some camera settings and you've got a
little button at this side if you want
to actually go into the eye ray renderer
to do a or say a render of your model
when you choose to do it so these were
just some quick pointers how they've
just streamlined the whole interface and
allow you to customize it as you see fit
so you remember that they've changed
they just moved most of the common
functionality on this side and you will
see that when I change between the
different mods the menu at the top is
contextual so it will change dependent
on the thing that you've chosen and say
over on me polygons the fill we can
shoot we can change and back to the
brush it will bring up the items that
are specific to that tool that we're
using at any one time so be sure to
check out this version of substance
painter because it goes a long way to
make already one of the best programs
that you can find for texturing assets
in a PPI workflow and it's just made it
better and better so thanks again for
watching and don't forget to Like
