awaiting the start of this tutorial
series so please bear with me when it
comes to all the videos that are going
to come up in the future because I'm
trying my best to get everything
underway and doing a whilst managing to
juggle all the things so as I said this
is gonna be the very start of the
survival island or the survival series
of tutorials and first of all we're
going to start off by looking at
creating an island or an island design
so I don't know if anybody had actually
seen or anybody from the UK who'd seen
bear grylls a camera was called survival
island and what they did was they set a
group of 11 people on a desert island
they said literally you've got to
survive it was quite a cool series and I
thought I dunno vaguely based a survival
series on that so I was going to do is
set on an island and you've got to
survive anywhere you can with different
areas so if you look at this and really
base off the actual island that they
used and we're going to have a sort of
beach stretch along the front and then
the forested area around the back with
this sort of layout so what I've done
originally is I've gone into 3ds Max and
I've just taken the overall picture of
the the island Britain my top view and
actually just made a quick mesh for this
because we're going to make this come
out of our actual terrain so we're going
to make our own look somewhat like this
ship so first of all what you want to do
is you want to get yourself into unity
so I've started a fresh scene for this
this series so what you're going to need
to bring in to your scene to initially
start off with is really going to need
the skybox pack which you can bring in
when you create a new scene or you can
right click import package and import
all the standard assets packages unless
I specify otherwise from here so
skyboxes you can bring in the current
you need the character controller pack
you'll want something with Itchy the
water basic approach depending which
version of unity you have you'll want to
bring in if you want to
using my 3ds max file and obviously I'll
put all the files that you can get
easily to hand on my website and I'll
put it as a pack in each week I'll
update it so sorry about this tutorials
a little bit long just trying to explain
everything that's going to be going on
and what you also might want is I've
downloaded a son textures pack which is
actually from the unity asset store
which is a free asset and all you need
to do that if you just go on the asset
store and search sand you can download
that asset pack and then another thing
that you want is I've got the tropical
nature pack which comes with a lot of
cool trees you can obviously use
whichever trees you want or even if you
make your own and I might do some
tutorials on making your own sort of
trees or whatever in the future but for
the sake of this it doesn't matter what
trees we use as long as you know you can
get an idea about what we're actually
going to be doing so what we're going to
do first of all is we're going to
actually we've got men coming the scene
we don't want it for now what I'll do is
I will go game object career other will
choose a terrain and then we built a
massive terrain within our scene but we
don't want it to be so massive so we'll
go over to the settings on the far side
and I'll actually change this to maybe
800 by 800 so maybe about 100 hi so when
we've got that what we actually want to
then be able to do is we need a light
source you can go game object create
other than directional light and then
we've pulled directional lighting you
know you can obviously just rotate this
but we've got nothing in the scene so we
can actually see anything so what you're
going to want to do is which other
version of unity free up Pro you'd have
to put hard shadows on for free I can
put soft shadows on so I've got unity
Pro now obviously this doesn't matter
differ from unity free to pro for what
we're going to be doing today so then
what we're going to want to do is bring
in the going to the standard assets
bring in your character controller and
just drop in a first-person
character and then I'm going to make
sure that my character is actually above
my terrain and then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to unless you have already
is import the asset that I'll be putting
into the survival pack I'll put the
island design in there and that's just
going to come with a sort of flat object
so what you want to do is actually drop
this just in T seen anywhere and then
what we're going to actually do is maybe
we'll scale this object up maybe to
about scale it to about five we'll hit
apply and then it'll come out in our
scene and what I'll do is rotate it so
we get the way that we had it in the
picture so if I just zoom out a little
bit and you notice that I'll just place
about that and then what I've got is
I'll add this script to the pack but you
need to have an editor folder which has
got a script called when it's actually
called object to terrain but I've spelt
it wrong and what it will do this editor
script a lad and a little lob a little
window to the top a little lamb'
drop-down because in the margin recent
version of unity the change the layout
slightly so a ladder object to terrain
icon so what you can do is actually
click on the obviously this island
design that we've brought in and then
what we can do is go on the object it
terrain and what that's actually going
to do once we get rid of the actual
island design it'll actually place the
island upon the actual terrain that
we've got as you can see for now is that
it looks quite quite high actually so
what we'll do is we'll go back into the
terrain height and then we'll maybe set
that to something like 20 and then what
we're going to do is we're going to want
to add a quick texture to the whole of
our actual island so we'll go on to the
pen textures a lot of texture you can
obviously get these from the terrain
texture pack which is a standard asset
but soon as that I have the
tropical nitch back it came with some
good ground textures so I'll add a
ground texture that I just wanted to add
to everything now and I'll just quickly
shift the tiling a little bit if we put
it about three and three just for now
and now obviously when I run around I
just have to drop my controller in you
can see we actually can see a little bit
more now so once we've got that in we've
got the basic texture we've got the
basic shape of the terrain and then
we've got a basic layout to actually
start working with so what I actually
like to do to begin with is maybe add
something so we can actually start
creating the boundaries of the island so
what I'm going to do is go to the
standard assets and obviously cuz I've
got unity pearl I can add a daylight
water and what I'm going to do with that
daylight water is I'm going to make it
really really big but obviously you can
use your normal unity free water and
what we do is I'm going to pull it up so
it encapsulate it's the entire outside
of the island and then what I'm going to
do is I'm going to select my actual
Island and I'm going to get the raise
and lower height on the normal brush
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make sure that hold shift and we're
going to start sinking in what I might
do actually is take the opacity down
slightly and I'm going to start sinking
in the edges of my Island so this is
going to act as like the beach area
because we wanted it to be underwater
ABB's or skipped on so that everybody
can quickly see that all I'm doing is
holding shift and just literally taking
the terrain down so we get more of a
flat a flat edge all the way across so
then what we're going to do is we're
going to pick choose another text you to
parent with going to add another texture
and with the Sun texture pack we're
going to do is we'll choose Sun five I'm
going to add the diffuse and add the
normal and we'll click Add and then
we'll select that
bit of sand and what we'll do is I'll
take the brush size down slightly I'll
take the target strength make sure it's
full and then what we'll do is we'll
just pin across the edge with the light
sort of scale brush and so we can give
the illusion that we've actually got
maybe like a beach a beached edge so if
I run the game and it takes in a while
to jump jump in you'll notice that we
get sort of a sandy effect leading on
out into the ocean and obviously you can
change this terrain however you like
now maybe up we want to just click on
that texture and make sure that it tails
a little bit more
so we'll maybe make sure it tails a
little bit more and we'll click apply
and we'll get a bit of a bigger amount
of tiling now obviously you can add the
beach to wherever you want feel that it
should go but what I'll do is I'll bring
my character controller so I'll just
position my character controller in a
better place now obviously with the
terrain you can add little any amount of
elements as you'd like possibly like to
add so say I want this texture that
looks like it could be more into the
water what I can do is I'll add another
texture
unlike the diffuse and if it's got a
normal you can add that and we can have
done what we can do is decrease the
brush size again and what we can do is
maybe pin along here maybe it doesn't
work with it coming quite so far out of
the water but I'll just paint along the
edge so you can get an idea of what I'm
getting up and obviously we can pan
across the edge and then we can go
towards the edge of the water and you
can see that you get more of that look
to what and a water effect would be so
obviously you could decrease the sort of
height of this slope we can reduce the
whole entirety of the terrain but for
the sake of this I'll leave it like this
because we're getting the sort of idea
of an island at the moment now what you
might want actually do is go to render
settings
and obviously if you've imported the
skybox you can go over to the sunny sky
box you can add a sunny sky box or juice
maybe Sky box 3 and just to make sure
there we go we've actually added that in
to give us some a bit of sort of realism
to the scene and now what you can also
do to add a nice effect if I make sure
effects are on so we can see it within
the scene obviously now you can see the
reflection of water now if we go to the
render settings and will they enable
some fog what we can do is we can
actually enable fog so we won't be able
to see quite the horizon so if I change
this to linear and then what I want to
do is maybe change the fog color to
maybe what we had in the water so on
quite a tropical may be nice turquoise
you look maybe I'll set the the fog and
to about 300 obviously you might want to
play with this now if you can obviously
see the fog out in the distance in the
ocean however you want and obviously you
can obviously turn if I put effects on
but I turn fog off because we don't want
fog on because it's quite difficult to
see in the scene so we've got the
beginnings to the sort of island and
I'll save this out for now so then what
we're going to do is we might want to
add some different sort of elements to
the overall of the scene so we might
want to add some different parts to the
island where we might have water sources
or we might have and different types of
jungle areas or might have a swamp so if
I add something to my scene so if I
click on the terrain and I choose that
this is going to be our more dense area
of trees and things like that what I'm
going to do is we're going to make sure
that maybe we'll have different areas of
water sources so what I'm going to
actually do in my terrain is just add
little markers to my terrain so I can
quickly zoom in on it without having to
make difficult problems so I'll just
take this
down a little bit obviously this might
be a little bit of a massive hole and
then obviously I'll leave this cube here
and I'll rename it as like maybe water
hole and then what we'll do is we can
obviously add if we go to stand assets
and then we go to maybe they're like
water again what I could do what we
could do is we could add some water to
this and then maybe make it a different
color so maybe we'll make it slightly
more murky then the other one and
obviously you can mess around with
whatever style of water you've got
so we might want to get some water from
there or maybe when we go to this part
of the island I'll grab the water point
again and we'll duplicate it I'm just
really I'm just showing you different
things that you can do to make your
island
the friendship between everybody's
because the end of the day I can't
really show you to make one thing you'll
want to do this try this yourself and
make it look however you want it to be
so obviously what we could do here we
could add a bigger sort of a bigger sort
of depth and what we could start doing
is obviously like I said before we could
add another pool of water but this time
we could maybe make it a lot darker
I sure what we could do is add a bit of
rear which could be like a more of a
swampy area and then what we could do is
we could go to the foliage we could add
some new trees and we could add some for
me
I've got some mangrove trees that I
could have and I could add those what
I'll do is I'll take the brush size down
and maybe I could we could out these
around in this solve area just for the
sake of showing you this in the tutorial
now obviously on your beachfront what
you might want to have is you could add
some trees
obviously as I'm saying I'm just showing
you we could add some saw some trees
that you might have sort of like a
kirkin or something like that which
might work oops I clicked on the wrong
tree you make sure you click the right
tree and you add your palm trees across
the island or however you want those to
be and then obviously we can play the
scene and we'll get the sort of palm
tree defect and obviously the thing is
I'm not going into heavy detail about
trees is because the ones that we want
to cut down we're going to have to place
ourselves because I've not found I'll
really research to where I've been able
to cut down tree which you've placed
with the terrain because they're all
part of the static terrain so it's hard
to be able to do something so you want
to choose what trees you want to be able
to chop down is ones that you're going
to place yourself so you want to be able
to have other trees that maybe you can
add which wouldn't normally be able to
be chopped down and similarly it doesn't
matter with the bushes as such because
we can add the berries and stuff later
on so I've got a whole host of sort of
plants or trees that could be added to
the scene so obviously I can add
different variations of trees into the
scene obviously as I say use whatever
you've got and you can make an
interesting look of a soft and styled or
desert island but you can make sure you
can add some different style plants all
over
obviously you can just add new meshes
all the time you can obviously go back
to whichever things you want we could
add some bamboo or some smaller pieces
and obviously it can just add obviously
this has just been stuff thrown together
really
I haven't taken much time on which star
in rarely putting stuff in the island
that you could see or you could be
believable but you know overall you can
go on and make a solve visual visually
appealing item just using that and
obviously what we could do is if we
wanted a bit more foliage in the
particular areas we can go and paint
details and we can add a new add a new
detail mesh and obviously like some of
these what we'll be able to do is paint
them in so what we can do is we can take
the time get strength down along with
the opacity and we can add solve
different areas where we'd have
particular object or because obviously
we need to edit these details so the
more in keeping with the actual colors
of the forest itself and obviously you
can add grass textures you can add a
sort of I've there's a ground cover
texture here which I might apply
obviously you can see it here we can
apply different elements maybe I'll play
it over at this little water pool zoom
in apply whatever you like to it what I
can obviously do is bring my character
controller over so I really I never said
this would be the definitive way have to
truly make something very desire but
thing is it takes a lot of experimenting
a lot of really working out so maybe for
the next tutorial
I'll redo this island a little bit and
I'll make it more of a structured sort
of layout but really I'm just showing
bits that you can actually produce and
put together with however you want and
however you feel like you
want your island to look so really for
this I don't want any wind
so I'll take on more wind settings down
because it's something I really don't
want and maybe with directional light
you might want to make a sort of more
warmer a warmer color for your entire
scene but really this was just a base a
real base on how you might want to set
yourself up in Ireland obviously if we
go to a top down view you might want to
put more coverage in these parts where
there's the darker on your Beach you
might have rows of coconut trees or any
sort of trees you've got and then maybe
have your swampland more at the back
towards where you might get a more
abundance of the sort of bigger animals
at the back of the island but as I say
when we look from the top-down view or
we go back to a perspective of the
entire island you can get the look of an
island that you might want to be looking
to create for your survival game and so
hopefully this sort of helped people out
and give you an idea of what sort of
creative things you can do and make it
look like realistically a survival
island so thanks very much for watching
