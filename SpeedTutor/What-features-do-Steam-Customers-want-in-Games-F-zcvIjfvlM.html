and this is something that a few people
have asked me for I've tried to cover a
lot of different things in terms of you
know what to expect on what to do when
you come to release again before you're
released again and things like that so
this one today is gonna be discussing
what do actually customers want when you
release a game on the PC especially and
what's the best ways to maybe increase
the popularity and the revenue based on
the things that they want and the things
that you can add in especially when you
release something like Steam so I'm
gonna give you some examples of my game
left alone and the things that you know
I incorporated from the beginning some
things that I didn't know and some
things are added as I went along you can
see the sort of configuration page which
you can either disable when you build
out in unity which a lot of God the
Garen gins don't actually have if you
don't use this you would have to
integrate into you know a system that
you've got within your actual game in
pulse and in your menus to be able to
remap your controls if you choose to do
that and in here there's an input tab
and you can actually choose to change
the actual primary and secondary values
based on it and if you are using the
input manager from the unity itself am
you will have to make sure that you
don't specify a key you specify a value
which can be remapped in this here and
you can get other solutions of different
input managers which might be able to
give you some helping hands with
creating something in the actual game
but the first one that I'd like to
mention just as I said is being able to
remap your keys because not everybody
uses a conventional WASD and things as
some people use the arrow keys and
things like that and that was one that
was suggested to me and people wanted to
be able to do it so I made sure that I
didn't hard code in any buttons say like
you know interact with E or move with
WASD don't hard-code them in because if
people want to change them they'll be
more inclined to purchase and carry on
and be happy about the purchases been
made with your game so I'm just gonna
load up my game and just use to go
through some other instances of things
that people like and want to be able to
do is that if we say we take this
options menu forgive the sort of quality
I mean I wasn't very good at doing you
eyes and things and it was made in unity
4.3 and I still don't really like it but
you know it is what it is people like
the ability to be able to change your
mouse sensitivity on-the-fly have a
volume slider be able to change
brightness have the especially the
ability to invert your mouse controls
because not everybody uses the
conventional you know up his up and down
his download user the opposite way if
you were playing like a flight simulator
or something that's quite popular so you
need something which just inverts the
mouse control and it's fairly simple to
do but it's something widely requested
and I didn't have it in at the start
because I didn't even know it was a big
thing and after releasing yeah people do
want it and especially people who maybe
don't have a mouse which can change the
DPI on the fly they want to be able to
change the mouse sensitivity if you've
adjusted something in the engine and you
thought off your mouse your mouse
sensitivities okay when somebody else
uses it might be really ridiculously
fast so you want a slide to be able to
control the actual sensitivity now
another good one is the brightness
because unity doesn't necessarily have a
brightness feature and it sort of like
maybe corrects in the gamma with an
image effect or I think in my game I
corrected the actual ambient light which
is in the scene which you could do in
the render settings and then you can't
really see it in this scene because it's
mostly baked out but it gets a little
bit brighter as I slide up and the
regular stuff like the quality settings
for people with a lot more different so
you care to for you know as many
different computer hardware as possible
so you care to for the lowest end
machine that you possibly can with the
lowest graphics and I'll give you an
example sighs stick to low you can see
that the gliding is mainly baked out so
you know it's possible even on the
lowest graphics even though pretty much
a lot of the effects are turned off and
if I take it back to old tree you can
see quality improve and there's two
things really with the resolution you
want to be able to cater for you know
the resolutions that they're usually in
a lot of instances when you am
at the resolution features it will
automatically find the different
resolutions that somebody's monitor can
actually reach like mine can go the
highest of 2560 by 1440 and then the
usual the last common one is 1920 by
1080 and you might go all the way up to
4k in some instances now it's not always
it's always good to be able to test your
game on as many different resolutions as
possible so if you've got the the actual
ability to look at a 4k monitor you've
got one and you can test you game on
that that's great because then you can
check all you eyes you can check all the
scaling you can check that your assets
look okay they're different things like
that because the sooner you start moving
resolution especially in this version of
unity when I made this game the
resolution was tricky because you were
at the UI isn't scale as easily in unity
Forester doing five because they just
updated the whole UI system because it
was all really janky and really
old-fashioned back in back in the past
and you had to write some additional
code to make sure it's scaled between
resolutions so sometimes if you weren't
from 1082 and 2k your you eyes would be
here instead of in the corner but you
shouldn't have as many problems but it's
good to check another one is some people
all have ultra white screens and I know
I'm saying that it's trying to cater for
as many people as possible now if you've
got an ultra wide monitor that's great
awesome you know some of you has to test
again to see how it looks but sometimes
you will have the black banding at
either side if you know you've not built
the game out to an ultra wide resolution
you can look into that and try to adjust
it if you if you feel that that's gonna
be the issue but there's not as many
people that are gonna be with the ultra
wide as as the out with just normal set
wide screen resolution so like I said
with the fact of the resolution is just
check all your UIs and make sure it
scales up depending on if the resolution
goes lower than 1080 higher than 1080
but you know try your best to have a
look make sure the UI is all scale up
nicely and don'ts of impede people's
view depend on what resolution you
choose in the game because that can be a
big factor and sort of ruin the
experience if you're not careful a lot
of people like to be able to imagine
save on the fly so you are regular save
points in this game it didn't have
particularly regular save points and you
know a lot of people didn't really like
that they didn't really enjoy the fact
that the save point was sort of few and
far between in some instances so it's
good to either have an option where you
can save any point or have regular times
where because a lot of people don't have
a great deal of time and if you've got a
good space or like half an hour to an
hour between save points its dependent
on the game if it's more of an adventure
like say this is which is an experience
you want to maybe keep you save points
every 10 20 you know minutes like that
of you know set gameplay let's say a big
one as well but people always asked us
for controller support and I tried to
add a controller spot originally to this
but it was just really awkward because
unity fire was already out at the time
when I was sort of you know toward the
mid end of this actual game and
controller spot was just dodgy and you
know I just thought it wasn't worth
putting in but with if you get yourself
your own custom Impa manager from ones
that from the asset store you can pretty
much set everything up and the
controller will work pretty much any
controller you've got could be a
PlayStation Xbox anything and the work
you'll plug them in and off you go and
it will work with your mouse and
keyboard it'll switch to the controller
once it's plugged in and you'll be R
it's really easy and people like that
because it's a lot more easier for
people just to pick up the game if
they're not inclined to use a mouse and
keyboard and will just drive more
expectation and competition to your game
because the more options you have the
actual better it's going to be another
one is steam trading cards and
achievements even though you know your
game has to go on Steam in this case but
trading cards you have to reach a
certain value of sales before you can
put them in but there used to be a good
way to you know get people be interested
in your game if they wanted to do the
trading card system steam achievements
is there from the get-go so that's a
good one to put in because just like
with places I xbox on PlayStation where
you go for trophy and achievements
similar with Steam people just like that
sort of thing people like being able to
something I'll get 100% completion on
games sometimes maybe find a mid balance
tome make your achievements ridiculously
hard you know have a good selection and
people really enjoying it can often add
replay value to a game if say you've got
one achievement which is completely game
and then you know replay a certain way
and you'll get the different one and I
mean that adds replay value to the
overall you know value of the game and
one last thing I'm kind I'm gonna care
to mention is this isn't all the set
points that of all the things to
remember but it's about having different
languages now I didn't have different
languages other than English in this
game but it was asked yeah you know
getting again most people when they're
looking for games the vast majority of
your custom will actually come from say
you know solidly in America and I mean
if you add all of Europe together
including the sort of UK and maybe
Russia they might eventually almost
equate to the value of sales it will get
in the US but your u.s. is usually the
biggest market of people who buy your
game so predominantly the will bit
english-speaking so that is your first
port of call and if English isn't your
native language as people suspect good
to have English as a first part of call
then maybe take a look at different
languages you can possibly put in so I
think the second most in my stats I
can't really show you because I'm not
sure if I'm allowed because of the nd
airs and things like that UK isn't far
behind that but again that's
english-speaking Germany's quite close
behind that and then there's other
European countries which not as
important Russia is close to there and
then the some saw of passive Asia which
number will be interested in again but
it depends you know if you know some
people that can translate your game for
you that's great that'd be fantastic and
that will just drive more sales your way
because the more people the more
features you have the more languages you
have the more support you have with the
most common languages the better so it's
really up to you to decide which
features you think that you can easily
implement the more you have like I say
the better it will be in the end but
these were just some key points to take
a look at
think about and then you can go from
there so hopefully this gave you some
ideas of what you can do thanks very
much for watching don't forget to Like
