scripts for July 2017 number one is the
evolutive dungeon generator light which
will generate dungeons based on the size
and complexity that you specify and it
will generate the actual size and and
you can set maximum and minimum
difficulties of the dungeon to create
different solve sections and layouts and
number two is the 2d arena mini-map and
this just comes with basic scripts and
prefabs for there for you to set up a
2-d win them up in a game with sprites
that uses a simple render texture and it
lets you view things like allies enemies
and things like that
number three is advanced object portal
which will help you manage object
pooling for things like when you spawn a
lot of objects and you destroy them
within your game it can help you recycle
a lot of objects which conserve a lot on
performance if you're instantiating and
spawning a lot of objects and then
destroying them all the time so check
this out if you're looking to optimize a
little bit in that regard and number
four is the queue singleton graceful
single so in the pattern and it just
helps you create a singleton based on
the singleton which is something where
only usually exists once and it will
help you create something which is
persistent across many different scenes
only exists one of that particular thing
whether that's something which control
all your audio or special effects and
this can very help you that if you
struggling with that type of thing
number five is the simple turret system
which in this package includes a actual
a turret model it can do auto targeting
it has a shooting system the handles
health bullets has sound effects and
actual audio and particle effects based
on the things you hit so if you are
trying to make a target on skin this
might be a cool one
- actually News number six is the VR
material manager and this allows you to
change materials if you've got a sort of
VR headset and you can change in VR play
mode and it enables you to have the
ability to modify and adjust existing
designs in virtual reality so if you are
somebody who likes to do that it's
tested with the HTC vive and can help
you achieve that type of thing and
number seven is the RPG box free and
it's the free version of this and it's
an RPG style toolkit which will help you
reduce development times and includes a
lot of actual core functionality which
includes an inventory system shop system
equipment system items attributes for
mods and stats as you can see with the
sort of images below it includes loop
tables and items and you can go for the
pro system which will include enemy
spawning floating numbers when you're
probably hit enemies and low drops and
things like that create your own enemies
and so on so this free version could you
know really go a long way to helping you
create a fully functional small little
RPG and number eight is the photon
thunder or which helps you run sort of
unit and unit games which is the
networking and sort of functionality on
the photon and networking without having
to change very much which allows you to
use the photon sort of network with all
the managing stuff behind that without
you having to change much in regards to
the things we use that number nine is
the oculus integration which is a system
which helps you support for rendering
audio and avatars input and helps you
have lets you integrate a lot of the
oculus features directly into the game
you've got whether that's you know the
gear VR or the oculus rift for adding a
lot of different features achievements
services and to fully intimate
implementation unity with the actual SD
okay and number 10 is the free vertex
wind which is a package which lets you
create wind without actually having the
elements there and it's a script which
will sort of transform the vertexes
which are there to create the illusion
of something sort of moved in the wind
and it allows you to have directionally
thing and it's fully documented and for
you to use and remember all of the free
assets that I feature for July 2017 and
are available on my list and I will
provide a link in the description so
