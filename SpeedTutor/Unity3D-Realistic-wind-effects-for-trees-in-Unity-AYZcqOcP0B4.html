this is gonna be all about making leaves
or trees blowing the wind if you've ever
seen it in a lot of games where all the
trees blowing sort of unison along with
any sort of asset that you might have on
you terrain so wind zones work best on
I'm not a hundred percent but I think
the only work properly with trees that
were made in the tree editor so if
you've got a terrain like me as long as
you've got some trees that you've
painted on which were made in it in the
tree editor within unity and the tree
editor can be imported by right-clicking
imparting in new asset and choosing tree
creator and as long as the men like that
they'll be affected by the wind that's
actually within controlled by unity so
first of all all we're gonna have to do
it's quite simple to do is we go game
object create other and winds on or what
you can do is say you create an empty
game object which could you could put
anywhere in the scene you can go
component miscellaneous and winds on but
for now we'll to create other of a game
object and we'll choose a winds own now
it's put it into the corner of my scene
now initially you can see the scene will
actually preview for us and when you can
see that the winds on directly effects
all of the trees are bushes that we've
got within our scene as long as we've
set the terrain settings high enough cuz
if I go further where you can even see
that it's going on but that's just so we
don't have to render so much all of the
time so this winds on when it you
brought bring it in normally it'll be
set to directional so if you rotate the
object like you would with any object it
will affect direction of which the wind
is moving and which the trail trees or
bushes do swear so the big thing about
this is that there's two different types
as I said this directional which will no
matter where you place in your scene
it'll always be the same it's only the
rotation that's affected or there's a
mode be called spherical
whatever in the radius of your object or
this wins on specifically the trees will
be affected and now it's really
dependent on what effect you're going
for you can make like a helicopter
downdraft or something like that but as
I move it about you can see the objects
affected by the spherical wind zone so
we'll keep the directional wind zone
here so you can adjust the settings so
the men win is going to be general swear
and Christmas that you give to your wind
so if you set it say wasn't you know we
will only want something really subtle
so we'll set it to about nine point one
and we get you know fairly timid sort of
wind now we don't want as much
turbulence and that'll affect how often
things are swaying in between and you
know it doesn't look under present
realistic so we can set it to that to an
art point one and then we get something
very subtle we can obviously increase
the the main wind maybe to a point five
and maybe increase the turbulence
slightly so from looking at our scene
now yes it looks it looks slightly more
realistic and I apply the same sort of
balance to the entire scene so it looks
like there's a little bit of wind again
all these effects you'll want to just
try out yourself and see what you can
affect but that's just a very basic
where to start to add a little bit more
realism to scenes which have a lot of
trees or bushes or anything that's
created with the tree creator and is on
your terrain so I might do another
tutorial looking into how to make our
curtains blowing the wind something like
that using cloth physics so again thanks
very much for watching and don't forget
