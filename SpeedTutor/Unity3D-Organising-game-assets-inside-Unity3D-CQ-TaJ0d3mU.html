tutorial today and it's about organizing
your hierarchy view and unity after the
most of the time in the project term
menu you can create a little folders and
keep everything and you know it keeps it
all nice and neat and sometimes you want
to do the same here because you get a
load of different assets sometimes you
seen might be filled up with lights game
objects assets anything characters so
you want to just find a way to organize
it all together now I've just made up
some random objects some just are all
cubes just trees them cubes and
everything I've used another seen before
and I'm just going to quickly show you
how to actually organize this so what
I'm going to do is actually just create
three empty game objects and you go to
game object empty game object and then
you get three objects that mean nothing
inside unity and you can name them to
anything you want so if you just if you
click on it once and then click on it
again when you wear a lot better you can
change it and actually change the name
some just a name entry objects cube to
assets and then scene objects or what we
can do is we can put the trees all
inside here but all the cubes inside the
cube assets and then we could put all
the scene objects inside there so
realistically what we do is we get
everything parented to an empty game
object which mirror which is really
light use for the game engine so you can
just hide everything so you can organize
you soon really easily what you can do
if you accidentally put an actual game
object in again empty game object and
don't want all you do is open up that
stack and you can just drag them out and
then you'll be on parented so it's
spray-z and it just gives you a way of
organizing all you seen without too much
hassle and that's pretty much it if you
liked the video please leave a like
comment and subscribe thanks very much
