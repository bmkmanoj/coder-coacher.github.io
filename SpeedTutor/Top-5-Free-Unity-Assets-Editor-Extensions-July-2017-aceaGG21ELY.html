headed sir extensions for July 2017 so
number one is an asset called uni
palette and this is something which lets
you sort of manage the colors that
you'll find in your game so you can set
a range of colors whichever you specify
based on whatever your sort of style is
towards your game and you have a palette
of range of colors as you can see in the
image here and you can apply these
colors really quickly to UI buttons game
objects lights
renderers materials anything like that
and it will just help you manage all
your different colors and styles without
you having to every single time change
and decide what color the mood if you
have them all managed here number two is
the hierarchy view star and this is a
nice little editor extension where say
one time that you using your game and
you've got lots of different things
offered up in the hierarchy new closed
unity all hierarchy sort of information
will be closed up sold in on your game
objects and things and empty game
objects that might hold all the
different assets that you have it in you
see and you won't be able to access them
little bit closed up and what this
allows you to do is remember exactly
what you are doing in the hierarchy and
open everything back up just how you
left it so it might be a nice full time
saver if you know you're often closing
the unity and coming back to the things
that you're previously doing number
three is the UN input Universal network
input and this is a input system which
allows you to you know use impulse and
things across a network and this can be
allow people to use game pads and even
mobile devices for a game that you might
be developing and it supports for up to
a a xbox pads or virtual game pads which
you might use and it comes in a Dutch
mented for that number four is the debug
tools and this is a range of runtime and
editor debug tools which allow you to
create a lot different things whether
it's an FPS current during the corner
whether it's a debug log which is
actually on
or is actually different graphs and
things to show you all about performance
within real time without your having to
bring other sort of windows and things
on top and number five if you Dimond
visual scripting and this suggests is
that as its yes is a visual scripting
and extension which allows you to
instead of you're not having to write
yourself some code it comes fully
documented and easy to generate c-sharp
code based on the visual scripting that
we produce it comes with a step by step
with the documentation manual to guide
you through the process of using vests
