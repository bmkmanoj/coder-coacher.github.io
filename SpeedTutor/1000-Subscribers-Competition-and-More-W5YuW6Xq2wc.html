and this is just a sort of thank
everybody and solve congratulates say
thanks for getting to over a thousand
subscribers now I haven't been making
videos for a couple of weeks because I
was away for ten days did the week if
you saw the notification on my website
and in the description but again yeah
thanks very much for the support and
everybody carries on enjoying all the
tutorials that I'm putting up zeva just
keep on making the suggestions and i'll
try and keep on making them and you may
have seen them a website that i'm doing
some i put a new section up about
freelance so if you want any scripts or
maybe some models doing that you need
doing you know more quickly than you
would normally i'll only be charging a
small fee but that's something that you
might want to look towards if you want
something doing but on to one of the
topics for this video is that i'm going
to be working on a few things and it's
going to be i'm going to be making model
packs so this can be using your games so
it might be a model pack for a kitchen
outdoor scientific anything depending
what I think are what people suggest but
these are going to be just packs of
models that you're using games which
you're going to be in a low to medium
resolution also these are just some sort
of examples that I've got to show that
I've been working on and I'll put
together and you know the just like
water dispenser some weapons items you'd
find in your kitchen and you know just
may other examples for outdoor sort of
things more weapons just things like
that and what I'll do is that once i get
one of these packs sorted out the lonely
be for a very small price but soon as
that I reach 2,000 subscribers and i'll
pick five different subscribers who post
in the comments section of a video that
I post up and then you'll get chance to
win the model pack once it's released so
hopefully people find that as incense
have to come back to the videos and
watch them and maybe have a look at some
of the models that I've made so thanks
very much for watching the videos and as
ever thanks again and like comment and
subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
