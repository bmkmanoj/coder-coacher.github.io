I'm going to be calling the top ten free
assets for unity and unity five and
above now this is going to be a new
series where I'm just going to cover the
top ten free assets from a wide range of
features whether this be 2d 3d and so on
I will go about showing you just a quick
snippet of each asset showing you the
top ten items that I found giving you an
example of each of them and what they
sort of entail and then I'll give you
the links in the description of the
lists that I've created for the star so
like I say you can get all these for
free so without further adieu we'll get
straight on first of all we have the
desert kit 64 sample which comes with a
range of prefabbed sort of ancient
desert II you could say Egyptian style
assets which you can use and throw in
your game if you're looking for that
kind of style second we have is the free
food pack which comes with a variety of
sort of low poly models which includes
the 2d icons which could be used in your
2d or 3d game number three is the m4a1
PBR related model so this is a fairly
high detailed and high resolution model
that you can use within your game which
comes with separate objects in between
and comes with a select set of
animations for different things number
four is the money pack and this comes
with a range of different styles money
models with a nice basic texture which
has a range of square and folded notes
with some singular and number five is
the heavy sci-fi gun which is a nice
sort of PBR model for something that
might be related to a sci-fi looking
game with a range of different color
selections choose from number six is the
platform game assets which comes with a
variety of background sprites and
characters and little objects which can
help you sort of add
lots of nice little 2d variety to your
game and comes individually packs which
you could add to your 2d again number
seven is the underwater fantasy which
already has a scrolling background which
loops throughout and can help you create
a look of underwater 2d see number AIDS
is the water effect for a more polished
style of game and this is a really cool
one and it's a simple shader that if you
change the height of the plane that's
given you can with it's got some called
clipping which can find the edges of a
terrain and objects that live in the sea
and it will change the effect to create
a cool little 2d and low poly style
water and number nine is the variety
pack zero 1 which comes with a range of
sounds which include background audio
and music and there's a bunch of corns
for all different types of scenarios and
games which you can check out and number
10 is last but not least is a is the
world skies and that includes a skybox
which can be used within your scene so
get the locket away from the default
skybox which in my hub which includes a
procedural sky I will leave a link in
the description and it will give you all
my free assets for April and it will
give you the lowdown on either other
ones that I might have found which are
useful and the ones that I featured in
this video so if you like this don't let
me know if you'd like to see more of
these things considering doing this type
of thing every month because a lot of
these free assets are really good and
can help you go a long way in making
again so thanks very much for watching
