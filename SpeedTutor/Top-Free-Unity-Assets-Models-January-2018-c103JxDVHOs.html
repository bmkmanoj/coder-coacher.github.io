for January 2018 and this shouldn't be
in a slightly different format I'm not
really gonna list in the video each of
these assets because there's an awful
lot of assets for this month and we've
had some sort of slower months before
this so I'm just gonna reel through all
the different models that you could
possibly look out for in this month and
you should check all these out so like I
said I mean it's gonna reel all these
off so the first one I'm gonna show is
the horror acts and this is a real quite
realistic looking axe model with solid
blooded hilt or whatever we might call
it fairly low poly with about 400
polygons and with up to 2k textures and
the second one is called druid Tom and
this is a low poly PPR model about 2400
triangles and includes you novel PPR set
up and it's quite a nice little add-on a
sort of metallic looking old-style book
and it might be suitable for any fantasy
RPG style game and the next one is the
furniture packing number one and
includes selection of furniture from a
well-known Swedish star and the based on
real science models they comes with 11
models 35 prefabs and 35 different
materials so there's a whole selection
of cabinets chairs and desks anything
that you might want might be here for
you
the next one is I won't try and
pronounce the name but it's a statue of
a Greek soft sculpture with three LEDs
4k textures and a varying levels of
triangle counts as you go down and the
next one is an asset called antique
binoculars and as it suggests it's
another great PV a little asset with
about 2700 triangles with 2k ppi sexes
and it's just a more maybe of a more
historical themed game where you might
have this in a stocking for a museum or
you might even use it if it was
something as a sort of gameplay mechanic
to your game again while we're following
the theme this is called spiff space
craft zero
it's another really cool PBR related
asset with 4k textures about 2100
triangles and it's quite a cool-looking
spacecraft if you are making a space
adventure game or something along those
lines and the next one is something
called ax slicer and again comes with
1/2 K by 2 k PB onna
text you set within a with a material
and its really low poly about 644
triangles and you can see the wireframe
down here so it's fairly optimized and
we could sue any style whether that be
your RPG MMO or sort of fantasy styled
game the next one is called the polygon
desert pack and it's a pack which can
include various prefabs and twelve
themed models in a set of polygonal
style with four desert plants and eight
desert stones I think this next one is a
nice one because it's called the winters
own mini includes a variety of meshes
fritter ends which are suitable for the
unity with including the ground texture
weather effects audio and all things for
the terrains that are involved and
includes two meshes with 100 times 100
with 4k and 16 care trains for each with
the diffuse and normal Maps and it's got
quite a nice-looking visual style looks
quite high quality when you look at it
from here and you could imagine these in
sort of fantasy game it's good even seen
something like Skyrim and this next one
is called translucent crystals and I
think this is an actual a really nice
one that you would see as solve maybe a
paid a say there's a fully PBR magic
crystal with a custom translucent shader
and you can use them in any game whether
it be stylized or realistic and it comes
with a variety of colors and I think
they have a really really extremely high
quality so you could use the shader on
other things not just crystals but this
works just really nice and I think it
could suit any style of RPG or something
we have might have magic crystals to
decorate see or even if you used it on
other props and other things if you were
looking to recreate a sci-fi again it
could be suitable for them and the next
one is picture frames with photos and
it's a collection of ten wall frames
with
photographs and it's friendly form all
about perfectly as it suggests a bunch
of photo friends with photos so you can
go crazy with those and the next one is
the sci-fi rifle in love Polly and it's
a low poly looking cipher rifle about
about 3,000 triangles and it comes with
PPI related to care textures so again
this is just one by itself it's called
the pine tree smushy craft series and
there's a few of these on the store and
there's just a bunch of different sort
of stylized trees vegetations and things
like that in this particular style from
a slightly larger set but if you're
looking to have this style you might
want to look at that pack or just have
take a look at the some of the free ones
and this month another nice one is
called the cutlery silverware PBR and
this is five separate objects which
include a knife spoon table FARC and
various metal and plastic things with
PBR textures up to two okay
with all the things that were expect and
fairly low poly considering the shapes
that are there and the next one is the
PBR old cabinet and we seem to be having
a hell of a lot of PBR stuff but it's
just great that we see all these for
free is gonna be an old cabinet with
doors that open and close includes 2k
PBR textures it looks quite a nice
styled cabinet the next one is the
cigarette lighter PBR and this includes
four separate object with the lighter
body the Flint wheel the fuel adjuster
and the lever there and in clip also
includes PBR textures up to two K so
this might be want to dot around in this
scene and the next one is the free low
poly desert pack and this is a a la poly
pack which is to create a low poly
desert environment which all assets
include poly cannot between sixteen and
a 388 tries it has nine types of assets
with two variations on the color with
nine flat colors and nine with mixed
colors and they're all prefabbed and
ready to go and if you been looking for
again from some of these packs that
you've seen these could sort of combine
together and make a sort of desert sea
western style things with the vegetation
that
and the sort of little assets they have
here unless what not least is the free
island collection and bridges from the
South triple-layer island environments
and it's a highly detailed 2.5
kilometres by 2 perfect kilometre
terrain with realistic glass and grass
textures up to 2 K with a high quality
terrain textures and a really nice
skybox that comes with it the waters not
included in this package but you can
find it with a link here so you could
see from various screen shops it's quite
a large and high-quality looking around
with all the textures included so again
if you're looking for something for to
spruce obliterans this might be a good
way to learn new things and take it to
the next level so this was just me
throwing the assets out at you this week
and it's a crazy month really for the
amount of content that people have been
putting out for free and I'm always
month on month really surprised so make
sure to check all these out and sort of
give a thumbs up to all the developers
who created them so again I'll leave a
link in the description so you can check
these out thanks very much for watching
