tutorial and this is going to be a
showcase of showing you the best tips
tricks and overviews with creating
realistic lighting and rendering within
unity now this is using the latest of
unity five point six point two and there
will be later versions but all of the
things that I'll show will be very
similar in terms of the settings that
will show you today and also things in
the past they all sort of crop around
will stay the same so this is not the
most definitive collection of tips and
tricks because you can do a whole host
of reading from the unity sort of
documents and I'll link you to this to
the pages that you can have a look at
and read well I will give you the tips
that I have learned over the time and
the things that might help you achieve a
bit of realism now this is the scene
here this might not be the most
realistic seem you've ever seen we might
be able to achieve something similar
like this and with the tips that I can
show you you can help you sort of push
your game further to the realms of being
more photorealistic seen but it is
something that I've got from the assets
star it's the 3d sci-fi kickstand ticket
and you can see in the game view here
this is how it started so I know it
looks you know the scene looks okay just
in general but you know there's a lot of
ways that we can use to improve this and
if I go back into my scene there's a lot
of ways where we can add a lot more
depth to the scene and a lot more
settings that we can change to try and
achieve it and you can see that from my
sort of test sample here we've got the
sort of emissive lights all around the
scene we're using reflections reflection
probes we're going to do some big
lighting and the use of the image
effects with the new post-processing
stack talk about HDR and the different
workspaces and lighting rendering modes
that you can use and what soft assets
you can use to achieve and better
quality results just in general just get
straight into the meat of everything
that you can actually try and do so the
first thing I always like to you know
start with is in unity by default you've
got a default skybox no the defaults
gave up
isn't particularly you know fantastic it
doesn't do anything this overly accurate
now it's not so much apparent for this
scene unless I maybe had lots of windows
and things like that
but we can use something called HDR i'ma
and that helps us achieve in it's almost
like a 360 picture almost like a
reflection probe of a scene or a place
in real life and you'll be able to draw
the lighting in the ambient light and
whatnot from that image use it as a
skybox and it will help create a sort of
look of real life if you have a HDR I'm
up from say a field hour you have it
from a city environment if that's where
you're going to set your game it can
help you achieve that sort of lighting
if you're looking to do that so if you
want to do that you can go to the asset
store and when you're at the assets so
you couldn't search for the unity HDR
iPAQ and that's completely free and you
can use that or you can find some other
HDR I'm ups if you so wish once download
and import these so once we've imported
these into the scene we'll get a
selection of the hitch gary maps that we
can use and on the lighting tab if you
don't have a single window and lighting
on them we can change the skybox
material so we can choose whichever one
we might want to use and you can choose
whichever one for this particular
instance if i go back to the inspector
we can you know get different examples
and you can see it's already set up into
materials for as easily so what i use is
just the treasure treasure island white
balanced and i'll let that and my CNM
you might have seen a slight difference
but like i say it's a little bit
different because this is an entirely
closed scene but it is very evident if
you've got say an exterior scene or
something which takes the lighting from
the thing once you beg two hours you've
got a lot of windows and things like
that and going from the things that we
can see within the scene there's not
very much going on this the camera a
level and a directional light and a
point life i really pretty much disable
each element you don't really see
anything in terms of the directional
light doing very much in terms of the
overall quality because as I said it's
an enclosed scene but an directional
light is always a good one to use if you
want to achieve some lighting especially
outside or within rooms which might have
windows in an interior and you can use
other types of lights which might
include point lights and things like
that but like I said with this one scene
as though this scene has a lot of
materials that if I show you here with
this material it has an emission so that
can actually add to our bounce lighting
and help us create a more realistic look
but I will go into that more in more
detail further down the line but another
thing to mention is last tip - let's say
is that if you want to go for realism or
photo realism is you want to M to use
PBR related assets physically based
assets you will see that immunity as
standard with the standard shader it
does support physically based materials
and if you go and create these in a
particular workflow whether it's using
the quick source we are substance
painter and designer and things like
that's correct materials and textures
for objects and the like you can help to
create things that are realistic in all
lighting situations so this can include
you know being outside in doors whatever
in all the ways of sort of authoring
textures you had issues if you had a
scene like this and then you maybe made
you texture and it looked okay in this
scene if you put into something
drastically different it might look
really weird and you'd have two or three
texture again whereas with a PBL
workflow is you make it once with
materials that based on real life
materials so they interact with lighting
in a specific way which is real - real
life is no matter which seem you put in
it will always look the same so they are
normally use with Inuit if using a
metallic workflow is they'll use an
albedo and metallic roughness or
smoothness for unity usually a normal
map and occlusion map and maybe
something for your emission and they're
the things that usually equate to it
being helping it be realistic so that's
something to mention you don't have to
use PBR assets but it goes a long way to
making things look better now if I go
back to the game view and I select this
object that we've got here I usually
like to leave everything by default but
maybe not the smoothness up a little bit
a little bit of reflectivity over time
and you can adjust that and I will go
through my final scene at the end you
want to use a different rendering path
say forward on the 3rd at the two men
examples and forward it's based on the
amount of lights you've gotten you've
seen a women-only render usually the
brightest lights within a scene and it
doesn't always achieve the most accurate
results and we normally want to switch
to deferred lighting and you can see in
the background it we can see the now the
light in the background because it'll
take all the light into account and will
do more accurate results now the problem
with this is it's more featured towards
high-end console and PC because it's
more taxing on the machine but of course
we're going for some more realistic
results then that's what we want to try
and achieve one thing that goes hand in
hand with PBR I'll give you an example
if I will edit and we your project
settings and then we go to player then
we go to the other settings down here
you can see at this side we've got
something called color space and color
spaces are things which work
hand-in-hand with PPI if you want to
receive more realistic results which is
choosing the color space and there's two
different types of linear and this gamma
and in the example you can see below
that the gamma works best when you get
more sort of white areas to get blown
out very quickly and the advantage of
the linear space is that the colors one
is supplied to the shaders will sort of
brighten linearly over time as the light
increases so it makes a more soft effect
across the board whereas the gamma space
although not supporting on some consoles
maybe earlier consoles and lower end
mobile devices and it doesn't give you
as realistic results and the linear
space is what PBR when you're off the
PBR materials that's usually the
workspace that it's using so it's good
to switch your color space over to that
if you again trying to achieve those
more realistic results so over on the
rendering on the color space we can
switch to linear and it will do some
calculations and it will start switching
everything over for us and if you go to
edit project settings and graphics you
see that the different tiers set up for
what's type of rendering paths you're
going to want to use and it's grayed out
because it's using by default but if
like I said if you go to the camera and
you specify what the rendering path you
want to use it will override those
things in the settings unless there is a
say a graphics card or a piece of
hardware that can't support deferred
rendering and you saw the lighting
slightly change or the materials file it
up there when we change the linear
workspace and everything got a little
bit more brighter because we've got a
more high dynamic range that we can
achieve with that actual asset itself
now another thing that's pretty
important when you're doing a lot of
things especially interiors and stuff
even if you don't think some of your
materials are actually reflective a
reflection probe is always a good one to
add so you can go game object light and
you can add a reflection probe and this
can go in sort of every different area
that you might have in your place and
this is already have one by default so
I'm going to do is I'm going to just
remove this reflection probe out of this
main folder with all the actual assets
in and go back to the game view so you
can see these settings that I'm using so
you can see the little preview down here
and you can see that it will sort of
stretch a simular reflection based on it
will take everything within the scene
and it will almost bake it down into a
texture map and it will apply some
settings towards it to make it sort of
simulate how it would reflect in your
life now some things to mention is that
if I go to my scene you when i zoom all
the way out you can see that the
bounding box for this reflection probe
encapsulate the entirety of this actual
sort of let's say this sci-fi space
center for instance but it's always
beneficial to split up into areas where
you might have different sort of
scenarios so for the sake of this we
when were actually rendering just this
room in here so what we can do is we can
grab this sort of tool which will scale
in the bounding for the actual
reflection probe and I'll just scale it
down and scale it in and I will grab
these just little these little anchor
points and just move it around so we
just encapsulate the entire just be
entire seeing itself and you can just
have a check around to make sure that it
looks like it's encapsulated the entire
area and just pull it very
as close as you can to the mesh without
self losing any elements to itself now
you can have a look and you can do it by
real-time and you can just do it on a
wax or refresher Lenin once you can
actually choose to bake it but you can
choose to do that you can choose the
importance the intensity if we're doing
a room which is like this which is
almost you can imagine it like a box as
most interiors would likely be you can
set the projection to box projection and
if you take it a little slightly updated
more towards what we might be looking
for and we can set different things and
we can set the resolution we could
probably knock the tubs to 5/6 if you've
got a lot of reflection probes it's
recommended to keep the resolution
fairly low because you might get
problems otherwise you might get
performance dips and unless you're
seeing really bad quality it's not
recommended especially if you've got a
real time probe which will leave on for
this and to leave it as it is you can
set keep it as HDR that's fine like I
said before when we're on the camera
which is similar to what we were talking
about the far in terms of the hitch Gary
maps and things like that is that we
have a few settings on here and we can
allow this camera to be and HDR enabled
and that just stands for high dynamic
range and allows the lighting and the
color space to reach a higher value of
lights and darks and especially it is
quite important if you're going to use
image effects which I'll show you in the
in the future and you can choose to
disable MSAA because we then use our own
thing in the future so what I'm gonna do
now is I'm going to give you an example
of how the reflection probe actually
works so say I click on I click on the
material that we've got here and I take
away its metallic map I'll put the
metallic this all the way down and then
I will knock the smoothness up I can
even put them italic all the way and we
get some weird weird results but I leave
the smoothness obviously you can see
that this it reflects some of the
environment and you can see that it's
doing it looks like it's doing it
freezing with realistically now if we
disable the reflection probe we don't
actually see any reflections and
at all and it just maybe looks a bit
blind so if I disable the reflection
and I select back on my asset again and
I will sort of decrease maybe and
smoothens to a naught 0.8 if we keep me
a reflection probe enabled and we can
adjust the actual values in real time
and you can see how it affects it even
without a great deal of actual
reflectivity on the assets that we've
got so it's always important to keep
that there so now we've got some basic
setup done we can look at the actual
lighting itself and how we can sort of
go about setting this up so in this
scene by default if we go to the
lighting tab it's using the real-time
global illumination now for this I don't
want to use it a mummy on take that I'll
lose some of the sort of them pretty
computed yeah it's already done and it
might look a little bit it looks a
little bit washed out now now what we
can do is we can actually use and
lighten to do the salt and not baking so
what you need to do for a lot of things
if we've gotten emissive lights and we
want emissive lights to affect different
surfaces around our scene you need to
make sure that if I click on one of
these objects in the scene and they were
going to the inspector you need to make
sure that they're the things that you
want to be taken into account for the
light map you want them to be static so
light like static and you can take that
up at the top on the static both tick
box now because all these assets set as
static what I'm actually going to do is
you can see that I've got an emission
value here which is has got a map and a
color you know you can change the color
as you wish from here so I could just
move it so it's slightly more ready and
what I like to do is usually I'll maybe
knock the emission value up it's usually
between a value of not one but for the
sake of this baking I might knock it up
to three and all the objects which
actually share the same material will
all have an emission of three and
usually higher you'll get more soft
bright results but this is a nice way to
test them you can test this yourself if
I go to the lighting tab again we can
leave everything at the top by default
we can enable mixed lighting I want me
to do is I'm going to choose begged
indirect because we have two different
types of actual lighting we have direct
lighting so if you imagine this is a
light and it's shining down
here it will have direct light on to
this point around here and then nothing
else will happen and it will just have a
hot spot here but whereas if we add
other lights area lights or these
emissive lights we will add to the sort
of debounce lighting around and that's
the indirect lighting so you will get
light over here which wouldn't be
directly from this light but it's as
light bounces around it brightens up
places where because if you look in real
life and you've got Sun coming through
your window you don't just have the
corner of your room which is pitch black
it light bounces around realistically
and will softly light up different areas
so what we can do is we can change to
baked indirect which the most accurate
version of it we can keep the light
matter as enlightened because I prefer
enlightened for this you can keep the
indirect resolution as to so with the
light map resolution you can change it
and you can adjust it just be 20 to
speed up the time and you can increase
that as you need to you can leave the
padding at two and like I said you can
really look at all these values as you
need to you can leave the light map size
2025 you can leave them compressed you
can add I'm going to conclusion if you
want to and that will add some daggers
but we'll use an image effect to achieve
this later them we can enable final
gather which is a nice thing which when
it's calculating the lighting and how it
bounces around on the last bounce it
will calculate the global illumination
and just make it a higher resolution
based on whatever the light map size is
so it will increase time of which it
takes to bake Bob will increase quality
so for the sake of this maybe I'll
reduce it to one to eight and you can go
up in increments one to eight 256 512
1024 but you want to really M adjust
these settings accordingly and you can
tick and the denoising which will try
and minimize any noise that you get from
when you bake out the final gather and
you can leave a directional mode as
direct I sometimes like to put the
indirect intensity to about two and you
can adjust this as you need to I'll put
the light map parameters down to love
for this for the sake of this and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to untick
fog because I don't want this on this is
just from however it was before so
we expect is that because everything's
static and we're using these settings to
bake out the light mapping nothing in
here is going to move which is good for
us and we're just going to hit generate
lighting and you can see after the sort
of baking is done but based on the
actual color that I chose for the
emission value was a little bit in the
ready because you could see it in this
preview at the top I could set it more I
can set it back to white
and you can see it might look a little
bit bright so we could potentially turn
the emission down to 2.5 and we can
adjust settings like that other time
because no amount of being able to do
your lighting will ever beef you know
100% perfect the first time that you
ever do it so let me give you another
example of say a an emissive object that
we can use so say I make a a cube here
and this just will sit in our scene just
let's say so we can't see it there I'll
push it back a little bit what the
result will create a new material and
I'll call this red and what I'll do is I
want create it and I will apply that to
the cube then what I will do is I will
change the just a do the normal albedo
to red then under the emission that
we've got which is here I'll enable
emission and I will change the value to
a red value and you see it set to 1 and
now what I'll do is I will set this to
2.5 and you can see that it will have
updated in our preview here now I want
to set that as static because I want
that to be taken into account when we do
our light map I've changed the the
colors back to white and before we beg
the lighting out again I'll give you an
example of what we can do for the
post-processing effects so if you go
back to the assets star and then you can
go to the unity star and search for the
post-processing stack and this is the
thing that we're going to use to control
the image effects or the post-processing
that we want to use so we can download
and import and so what we can do from
now in our scene we can go back on the
main camera I remember that we want to
allow HDR and our own tick allow MSAA
because we're going to use our own
anti-aliasing here so I want to do is
want to add a component here and
add we want to add a post-processing
behavior and this is when we're going to
put our new behavior so if we right
click down to the botton in the project
we can go Korea and we can go to the
post-processing profile normal cold this
cause process new for instance so what
we can choose to use on here I've got a
tutorial which shows you the more ins
and outs of all the image effects that
you can use and all the effects on low
end high end and the performance issues
you might see so we click back on the
camera and we can add our
post-processing you behave you to the
camera now we can just edit it straight
in the project so we can add
anti-aliasing and we can use the fast
fast approximate or we can use a
temporal anti-aliasing I will use the
fast approximate and just keep it on a
higher quality we can use the ambient
occlusion which will add and sort of a
dark and airy to either recessed areas
or areas where light will go inside and
so I've not escaped from and it helps
you just add a little bit more depth and
realism kisi put the intensity or to an
or point for and set the radius maybe
not point six or something like down we
can take away and add it as a result
wish you can keep on down sampling but
it's usually best not to overdo certain
things one thing that always you know
looks pretty good but is quite taxing
effective screen space reflections and
this is something which adds reflection
based on just things that you see in
screen space so only things here that we
can see will be added for the retrace
reflections and it will try and sort of
do some calculations based on the
reflections that we have and try and
make it more accurate we can do the type
as physically based we can choose
additive but it's not as accurate so we
can choose physically based and keep the
quality on low or you can increase it to
high but seeing as though we're going
for the highest quality or do that we
can choose to reflect back faces but it
will reflect things that wouldn't
normally be reflected so say the back of
this light might would if I enable it
you can see that it will start by doing
reflections on the backsides of floors
and walls so it will make it more
accurate you can see if I enable or
disable you can see slight changes in
the
object over there and you can adjust all
the settings as you want to we can
privilege skip all the things they're
here because they're not a great deal of
and benefit quite yet we can enable eye
adaption and that helps to try and tone
down some bright areas that we've got
but we need to redo the lighting a
little bit before we do that we can add
something called bloom and I'm sure
everybody on it and knows what bloom is
but if you go a lot of overboard with
bloom it can look a little bit crazy so
we can change the intensity down to
maybe a knot point one so we get a
little bit of intensity on there and
have the just a threshold up a little
bit higher maybe just about you know
almost two so we take away the just the
sheer intense I have found use that we
get you can choose to use a texture if
you so wish and if you go inside the
post-processing and you go to the
textures and then you go to the lens
that where you can just add a lens
effect and it could make it look a
little bit more dirty on the areas which
might have blue now one thing I always
find important to add is some sort of
color grading and color grading is
always good because he comes with its
own ton mapping and in photography and
things like that tone mapping helps to
just sort of bring bright areas down to
sort of a very realistic and sort of
range and I like to use the the filmic
Tama because it's slightly more
realistic towards getting you know
closer and closer and closer to try and
make it look more realistic and the post
exposure is zero you know we can choose
to increase or decrease this a comment
we'll just leave it as if by default now
I like to sometimes many what style you
going for is increase the saturation
slightly so it looks more bright in
areas which has got you know sort of
vivid colors and it makes them a lot
more vivid you can choose to use
trackballs to sort of maybe make your
scene fit a specific style so say if we
you know want to add a little bit more
you know blue to our scene here and in
the middle trackball we can leave that
as
because if we start moving it might you
know look a little bit weird and we can
do the same here but we've got some of
the sort of Slav values that we can
change or affect you know the mid-tones
and highlights and the shadows within
the scene or we can choose to sort of
bring them down to a value ver you know
as if we saw that the scene looks maybe
a little bit overly bright at the start
so we can maybe pull pulled the first
trackball down slightly you could use
the middle and you could maybe overall
pull there on we could adjust the last
the offset value maybe you know pull
this down slightly as well you know it
depends what you're trying to achieve
what you seem just you can mess about
with all the things here and you can add
some vignette so you can maybe just
darken the edges of the actual screen
just to solve blow them out a little bit
and like I've said before we can use a
series of different style lights so we
could use if we go game object lights
we've got different types of directional
light which would act us and we've got
point lights if you need them which
would affect a solve and almost like a
light bulb in an area spot light would
be just as you would imagine a spotlight
but area lights are something that if
you can just about see if I make this a
little bit bigger and the area light is
almost a just a box if you can imagine
it because this is a little bit bright
at a minute and it can only be were used
in real time ball help add some bounce
lighting to your scene if you need to
brighten areas up so say we had a window
that said this side and it was quite
dark in this scene we could add an area
light over here and if we back up the
lighting it would just add some more um
ability to bounce if we're not using say
and the emissive lights that we've got
in this scene but most things that use
whether it's an indoor or outdoor you
will use a Sun you might use emissive
light if you've got sort of light
fixtures and things like that you might
use area lights
windows and things to make it a little
bit more bounce lying around you can use
point lights and things if you need to
do that but as I mentioned before we had
a material that we created here which
was just red
and we gave it an emissive value of
three and we're just going to rebec the
Lightning out because I slightly reduced
the overall intensity of these lights
and I added this one here and set it to
static so it would then add some sort of
fan it would add the bleeding to
different areas as you don't be required
so what I like to do is make sure that
also generators off because I only like
it to do the lighting when I want it to
and we can just clear the back data and
you can see that it's um taken away all
the solve bounce lighting around that we
had it'll still have the image effects
and the things that we had which it
doesn't look too bad but will generate
lightning again then one thing I'll care
to mention while it's baking out is that
usually the baking by itself will be
fairly fast especially if you've got the
settings more low but if once you enable
the final gather which will increase the
overall quality it will take a little
bit longer and so you just need to
really adjust the settings accordingly
and just just try them out you can turn
them down if you need quick iteration
times you can potentially use the
progressive light map where you can
change the line mapper there but I like
to use enlightened just for the sake of
that it's something that I'm used to
using and you can change or if say
you've come to the end of your project
and you need to sort of bump up the
lighting to increase the quality it's
just you know just setting so you might
want to increase the light map
resolution you know you want to but I
want to increase the padding if maybe
you've got some issues you might want to
increase the light map size if you want
the light Maps get bigger and more
accurate the light map in a resolution
could be increased as a little tool tips
to explain what each of these is and you
can obviously increase the final gather
and as you can see that the Lighting's
big back out you can see in my normal
scene that it looks quite white and
easier and based on the actual image
effects that we've gone here it looks
more blue so we can go back to the past
process and go back to the inspector and
maybe if we uncheck the color grading
it's the color grading that's doing that
so what we can do is we can move back
down to say this the slope track bar
and just maybe bring the sort of ball
back to maybe the middle or maybe add a
little bit of something there so we get
in more towards the maybe the color that
we're actually looking for and what we
could do is if we want maybe a little
bit more reflectivities our scene we can
click back on one of our objects that
we've got and the smoothness value that
we had you know we can potentially
increase - you know leaking all the way
up or we can go to just about null point
a and you can see the reflection of the
red cube that we had so you remember our
we put something here and you can see
that this part of the scene you can see
that the emission effected the top the
bottom this side and things like that so
you know all in all we can get more
towards a realistic look over time with
sort of adding a little bits and lot
bits to the sort of overall luck to make
it try and move towards a bit more
realism I will go back to the original
scene that made and you can see that I
were all the same things that we've just
featured previously and I've got the
material and so does that emission set
to 3 and I've got all these objects and
they were set to a mission of about 2.8
and you can see in the scene that's an
exactly the same basic settings were
looking the same we've clicked the the
mix lighting for the bait global
illumination with Becht indirect we've
got all the same settings for the
resolutions and we choose to do the
final gather and compress the light maps
and you can see that in game you know I
can adjust accordingly and it will
change as as I needed so I'll quickly
run through your things that we've
covered in this video is that we've got
imported hich Gare I'm ups which can
help to add a sort of a little bit of
realism because it will be a panoramic
shot of a real-life scenario and it will
help to bring light in from there you
can use PBR assets to you know look and
work realistically to help you ask a
realistic looking materials for any
lighting environment you've got so
they're very good to start learning you
use the deferred on your main camera use
the deferred rendering path and you want
to do the linear
colorspace which you can do within the
edit project settings and player and you
can choose a linear there which works
well with PBR because that's the
recommended things use you can use
reflection probes and in this scene
I've got reflection probes in a few
different areas as you can see the
bounding boxes are there and we've got
everything set static that you want to
be taken into account on the actual
light map we've got some sort of we've
got some reflective objects for this
material that I've got has some
reflectivity so we can see things inside
other things we've looked at the
lighting setting so we enabled the mixed
lighting for the becks
enlighten and light mapper and we chose
to enable final gab things like that
we've got and looked at the emissive
lights that will add to the global
illumination and you we also touched on
using area lights under the lights to
add to that and we looked at using image
effects to give an example of adding the
screen special reflections and get
occlusion and things like that to try
and sharpen up your scene and you can
see that I can run around in this scene
and you know do everything that we
normally need to do as you would expect
from the scene you can even if it's
staticky and hide this object and it
will still do the same thing that our
that it was baked out to do so if I gone
inspector and I hide that cube you can
see that there's still you know a hot
spot bleeding at the bottom because it's
already baked into the texture so you
don't always need the lights still there
if you don't actually you know need it
anymore
and one thing to care to mention is so
you've got real time objects like a
character of things that can't be static
all the time to static objects never
move you can use light probes so you can
go game object light and light probe
group and you can add these a little
sort of yellow balls and you can just
edit light probes duplicate them around
and you can add them in grids around you
see depends if you're doing an interior
and exterior you can read the Unity
documentation on how exactly to use
light probes but when these get baked in
de Becque some of the information
that we've got from you know the light
mapping and it will apply a similar set
of information to things that move so
you've got a character and you need it
to have you know this big liking that
we've got around here and all around is
that it will get baked into one of these
probes and as soon as the character or
real time object gets near a particular
probe it will get the lighting based on
that so it's just another thing to
mention like I said at the very
beginning of the video you can go as
detailed as you need to with lighting
and you know it can go far beyond what
I've mentioned and some of the things
that mentioned might not be a hundred
percent correct but these were just my
tips and tricks to try and achieve a
more realistic or stylistic look font in
the new games within unity so sorry that
this was quite a long one I hope you
enjoyed it thanks very much for watching
