Engine 4 tutorial and today I'm going to
show you how to make a custom collision
mesh or something work you'd use in a
game where you don't want to have to
make collisions every time within the
engine so you can do it within your
modeling program so this is just a very
basic example all I've got is a
cardboard box and you can see the edges
and the sort of polygons that make up
this mesh now I don't want to said going
to unreal and make it a sort of
collision over the entire mesh I'll make
it convex because we don't want extra
points all over this because this is
essentially a cube shape so we should be
able to just have a collision with this
example and it's better with something
let's say more complicated because this
you could just add a basic Collider in
unreal but this is just to portray my
example so what I can do is with any
object if you even if you've got a group
of objects that were sitting you seen
that you might want to clad them all so
I'm going to do is with any primitive
ship or whatever you want to do what I'm
going to do is going to grab a box and
I'm just going to just make it the size
of my CAD box roughly over the top you
can see it there and from there you can
see that it's just got a default color
on it what I need to do is make sure
that this has the name corresponding to
what my cardboard boxes codes if I click
back on my box go into the modifier is
called sea box now if I go back on my
collision I'm creating what I'm going to
do is I'm going to rename that - you see
X underscore sea box and you see X
underscore is just the sort of name
definition that you're supposed to give
to a collision so once you've done that
you can have those two in your scene and
from there what we're going to do is
we'll leave those to that what I'll do
is I'll get X bar X bar I'm going to
choose where to export my model if
you're not using 3ds max it's very
similar in any other modeling program
you want to export out as and I will
name this as just C box and I will save
this and I will take a bit and bid me
if you want to have your textures
included and you'll want to include in
geometry smoothing groups and then what
we're going to do is press ok and it'll
export those two models out we'll go
back into ue4 and then from there what
I'm going to do is going to create a new
folder in my content call it let's say C
box for now just for this example what
I'm going to do is right click in there
and choose new asset in part I what I'm
going to do is I'm going to find where I
have saved my model so I'm going to Part
C box R we don't want to auto-generate
collision so we can uncheck that we can
import materials and textures if you
want to so we'll click import you can
see my object here what I can do is I
can bring this in and I will drop it in
my scene and I can just scale up for the
purposes of this demo let's say and then
you can see my box in my scene if we
walk towards it you will notice that
there we go we have the collision on the
actual mesh itself now if we just go out
of that I can double click my model now
if I view this in the inspector window
and I show collision you can see the
purple around the purple bounding box is
my collision that I've got on my object
so that's just a simple way if you need
to and you want to bring in a custom
collision no matter how complicated it
can save you the time or the level
design of the time in the actual engine
itself so thanks very much for watching
