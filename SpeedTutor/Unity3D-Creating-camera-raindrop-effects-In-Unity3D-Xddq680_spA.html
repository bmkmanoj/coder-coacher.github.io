and this is going to be about creating a
raindrop effect which somebody suggested
now this is not going to be the best way
to do it but this is just a way that I
thought you know imagine it works now
this is the first time I've actually
shown like a preview of what I'm going
to do so you know if people like that
make sure that yeah you know tell me
I'll try and remember to do it each time
that I make a video now what we're going
to start off by doing is I've taken I've
made a little image here which has got
you know a soft edge and it's just a
sort of dark sort of circle and we're
going to use this make sure it's got a
transparent background but I'll add this
to the script package if you know you
want to download and use it for your own
now what I've done is created a raindrop
material and this has got the particles
additive shared now if you right click
on your project and you click import
package you can import the particles
package if you don't already have that
that's set
I'm shared now then you add your image
to that shader and you know you can
change its color you know however you
like now what we've got is I've got a
particle system which actually creates
this images multiple times and I've
attached it to the main canvas or always
follows us around I'm just going to go
through the basic parameters of this
particle system you know so I don't
forget I'll bore you with the actual
outcome
now I've just gone if you go to the
renderer tab at the bottom you can add
the raindrop material that you've grade
and you can create a material if you
didn't already right-click Korea and
then material now as I say if you want
your material in there you max particle
size can be something like not by 1/7 no
all these parameters that I'm going to
give you you can change depending on
what you like now the next thing you
want to change is if you click on
particle system at the top make sure
duration is 120 make sure it's ticked as
looping
don't have free roam ticked start delay
not point a lamb start life time roughly
4 start speed roughly 1 start size not
0.5 you know I'm just giving you roughly
because it doesn't have to be exact and
then start rotation can be 3 gravity
multiply needs to be about not point 1 7
just so it falls down make sure it plays
on awaken microparticles career roughly
a thousand on a mission
you can put roughly 5 point 5 and keep
everything the same the shape it needs
to be you know a sphere sort of particle
emitter and then the radius can be about
far and you can take the box so the
emitter a random direction now if you
take velocity of a lifetime X can be
minus nor point 5y can be minus 1.5 to
and Zed can be minus 2 point 4 9 as I
said these just affect the way it moves
over its lifetime and limit its velocity
over the lifetime if you tick that box
make sure the speeds about naught point
naught 9 and the dampens not point 4 1
as I say all of these can be change it
just depends what you would like to use
now from here we're gonna actually
create a script which lets us control
when would display this and when we done
because you might not always want it to
be rare and have this effect in front of
your face and I'll show you how to turn
these on and off and do it a car didn't
it now I've downloaded a sort of Rand
asset from the assets star but if you
want to have a tutor on how to make one
I'll go ahead and do that if people want
now I've added a box Collider to this
and just made is trigger so we're gonna
actually use this to trigger when we
want the event to happen now what we're
going to do is create a JavaScript file
and call this raindrops then from there
we'll double-click an open up in
monodevelop
in monodevelop we'll create a variable
called count drops set as
type of particle system then I also have
a function start close the two brackets
add two curly brackets and say kam drops
dot stop with two brackets and then a
semicolon that just make sure that it
stops the particle system when we don't
want it to happen then we're gonna write
another function called function on
trigger enter then open up a brackets
call it call : Collider close that up at
two curly brackets then we'll set if
call dot tag is equal to player then
we'll add two curly brackets underneath
and then we'll say come drop stop play
and to curly band two brackets in the
semicolon we'll copy that one function
pissed in underneath change the on
trigger enter two on trigger exit and
then what we'll do is change come drops
to come drop stop stop like the top
we'll save that out got back into unity
well add the script to the ran particle
effect that we've got now you need to
make sure that you want your particle
system to that script so when you walk
into it it knows what it's doing
and now if I press play you might notice
that it's actually raining currently but
that doesn't really matter
it's just when we walk into the collider
you'll notice that we start getting a
visual effect like you know brain on
maybe some goggles or sunglasses that
your character might be wearing and it
just emits the particle effect in a sort
of random direction now if we walk out
of this Collider you'll notice they then
eventually fades away and only when you
go back in does it actually you know
start beginning again so that's pretty
much the entirety of it just a very
simple script which takes you know when
you enter the collider it starts playing
and when you know it stops and we just
create a basic texture added the
particles shared it to it and then
create a simple particle system which
you can change depending on what you
like you know make a sort of visual
effect that you
need so as ever if you liked the
