tutorial today and it's just gonna show
you how to get back to the legacy
animation system in unity 4.3 it may
have been changed in slightly earlier
versions of unity 4 but I'm not sure but
I added a little bit of a problem myself
because the new animation system I've
not used very much so if you want to
know how to get back to the legacy I'll
quickly show you here now normally what
I do is I sell on that we want to
animate this box you go to window
animation we create a new animation and
we'll just quickly call this something
like move so now what we can do is
obviously scrub across the timeline and
in a second we'll just move the box over
there so it moves just slides across so
that's it so now you've got your move
animation but with the new animation
system especially when you were playing
it to an object there's no just make it
stop playing automatically and things
like that so sometimes you want to go
back to the old animation system until
the developers of unity take the old
system out how you can get there is if
you click on the animation itself that
you've created you click on the little
drop down at the very top here and then
you got it I'll have a ticked on normal
mode if you got a debug mode and you go
see the animation type 2 is the Meccan
in animation system and if you change
that number and make it so it's 1 press
enter and then you just click off your
animation again you'll notice that when
you click back on normal l have gone
back to the legacy system so when you'll
be able to click on your box and you
delete this old animation component off
drag your animation back on and you'll
notice that it's the old system which I
like a lot more because you know you're
going to take place automatically and
you control what elements of animations
you've got on without going into the
external mech and in medicine and
obviously you can always change it back
by going back into that debug option so
that's just a way to get back to legacy
system if you are used to using that
you didn't already know how to get back
there so as ever thanks very much for
watching and don't forget to Like
