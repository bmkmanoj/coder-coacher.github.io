scripting assets for October 2017
I know Borna is the screenshot helper
and it allows you to easily take in-game
screenshots with this tiny tool it works
on mobile desktop and the editor and you
can take a full-screen image take every
proportion of an image or you can take
the image from any of the actual cameras
you've got and number two is we've got
find away the tag editor and you can now
search for game objects with the tag in
both the editor and the play mode and
you can find and move between the
different objects with the same tag
accelerate your searches and you control
the tags quickly and it's compatible
with any version of unity so it makes it
easier so if you've tagged a lot of game
objects which is specific to just being
interactable you can search through
those more easily without having to not
be cumbersome looking through all your
own actual items in the hierarchy number
three is the drawing 2d shapes and this
allows you to create shapes in the unity
editor with a few clicks and you can
create shapes and colliders on the click
using a simple script just with the
mouse as you can see in the video below
and it just with the simple script and a
few and clicking you can create the
custom sort of styles which will be you
viewed accordingly to how they need to
be and before is a nice is the simple
sprite trails and this is a script which
creates weapon trails for 2d games
resulting in a trail which is a static
sprite based below the actual weapon
sprite you can repeat the weapon sprite
at the edge adjustable color and
transparency works in the editor and
runtime any platform whether it be unity
5 our 2017 and you can see the little
examples here which look quite nice and
number five is the VR keys and it's this
is via keys as an open-source keyboard
interface for a single line text input
in VR made specifically in unity works
both with oculus touch in the HTC vive
and it's got a sort of drum style
keyboard effect we used a little sort of
pointers to do it enable or disable
input for validating and submitting the
content that you've got there and
there's demo scene which shows it all
work
and for you to have a little luck and
you can see the little preview at the
bottom here and you can see the sort of
drum style effect that we've got so
these were the top five scripting assets
for October 2017 and I'll put the links
in the description so you can check all
the assets out for this month so thanks
