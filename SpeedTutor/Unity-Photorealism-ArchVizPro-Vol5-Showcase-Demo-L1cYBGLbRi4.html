video today and this is going to be
showcasing the fish and this is going to
be showing the arc vis Pro interior
volume 5 ad vis pro the developer for
this asset has some of the best quality
and architectural visualization projects
that you can find on natural unity star
and he's got a series of as it suggests
5 volumes available you can see the
video playing in the background it'd be
currently sells for around $50 but the
pure level of quality that you getting
with this style content is you will get
over 150 prefabs are fully lit interior
for visualization and it comes with the
fully baked GI and it will come with all
the models post-processing and high
quality textures and you can see the
overall range of models that we have
here and this is your perfect way to
sort of get a good luck on how you can
sell some realistic lighting use all the
post-processing effects and and choose
to use all the environmental effects
that come with unity so without further
ado you can see the scene that's
currently in here we've got a
mountainous sort of snowy background and
we've got the architectural scene here
which is split up into various sections
which comes associated like I said with
all the assets available that you can
see within the scene it comes setup with
all the normal functionality for
realistic lighting so there's the use of
reflection probes area lights and it has
a lot of dynamic elements and supports
everything for VR for use with HTC vive
and things like that and you can see the
entire packages neatly arranged with all
the prefabbed objects set up with all
the textures shaders and the scripts
that are used within the project what
I'll do is give this a little play
around so you can see what's going on so
you can see when I imported this scene
all I need to do was bring it in the
post-processing effects and the standard
assets character just to make it work
and it's the post-processing
for 2,000 17.1 and you consider this is
a bathroom area and we'll move through
and you can see that some of the image
effects that used in this and you can
see that we move into a kitchen area and
into a living quarters and we get a nice
look of the environmental scene in the
background with the lights and stuff as
we move around you can see that we've
got a balcony here looking out towards
our environment that we've got and we've
got a small bedroom and as you can see
that all the assets here are included
one of the best visualizations that you
will find and comes with all the
particles that are associated the
players light the rocks the trees the
mountains all the 3d props that you can
see the furniture and the actual house
itself and you can get a good idea of
actually how everything is actually set
up so you can check out everything on
the first list controller to see how the
actual the post-processing is setup with
a desktop gear VR mobile and VR and this
a bunch of seams associated with the
different things that you will do
whether it's for a VR mobile or the
standard project make sure to check this
out if you're looking to maybe get some
hints and tips on creating the very best
interior lighting that you can possibly
do within unity also look for you might
want to get access to the models that
use because they're extremely high
quality and the developer puts a hell of
a lot of effort into making the quality
that you see here I personally have all
the assets from this developer because M
it does make some of the best assets for
this type of just visualization to get
the best tips and hints on how to make
the best interior lighting within unity
so thanks again for watching don't
