scripting assets for August 2017 now
this is a sort of small one because
there's not as many scripting assets
that I can feature this time so this
time has to be the top five out I'll add
another extra warning just for good luck
this time number one is the AV pro movie
capture free version now this is what
quite a popular asset this is to help
you capture real-time and render output
to AVI and mp4 directly in the engine
and the only difference between the pro
and the free version is that the free
version allows you to record to up to 10
seconds but it has no watermark so this
gives you a little luck on what you can
try and achieve number two is the simple
at Kepler orbits and this allows you to
create a sort of orbiting system around
a particular point or an attractor which
allows you to create planets asteroids
and things like that which will rotate
around a specific place and have
realistic movement and velocity based on
that number three is the in-game
notification system and this is an open
source system which allows you to show
messages when you want similar to Skyrim
in Oblivion and it has transparency
animations text icons and events and you
can shown hide things as appropriate
number four is the clock on Collider
which is a different type of Collider
than you might have already seen the the
default ones that come with unity and
this allows you to career and you can
see the video down the bottom a cone
which is your collision objects which
allows you to set the angle the distance
and whether it's a trigger just like you
would with almost like a spotlight so
you can use like a spotlight trigger or
something like that if you know you're
making like a game where have a
spotlight would search the floor and
would be able to find you and number
five is the prefab manager and this is a
solve allows you to easily pool
different game objects Auto scale from
that improves the performance and spawn
and recycle objects based on the prefabs
that you've got so which allows you to
optimize and make a game mob bomb best
on the prefabs that you've got and
allows you to control everything
and the last one number six is the VR
keyboard which is a really lightweight
sort of UI keyboard that you can use
within your game which you can add a few
things to your object which includes a
few scripts for there are air cast and
you can create yourself a nice little
keyboard to import functionality where
is required so these were the few assets
that had that are available for
scripting assets for August 2017 so I
will leave a link in the description so
you can check out all the assets so
thanks again for watching don't forget
to like come in and subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
