scripting assets for September 2017 so
you seen number 1 is the advanced debug
console and this is something which can
integrate a debug style console within
the application that you build down so I
suggested it's easy to implement it
works on desktop and mobile
it shows debug logs and it'll logs to a
file and it's got a demo for Windows
Android and other things and you can see
in the little video below that you can
bring up this little pop up and you can
see FPS resolution and things just at a
glance without your having to write any
additional stuff and it will show you
the log if you need to just for testing
purposes number two is the loading
screen animation and this package
includes seven different animated
transitions for a loading screen and
it's a drag-and-drop system that allows
you to create a professional-looking
loading screen and you just helps you
save the time and it's a simple way to
use and you just only need to solve have
one line of code to use it and you can
just have different functionality and
animated symbols number three is the
landscape populate er and this asset
suggests that it's an easy way to
generate amazing looking landscapes with
a push of a button I don't know how
effective this actually is based on it
you might want to try it if it's
something that you're looking to just
automatically populate a scene so try it
out and see and let me know what you
think number four is the recorder by
Unity themselves and this hasn't got a
great bunch review so I don't know how
good this actually works recorder that
captures supposedly video and images
during gameplay and can output export to
various different formats and it has a
dedicated recorder window and it can
save images JPEG PNG gif and whatever
else and can serve video files and
number five is the mesh rotator tool
this is essentially a handy tool which
lets you easily rotate the pivot of an
object without your exporting to a 3d
program so if you've ever had it
you've had your pivot in the sort of
wrong area and it's it's not rotating in
the right place so X might be up bar Zed
might be in the wrong direction because
some 3d programs don't have the same as
unity in terms of where the pivots are
angled you can use this tool to easily
manipulate the pivot point without your
having to re export and bring it back in
so I think that's a pretty cool one to
use if you're looking for something to
do that with so I will leave a link in
the description so you can look at all
the free assets for September 2017 so
thanks again for watching and don't
