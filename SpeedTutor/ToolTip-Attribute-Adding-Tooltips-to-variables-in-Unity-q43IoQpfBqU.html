tutorial today and this is going to be a
quick tip video and I'm going to be
showing Martha these and this is going
to be showing you how to add a tool tip
to the inspector or two tool tip to a
variable that you might have which one
to view in the inspector say for
instance we've got our public float
health equal to ten and yeah we'll be
able to see that in the inspector and
that'll be fine I'll just add it to my
player and you can see the health there
and you know nothing really special in
here so what you can start off by doing
is creating two square back brackets
just above your current variable that
you've got then what we can start by
writing is taught it then we can have
two brackets after there and then we can
have something inside course so we can
write whatever we want the tooltip to be
so remember we always have the two
square brackets on the right tooltip we
have the two normal brackets within
quotes we're going to write this is the
variable for the player's health and we
can save that out and if we go back into
unity again and we've gone on we can see
that the same inspector attribute script
is there and we hover over a health you
can see that now we have a taught at
which which actually says what we've
specified this is the variable for the
player's health so that was a really
nice quick way to just add tool tips to
your scripts within unity thanks very
much for watching don't forget to Like
