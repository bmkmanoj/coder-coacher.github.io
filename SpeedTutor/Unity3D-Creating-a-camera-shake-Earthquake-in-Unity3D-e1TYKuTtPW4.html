tutorial today and this is gonna be
about adding a camera shake or an
earthquake style effect to your
character are you camera so you could do
this on trigger or something like that
then it's just something that's a little
simulation for you again so all I've got
in my scene it's just my sample scene
I've got a cube which I'm gonna set to
as my actual trigger you don't have to
have it as a trigger you can just have
it whenever you want to do it but I'm
gonna show you with a trigger so I just
created a box so you know game object
create over then cube and then I just
got rid of the mesh renderer left the
box Collider and I made sure it is
trigger so what I'm gonna do we're gonna
have to write a script straight off so
we're gonna create a new java script and
we're gonna call it camera shake so I'll
open up monodevelop what we're gonna do
is get rid of these and we're gonna make
five variables one variable called
starting shake distance and we're gonna
set that as type float and set equal to
not point eight start with then we're
going to write another variable called
decrease percentage and we're going to
also set that as a type floor and we're
gonna set that as not point five to
start I'm gonna set another variable
called shake speed and again set to
float and say it 250 I'm gonna create
another variable called number of shakes
set that to an integer and then set
equal to 10 then we're going to create
another variable called cam and set that
as type camera so bear some of our
variables for this first bit so what
we're gonna do is write a function
camera
then to brackets then what we're gonna
do I'm to killer brackets here I'm gonna
write four variables inside our function
because we're gonna call the other
things that were made so we're gonna
call hit time as a lot and we're gonna
make that equal to time time I'm gonna
create another variable called original
position and set that as flopped and
make that equal to come dot transform
dot local position dot X with a
semicolon then we'll create another
variable called shake and set that equal
to the number of shakes and then we'll
have another variable called shake
distance and set that as type float and
make equal to starting shake distance so
that's what we've got now so now we're
gonna create a while loop and so we're
going to say while that shake is going
on all do is add two more curly brackets
and we'll say variable timer as flow is
equal is equal to open brackets
timed out the time - hit time close the
bracket it's timed by the shake speed
and then we'll put kam dot transform dot
local position dot X is equal to the
original position Plus math F dot sin or
sine timer closed brackets times by the
actual shake
distance I will put a semicolon there
it's all that does is hit and then it
makes sure the time it starts at 0 and
then it proceeds with changing the
position of our sheykh based on some
math variables so under here all right
if timer is greater than math fpi times
by 2 then we'll like to curl the
brackets under here and say hit time is
equal to time dot time with a semicolon
and then shake distance is times an
equal to decrease percentage and then
we'll say shake - - semicolon which
means if it's below a certain amount
will say that the hit time is equal to
the time that were playing through and
the distance is based off a decreased
percentage and while it's going through
the loop it will make it count down so
the shape gets less each time and then
what we're right down here is yield and
underneath here we'll say gamma dot
transform dot local position dot X is
equal to original position and we can
save that out and go back into unity and
what we can do is on our main camera we
can add the shake script so you can see
it now we'll add I'm income it to the
variable slot and these are parameters
for now so we need to make a new script
which is going to be a JavaScript which
we're gonna call share trigger so this
is gonna go on our trigger to make
they actual actually affect the player
so what we're gonna do is well make a
new private variable called camera shake
all lowercase for this and then we'll
put a call on and then we'll set it to
camera shake and then in the start
function we will say that camera
lowercase shake is equal to game object
to capitals dot find open brackets some
and speech marks main camera dot
getcomponent and then we'll write the
script which is called camera shake with
a semicolon we'll get rid of that update
function on trigger enter open brackets
right collider and the wall sitcom and
then we'll write collider
then we'll add up two curly brackets and
here we'll write if call dot tag is
equal equal to are set to player then we
had to kind of brackets underneath there
we say camera shake
lowercase dot camera shake uppercase
with two brackets and a semicolon which
just means that were making script here
the variable that we found look at the
script here and activate this function
which is going to be the hem do the
check
so if we gone the earthquake trigger and
we add the shake trigger make sure it's
set to its trigger and make sure our
first person controllers sets a player
and Aldo is will walk towards it and
you'll notice that we had a shake when I
walked into it but what you can do to
make the earthquake sort of earthing
more apparent is if you set the
percentage decrease not point nine and
set the number of checks to 30 and then
you go here you'll notice that you get
more shakes before it falls off or you
can do everything like increase in the
share expediate a much more a much more
violent shake but they say you didn't
want the item to fare and fall off too
quickly at all you can increase the
decrease percentage to not point nine
nine walk it to the collider and that'll
last for much longer but of course you
need to increase your number of shakes
for it to last longer so it's all about
the experiment with what you need and
that's what you get
so that's pretty much it that's a way to
show you how to make you camera do
simplistic sort of share which you could
be in turn use for an earthquake getting
shot something like that but that's the
way that you can do it and if you liked
