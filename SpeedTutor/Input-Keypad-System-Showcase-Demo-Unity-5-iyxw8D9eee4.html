the input keypad system that I'm selling
on the asset store and this is just
gonna be a demo and run through the
things that you'll find in the asset so
when you import the asset from the star
is your find materials models prefabs
all ready to go within your scene
scripts sounds sprites all included if
you double-click on the demos demo scene
you will find two keypads two doors and
everything arranged neatly in with a
keypad controller with everything
underneath that and the canvas with
everything underneath that we can show
an example of the test scene we press
play you will drop in with a crosshair
it will turn red when you run the
highlighted object on the keypad when we
get close enough to the keypad we can
press 8 and we will get a keypad UI on
the screen we can press the UI so we
want and we can put a four-digit code in
because that's the maximum the component
for this example press ENTER and nothing
happens because that isn't the right
code we can press clear we can press
escape we can go back on that keypad and
the valid card is 2 to 3 and then we
press enter the doll will open and when
you click off it we won't be able to
interact with that keypad again we can
walk into this other scene and you can
see the valid code is 2 2 2 we can put
anything else drawn we can try and put
extra digits in but it's not possible so
we can just replace 2 2 2 and enter and
a scare and we cannot then re interact
with the items so if I unselect that to
play you can see that on the keypad
controller object that we have got with
the keypad controller script all you can
do is you have to change the valid code
and the character limit so for example I
can put 5 5 5 5 5 here and we need to
make sure the character limit is
actually 5 so we can't go beyond that
value so when I go to this star I can
try to 2 2 3 again won't do anything so
need five this many times and then it'll
work for that instance and you can add
multiple keypads to one scene you can
just duplicate the first one you have
and it should increment it nicely so you
can get your own easy adding multiple
per scene you kind of add as many as you
want and edit those on the flight just
in the same way you just need to add
whatever objects you need to the scripts
and the scripts are easily modifiable
for use in unity 5 so this was just a
brief overview of the system so I hope
you liked it and if you have any
problems or suggestions please feel free
to send me an email or a message on
YouTube and I will go into possibly
adding that for the system and the
system includes full documentation for
use with setting everything up and using
it within game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
