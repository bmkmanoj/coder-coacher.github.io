fast detail on how to make sure that you
can always go backwards in 3dsmax
because often the default for undoing in
3ds max might be set to 10 or something
like that but sometimes on the odd
occasion you might make a mistake and
you might forget to go back and you
really want to book when she steps back
I finished what can you do he can't do
anything about it you have to start over
so what you could do something really
easy to do is you can go customize at
the top of 3ds max menus go to
preferences and what you can do is you
see a little button on the general tab
it's called seen undo and you can set
the levels to whatever you want so I
don't know I can't remember what the set
as default possible around 10 so for me
I set to 100 you can make it performance
a little bit dodgy if you've got too
high because it has to save that in
memory but I don't usually have to go to
100 steps back but just for peace of
mind
you can set 20 50 whatever you want but
something really easy if you make a
mistake you've got no worries if you
need to go back and you press or care
and it'll always remember every time you
boot up max so that's what we're all
really</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
