tutorial today and today we're going to
be looking at what a lot of people have
been asking me it's within 2d or within
mobile games is how to go and do a
trigger enter our collision event so
that might be changing your level or
doing things like that so first of all
I've got a basic 2d scene set up within
unity I've just got some basic floor
pieces so the character will stand on it
I have got the default one of the
characters from the standard assets that
comes with the unity and one thing I
will care to mention is if you've made
your own custom one or if it might not
be already you need to make sure that
your character is tagged of player and
you always need to make sure that either
your player or your trigger or your
collision object has a rigid body and in
2d if you're familiar with it it's going
to be a rigidbody 2d so as long as you
play as got one on because it needs to
be affected by gravity and things like
that that'll be absolutely fine
now to go about doing your collision
event we can go to the object sprite and
we can create a new sprite and call this
we'll call it new scene trigger doesn't
really matter what we call it so in the
inspector we can give a sprite and I'm
just going to use the pink crate so we
can see it really easily I am just going
to move this down sort of towards my
flower I guess then what I'm going to do
for this is I'm going to add a component
and I'm going to add a box Collider 2d
seekin search in this actual search bar
box collider 2d because that's what we
need on it then we're going to say is
trigger and then what we're going to do
from here is going to create a new
script we can either create it in
c-sharp or JavaScript for this I'm going
to create a JavaScript file so we'll
call this trigger
event will open up in monodevelop or
whatever application you've got to do
your scripting and once we're there what
we'll do is we'll delete the two
starting functions and we'll start by
writing function on trigger enter to D
then we're going to open up the brackets
and say call kohalon Collider 2d close
that up add two curly brackets below
then we'll say that if call dot compare
tag open brackets in court player close
the brackets and the courts up will have
two curly brackets below there and then
we can do whatever we want so we wanted
to move the level so we'll say
application dot load level and then in
brackets we'll call this level and then
put a semicolon we need a variable at
the top so our variable called level as
type string with a capital and then
we'll save that out and we'll move back
into unity we'll go on our new scene
trigger event we'll place that script
onto the object
we'll set a new level we want to go to
right what I want to do is create a
quick new scene I'll save the previous
scene this is just blank and what I'll
do is I'll go save scene as now you can
see my 2d scene is there 2d collision
enter 2d scene - we'll call this and you
can see we're in Sudi scene - now or go
back to 2d collision enter will write in
the Box here 2d scene - because that's
where we want to move we'll go to file
build settings we'll make sure that both
levels are in the build settings and now
when we enter this collision you can see
I'm playing my game and enter the
collision and I moved to the new scene
and you can do whatever else you want as
long as you have ontriggerenter 2d and
collider 2d so thanks very much for
watching
don't forget the light come to subscribe
