looking at bringing the Survival Series
from unity 4 to unity 5 now this is not
going to be a look at changing the
script or the script for the character
Martin not existing on the unity 5
controller what we're going to do is
we're going to look at two ways of say
you've been working in unity fine you
want to bring this opportunity 5 we're
going to look at upgrading your project
and helping you upgrade any sort of
project and giving you sort of details
on doing that and also if you want to
follow the Survival Series you can I'll
actually upload the unity 4 character
controller pack for you to easily
important to unity 5 so you can carry on
following the tutorials exactly as I
have done them because I haven't an
awful lot of time to look into what's
changed in the character controller in
unity 5 and editing all my script so
what we're gonna do is once you open
unity 5 for the first time you're gonna
want to open other so what we're gonna
do from open other I've got a folder
called unity 5 and what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna select my survival island game
there's gonna be my unity far specific
package now I'm gonna then select that
file and it's gonna ask me to upgrade
this is a backup of my version in unity
Foss always make sure that you've got
backup first just make a new folder and
copy and paste a new version in so if
you upgrade it and it messes it up we
won't have any problems and then what
you want to do is just update that and
run through let unity just do what it
needs to do and in this we're gonna look
at changing the sky box because
sometimes it causes an issue looking at
the differences in the render settings
setting the lighting paths from if it's
was forward or deferred rendering using
how it renders it on the graphics card
so unit if I used to be DirectX 9 we're
going to be looking at DirectX 11
and you can say that I made a backup so
go ahead and just compile everything for
me and then I'll be back once we've
finished this compilation okay so now
what we've opened this up in unity 5 and
it looks let's say somewhat similar to
how it functioned before now there's
gonna be some things that messed up and
it might look a bit a little bit crazy
so if I play the game now you'll notice
that we don't particularly have any
errors but we're gonna have some sort of
visual bugs going on that we need to
sort of address through this video so
people have been mentioning that the the
some areas with the character controller
and the scripts with that but now if you
use the Unity for character neutral you
actually get any problems so as a
workaround for everybody is that I will
provide the the actual character
controller pack and you will have it in
your standard assets and these one these
ones like in unity for now we're going
to sort out these little issues that
we've got so far so what you want to do
first off is go to you want to go to the
light mapping all the lighting tab so
you can go window and lighting when it's
called light mapping because it's coming
from a unity 4 now what we want to do is
want to add a different skybox
now I might make another tutorial on how
to add a custom skybox in unity 5 but if
I search skybox and I'm gonna put the
default skybox in and it will clear a
lot of the massive issues that we had
first off really then what we could do
is we can add directional light as the
Sun we can as the ambient sauce as the
skybox and we'll get some more shadows
you can leave article where the ambient
intensity maybe just leave up for this
you can probably take the reflection
bounces down we can add precomputed GUI
I'll probably do disregard the bake GUI
for now set the resolution to 1 make
sure that there
is for the general GI you can leave the
fog disabled or enabled but this fog
works slightly differently in unity 5
than it did in unity 4 so we might want
to switch that off for now
and the main things that we were
concerned about we want to make sure
that we would go back to the inspector
tab we want to make sure that our
directional light is real-time and we
can leave the intensity and such by
itself we make sure to Rend static if it
wasn't already now what we might want to
do is go into edit project settings and
then player we might want to change our
rendering path here to forward or
deferred rendering make sure that it is
a non legacy so maybe if we change it to
deferred or you can leave as fallible
people leave it as forward for this now
it says at the top it's usually directs
DirectX 9 you can use direct3d 11 so if
you apply that and say well yeah we'll
save the scene out it'll then be using
DirectX 11 if you've got a graphics card
that supports that because that's a
newer version to support any graphics
now we can also go to edit project
settings and quality now I had this on
fastest before so we had no shadow so if
you've got a problem there you can turn
it to fantastic and you will get the
shadows again now it strangely flip that
upside down and that's probably because
I've got a camera effect so if you've
gone the first-person controller now to
your main camera I might want to get rid
of the Sun shaft and the fast bloom we
could do is we could leave the Sun
shafts or take those aware fast bloom
makes its switch upside down I'm not
really sure why that's doing that but
that's all I care for now but if we want
to have a look at playing the game it'll
sort out a quite a few issues that we
previously had and it looks it looks
fairly nice and also you might want
to use continuous baking make sure that
your lighting tab continuous baking is
enabled some of these objects we don't
we make sure that we don't want to be
static because they're going to move now
I've got a little issue with some of my
palm trees
now that might have been sorted in the
if the person who's made the tropical
nature pack updates at f-- unity five
but you may need to bring those in again
if you're having problems with some of
the issues with the things themselves
now now with continuous baking on its
brightened everything up slightly and
now we get some nice not so dark shadows
in the areas so we can probably decrease
the indirect intensity if we need to but
on our directional light we might want
to make sure the intensity isn't quite
as high so it's 1.76 if I take that back
down to one that might be more
beneficial to us all now you can enable
fog again but you might want to
experiment with what actually works
because maybe I'm using the fog and
correct me and if anybody knows how to
use it properly
I might look into it more detail but it
seems to be doing it in a different way
to how it normally expects that I want
the fog to be back here rather than very
close to you know our player so if we
adjust the start and end values we can
get if we just the N value we get the
fog back there I can't seem to make it
affect anything down there maybe it's an
issue with me but something might you
might want to test for yourself but if
we leave that off for now and we test
the game we'll get everything you know
from how we wanted it in unity 5 so from
unity 4 to 5 yes we are missing some
trees and things like that you might
want to tweak some terrain settings if
you need to so if you go on you to rain
and
the terrain is using the built-in legacy
material now what you might want to do
is you make it use the built-in standard
so if you adjust that you can add your
own material into the settings so you
can add your own material to use the
standard shader for any materials that
you might be using so if we've painted
on the sand we can edit the text just
accordingly and it'll be using the
standard shader
so the physically best stuff will
actually work more efficiently so really
that's the base of going from unity 4 to
5 especially with the suvival series we
just had to tweak a lot of different
things we had to make sure that the
lighting was all functioning correctly
we had to make sure we had a new skybox
so any graphical issues we had made sure
that the real-time global illumination
was enabled we had the Settings app on
off using a different version of DirectX
and just tweaking some settings now of
course like I said if you've got any
problems with using the character
controller from unity 5 use the unity
fallen for this series and then when I
get chance to editing my scripts I'll
make sure that I get round to you know
tweaking it for unity 5 but again if
you've got any tree packs you might want
to see if the developers updated it so
it works with unity five better or maybe
reom part everything and apply it to
your terrain again I know that's not the
best way to go but when you're moving
from one build of an engine from Unity 4
to 5 you're gonna get some issues and
not all of them can be sorted so all in
all it looks you know somewhat to back
away we were so hopefully it will get
back into the series but I'll continue
development in unity far but hopefully
this helps some people out with the
development in unity 5 so thanks again
