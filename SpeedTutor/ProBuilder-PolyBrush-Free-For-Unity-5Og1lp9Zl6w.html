today and this is some news that was
released by unity on the 15th to
February 2018 and it shows that ProBuild
poly brush and progress are available
for free across five point six and above
and will be integrated as 2018
rolls out and becomes out of beta and
into the sought further release down the
line and if you don't have a you know
self fully focused idea on what actually
any of these are unity have acquired
these fairly popular assets which allow
you to do a lot of differentiate and
functional it's because unity trying to
bring as many different assets and
workflows technologies into unity to
make it almost like a one-stop shop for
being able to whether it be do your
modeling texturing and your game engine
work directly inside unity these things
will never replace a traditional 3d
program because the very powerful and
what they do but these assets can help
you go a long way so probability is
essentially it's a unique sort of hybrid
between design tools modeling tools
where you can make advanced basic he can
extrude and you can make things from
simple to more advanced and you can even
edit the UVs
with directly into the engine and you
can see some examples just down here
where you can make stairs ships and
different ideas just with an easy
interface just directly inside unity so
you never even need to use a 3d program
if you're not confident a few popular
games use this like super hot use pro
builder to build most of this of basic
style meshes that are featured in the
game and the second one is poly brush
and this enables you it's almost a
sculpting painting and scattering tool
which allows you to sculpt on geometry
like you can see down here you can add
vertex paint two meshes and you can
blend textures and paint surface details
so if that be rocks plants whatever
similar to what we'd see in a terrain
are a classic soft sculpting program
like a ZBrush or a sculptress which
allows you to have
much more functionality in terms of
controlling helm meshes work of course
these would be required to be higher
polygon meshes just like a terrain they
allow you to extend things and not have
to be constrained with an actual terrain
you can have it on just smaller objects
that you can make yourself a let's
imagine this object a rock and you could
paint this and you could deform the
geometry in such a way that it makes it
quite easily it isn't the beta but if
it's something you're looking for you
should check it out and there's one more
thing which is called progress and
progress is as functional and visual
sort of grid layup system which allow
you to snap and place objects around the
world I'm really good for prototyping or
even helping you just I'll build your
levels up if you're doing a modular
workflow and you can check out this page
and it will give you all the details on
the road map of how unity intend to
integrate them and where to get the
assets in the future so you can check
all of these out on the unity assets
start on the free and available for fun
unity 5.6 and above and they're all free
and ready for you to start messing
around with holly brush requires 2000
17.1 per grids again requires 5.6 so
it's good to see more and more assets
coming out from unity and trying to
extend the engine and make it more easy
for developers so I check this out and
see what you think thanks for watching
doctorates are like gonna subscribe
Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
