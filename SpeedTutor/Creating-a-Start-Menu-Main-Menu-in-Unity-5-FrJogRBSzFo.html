tutorial today and this is going to be
showing you how to make a menu in unity
5 now my background is only terrain and
I've got a camera which has a few image
effects on and it's got a blur image
effect so this is going to be sort of
you can put anything in your menu it
could be just something blank this is
just going to be our background so to
start off with what we want to do is go
game object UI and go image so we're
going to start with an image I'll go
into the scene view if you need to on
your scene view you can click 2d and it
will go into the 2d view and you might
need to zoom in or zoom out you can
select the move tool if you can select
the image and you press F it'll zoom
into it and then we might want to scale
out so we can see the bounding box which
is the actual UI that we're going to be
able to see we want to be able to we'll
adjust this x and y position at the top
to zero zero so it's centralized what we
can do is we can we're going to put
picture in or an image it could be text
but I'll give you this example so I'm
going to import a new asset and I'm just
going to import my speed shooter logo
that we're going to use and when you
bring in any sort of image if it needs
transparency you want to make it a
sprite 2d and UI and then it will hold
the transparency for you we can go back
on the image on the canvas drag the logo
or whatever image you might have into
the source image slot we go into the
game view and you can see it there in
the middle what I'm going to do is I'm
going to set the width and height to
maybe 250 and 250 and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to drag this up
to maybe the top corner here so now we
have it we're going to have a just a
u-turn menu coming down here now what we
can do from here is if we select canvas
again and we go game object UI we want
to add a button so we can add a button
and we can drag this over to next to
where our images we can click back on
the game
tap and we can see that it's there so we
stick in the scene we can set maybe the
width to let's say two to five I might
set the height to 40 just to be a little
bit different so we can move that into
place so just sort of maybe at the
middle of the logo that we've got you
can you know arrange this however you
want now there's our button in the game
view if we go on to the button here and
when we click the drop-down we can go to
text and we can change this text to
whatever you want on the right hand side
in the inspector so I'm going to name
this new game now if i zoom in a little
bit on the scene view where you can
potentially change the font size so we
can set this to 20 I'll go into the game
view you can see it there twenties looks
quite nice we can keep them everything
the Sailor for now when we play the game
you might notice that it does not think
it doesn't really do anything
interesting you might have noticed that
we went in when we went into the game
it sort of centralized it in a weird
m-may position what we can do is we can
actually change the anchor point to
Center and then we can change it to the
top left if we click on that box here
and we can do the same for the button we
can set it to top left now if we now
press play it will be positioned toward
the top left of that space that we've
got we could drag these two down and
potentially just pull them out a little
bit and we can see what it looks like
that looks nice there what we can do
from here is if we select the button
I'll do is I'll rename this new game BTN
for new game button and what I can do is
I can change the color if I wanted of
the actual and thing that we've got but
we can do down here over the button is
we can have the normal color
so we click normal color and we click
the little colored wrapper we can maybe
select the color that we might want and
I'll select maybe that blue maybe I'll
select the lighter blue for this and
then one might want to do is on my one
select a highlighted color and I'll
select maybe a portion of this orange
then now we can really see the text
color very well so what we could do is
we could go on the text and choose the
color and make it more towards white and
then if we press play again we can get
you know different colored button here
what we could potentially even do is
change the highlighted color to a
slightly darker orange so it contrasts a
little bit better with the white that we
have so we're just matching up a sort of
consistent style with how we want what
we could append potentially do is close
it up we could duplicate that button and
rename this exit game
BTN if we wanted to and we could
potentially pull this down by a certain
amount roughly there and what we could
do is we could offset these buttons and
however we like so we could I could
leave new game about that I could offset
inset the exit button to here and maybe
I could pull these two down a little bit
away from the actual logo itself and
then we can get a difference we can go
on the exit button go on the text and we
can change this to exit gate and we can
press play and we'll get exactly the
same thing here and here so what we can
do is we can create a simple script
sceners that we've created two buttons
so I'll do this right-click C sharp
scripts and we'll call this button
manager and then I'll open up this in
Visual Studio whatever programming and
edits that you've got
now what I like to do is pull these
curly brackets down I'll get rid of
whatever's at the beginning what we can
do is prayer a public void and we'll
call this new game BTN so this is the
function we're going to create and then
in brackets I'm going to write string
and new game level and then under here
we'll have two curly brackets and going
to do something in there so we're doing
is we're creating a public function
called new game button and then we're
passing in to that function the name of
the string that we're going to want to
load so to actually use something in
unity 35.3 and above we actually need to
use a different way to load the actual
game and we're going to use something at
the top below the collections or in
between we can say using unity engine
dot scene management with a semicolon
now that's fine once we're in here we
can say that scene manager and if we
don't have this reference at the top we
won't get scene manager to be able to
access and we can say 'lord scene and
then open brackets whatever we had in
here so the string that we had his new
game level and then we can put a
semicolon at the end so we can save that
out and this is going to allow us to do
a button press so once we've got that
what I can do is I can close that up and
what I will do is I will create an empty
game object by right-clicking in the
hierarchy create empty and then what
we'll do is we'll call this button
manager object what I'm going to do is
I'm going to drag the button manager
into there this is just so we can keep
it all nicely arranged so if I close
everything up you can see everything and
nice and neat if we got on to the new
game button and we click the little plus
we'll get an on-click event which we'll
be able to do at vernon time and click
and do whatever we need to do as long as
it's written in script so what can do is
we can add
the button manager object into there we
can select whether it's well what it's
going to be using so we need to go to
the button manager script that we
created and we want to run the function
which is called new game button in
brackets string what we actually set in
the script so then we can write in
whatever seems we may have created so
from here I just save this scene make
pressing ctrl s and it saved out this as
menu you might want to do file save
scene as if you need to do that what we
can also do is create a new scene and I
will save this out again as the example
and call it level one I'll go back into
the menu I'll go fail build settings and
we need to add menu and level one to the
build settings then we'll be able to
access them we can go back into the
canvas onto the new game button and
where it says the on click event when we
wanted to put our new game soft string
will click level alright in level one so
movies then save this scene we can press
play and you can see that it's running
in the background as it was you can see
new game and eggs again we can press new
game will learn to scene nicely
perfectly just using a simple line if
you want to be able to exit the game we
can go back into the button manager we
can do another public function that
we're going to be able to access tool
safe public void exept game BTN with two
brackets and then two curly brackets
below the or gives you this time is the
old way to access or to quit the
application so you do application dot
quit with two brackets and a semicolon
so that makes it all nice and neat to be
able to do that and just as we did
before we can select the exit game
button we can have an on click event we
can add the game button manager the
butter manager object we can select the
button manager and we can show
use exit game button now for the sake of
this you would have to build your game
out to be able to exit the application
because when we press it in the editor
it doesn't actually do anything it just
sort of hangs a little bit because it's
expecting to do something but it can
because it's not built out now obviously
this is that's pretty much everything
for just adding a couple of buttons to
your canvas having adding an image and
having a simple script which controls
whether you know you can going to move
scene are you going to quit you can
obviously add a couple more buttons to
your scene really easily you can
duplicate the new game button again we
can go back into the scene view you can
grab that exit button just pull it down
a little bit we can grab the new game
button cold ice load game button and I
could potentially pull that down pull
that across have the exit game button
pull it up and across like that we could
rename the load game button to just log
game and then we could just like we did
before
add another public void load game button
and we can put whatever script we need
to do in there and in the game view
because they all share this exactly the
same sort of mirrored copy they're all
exactly the same and they're all you
know perfectly to however you want to
style you buttons in the future but this
is just an extremely simple way to you
know create a few buttons on the UI and
set some styles that you want with the
highlighted and the norm change in the
text color the sizes scaling buttons up
remember not to scale buttons using the
actual scale or it will make the text in
itself very blurred because you're
scaling up not the correct way you need
to use the width and height based on the
UI elements or become very blurred and
hard to see and then in your text you
can change the font size you can change
the font type you can change the text
that's displayed you can set whether
it's center-aligned a lots of
things that you can do but like I said
this is just a simple way to create self
very basic menu and maybe of people
wanting it I can go into showing you how
to do more advanced menu whether that
would be a confirmation box to say yes
or no whether you want to stand on you
again exit the game maybe a simple
options menu things like that but this
is just to get everybody started so
thanks very much for watching don't
