how to push rigidbody our physics
objects within unity 3d and this is all
about having you know you character
controller and having the ability to as
long as these objects have got rigid
bodies you'll be able to push them over
with a certain force and it's quite good
you know to add a bit of realism to your
game now it requires one fairly simple
script and you just need to make sure
that you have the right elements I'm
going to show you here
so in my scene you know you may have
seen this scene before with my scene
character controller just my standard
lights now for three barrels in the
scene now I'm going to select each one
of these barrels because they're exactly
the same and then what I'm going to do
is actually go to component physics and
then add mesh Collider to each of them
now when I play this actually before I
do I'll go also go component physics and
rigidbody now if I play this they would
all fall through the actual flaw which
is no good you don't still falling
through the floor and that's because the
collider isn't big enough so if we take
them both to convex on the mesh Collider
you'll notice the dirt fall through the
floor anymore so you need to make sure
that when you put a rigidbody on an
object if the collide is not big enough
say if you added a box Collider or a
sphere player then it would be big
enough because it would you know go out
the boundaries but as long as we take
convex now once you have all your
physics colliders and your mesh
colliders on that will actually start
creating the scripts if you create new
and then JavaScript and we'll call this
object physics and then we'll open up in
monodevelop
and when that's open up what we'll do is
we'll delete these two lines and we'll
save variable push power is equal to 2.0
and then we'll write a function called
on controller Collider hit all words
having capitals and then we'll open
brackets say
then call on controller collider hit
again and then we'll close that brackets
we'll open up the two curly brackets and
say variable body and then call on rigid
body equals a hit
dot Collider dot a rigid body and then
we'll write a semicolon then we'll say
under here is if body is set to or equal
to null we're going to add to UM solve
line breaks I don't actually know what
you call these but next to your shift
key and next to Zed if you hold shift
and then press the kappa key next is
edge you'll add these two sections and
then we'll say body dot is kinematic
close those brackets underneath we'll
say return with a semicolon
then underneath we'll see if hit dot
move Direction is less than minus not
point three close the brackets then
we'll also say return then we'll say
rather a variable called push died for
to push direction and then have that set
to vector three and have it equal to
vector three open brackets hit dot move
Direction dot X comma zero comment hit
dot move Direction not said cause the
brackets in the none a semicolon and
then we'll say under there is body dot
velocity equals push Direction times by
I could find the star
power so what this means is we set a
push power of the beginning now also it
was saying that if the controller
Collider so the woman year F guest
controller hits an attached rigidbody
then if it's null if it doesn't hear
anything we're not going to do anything
and if you movement Direction is this a
written return the value and then the
push direction is the direction of
moving in and then the power is the
power at which we push the object so
we'll make sure we save that I made a
mistake here and I need to have hit hit
move Direction dot why it's less than -
not point three on the first person
troll you can now add the object physics
and then we've got push power so you can
change that so if we play the game
you'll notice that and run into these
and I can push each of these objects
down and then I could push them around
you could change the mass of the actual
object so change the mass to something
like I don't know not point two for that
object
now push this one over now what we'll do
we'll be able to push this other one
over easier than the other two because
it's got less mass to it but I'll keep
everything at one the so that's pretty
much it for actually making objects or
physics objects fall over or and be
pushed by you character
I've actually got another tutorial
coming up that if the object falls over
then it will actually make a sound fact
but this is all where I have for now
thanks very much for watching don't
forget if you like the tutorial like
