about substance painter and what
actually is substance painter and why it
might help you so I will give put some
things in the background to show you
some of the content that are made from
some of the biggest triple-a companies
and I'll just go through exactly what
the whole idea of PBR substance and what
it can help you achieve on a day-to-day
basis
so if you're somebody who wants to take
the quality of their game to the next
level you're interested in 3d art and
maybe you've not used a texturing piece
of software like substance painter
before I can't recommend it enough
because it's truly a one-stop shop for
all your texturing needs when it comes
to making us an asset within a 3d
program you can bring it straight into
substance painter you can bag any of the
high polygon meshes that you might have
to bake the textures all within the
program then you can just like you would
with a standard Photoshop with all the
layers you have you can paint you can
apply scratches masks grunge's dirt
whatever it needs to be to specific
parts of that model just to breathe
extra life into something that you might
have originally been a flat texture on
your model you can actually make it look
like it's truly something that you would
see in the real world so the whole idea
behind this program is to streamline the
whole efforts of texturing rendering
applying all the different effects and
the whole idea of a PBR workflow is it's
classed as physically based rendering
and physically rendering is when you get
a material or a texture and you ask them
in such a way that they are based on
real-life values because you will get
any item in the real world and it will
have specific metallic values and so on
that react in a certain way to light if
you've got a piece of metal it will be
have high reflectance because it's a
metal at the end of the day and then
you'll have something that's a lot done
alike is something like a wood and it
wouldn't
have as high reflectivity and there's a
lot of different things that you can
glean from real life and it allows them
to work in lots of different lighting
scenarios which means that no matter
where you put your asset whether it's a
swamp a forest a desert anything like
that it will always look like it should
in no matter which place you do it and
such big triple-a companies like Ubisoft
games like from Naughty Dog like
Uncharted so many big titles have used
the software and if you truly want to
take a step into using what Elwood
professionals tend to use it's something
that you will want to look at using and
it has all support integrated in all of
the big game engines like unreal unity
and so on and with the most recent
update of 2018 point 1 they've
streamlined the user interface so you
can customize the layout as you see fit
hide things away which you don't need
and just make it an experience that's
really helpful for you I'll never go
back to using another program because
it's so unbelievably streamlined the
straight forward you can bring in your
model apply materials that you might
have got from the big stars from
algorithmic who make the software
themselves they've got something called
substance sauce and it has thousands of
materials that you can pre apply whether
that be metals wards leathers cloths and
from various other avenues you can get
hold of materials and you can really
take things to the next level so
hopefully if you haven't tried be sure
to check out the 30-day trial for
substance painter is such an awesome
program so be sure not to miss out
