models for unity for February / March of
2018 and number one is the battle ready
sword which requires 2000 17.1 and it's
a free model which as it's jess is an
FBX model with materials for the handle
the blade and the sheath with a texture
folder and a presentation and you can
see it here and number two is the
Kessler Natura and it's a sort of pack
of natural objects which consists of 95
objects 65 bushes 28 trees 12 leaf
materials background textures and
there's a lot of different different
assets that are in this pack and you can
see from the images and the quick video
below and number three is the medical
salt which is a fairly realistic looking
3d model around 1000 polygons with 1000
by 1000 textures and it looks a pretty
high detailed PBR looking asset and
again we've got a ball which is a pair
of players which is called some players
which is 582 two phases in FBX by a
thousand 22 for once again which is
another quite a nice-looking asset and
the next one is something called bulk
container and it's another free 3d model
with about 5000 faces which includes the
palette the rack and the box all with
separate objects with 4,000 by 4,000
texture now with an FBS farmer and it
looks like the same person has made all
of these assets for free so check them
out if you're interested and the next
one from the certain developer is the
old USSR lump and again this is about
1,000 faces FBX with 2k the next one is
something called PBR cardboard box and
as it suggests is a cool-looking PVA a
box with one model one material -
prefabs and demoscene and what can we
say is a fairly looks like a fairly low
poly asset and if you need to just add
some boxes to your scene this might be
perfect for you and the next one is
something that called the troll cannibal
and this model what is suitable for any
types of mobile or PC game and
it's a mesh with about with around nine
point nine thousand tries it comes with
a set of animations which include idle

type of enemy or playable character
within your game and this next one is
the benches free pack and it requires
2073 and it uses the standard shader and
it's a collection of benches with
calendars and prefabs which includes six
models of different benches with love
poly between 500 and 3000 triangles and

related textures is called wooden
barricades and wooden barricades is just
to spice up your environment yes again
and includes a FBX model with 2 K by 2 K
PNG with a demo scene and it just
includes two variants of wooden
barricades which again can be great too
if you've got them in like a little RPG
sort of game and the next one is the
simple city pack plane and you can buy
the full complete city pack available if
you're looking to get something mob but
here's a sample of it which includes one
sidewalk grass and Street a streetlight
six buildings large trash bin Coke
machine tree and a sort of potted plant
and the next one is a something called
lamp model and as it suggests is it's a
bedside table and lump or will pay for
perfect for any sort of situation and it
includes the lump bedside and textures
with up to four K and the drawers are
separate objects so you can interact
with them and I'm gonna let them and it
might be good for any type of
visualization and the next one is
something called destructible wooden
fence and it's a customizable
indestructible beam fence and every
piece is destructible and allows you to
be have three mixed panel designs one
