tutorial today and this is going to be
showing you basically how to move scenes
in unity 5.3 and above I had an old
tutorial that you might see on the
channel by a link to any we're showing
you how to do the old version to move
scenes and you need to use something
called scene management and we will do
that simply in a couple of lines so and
in the basic scene what I'm going to do
is I'm going to get rid of the main
camera and I'm just going to throw our
first person controller into the scene
so now when we go into the game view
we'll be able to just walk around a
little bit and you can bring that in by
going to your standard assets characters
and bring it in right click and import
custom and then characters right here so
we've got a scene and we need to be able
to do a way to move a scene this could
be any number of ways but the most
common way pose is to walk into a
collider so what you can do is you can
create a cube or whatever you want is
game object 3d object and cube but I'm
just going to duplicate the cube I
already have so I'm just going to
duplicate my cube by pressing control D
and I'm just going to bring it in front
of the other cube a little bit and I'm
just going to make it a little bit
bigger so this is going to be the cube
that I'm going to use as a trigger I'm
going to on this side and you can see on
the box Collider or set to is trigger
and then what we can do is going to
start by writing the script because we
set it to his trigger so we'll be able
to walk into it and trigger it so we'll
choose c-sharp script and call this move
scene we'll double click and open up in
monodevelop or visual studio and then
what you have what I'll do is I'm going
to get rid of the two and methods that
start off so we've got a first class
initial class that we're going to use so
when you want to use it you're going to
want to start by writing on the top one
we're going to want to use some soft
collections we're going to be using
Unity engine dots scene management with
the semicolon then we can access the
collections that are there so we can do
that type of
think so from Hylton point on trigger
Enza then we can write and Collider and
other and then below here we can then by
saying that if other dots
compare tag is in brackets in quartz of
those brackets will say player then the
law here were like two more curly
brackets and then will say and scene
manager got Lowe's theme open brackets
and then we can say something like we
can write our own variable called load
level bow will that will create a
variable first for them so we'll do
inside here just above the actual method
that we created we'll call this we'll
start by writing a thriver string load
load level with a semicolon because
that's private we want to be able to see
in the inspector but we don't need it to
be public because we don't need any of
the script to access it so we'll put in
square brackets serialized field before
and then just means it's going to be
visible in the inspector we need to
write what we're looking for in there
sore right load level and then we just
want to add a semicolon on the end so
we're doing is writing a simple
ontriggerenter
we're looking for and the other type of
collider within that if the thing that
collides with the trigger that we've got
then we'll load it whatever scene we
need to so what we'll do is we'll go
into here we will select our trigger we
will add our move cube there you can see
that we can write in whatever level that
we're going to want to go to one we do
is I'm going to save out this C so I
save seen as and what we're going to do
is you're going to save this as we'll
save this as level one and you can see
is that and we can see level one at the
top there what I'll do is with a
duplicate level one
and then it's going to automatically
increment at their level 2 so what we
then need to do is go off tail build
settings and add level 1 and add level 2
in there
what we can do from there is to like
back on you trigger that we're going to
be able to collide with and then remove
see you're going to want to write level
2 as it's spelled in the project panels
down here so we can say level 2 what I
will do inside level 2 I'll double click
it and I'll press save so it saves at
level 1 level 2 I don't want to have
that trigger
we'll make this box really tall so we
can obviously see that we've moved to
under the scene so we'll go back into
level 1 by double click it and it will
press save so now we're in level 1 again
we've got on a trigger with our simple
script but one one thing to mention
before we test this is if you click on
your FPS control and it doesn't have an
attack of player that might be something
that you're having an issue with so if
we press play you can see that this is
our trigger here now we run into that
and we move to our next scene so that
simple script just allows us to move
with the C major load scene and the
level that we're going to call we just
have to use the unique election
reference or put a top and to get some
things that we need to and I'll is it
you can put on the trigger you can doing
the start function you can do it however
you need to that's just a simple way to
move to another scene as long as you've
got it in your build settings and your
player is actually packed player so
