extensions for February March 2018 so
number one is something called folder
creator and this year allows you to
easily create folders within unity and
it doesn't just mean that you can create
folders directly in the editor which
would go into say just the assets folder
of your unity and sort of package you
can create folders anywhere and it just
allows you to do that number two is the
color picker utility so this allows you
to easily pick a color from unity
without your having to switch to other
programs and sort stuff out you can go
by hex code color and RGB just for ease
of access to solve easily go to one
little window which you can dock
somewhere if you're changing a lot of
color and palettes sort of values
throughout your game and you can copy
those values really easily and it'll
just save you time in the long run the
next one is something called Cena
manager utility and this is allows you
to easily have another menu which just
pops onto another window and allows you
to manage everything and all the scenes
that you might have open and close
scenes delete scenes duplicate apply
bore captioners and adjust settings
without you having to search through
folders and look where they put this
scene up or you know why do I need to go
from there you just get a selection of
what seems you have and bulk actions to
do with those scenes so this might be
another utility that really helps you
out and the next one is called something
called block out or light and this
allows you to um essentially just block
out areas and it's a collection of
prototyping tools for unity which speed
up the creation of mock-ups and testing
and it allows you to build just a
selection of simple geometry with
prefabs and just allows it to be
expandable and simple icon with 132
assets ranging from various polygons and
it allows you to with special transform
controls grid snapping a ruler and loads
of different ways to just snap things
together so you can get a basic layout
of you scene really easily and the next
one is multi edit tools and this is
a cool script which has a bunch of tools
integrated and as it suggests in the
description if you want to rename a
thousand objects at once you can do that
maybe you want to rename a specific just
child object or even partially rename
something you can create and revert
multiple copies of prefab at once you
can remove rigid bodies from as many
objects as you need to it's just got a
lot of functionality built in and there
might be something which you want to add
to your scene to allow you to just bulk
edit objects just on the fly without you
having to click through individually if
you've got a lot of the same except the
next one which is quite a cool one it's
called shift move clone objects and
similar to how you would in a 3d program
like 3ds max you hold shift and then you
move your movement gizmo and then you
will be able to duplicate an object and
it works quite well in a 3d program for
things like unity press control D
usually duplicate and if you just on the
move tool anyway this might be one way
you can hold shift and you just move it
across and you duplicate it really
easily so then you get things in
increments and it might be quite good
for you and another one is pro builder
which was recently bought by unity which
is another really powerful asset for
blocking out and modeling d even doing
UVs and things like that and it's one
that you really want to check out and
download because it's a really was a
really popular asset and it will
continue to do so in all versions
because unity have purchased it just so
that everybody has access to it because
it's a really great tool the next one is
substance in unity and this is a plugin
for unity which allows you to access
substance sauce and have a substance
pens at live link so you can work with
you games and easily integrate substance
or switching is an a sort of a library
of a thousand plus high quality PBR
textures and the substance painter link
is allows you to create a connection
between substance painter and the unity
view pot to allow streamlined sort of
experience and real time updates
depending on what you're trying to edit
within substance painter so this might
be one for you if your enthusiasms
painter like i on another great one is
something called progress which which
was again purchased by unity recently
and
allows for like the other assets for
quick prototyping this allows you to
snap game objects by prespecified
by grids and snapping and you can get
the objects and you can quickly just
iterate on the scene snap it all
together and it can really help you out
but this is yet another one that I have
mentioned before in a video it's called
poly brush and again this was bought by
unity recently and that this again is an
asset similar to ZBrush sculptress and
things like that and it allows you to
paint sculpt blend textures with vertex
painting quite easily within unity so
you don't have to go to a different
program similar to how you would elect
arraign but you don't have to use a big
terrain it can be just a 3d object that
you've specified yourself and this I
think this is a quite a good one it's
called consistent line endings and this
one allows you to you sometimes get an
annoying suggestion by visual studio or
something that your line endings are not
consistent and you need to self press
yes and then re-save it and this one
allows you to do it normally
you know without you having to do
anything I'll just convert your line and
links for you it requires no extra work
so if you're looking to just get rid of
that annoying error this might be one
for you and the last but not least is
something called select ability and this
allows you to have hierarchy selections
with an editor extension where you can
right-click on a game object and then
you can easily select the parent route
the child sibling whatever it needs to
be as you can see down here you can
right-click on anything in the inspector
and select things really easily so you
can select all the children of one
particular asset or something like that
other things that depend on other assets
which don't allow you to have to hold
ctrl R shift to select all of the
objects below so this again all these
extra extensions are really great for
just saving you time so check out all
these fantastic editor extensions for
February March 2018 and be sure to thank
all the developers for putting the times
into making these assets and of course
for making them free thanks very much
