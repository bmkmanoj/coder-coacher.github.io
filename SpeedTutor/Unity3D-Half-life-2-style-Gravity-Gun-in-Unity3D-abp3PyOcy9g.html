that people requested so it's about
creating the gravity gun from half-life
2 now this isn't necessarily going to be
a tutorial because I thought that I had
a little look and research the topic
online and I found a script that
somebody had already made so I think
realistically them rather than me having
to you know spend 20 minutes showing you
how to make something like this we can
that can provide the script in the
description and you can use it but in
this video I'll just explain how it
works and how you can use it so first of
all you can see that on my main camera
I've got my own first-person controller
and then I've got to sort of physics
objects in my scene one is just a sphere
and then another two cubes so you're not
- physics objects and you've got to make
sure the god of rigidbody attached and
what you can do then is on your main
company you need to make sure you add
the gravity gun script to it and it's
got a few things that you can you know
change you've got catch range so this is
how far away the object is that you can
actually solve a tractor I'll pick it up
so if you increase that the further away
we can pick it up the whole distance how
close it absolutely is t player then the
minimum force that when you force it
away the max force so you can't push it
too far then the charge time so if you
hold your left click down on your mouse
actually means it charges the power of
which you can throw it so if I go into
the script and I show you what's going
on it's got those variables there that
just pretty much explained and what it
does it holds a various amount of states
so it's got when you don't have anything
your hand when you've got something car
when it's actually in your hand when you
charge up and when you release it so it
does it in a fixed up there and it
starts off that if you press the fire
button and a rare cast finds the
rigidbody in front of you then you've
caught it then if you've caught it
it'll just hold it in front of you
then if you press fire one again and you
have something in your hand it'll
actually move to the charge and when
it's charging the longer you hold it
fall the more force that you will add to
the object and then when you release it
it will actually fire it away so it's a
bit of a long script but it's pretty
much it's simple when you break it down
into its color elements but I'll give
you an example of how it looks here so
if I'm in my scene now you need to make
sure that you imagine where the center
of your screen actually is so if I go
towards this object and left-click
you'll notice that I'm now picked up
this object and if I hold left click and
let go it'll shoot the object to where
similarly with this ball if I pick it up
if I hold it and then fire you know you
can fire it quite far depending on how
long you've actually held it down for
just just lied and hold it down for very
long but it just shows you the solve
it's simple where that as long as you've
got the scripts and you additi main
camera or the end of your sort of gun
that you're gonna have you'll get the
ability to pick up and sort of
manipulate objects by throwing them and
things like that like you could in
half-life so that pretty much gives you
the basis of it so I'll provide the
script but that was just showing you the
script explaining it briefly thanks very
much for watching and if you like the
tutorial don't forget to Like comment
