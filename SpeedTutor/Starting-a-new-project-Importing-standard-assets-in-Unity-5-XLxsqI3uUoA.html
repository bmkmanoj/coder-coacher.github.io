quick tutorial today and this is going
to be the first tutorial for unity 5 and
it might be very basic for a lot of
people but it's just going to show you
because unity fives got a slightly
different way of importing and starting
a new project so when you actually
double click on running unity 5 you'll
get this window popping up you'll have
projects so you can open other ones that
have been started or you can click new
and what you can do from here you can
see that similarly to the old version of
unity that you've got location of which
you can save your unity in you can name
the project and then you can set it as
3d or 2d but before you start that you
can import assets that you might need so
you can import characters effects
environment now characters is going to
be your FPS controllers and such cameras
are going to become as it you can use
effects particle systems environment
utilities anything that you feel that
you might need for your game and they
say I just choose characters for now
press done and all I'm going to do is
I'm going to create a new project and
wait for that to actually begin to load
itself up once you then into unity
you'll notice there has a scene setup by
default with the main camera and a
directional light you can start building
as you would normally but this is just a
quick example just like in unity 4 if
you haven't forgot to import a
particular asset that was there
available at the beginning you can right
click on your project panel say import
package and choose 2d camera characters
effects just what you had there and say
I needed particle systems I'll click
that and just like before we'll wait for
it to load itself up and we'll click
import and it will import that in for us
and it will be in our standard assets
folder so we'll have everything there
that we needed B from before so that was
just a simple way to start a project
within unity 5 so it's very similar on
is a few
minor differences but other than that
pretty much straightforward thanks again
