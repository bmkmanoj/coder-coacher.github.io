tutoral today and this is gonna be
showing you how to our background audio
our music to your game and then maybe
even saving it between scenes so it
doesn't just solve you know destroy
itself
when you move into another scene so
without further ado I've got the menu
bezel my new that I created a few
tutorials ago and we might want to add
some background audio to this because
you know it's not very interesting
without it so I just got an audio track
that we're going to use to put on it so
what you can do is when you've decided
on what you want you can right click on
the project panel go on impasse and
import the audio that you want you have
to allow in unity to import it's been
you know how big the file is you can
click on the audio and test it this side
but on to testing case it's really loud
on the recording what we can do is for
the most part you want to create a new
empty game object just make sure that
you set the position to 0 0 0 it doesn't
really matter it's just for the sake of
this we can rename this we can name this
background audio something like that
what we can do is once we've renamed
that we can add a new component and we
can search audio and we can add an audio
source some once we've had an audio
source to the object what we can do is
we can add our music track to the audio
clip slot and you want to make sure that
the special the special blend is all the
way down at 0 so it's a 2d sound so it
won't matter where we go in any scene
anywhere it will always be the same
volume and you can keep it playing on
awake so as soon as your menu starts or
your game starts it will play and you
can leave loop on so then when it ends
it'll just automatically just loop over
again so you don't get any pauses in
anything you might want to pull the
volume down a little bit and I'll pull
it down quite a bit so we don't get
blasted in the eardrums so what I'll do
is I'll try I'll test this and as you
could you could hear from that we got
some of the audio in the background and
yeah that's all well and good but when
we pressed play it's all one and good
ill start up and it'll be fine but when
we go to new game it'll just cut the
audio out so it depends really what you
want to do with it if you want to keep
it between scenes or um you don't that's
perfectly fine you can leave it like
that and when you go into a new scene
that's fine but say you wanted to keep
it we can go right click in the project
panel Korea and we can go see sharp
script and we'll say something like
don't destroy audio and then from here
we'll open up that script in Visual
Studio or whatever program that you've
got to edit your code and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get rid of
the two starting functions and I will
just start by writing avoid awake two
brackets after there the two curly
brackets below we can write don't
destroy onload and then we can write
transform dot game object with the
semicolon on the end so what this means
is that when we move into a new scene it
won't destroy that game object and it
will keep it as life for as long as we
say that it should stay alive for so
what to do is on our background audio
game object we can add our new script
and once we press play you'll notice
that with them when I move to a new
scene and I moved to it will carry on
the order in the same place that we left
off
so you can hear the sound man and as
we've moved to do the scene you can
still hear the audio so that's perfect
so you want to need to remember a few
things you can create an empty game
object add an audio source make sure
that it's 2d or 3d depending on what
you're trying to achieve you can make
sure that it doesn't destroy when you
move to another scene you just use don't
you strong load and then have it on your
game object that you have and then when
you move between scenes you can have
your background audio and you can sort
make and maybe make a fair doubt
accordingly so thanks very much for
watching job gets a like on and
subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
