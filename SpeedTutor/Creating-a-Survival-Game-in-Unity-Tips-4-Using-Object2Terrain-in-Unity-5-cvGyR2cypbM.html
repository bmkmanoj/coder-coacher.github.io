tutorial now this is gonna be a little
sort of side Pat's the Survival Series
because the question that I get asked
the most is how do I use the object of
terrain script to like I showed in the
first part of the tutorial of the
Survival Series to make it work within
unity 5 now I did actually cover this
ball make one video to cover it once and
for all so I've got a brand new scene
here nothing in except directional light
a main camera nothing in the project as
you can see if I right-click and I'm
gonna import a new asset and I'm gonna
go to the scripts that are on my website
that you can download and part one is
the island creation now if I import the
objects a terrain script and it's there
when I import into unity 5 it'll detect
that it's using some old API or the old
where that it might have been scripted
so it will just update it automatically
for me and just say that you've already
made a backup and go ahead and import it
it will I think it changes one line of
code it changes one line of code which
in here I think it said objects get
component and then Collider is with
triangle outer brackets like in c-sharp
now you can see that at the top scene as
that that's been updated I didn't even
need to put it in an editor folder but
you can do here right click create
folder and put in an editor but now up
at the top it does now reports object to
terrain and it said please select an
object now I've created a brand new
terrain by going game object 3d object
and terrain now if I bring another
object call maybe a cube let's say and
we make that really big this is just an
example of a mesh that we could bring in
from another program if we wanted and
then with that cube being selected if we
got terrain object you terrain you'll
notice they if I now hide my cube and
then how I go to the terrain
you can see that it's been made the size
and the share of the terrain as we would
expect based on that cube it isn't
doesn't have any height because you need
to give it some or should I say that you
can see it's actually tall but you'll be
able to sculpt inwards and raise and
lower this terrain height accordingly to
however you like to do it so if I hold
shift you can see that I'm pulling it
down and it's based on the cube that we
just made so really all you need to do
is import it from my packages and then
all I did was realistically import it
straight into the project side unity
updated it for me and there we go so
hopefully this once and for all
hopefully sorted it for everybody else
thanks very much for watching don't
