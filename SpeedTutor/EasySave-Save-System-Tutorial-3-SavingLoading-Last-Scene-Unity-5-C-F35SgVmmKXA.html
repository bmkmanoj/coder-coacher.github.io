going to be part 3 of the serving system
using the EZ save asset from the unity
stop and in the previous episode we went
into just quickly almost saving the
players position and in the previous
video father we looked at saving some
basic variables so in this one I will
show you how you can actually save the
scene that you're in and then we'll be
able to load from a menu and then so on
from there be able to learn anything
that we've loaded then load the players
position and then load up all the
variables because we have to do in a
certain way if you imagine that in this
previous tutorial we made a menu so if
you imagine before you load up any
variables you need to be loaded into the
scene that you need to be in so this was
the menu and it only had a load button
for an example so there's no point was
loading the position before we've loaded
in the scene that we needed to be in so
the first thing we need to do is
depending on what we're gonna do so I'll
keep this in level 1 I'll open up the
simple save and we need to go about
finding where to actually save the scene
that we're in so how can we do this it's
changed to slightly with the sort of
changes with the unity 5 and as it's
moved on because this scripting has
changed to be able to save levels and
Lord levels and it works in a slightly
different way but I'll go through it and
I'll go through with saving it with this
system so in this city of function just
like we did before we'll do es-tu dot
save and it's always the thing that you
use to be able to save will open up a
bracket and actually before we do that
we need to be making sure because all
this is in c-sharp we need to make sure
that unity is using something in
particular and it's using the scene
management or we can use a long
reference
in the code but if we're using the the
actual system directories then we don't
have to reference it in such a long
instance so if we write the top using
unity engine dot scene management we can
easily call the scene management
references directly using this of
namespace that we've given so having
that we can then write in this box and
you don't need to have this in if you
don't need your script to sort of be
working in scene management unloading
scenes or you know with that sort of
thing but from here we'll do es2 dot
save and in the brackets we will do
scene manager and you wouldn't get this
if we had scene management because we'd
have to do scene management dot scene
manager and it'd be slightly longer in
the code that's what I'm trying to get
across then we'll say well put dot and
we can say get active scene and then we
add two brackets because we're calling
that particular function that's built in
then we're asking to find the name and
then we're gonna say um comma then in
quotes
we're gonna have to say save scene and
add a semicolon on the end so what this
means is we're just going to save from
the scene manager we're going to get the
active scene and we're gonna get its
name and we're going to save it to the
file called saved scene and you'll be
able to see it if we press play and we
save we could stop the game running got
easy save to Settings tools and open up
the default save you'll notice that
we've got a saved scene file now so what
do we need to do with that now
so we've served the same verse in the
position we've saved some variables that
we need to manage so now we will go into
our menu and then what we can do is
we'll create another scripts or create
c-sharp script and call this main menu
load and I'll do is I'll open up this
and then when we're here
I'll just take away these starting
functions that we don't need anymore
then at the top here we can do the same
thing to do before will say using unity
engine dolt scene management with a
semicolon then at the top within the
class that we've written we've ruled on
to write a public string and then we'll
have level to load with a semicolon and
this is just going to be the string that
we're going to find so we're going to
find the scenes name and we're gonna
load this from the EZ save so then we're
gonna like public void load like we did
in previous scripts and what this means
is we're just going to use it on the
load button so we need to make sure it's
a public so we can get the button click
to actually run this function when we
want it then we'll say level to load
equals e s2 dot and then in angled
brackets little like string and then
we'll ask it to load the saved scene
inside some courts and the brackets I'm
allowed a semicolon at the end so like
we've done before with the load we can
load integer boolean's and the player's
position using vector 3 now for this
we're going to be using a string which
is more of a common type just like
variable but our strings a series of
characters doesn't have to be left as it
could be numbers it can just be a a
bunch of characters all together but
we're going to be getting the actual
name of the scene based on what we'd
saved out then what we can do is we can
say scene manager don't load scene open
brackets level to load with a semicolon
on the end so really what this is doing
is we're passing in two level to load so
it's a public string and we're saying
that
we're just gonna load the strength
that's inside said scene
so whatever we'd saved the string of the
name that we'd saved out we'll put that
into level to load and then we're going
to say that scene manager has got to
load the scene with whatever we found as
long as it makes sense to the actual
build settings that unity has so what we
can do from here is go to our menu UI
the canvas load button what we'll do is
we'll pop the main menu load on that
what we'll do is we'll add a do the tick
box for the on click event and the load
button directly to it on the function
we'll go to the main menu load and we
will go to the load so we expect that to
just load the scene and then from that
it will load the scene that we'll just
in and then it will change the babe
players position and bring in whatever
variables you need so like I said you'll
be loading the scene before you do
anything else and then once you start
the game then on that start function you
will then load everything else so we
press play we're in the menu we expect
that when we press the button it will go
to the correct scene or what throw up an
error so what you can say that is that
it's not added to the build settings so
we can go file build settings and you
can see there's nothing there in the
build settings so it doesn't really know
what to do there's no names like this so
what menu is number one and level one as
number two but it doesn't really matter
for this instance now a press will get
rid of that error just to make things
clearer with the press play again and
now we'll load and you can see that we
now loaded the scene that we were just
in and it loaded the position because
we're on the yellow plane and it will
have brought in any of the things we
might have had before so it's just a
simple simple way to on the menu we just
love the string load that string into
the scene manager then from that once
that scenes loaded on the start function
it calls the simple load function and
I'll say change that remove the position
unload any of the variables and just
going over the save system once again
saving the position saving the scene and
saving any variables you might have and
the variables can be managed from one
script two scripts as many scripts as
you might need so these are just a three
I think the core elements to saving
things in you again and you know you can
use loading just as sailing scenes but
it's quite helpful to understand very
many different sort of areas to this but
after this helped you sort of get a very
you know bass level understanding of a
save system and you can incorporate that
into game really easily so thanks very
much for watching don't forget to Like
