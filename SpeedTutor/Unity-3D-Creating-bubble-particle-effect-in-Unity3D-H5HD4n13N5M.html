something really simple today is how to
create a sort of bubble particle effect
using a salt bubble now I'm going to use
this for my other tutorials that's going
to be about swimming underwater and the
one that's already open it's about
underwater effects so really let's get
straight into it you may have seen this
scene before all it's got is some water
to rain a skybox and a directional light
something really similar and a main
camera and you can see it just looks
across the water
so what we're actually going to need is
we're going to need any standard assets
you're going to need the particle pack
that comes with you if you don't have
the actual standard package when you
import you can right click import
package and go to particles which is
then you'll empower that package strain
and we'll get something called a salt
bubble now we're just going to use this
just for the sake of it you can create
your own in Photoshop and stuff like
that but for the sake of this is what
I'm going to do so you want to right
click create material what we're going
to do is we're going to call it bubbles
once we've called it bubbles we'll get
the shared here so we're going to change
it to particles and addictive soft I'm
going to just drag this and texture
we've got onto the actual shared a slot
so now it looks like the image we've got
here so what we want to do now we want
to make an actual system that's going to
display the particle so gone game object
great other than particle system you'll
see that the system now emits particles
whenever you're actually on the system
so we're going to just collapse particle
system and go to renderer and you'll see
we've got a default particle and sort of
texture map on it but we don't want that
we want to add our bubbles so now we
actually get some bubbles emitting from
the actual emitter itself but what ones
do is you just want to have this as sort
of breathing underwater you can change
the different other ways but I'm going
to show you it
so I'm going to set the red to about two
so we get something you know that's not
too many bubbles at once
Jayesh and about two so the dot lasts as
long the life span isn't as great we'll
leave the star lifetime work but the
stats read it too so everything goes a
lot slower SATs eyes and everything is
the same you can affect all loads of
different things you can affect the a
cat which the they emit from so you
could have it in you art you could have
some bubbles coming from some saltiness
in a sink and press play you'll just see
the bubbles as they would be it's quite
a simple way just to make some simple
particle how to make a simple material I
play an alpha texture to that and then
something that can work for anything you
want to do and don't forget if you liked
