and this is going to be just detailing
the steps and the tips to get yourself a
game on to steam now I was actually a
pattern we've seen before a big turned
interesting direct where you can pretty
much quite easily get any game that
you've developed by paying a small fee
as long as you have an account and the
relevant paperwork and information and
you can just upload straight to the
start and they give you a store presence
to instantly and then you can update you
store upload packages and manage
everything that you need to do with that
but really I'll just detail the sort of
initial steps you can read all this
information and I'll leave the links in
the description it's all fairly
self-explanatory but what you need to do
is you need to go and create yourself an
account to be expected I guess
and then you'll sign the initial digital
paperwork with the information that
you're required to fill in with bank tax
and information related to either if you
are a company or your ass all sort of
trader then you will pay a deposit and
the fee to get your game sort of
approved by steam you will then have
access to Steamworks and that's just
their platform that they call to get
access to and all the admin management
all the management for the staff run to
get hold of all the builds to upload
your builds get verification and to get
hold of all the SDKs and any inner
workings with Steam and then you can
begin instantly preparing your actual
game for release so you can like I say
you can update start page upload
configure any of the specifics and set
your desired price there will be a brief
process for your store page specifically
and there'll be a review process between
1 and 5 days to verify all the content
that you've submitted all follows the
rules and just regular rules
I know swearing in such an all
appropriate content for all ages one
thing to care to mention if it's the
first few titles and valve and is very
specific in what a few titles is could
be one two three
you'll have a 30-day waiting period
before you can initially release your
app after you've paid the feet just it
gives supposedly gives them time to
review the information and confirm all
your business details and everything
like that like I said you'll need to
confirm the unpair you star page and
then you will set it up and make it
publicly visible as a sort of coming
soon edge and then it will start
building up yourself audience that
you've got and then once you choose to
release you can then set it live and
just to sort of outline the things that
you should have available to you when
you decide to sign up is all that
accurate bank account information
whether you're US or UK it's going to
differ all other parts of the world
you're going to need regular bank
account information
sometimes you need a routing number on a
phone number things like that you'll
need names of an accounts and whether
you're an established business you will
need account types of that you will need
all your tax information all will give
you a questionnaire if you're outside of
the US you will fill in a particular
form related to that because you won't
be charged tapped it within the US if
you're not specific to the US you can
look at the specific Steamworks
documentation and it will give you a
lowdown of each of the steps that you're
going to go through and all the
information that you're required so
you'll need your company identification
payment information tax information and
the fees and all the information regards
to what you will need by hand when you
first initially set your account up and
this will just really give you a rundown
of everything that you need to do in
terms of whether it's setting up your
page or managing all the things from the
SDK so really the streamline the process
of getting your game on Steam so it's
perfectly more accessible to everybody
who decides to release on the platform
the steam fee is particularly as follows
if your M going in dollars it'd be about
100 US dollars and maybe about seventy
nine pounds if you're from the UK and
equivalent to euros or any other
currency that you use this fee is
technically non-refundable but is
recoupable as in it means you will get
it back once your product has
at least $1,000 in gross revenue so you
in the end you get that back in the long
run as long as you game hits a specific
value and I'm sure everybody will hit
them so take a look at all the
documentation and you can quite easily
get your new application onto steam so
thanks very much for watching don't
