video and this is gonna be a showcase of
the butterfly world at vis interior
apartment volume 1 now a fair company
behind this do a fair few other solve
architectural visualization things for
the unity asset star but I have a really
big interest in lighting and things like
that when it comes to game development
and I find all of these things really
interesting I think these guys among a
few other examples do a really good job
in creating some really awesome
this style projects and it can go a long
way to show you how to set up the scene
do the lighting and look at the models
so we're gonna look at one of their
things today and be sure to check out
all their content on the unity asset
start if you are interested so you can
see the scene here and I've been part of
it into unity 2000 17.3 and this package
uses the processing stack version 2 so
it comes with all the modern features
that you would see in more recent
versions of unity that comes with the
Becht lighting it comes with a whole
bunch an array of settings and it comes
with over 20 PBR models some with other
variations of the same one but it's a
nice little scene just to get you
started and it's a nice little realistic
looking apartment with the effects and
camera motions in between and I'll just
play this scene and like I always say
about any of these things that you ever
look into when whether you purchase it
or looking to something like this it's a
really awesome way to get a whole host
of them very high-quality looking PVR
models all with a very low poly and all
with a really nice style or whether it's
a way to look at the lighting that setup
in the scene whether you look for how
they've set up the lights how they've
done the materials reflection probes all
they've done the post-processing with
the bloom and whatnot which is featured
all out of the box all everything that
you can access within units 2017 and
above and this is just one of those
examples of a really nice looking you
know fairly small apartment with some
assets around here and as I do say that
they've got a whole host of other ones
which you can check
but this is just a nice little apartment
with a few assets chairs and components
that you could use in other games other
projects that you choose to use and it
just shows what quality can produce in
unity just when you've got a little bit
of talent with making the models and and
having a bit of knowledge when it comes
to lighting so be sure to look at the
unity asset store at butterfly world
because they do have a whole a bunch of
architectural visualization startup
projects that you can look at and they
do have a few more coming to the assets
table which are really quite cool so be
sure to check out them if you're really
interested in this so thanks again for
watching don't fit to like comment and
