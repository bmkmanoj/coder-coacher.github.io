going to be about creating a particle
effect like leaves blowing in the wind
or falling off trees because I played
again recently need speed rivals and
that had an awful lot of leaves blown
front view car and I'm as much as it was
a bit OTT it was you know a nice
particle effect and I thought you know I
teach everybody how to sort of create
something like this within unity so
here's my example so I'll run my game
and you'll see it within the trees and
you'll see it falling down now you're
seeing my scene here that you can see
between the trees and we get a lot of
leaves falling down maybe a little
unrealistic but this is just you know to
make the example apparent that you can
see you know the leaves falling from the
tops of the trees
okay so I'll show you how I initially
made it so I've got my I've got my
forest here which is nothing crazy just
some trees and some bushes and stuff and
I'll just bake the lighting out a little
bit now what I've done is I've got a
selection of leaves that I've got now
create another tutorial which is about
creating an alpha map for your textures
so if you go to CG texts is awesome one
like now you can download a bunch of
leaves which then you can take the
background now so you can use it within
unity as an alpha cutoff so if you'll
see that you know the Alpha cutoff and
some of these like if I show you this
leaf on at the bottom here that I've got
but if I don't say it as a cutoff then
you'll see the back the white background
so initially what I've done is if you
watch me on the tutorial we've got I go
into Photoshop take the background out
make an alpha channel on the texture and
then what you can do is then bring that
into your actual scene and make a
texture from so what you do is actually
you want to import your texture in
see seen some line here I've got three
different leaves and then what you want
to do is create a new material so create
material and then I've called it leaf
one it'll start off as a diffuse shared
you want to go down and create
transparent cut out diffuse and you want
to make sure that you pretty much set
your slider almost to the bottom so you
get rid of the white edging on your
material like I pull this back you'll
get the edge in four tick aware you know
we get the even leaf now then what we
need to do is go to game object create
other and then particle system now I've
created this is a prefab so I can make
it my scene but you don't need to worry
about that what you do is you go down to
your render section and then what you
can do is change material to whatever
you created some leaf one so I added
leave form to my slot there and you know
I've just kept everything the same and
then you make sure that it receives in
cast shadows and you can set the normal
direction to one and make sure it's
billboard if not already then I'll go
through my other settings and then I'll
go but I want it to rotate over the
lifetime so you want to leave not just
to fall so rigidly so you can set that
to about thirty so actually will rotate
as its falling you know to give it a
soft effect in itself and then if you
tick for sort of a lifetime it will make
sure that it sort of moves in a
particular way as if the winds pushing
in direction so you can set yeah x2 9.6
uy to not 0.3 and you said to not - not
point naught 5 as I say with all my
particle tutorials you don't need to
keep these exactly the same it's
whatever you would like to have and then
you want to check velocity of a lifetime
which does a similar thing and you can
set that to minus three point three -
not point six and the Zed can be one
point one
you want to have share pin air weld if
not already you want it to emit from a
column the angle wants to be 90 degrees
the radius 5.75 and it can emit from a
volume shell and tick random direction
because you want it to have a random
salt variation then on the emission you
can have the rate about 10 and leave
everything is standard then on your
leaves you can have the duration around
10 set that the particle defector lupin
makes your pre rot warms ticked make the
start lifetime about 24 start speed 1
point 4 sat size depending on your
leaves really i've had mine not 0.7 but
depending on the size of you texting the
size that leaves you 1 then the start
rotation - 34 gravity multiplier not
point not 7 because you don't want the
gravity to pull it down so fast or you
don't want the gravity to be so low that
it rises up you just want it a very
small armor of gravity then you can have
inherit velocity or 5.77 make sure it
plays on awake and of the max particle
set normally is a thousand obviously you
can change this if you don't want so
many now obviously if you know you want
to make this into a prefab what you can
do is right click create prefab and once
you have your particle effective at this
side you can just drag it in to a prefab
slot which ever you've created so you
can then drag it in you know in TC in as
many times as you like so you know it's
quite straightforward to get it the hard
part is just essentially making the
alpha within you photoshop then just
import into unity and then just applying
it to a material and creating the
particle system so again you know you
get that sort of nice look when you're
within a sort of Foresti area that you
know it looks like the leaves are
actually falling off the trees that
we've got in the scene
so you know as ever thanks very much for
watching and if you liked the tutorial
