short tutorial today and this is going
to be about what people have asked and
it's about head bobbing or something
that happens say you're running with
your character and then your head would
realistically bulb in real life like you
can see there that I'm running now now
I'm not really going to show you how its
programmed this because it's already a
good example on the unify wicket I'll
put the link in the description but if
you go on to a web browser and you put
the link in you get unity3d good comm
then you get the head Baba script which
is written in JavaScript and all this is
is I'll put this on my website so
everybody can find that more easily if
they want and I've set it out in a way
that maybe people can understand more
and all it's doing is looking at a
bobbing speed and bobbing amount in a
midpoint the speed the bobbing speed
obviously is the speed at which and the
camera Bob's up and down the bobbing
amount is how far up and down it goes
and the midpoint is whereabouts the
middle of your camera should be so if
you set this real high you can roll
float in the air really high so all it's
doing is doing a timer for every time
that you move horizontally or vertically
with your keyboard inputs and then when
you do so it's going to do a
mathematical calculation to move the
actual camera up and down dependent on
what variables you originally set so all
you really need to do is copy that
script from there or I'll put up my
website as I said so you met you have a
JavaScript file you can call it whatever
you want and you can add it to main
camera once you added C main camera
bobbing speed is set to not point one
eight which is quite good and then the
amount null point two and the midpoint
is usually set to two but I've set it to
one so obviously when we play this you
can see you know it looks fairly
realistic if I push it up quite far
you'll notice it Bob's pretty fast
I'll put it all the way back down and
I'll put the bar in a mount up you'll
notice that it's quite crazy so
obviously you can make different types
of
supposed playercontroller and if we
change the midpoint you'll notice that
the camera goes quite high so we could
obviously make something like a a big
giant or something like that so if we
increase that increase that yet
something quite like you could imagine
being a giant awesome thing with giant
footsteps now as I said that's all that
I'm going to show because it's already
written out for you so make sure you
check that script town and and if
anybody's wondering the survival Ireland
tutorials are coming soon I'll make a
little short video showcasing they up
there
