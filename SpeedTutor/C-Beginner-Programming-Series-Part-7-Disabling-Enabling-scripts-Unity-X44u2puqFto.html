tutorial today and we're going to be
looking at doing and activating on
disabling components of scripts via
scripting in c-sharp as part of the next
step because in the last episode we did
about turning game objects on and off so
this is just a step forward and
sometimes you might need to turn a
particular component off from your
character let's say or you might need to
turn a script off when you don't want it
to be alive anymore so let's give an
example here so so on this first run
controller I'll just add the first
script that we made in really early in
this series and for the sake of this it
doesn't matter what it has to say so
we're just going to disable it by making
a disable it and it'll just untick
itself so I'll just not make it work
anymore so it won't run any lines of
code so what we'll do is like we did in
our previous video we'll do it on a
trigger to make sure that it solve
obvious and in a game example so I'll
upload the trigger event game object
script that we'd seen last time and if
you following through from sort of this
point and you've not seen any others you
can look back or you can just follow
along from here so when you're here is
that how we did it before we look for
the game object that we need to find and
then we set active now we're going to do
something very very very similar to this
so let's imagine that we need to find to
the player and the player has that
scripture that we want to disable so
we're going to say is we've got public
public game object with two capitals and
then we're just going to write player
doesn't matter what we write here it can
be anything but this easily allows us to
identify what we need to do so we with
player there romi into the collision
what we can do is we can say is I will
just comment this line out so it doesn't
deactivate the script before we get to
it so under here I'll say player
dot getcomponent and then we will have
two angled brackets then two brackets
after there so what we want to say in
this gap component is the actual script
that we're going to be looking for so
we're going to be looking for is first
script and it already knows that that's
alive in our again and then what we want
to do is then after the two brackets we
say dot enabled equals false
so all it's doing is our reference that
we're going to give it we're going to
say player so the player or whatever
game moment we're looking for him we're
going to say we're going to grab the
component the angle brackets for C shaft
are required to find the component that
you're looking for and then the two
brackets afterwards are required in this
statement and then afterwards we said
darn able because we want to say whether
it's going to be true or false to be
enabled so what I'll do is I'll save the
cell and I will show this as an example
and you can see that on there is the
first script so we need to select our
trigger object that we've got and the
trigger object will now have player so
it's looking for the player now so what
we're going to do is we're going to just
grab whatever a player is for this
instance so it's first person control
and you will see that the first script
is actually ticked now I will leave this
on maximized so when we play the game
you expect this so if you watch this
works but when we go through the
collision that will turn off some there
I walk in front and the script is now
disabled and as an example we can do
exactly the same thing if we want the
script to be true so say you know we
want it to become active when you go
through the collision we can do that or
say this is just another example say we
want to do something differently
entirely and we want to set access the
mesh renderer on this
quad on this plane that we've got for
the flaw is the mess renderer if you tun
tick that it won't render the object
anymore so this is a slightly slightly
different but in the same sort of
instance exactly the same so what we can
do is we can say that we have another
public game object which is type flaw
then under here we can say that flaw
don't get component with the two angled
brackets with two brackets afterwards
dot enabled equals false in exactly the
same way but what let's say this time is
we'll start writing mesh renderer and so
instead of specifying the script the
rafter which is looking for the mesh
renderer so what I could do here is on
my quad I could make sure that mesh
render is ticked but remember that when
you're doing your script you need to add
the public reference in the inspector if
you are doing it so when we go through
it you expect the floor to disappear and
first script to become enabled now in
the script I just cleared up the things
that were there before to make this
easier to read so I would move me to a
referencing we saying getcomponent we're
giving the component that we're looking
for so it's anything that could be on
the object and we saying dot enabled
equals true or false and then like in
the other video you can do it in a
similar way with looking for tags and
things like that so you could say
private and game object and we could
call this for this instance player call
this player two just for this so they
don't conflict player two now what we
can do here is so that player 2 M equals
game object don't find game object with
tag and then open the brackets in course
we can say player because that's what a
tag of our player usually is we'll put a
semicolon then we expect that player to
get component first script is equal to
true so now when we check our trigger
when once make sure it's enabled we
haven't got a reference in there yet
I've just made it public so you can see
it in this instance and the first script
is off so when we press play we expect
on the trigger it found the first
booking person to enter Ola
automatically because our player our
first person controller was tagged
player and now we expect when we go
through the collision for first script
to be enabled so we'll do that and first
script was enabled because we can see it
there now to optimize your card a little
bit you can set that to private because
it does it all for you in the background
and there's no need to have a public
variable here now it's disappeared it's
not in the inspector so it's just hidden
for that script itself so hopefully this
helped you be able to enable and disable
some components on objects on anything
that you see in your game and using it
on a trigger event just on an on trigger
event and looking for the tag player and
doing some enables and setting it to
true and false so thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
