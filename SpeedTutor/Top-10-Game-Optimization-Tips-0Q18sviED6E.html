optimization any game engine because the
most of these actual concepts apply so
just a disclaimer I do have a series
which goes into depth about all these
things that we'll mention in this video
about the top ways to actually do the
optimization so you have a look at those
and I'll leave a link in the description
if you want to check that out but number
one is some tips on modeling so when
you're modeling any asset anything that
you've got it's good to take a look at
the amount of polygons or triangles that
it's made up of if you look at the faces
this isn't many because all it is is a
box now sometimes that people are just
often though you could say I can add
lots of different loops around this
model and you can see that's unnecessary
this is really you know self explanatory
type of stuff but reduce polygons where
appropriate you know the less you have
the better is as long as you can keep
the shape just as the same with say this
box if we're never going to see the
bottom of this box for instance and we
convert this to an editable poly in 3ds
max I delete the bottom there you go
you've saved yourself two triangles or a
polygon there because if we just always
keep it like that we're never going to
see the underside so we don't need to do
anything with it if similarly if we've
got an object which goes into another
object like let's say it like this for
these two objects we don't actually need
to be able to see this side or the other
so we can again we can just choose to
delete either inside of the boxes and
you'll never see obviously something
like this we could join them up and then
there we'd save even more but similarly
if you've got a pipe going into
something else you don't need the inside
face it doesn't matter that some of the
you know polygons aren't connected
because it doesn't really doesn't really
matter you can join things up to
triangles if you need to it will you may
have problems in the long run if you're
doing animation if it's something more
eye Ganic like a character but it's good
depending on the type of assets you're
going to make if it's going to be sort
of a base asset that you're going to see
about here
you know keep it fairly simple and basic
delete
polygons were not required and only if
it's something like a Harrow I said or
something you're gonna see a lot will
you add more detail to it and there you
can go and create yourself
high-resolution meshes to do the backing
out for the normals and number two is
gonna be texture sizing atlas thing and
resolution and things like that
especially when it goes hand in hand
with in modeling especially when you
look at the size of texture and
resolutions of textures if you can see
that this whole canvas here is 2048 by
2048 which is a good size for a lot of
different textures you know these could
be things from you know walls floors
very you know high detailed assets and
then you go to a thousand 24 which might
be good for a lot of different props
things smaller things and you can see
that you can fit a thousand and for a
thousand twenty four you know size maps
in one 2048 and texture space you could
see that my red fits in here four times
now similarly if we go to half the
resolution of 1024 you would have a box
which is 512 would fit into a thousand
24 four times and similarly there we get
even better for even smaller assets less
detail assets you know reduce the
resolution where appropriate because the
larger the texture size especially with
the more detail on it the bigger the
file size will be and when you build
your files out and run them in the
memory it will take up more space so
it's good to authy textures
appropriately and you can scale down as
you save them out and especially if
you're working in a PBR workflow like
something like substance painter and
you've got maybe three farm Maps five
Maps per asset the UX spot yeah and you
exploit them at 2048 before you know it
you've taken up 20 megabytes in one
object so hand-in-hand with that is you
can do something called a texture Atlas
Inc so let's imagine that these two
objects that I've got here
have a both separate and they would both
essentially have two different maps and
they wouldn't they wouldn't share a UV
map now in 3dsmax which I'm sure it's
similar in a lot of other programs if we
choose to attach the two objects
together and I
open up the material later you can see
that they now then now both on one UV
Island so which means that these two
objects now share one UV map essentially
which so they will share one texture the
world depends if you do do it via PBR
then it would have more than one texture
but instead of it having you know say
this had fall in the end then this had
fall they would both be together on one
map so they would be far together so you
could essentially you could add another
object here so let's say for instance we
added something like a sphere and what
we're doing with a sphere is we choose
our boxes and we attach them to the
sphere and then we open up our UV editor
again you can see that now even though
the UV map isn't arranged very nicely
these all share the same UV coordinates
so it's now three objects that share the
same thing so again you're taking you're
using you know the best use of your
optimization to condense assets together
so they're all on one space and multiple
materials on lots of textures for no
apparent reason
so then in this instance instead of
having for a thousand 24 which would be
2048 which wouldn't may you might have
end up for you know twelve textures you
could have them on one 2048 map or 1024
mer and then you've saved yourself a lot
of difficulty in the long run something
that goes hand-in-hand with this is that
if you choose to build out your game if
you go file build settings if you got
build and run and once you've built our
game at any one time you can go to the
console go to the top of the console
here and you've got a little drop-down
and then you can show up in the editor
lock and then you can go down to the
bottom of this editor log and it will
tell you how much each of the actual
textures and how much size is that
everything takes up you can see here
I've almost scrolled down to the bottom
of this here and you can see the
textures take up 0% messages I represent
sounds take up 28% of this current build
and it's a complete size of 43 megabytes
and you can see what's taken up and what
of heads you've got on resources you can
see there are sounds I might need to you
know compress those a little bit which
might be another element to your
optimization making sure that you've
compressed the sounds as much as you can
either with OGG format
mp3 something like that you don't want
to kill you too compression really in
the long in the long term another good
way to you know just the setting cording
to what plays you might have if you go
edit project settings then you go to
quality you've got a bunch of quality
settings now I've customized these
quality settings so I've got my own
levels of customization you can go to
ultra and you can knock the different
settings down so say you want to go to
low you might want the textures only to
be half resolution you might want all
the special features disabled or maybe
disable shadows keep shadow resolution
to very low keep the shadow distance
down to a minimum you can test the new
game because every time you click it
would adjust the settings you know if we
had something in this scene which was a
parent to be able to see it you want to
adjust these settings according to what
systems you actually want to reach so
it's a good way to you know be able to
test for different machines or one thing
to care to mention especially if you've
said this object here had a lot more
polygons in it so we selected this plane
and we look at shaded wireframe and you
can see that it's made up of more
triangles than is required to make up
this object cuz essentially it should be
just two triangles because it's a plane
at the end of the day this see it's got
a mesh Collider on it but that's a waste
of our resources here because a mesh
Collider puts the collider all the way
over the you know the entirety of the
mesh so it will find where the polygons
are and then put it over there
especially if you've got a complicated
object which in some cases is fair
enough if you need to do that that's
fine
but if it's a simple object like say
take this cube or you take this plane we
can get rid of the mesh renderer and in
all cases you know for the most part you
can use something like a box Collider
and that will be more optimized
especially if you used a lot of it when
it does exactly the same thing because
it just puts a box over it because it's
a box at the end of the day we can do
the same thing here we can add a box
Collider to this because essentially it
is a box so it's about looking at the
colliders you've got a void mesh
colliders where you can how to use box
colliders cylindrical collectors
anything like that to sort of slowly
optimize your way especially if you're
colliding a lot of stuff in game say you
do have a really complicated asset which
is MIT yeah the lodge of
located ships you could go back into
your 3d program make a really basic say
I wanted to collide for instance if I
didn't use a spherical collider on this
sphere here and I wanted to let's say
make a custom collision for it I could
do that and I could use a mesh Collider
for that but I don't want to mesh
collide all this because it's you know
it's very high Pulliam it feels like a
waste so what I could do is create a
carbon copy of this object so I say I
took it like this for instance and I
reduce the sides on it so I had it like
this so you can see it looks somewhat
similar but because it's a collision it
doesn't really matter but we've reduced
the polygon count enough so if we export
and bring this into unity now and use
this as our collision mesh we can bring
that your object into unity and put a
mesh Collider on it and it'll be more
optimized than using the original model
as the best Collider say we've got a lot
of different objects in this scene here
and I will just duplicate some things
over here and these might be our main
walls let's imagine and then we could
scale this down and say we've got really
tiny objects and I put the directional
light towards these objects here they
all cast a shadow and sometimes you'll
seen a lot of games a lot of Triple A
games especially the especially with of
small assets there's no point of smaller
assets casting shadows if it doesn't
really add anything to the game because
most part these big assets here you
might want them to cast a shadow because
they might be important and they might
make you seem look more towards a
certain scale that you're trying to
reach but say this object here if I pull
it closer to the floor
you know maybe really that that asset
doesn't really need a shadow because we
might have put some ambient occlusion
somewhere near that and it doesn't need
it so what we can do is we can select on
the Metron mesh renderer and but we can
take off choose to receive or take off
and receive shadows but we can take off
cast shadows so we can just say off so
we can say there that if you were
playing a game and you maybe had some
decals or alphas or rubbish on the floor
they don't need to cast
shudders because the probably wouldn't
have shadows or if you've got really
small items in a drawer on a desk there
might be no apparent reason for it to
cast the shadows but it will be a
performance overhead if you do leave
them doing so it's really dependent on
what game you trying to create what
quality of application you're looking to
make we've got a different
differentiation we've got static and
we've got dynamic batching when it comes
to doing some optimization you will see
in if I go to game view and we go here
you can see that batches for the most
part items are dynamically batch - based
on the material that they have and
whether the same object so said all
these squares here they all share the
same material so they'll be
automatically backed by unity and
they'll be grouped into essentially
sometimes a single draw call and draw
calls are the thing that depending on
how many objects you've got how many
shadows that they cast how many times
that they do certain calculations will
add too many draw calls and can bog down
your performance so say they all share
the same material or they're all the
same object
they'll all be dynamically batched
together into one draw comp which it is
great if you've got objects that share
the same thing now we can do something
called static batching which if you
click on an object and you click on the
top and you can choose to set that to
static and that'll now be static so you
don't want to is especially important
for objects that won't move or if you
want to do light mapping and I'll come
onto that after this and what static
batching does is that we'll take
everything that's static and everything
that shares similarities and that will
batch it into one Drock or because it'll
never move and it will just go a long
way to them same performance especially
if it's on bigger objects which costs
which cast a lot of different shadows
and receive a lot of different shadows
from other objects coming on to actual
Becht lighting if we go to the lighting
tab from unit you can go window lighting
is that we've got different settings
where we can use the light mapper
settings to do bed lighting which on
baek's lighting and the shadows and the
global illumination into one single
texture now normally if we just add a
Sun and we don't
to any backlighting ill be just real
time we'll see the real time shadows
just here now if we choose to use some
BEC setting than if we set some of these
cysts attic by any of these they'll be
taken into account when we do our static
light mapping unless you take the mist
attic that won't be taken into the light
map so if it's big objects like or walls
and things that are never going to move
then take static and back out the
lighting and you know that's great and
then you'll back out all the shadows and
all the information into one texture and
you don't have to use real-time lighting
because the real time will be a big hit
on performance obviously depending on
the platform they're trying to reach and
the different quality you're trying to
go for but there's other things you
could do you can do the mix lighting you
can use light probes and things like
that to get around to using baked
lighting and dynamic lighting at the
same time another one to mention is that
you can use LEDs so sir we've got this
one cube here then from here let's
imagine that we've got an object which
is a sphere and the sphere here is you
can see it in our scene great that's
nice and big and it can be about many
polygons because we're going to see it
this close now how long level of detail
mesh works is that when you add the
component or you bring it from a 3d
program is that if is this many polygons
this close that's fine but say wheezy
waiter say we move out here is still the
same amount of polygons and if you're
this far away maybe you know women
become see all the detail in it might
have some bubbles some different sort of
stripes something on it which we can't
see anymore so the level of detail can
be something where depending on how far
the camera is away we can adjust and
swap the mesh out depending on how far
we have away from it and that can be
then swapped to a mesh which is much
lower polygons or maybe have slow
resolution textures that can go a long
way and they say we got here you can
have different levels of level of detail
so you can go all the way to an even
lower amount so you can almost make it
look really blocky at this point because
you know over here we can barely see and
what your the detail so
it would be hard to make out so he could
reduce it again automatically with unity
the further you get away normally from
textures it will use something called
MIT maps and MIT maps adjust it reduces
the quality of a distance of your
textures to decrease the overhead of
everything that's there one of the sort
of last things that I'm gonna tie in
together and mention is that on your
main camera if I look at my camera here
you can see that I've got a far and near
clipping plane and the clipping plan if
you see in my game view I can take all
the way down and it will clip away
things when it gets a certain distance
so this can be a way to cull objects out
of the frustum and the frustum is
directly where the camera actually looks
pending on how far away so if we didn't
want to render things right in the
background we could decrease the
clipping plan to take that away and one
thing like I said you can mention is you
can look at the stats window in the game
view to have a look but another thing to
look at is window and you go to profile
and you can press play on your game and
then the profiler will be able to tell
you and you can see based on the profile
you can look at the rendering so you can
see how many patches and draw calls were
saved you can see how much memory was
allocated to different things you can
see what audio is used and you can see
what was taking up the massed stuff in
the CPU usage so you can look down and
you can break each part down so you can
see the cam render was taken 30% of
performance at different points and you
can scrub across this timeline and see
all there was a spike here so what
happened at 37% Cameron was doing
something he was drawing and it was
drawing the geometry that was there in
the scene and you can break each element
down to look at what might be causing
performance steps in each of the things
that you're trying to do so it's another
good way just to in each level of ever
you optimize something optimization
isn't just a like a step by step guide
even though I've sort of given a brief
one here is you have to do it from start
to finish over and over and just
learning stuff as you go along
to take each step really slowly and
optimizes you go along because if you
optimize they usually go along there
won't be as much
to do towards the end because the more
leave to and the more I'll absolutely
bog you down and you actually and you
got crazy these are just some of the top
tips that I can give you to you know get
the best out of the best level of
optimization you can and help you again
to achieve the performance that you
really want so thanks again for watching
