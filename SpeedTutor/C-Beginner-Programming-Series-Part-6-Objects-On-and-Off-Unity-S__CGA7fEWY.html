tutorial today and this is going to be
looking at the part 6 - the c-sharp
basics tutorial series and we're going
to be looking into activating and
deactivating game objects are objects
that you've got in your 3d world that
you want to do something with so in the
earlier in the series in part 2 we did
something about trigger events so when
you expect to do something on a trigger
event you walk through a collider where
we might walk through this little box we
have here and then we expect something
to happen so we're going to look into
turning game objects on and off because
it's quite an important thing to learn
and it's not a fundamental part of
c-sharp but it can be quite effective
with you know any type of game that you
going to create to unhide hide depending
if you complete an objective and you
want to make something happen
so let's get straight into it if we
right-click in the project panel
we'll go create and we'll go C sharp and
then what we'll do from here is we'll
call this trigger event an alcoholic
trigger event game object just for the
sake of this tutorial now we'll open up
in whatever code editing software you've
got and you'll see we'll start off with
the public class that we've got for the
script that we just created now I just
like to keep my curly brackets below so
I have everything together and I'll get
rid of everything that's between these
two curly brackets so we'll keep it nice
and organized
so first of all if you remember we want
to create a trigger event so I will
briefly go through this but you can look
at part two if you feel that you want to
go through trigger events mob in depth
so we're going to say void on trigger
enter then open brackets and in the two
brackets we're going to write collider
space other and then below there we're
going to have two curly brackets and
then
between the curly brackets we will say
if other dot compare tag then in
brackets and in two quotes
we're going to write whatever tag that
we're looking for so more often than not
we're looking for the player tag so if
the turf the player walks into the
collision then we will do something then
what we can do is we can have two curly
brackets below here and then this is
where we're going to write whatever we
want to do to set the game object active
for instance now if you want to do that
there's you know a few ways that you
could possibly go around doing this
first where you could add a public
variable to the top of here and
reference it in the inspector or you
could potentially have something which
finds that object for you but this one
is possibly the quickest way to do it
not always the best but if you've only
got a few game objects and you need this
to happen it's a good way to just manage
the things that going on so what we'll
do is we'll write public and then
whatever game object and whatever
variable type should I say so we're
going to have a public game object and
then we're going to look for our object
that we want to activate it so we'll
just call this cube object for instance
and then I will put a semicolon on the
end and then what looking for that is
we're looking for a public game object
cube objects so we're going to reference
that in the inspector and then in our M
if statement of our trigger enter we can
say that cube object dot set active in
brackets we can put false or true
depending on which way I want to do it
we can save that out go back into unity
I've already got a cube here which will
be my cube object so this is the thing
we expect to disappear now what I'll do
is I'll duplicate this cube object which
is going to act as our collision so I'll
just make it bigger so we can walk
through it we'll make sure that it is
trigger we want to make sure on your
first-person controller and you are
tagged player if not already I just
imported the old unity four character
it doesn't matter for this but I've just
made sure that I am tagged play now what
we expect is based on this we will add
our script to our we'll just call this
our trigger and we will add the trigger
event game object script to the object
and now it's going to ask for it's not
gone game object that we want so I want
to add a cube there so we expect when we
walk through this collision the cube
will just disappear so we have our
trigger in front and there's a cube
there if we walk ahead you'll notice
that the cube just disappeared now you
can see that if we left this available
for the player running again it would
keep executing the code for as long as
you walk through the collider so then
what you could do is you could say at
the end of when you've activated the can
the game object that's going to just run
that line once then we can say this dot
game object dot set active this false
just like we did above so all we're
saying here is we'll just saying that
the game object err that we're currently
collided with we'll just set it to false
so we can't do anything with it again so
you'll notice that when I walk through
it again you'll notice that both items
will disappear so you'll see that both
things disappeared and in the hierarchy
you'll notice the cube and trigger above
active and set to false now that's good
in your game because you're not exactly
destroying it they still almost exist in
the game world but they're not taxing
any renderer or any adding any tries or
vertexes or shadow problems to your game
you're just getting rid of them so
they're not rendered anymore so it's
good if you want to bring them back or
bring game objects back if they're
already living in the scene so it's a
good way to manage things now that's
just the simple way to actually go about
doing it you could do this in a slightly
different way we could actually do
avoid start have two curly brackets
below so then what we could do is we
could essentially and make a private
variable so it could make private game
object and we could call this cube
object to for instance this is just for
the sake of this it essentially said
that cube object to an equals game
object with two capitals dot find object
with tag we could just use dot find and
then specify the name of the item that
we want but say you've got thousands of
objects in your game it's going to be
extremely slow to search it so it's
probably more beneficial to say that
okay
so cube object two equals game object
find and then we'll find the object with
the specific tag that we're going to
give so we'll give the object a tag of
cuba for instance and then we will add a
semicolon there so what this will do as
soon as this code is actually run are
you game is actually executed it will
say well we need to find the game object
with the tag cube and we'll
automatically add it to the script for
you without urine to specify in the
inspector so what we could do here is in
our script as another example is you
could do cube object two dots set active
and then in brackets false with a
semicolon now if you didn't do this
right it would throw up an error saying
it can't find the actual object but say
we've got cube here and what I'll do is
I've duplicated the cube and what I'll
do is I'll call this Q - there you go
now when I'm on this trigger you'll
notice that there's no public variable
for us to specify but with cube - we
need to give it a new tag so we could
essentially give it an actual tag called
we'll add a new tag and we'll call this
cube once we have that we'll go
back on cube to go to tags go to cube
and now it's got the tag of cube now
when we expect to play the game the game
will have already found that cube to
that we're actually looking for and we
expect that when we run through this
collision both cube one because we
already give gather in the inspector for
the public variable and we expect the
script to have already found cube 2
because it based on that tag that we had
given so if we walk through you'll
notice that everything disappeared so
based on everything we have we're just
telling the script to say right this is
the object that we have we've set up
here we've set we're looking for a game
object and then we're saying find it
with the tag of cube then when we go
through the collision we're saying that
if the collision and that were detected
we've seen the players collided with our
object will set cube object defaults
which is that and then cube object 2 is
also false and then we're just setting
the all color the Hulk of Collider
itself or the object that the script
sits on we just send that to fault as
well so really they're two simple ways
to either find an object to specify
itself in the inspector turn it off on
and similarly if you had a game object
which was false and you walked across it
up collider you could set it to true so
I'll give you a quick example I've just
turned a cube object to true so we
expect that if I turn the cube off with
this tick box at the top I press play
you'll notice that there's no cube there
anymore still cube 2 is alive we expect
this to turn off cube to turn off cube 1
to come alive again so what we'll do is
that's what exactly what's happened and
we can run back through the collider and
it doesn't exist because you can see
down in the hierarchy what's happened so
those are simple basic ways where you
can control logic in your game without
really doing that much groundwork to do
it but it's important to understand this
basic I've just been able to pretty much
just set active true or false to do
certain things so thanks very much for
watching
