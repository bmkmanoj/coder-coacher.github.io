today and this is what a few people
actually suggested I'm going to have two
variations to this sort of same tutorial
now this is going to be creating a
simple pause menu or repulse Crean or
whatever you want to think of it and
this is just going to be show you what
we're going to be creating so normally
what you could do is run around you see
and do whatever you need to do but if I
press P we'll get to a pause screen
obviously you can see that it looks like
it's paused and if I try and move around
I'll look around or anything I can't do
anything and I press P again I'm boring
part in the game and I can move around
and do whatever once again so I'll get
straight into it today what we're first
going to need to create is you're going
to need to go to game object create
other than GUI texture and once you've
created a GUI texture it will bring it
up into your scene obviously what like
exactly the same as this it looks
slightly different and all of them is
renamed this to pause GUI you can name
this to whatever you want but we're just
going to need to reference it in the
script later on now on you pause GUI you
want to actually add you texture that
you may have created so what I've done
is in Photoshop I've created m11 920 by
1080 workspace and then I've just added
a gradient square in the background and
move the opacity down and just put a
little bit of text over the top so when
we actually overlay that over the screen
a look like it's slightly greyed out so
what you could do is then import that in
and then put that into your text you
slow up here and then what you want to
do is set the pixel in set the width and
the height the same as you've set your
Photoshop document and if you've done
the same as me for a standard monitor
for HD monitor what you need to do is
set the pixel X&amp;amp;Y in set to minus 9 and
20 minus 540 because it's always half of
what you've set the width and height so
it presumes it in the center so what
we're initially going to do is start by
writing a new JavaScript and what we're
going to call this is
pause and then we'll open up in
monodevelop
and once that's open what we're going to
do is delete these two functions there
and we'll start by writing private
variable pause game as type boolean
equal to false then we'll write another
private variable called sure GUI is type
boolean equal to false but mine just
auto corrected it for me then we're
going to start by writing function up
there and then to kill the brackets two
curly brackets below that and then we'll
say pause game is equal to exclamation
mark pause again with a semicolon
then what we'll do is we'll set if pause
game is equal to true then we'll add two
curly brackets below then we'll actually
say time dot time scale is equal to zero
so that just actually stops I again from
doing anything and makes everything
pause then what we'll say is pause game
then we'll say pause game is equal to
true then we'll say game object dot find
open brackets main camera in quotations
main camera close the up getcomponent
open brackets mouse look closed up dot
enabled equals false so that means we
won't be able to look around anymore
then we'll say game object dot find open
brackets in quotes first-person
controller
close the table dot getcomponent
open brackets mouse look close that up
dot enabled equals false again then
we'll say sure Gy is equal to true then
what I'm going to say is that if pause
game is equal to false
now like two curly brackets below and
we'll copy all of this again from this
initial function start the function
solicitor and then I'll just farm at it
a little bit better now put timescale is
equal to one so we're setting it back to
normal time then we'll say pause game is
equal to false and showed UI is equal to
false then under here will say that if
Shoji uy is equal to true then we'll add
two curly brackets below and say that a
game object now this game object is a
lowercase G dot find open brackets in
quotes paused GUI like we set for the
actual GUI texture dot GUI texture dot
enabled equals true and then under here
we'll say else then two curly brackets
below what we'll do is copy this same
line and we'll paste that in and then
we'll say that Shoji uy is equal to
false one thing I forgot to do in my
script just above here is that I forgot
to put an input function and input
Stefan sure so if input so within the
stop the top of the actual update
function if import get key down open
brackets then we'll set P for pause and
then I add two curly brackets so now we
need to add a curly bracket right at the
end and one thing I did do wrong here in
diem
if pause is equal to true we need to
make these equal to true so we don't get
any problems cuz I forgot to change them
earlier and so then what we'll do is
we'll run the game on develop as long as
it's attached to your main camera you
can run around and then if you press P
you'll notice that pulse when we can't
look around anymore
press P again come out of it and we'll
be able to look around again
so as long as that's on your main camera
and you have I'll go through the script
real fast is that if you press P it will
change the boolean value of pause game
to true between true and false if it's
true we'll stop the game and we'll
disable the mouse look and we'll show
the GUI whereas if it's false we'll make
sure that we can play the game by making
time scale scale equal to one and making
sure that we can look around and then
dis am disabling the actual GUI so
that's pretty much it fairly basic
fairly straightforward and I'll have
another pause menu coming up in the
not-too-distant future so thanks very
much for watching and as ever don't
