a quick tutorial which is going to be
all about stop speeding up workflows and
such in 3dsmax and there's three key
elements that help you with your
modeling and things like that so I'm
going to show you how to hide an object
freeze an object and make an object
see-through or slightly invisible so you
can work with it I find that easy when
you're working with a rig than when
you're animating and things like that so
red I've got three objects here just a
really basic scene I'm just going to go
through some basics so you can
right-click any object and you get you
your task pane and what you can do here
is you can freeze a selection so when
you're going about you seen if you you
know you don't select an object if
you've got many parts to a certain model
that you making and you don't want to
have to click it you can freeze it and
it will always be frozen until otherwise
you say on freeze all and it will
unfreeze the actual selected object
which makes it easy to work with now
another one if you don't want this in
you've seen all the time you can
actually just hide that selection so in
your scene instead of it being frozen
it's out of the way and you can still
work on everything as well as you could
and you can click on hide all and it
will bring your objects back the last
one I'm going to show is how to actually
make your object invisible and all you
need to do is hold alt + X and I'll make
your object see-through it looks similar
to frozen but you can still move your
object but it just makes the actual mesh
slightly more transparent so you can see
through it doesn't affect rendering but
you press all X again and you bring it
back so there was three key things that
I think really helps out when you use in
