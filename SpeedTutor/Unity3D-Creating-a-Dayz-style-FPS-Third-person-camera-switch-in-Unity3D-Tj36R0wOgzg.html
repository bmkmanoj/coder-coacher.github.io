today and this is what somebody
suggested to me and it was about making
a third person and first person sort of
camera switch almost something that
you'd find in like desi and stuff like
that where you can run around in a
first-person mode to where my shoe or
whatever and then switch to third-person
to run around and look behind and do all
that sort of good stuff now this is
going to be really basic and I'm just
going to use a first-person controller
for that so it's gonna be simple but
just show you the basics of doing it so
you've got a first-person controller and
it'll have main camera on it and the
main camera will just be as it suggests
you know the first-person control of
will you know you could see some arms or
whatever you going to see there now what
I've done is I've gone to game object
create other and then I'm going to
create it in a camera and I've created a
camera and called it TP underscore
camera for third-person camera and I've
just positioned it as you can see in the
preview slightly behind my actual
character object and then what we'll do
is we'll parent it to the first-person
controller so it will always follow you
around so when we switch between them
you know you can switch between whatever
you want and it'll always follow your
pal so we'll create a new JavaScript and
call this view switch our camera switch
or whatever you're gonna have and then
we'll all but on one develop once that's
open we'll delete the two scripts here
and then we'll save variable fps camera
as type of camera and then we'll have
another variable called third-person
camera as type camera and then we'll do
is have a private variable called cam
switch as type boolean equal to false
then I'll write a start function and
then where are two curly brackets and
say that fps camera dot camera dot
enabled equals true so we'll have the
first curse and controller camera and
visible if not already and then we'll
add
the line called TP camera dot camera
died enabled equals false so we make
sure that's disabled then we're going to
add an update function and add to curly
brackets
and from there we'll set if input don't
get key down open brackets in quotes
whatever letter you want to use on your
keyboard so I'll write C for camera add
two Crockett's on there two curly
brackets below and then say cam-cam
switch is equal to cam switch but we
need to plug question exclamation mark
before that so it just as opposite of
what our boolean set up as then we'll
say if canvas which is equal to true or
like two curly brackets and then say
that we'll just take these two lines up
here copy and paste them in let's make
sure I organize them properly and then
we'll say 30fps can trump a camera is
false and the other camera is true and
then what I'll do is all right under
here else add two curly brackets under
there tablet out and I'll copy these two
lines again add those in and just make
sure that's organized there and what
we'll do is we'll change that to true
and this to false so we'll save that
I'll walk so what we're doing is were
saying the camera the first person
determines to true as soon as it starts
if we press C we sit a switch can switch
from false to true and if it equals true
we'll swap to the third-person camera
then if we press it again we'll
obviously be switching what comes which
is equal to true back to false so if we
do anything else than true we'll switch
the camera back one thing I'll mention
or I forgot to put a semicolon at the
end of there and if we save that out and
go back into unity and we go on our
first person controller and add the
script they want the view switch and
then we'll add the two cameras so the
main camera is going to be first person
camera
and then the TP camera is going to be
obviously the one that we set for the
variable now if we'll play it again and
you'll notice that we start off in first
person
if I press C you'll notice that the
camera switches and you know we can move
about as if you know or a third person
and if press again go back to first and
then you swap between depending what you
want to do so this you know simply just
use your two cameras and lets you switch
between them to curate you know that
sort of visual style as ever thanks for
watching and don't forget to Like
