since I last recorded a video and it's
been long process but I've worked I've
been working on quite a few bits which
include a system similar to Minecraft
another thing which is similar to base
building and been working on a level up
system so these are becoming in the next
few days or so but for today
I've actually got something which it's
quite rare it's quite a simple thing to
do but often the people struggle with it
and I struggled it with it myself
because it was a bow Center in your
cursor so when you run your game you won
your mouse to actually be in the center
of the screen so if you've made a
crosshair or something you'd always be
able to click at the correct point but
say I run the game now and we actually
have a look or where the mouse actually
is so from in the screen you see that my
mouse is here and wherever I would
actually click with my mouse would be
where I could click on something and
it's not directly in the center of my
screen all of the time so what we really
need to do is we just need to create a
simple script and we call this mouse
lock just something like that and then
if we open up the script and wait from
an undeveloped once that's up and what
we can do is we can delete the function
up there and in the function start what
we can do is we write screen dot lock
cursor equals true semicolon and then
what we could do is save that help and
then if you go to your main camera
anything like that and you just add the
mouse lock what you do is you realize
that when you go in your game and it's
not always apparent when you actually
build your game in the editor because
sometimes it's and do it properly but if
you actually build your game if you got
to you know build and run so they've got
build settings and you build your game
as you would do for a standalone project
you'll notice that it works prop
when you build the game it's just
something wrong with unities editor when
it comes to centralizing the mouse
cursor in the actual and when you run
your game in the engine itself
so as long as you build out it'll be
absolutely fine and it'll be at the
center so you will always know that in
the center of your screen you'll be able
to select objects and do things that you
want to do so thanks very much guys for
watching and as ever if you liked the
tutorial don't forget to Like comment
