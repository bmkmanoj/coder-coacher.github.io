May 2017 and this will feature the top
ten miscellaneous and other assets
including audio particles and other
things that may be in the comments you
can give me a suggestion on what I
should really call this because it's
just a category that doesn't fall into
model scripts Pack one is dqs materials
nature pack grass volume three bit of a
tongue twister but this comes with a
range of grass specific materials which
have been updated to include normal Maps
and it's got eighteen as it describes
real and stylized photos for you to use
for different types of terrain and
material so you can have a look at those
assets and textures if you want to
create that soft thing number two is the
surfaces light and this is a pack which
contains twelve specific materials and
you can buy a pro version of this asset
if you so wish and the materials look
like they include a soft metal some
shiny objects bricks and may be
varnished wood some crafts are sort of
foliage and other things very similar
and it looks like quite nice high
quality and materials number three is
the ft infinity light again this is a
free version of a soft package and it
comes with a range of particles which is
which will include lightning and a magic
sort of circle and tornado fire and it
allows you to customize the sort of
basic effects that we've got here and
get sort of a mixture of things that you
try to cheat number four is the Aria
soundscape sampler so this comes with a
range of battlegrounds and noises and
stuff associated with
and again it's a free version of a
bigger pack which willing now be your
number five is the breakable floor tiles
and you can see me rotating this around
here and it is a substance related and
material which is PBR ready and it has a
range it's just a material which can go
all the way up to 4k resolution and will
have different parameters for cracks
damage and other things which you can
create so you could accidentally added
two floors or walls to create variety
quite easily in unity 5 all you do is
you literally drag the material onto a
model and a way you can go adjusting the
settings number six is the particle
starter pack and this is an asset which
includes of that a variety of sparks
fireworks lightning bolts and other
things like that which will get you
started for no just giving you examples
of how you can achieve certain particle
effects and things like that and number
seven is the simple scope 2d and this is
a nice little sort of scripted asset
which can easily customize the style and
look of a sniper scope which might be
associated with a particular 2d game and
you can you know take a look at that if
that's something you wanting to achieve
and number a is the uber shader for
sprites for unity 5 and this is a shared
at which on top of other shares it
renders alpha blended objects which sort
of consist of sprites and it allows you
to use normal macula nom mapping
specular emission and lots of other sort
of PBR related items and it's similar to
the standard shader and it won't be sort
of performance here if you don't use all
the slots available and it becomes with
the UI so you can quite easily take a
look at all the things that it offers if
that's something you're looking for
number nine is the sci-fi a master pack
sampler and yet again this is a simple
audio pack which includes
fu sound effects which includes a tank
shop spaceship epic backing and other
sort of things which is of a larger
package includes over a hundred and
sounds available and you can check out
the soundcloud and number ten I think
this is a pretty nice one is the
semi-transparent outline shader and this
one is a shader which can draw the
outline of an object even sort of when
it is a transparent one so you can see
in the images below that the object here
has got the red outline and this three
we canvassed other objects as you agree
and it helps you create a sort of maybe
a highlight system for your game if
that's something that you're trying to
achieve and might help you and it does
suggest that it's best it's not based on
any image processing effect so you can
get better performance out of this so
yet again you can check any of the free
asset alpar linked in the description
for all the free assets that are
available for May 2017 and you can check
them all out at your heart's content
