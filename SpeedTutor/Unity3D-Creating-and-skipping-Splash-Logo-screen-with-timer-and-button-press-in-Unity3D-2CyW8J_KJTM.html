to make a simple splash screen and then
to a main menu almost when you start
again and you see the company's logos
coffins and such that you want to skip
between those and maybe it could be a
splash screen to ammend menu a splash
screen to your main game but I'll show
you something simple how to go through
that based on a time interval that you
give so I've got a new unity senior and
you can see by the blue background so
what I want to do is save this scene as
maybe main menu so I've got that then I
want to make a new scene then I'll save
that as maybe splash screen to put your
logo so if I open up my splash screen
because it's my splash screen up there
and then I've got the main camera so if
I gone game object career other GUI
texture you can see when my game tabs
open
there's my scene as we games have you
get the default unity logo just appear
there so I created something earlier
just a second in Photoshop just as an
example
so there's your logo so you can drag
click back on the GUI object drag the
logo to the top of there you see it fits
in that arrangement now you need to go
to the pixel inset it sometimes closed
up you just open it up and you'll want
to just write the actual resolution that
is a part of your screen so mine is 1001
920 by 1080 because I'm just a standard
HD monitor and then yourse notice that
even when I run the game there's a bit
off position so what I usually like to
put in is you might want to mess around
the actual value you can do this in code
but to save time here so I just use
minus 9
day by 5:30 and you can see when you
play it you roughly get it into the
margins but you can mess around with
that your own leisure
and you'll notice sometimes if you
haven't positioned it totally you'll get
that blue behind your camera but what
you can do to get rid of that is if you
open it be camera and go to the
background you can change the color to
black and then you don't quite notice as
much but that's just personal preference
of course so essentially we've got our
logo screen here and if we open up men
menu we'll just save that you can tell
this is MIT this is going to be our main
menu because it's blue so it's different
to what we have here so essentially now
what we want to do is create the
JavaScript file so you can chain may
name that splash to menu doesn't really
matter whatever you want well up
monodevelop
and I'll just arrange my sin tax cuts
that's how I like to use it so what we
want to do is essentially when this code
starts but we're going to just tell it
after asset Mart seconds to move to the
next menu so what we want to do is write
yield where four seconds and then you
want to write in the amount of seconds
you want to wear it so for instance
let's write three for this instance so
you're going to wait three seconds add
your semicolon then write application
dot lured level and then inside your
brackets inside yeah quotation whatever
you called you've seen that you want to
load so mine was main menu so
essentially this is all you need to do
for this so save that out and nothing
will work until you attach the script
something so if you go to the main
camera drag the splash to menu on there
you'll see it appear on the script but
if you try this just running it nothing
on happen and you'll probably get an
error message unless you've gone into
build settings beforehand and added
splash screen and men menu all you need
to do is just drag them into this box
and just so that the game can build them
in in the runtime so essentially as you
saw before I can press play wait three
seconds essentially and then it moves to
your main menu but say you waiting for a
longer period of time I say we'll change
this to 30 seconds and you want to wait
30 seconds before it skips so you've got
an intro sequence or something like that
a video you can write a simple if if
statement just to detect whether you've
actually put a button down so you want
to write if open brackets input get key
down and then you want to write keycard
and then whatever function you have on
your keyboard so I usually like to use
the spacebar please write space and then
if you got drop a line down application
don't just like the top you can copy it
whatever you want
lord love them and then you're going to
write exactly the same thing in this box
just show that if you press your space
spacebar you'll load that scene so you
don't have to wear that 30 seconds every
time and it's in your update function
because it needs to be checked every
frame so if you save that out on
WordPress player you'll see that we're
waiting a period of time on three
seconds press space you hit B press
space it goes straight to the next scene
so essentially that's just something
simple to go from one screen to another
period of time skipping it yourself
whatever you want so anyway guys thanks
