trial today and this is gonna be the
part 4 to the save system series and
this is gonna be all about having a sort
of autosave or when you walk into a
collision then you will do a save and
it's going to be very similar to what
we've done before with the 7 mechanics
we've done with the simple save and just
running these lines of content which we
need to run to make it do the save so
say we want to create a collision and
every time you walk into it it does the
actual save that we won so what we can
do is we can go create C sharp and then
we can call this save trigger something
like that will open up and we'll get a
new script
and what we're gonna do by start by
writing in here is we're gonna say that
void on trigger enter brackets Collider
with a capital then other lowercase
after that then we're going to have two
curly brackets below and then we're
going to say that if other dot compared
tag in brackets in quotes and ammo right
layer or whatever your own character
will be tagged normally player then we
can put in here the lines of code that
we want to do so we can just grab all
this say copy that control C control V
to paste it in we also need to make sure
that we are have got the two variables
that we need so we'll put those at the
top of here above the method and then
we'll save that and we also need to do
at the top we need to say using unity
and
Jhin don't see management with a
semicolon so we're doing is you're on a
trigger event we're looking for the
player and then we're going to set the
position save the scene and save any of
the variables that we need to save and
you can look back in the other tutorials
of part 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 for looking at how to do
this more thoroughly so we've got a
simple trigger what we'll do is we will
create a game object 3d object cube I'll
love the cube to this floor I will put
it in the Blue Square so we can see it
when we reload and what we'll do is we
will make sure that this is is trigger
over here we'll add the save trigger
over there we'll make sure we add the
manager game object and also will add
the player
I'll make this trigger slightly bigger
and we could end up getting rid of the
mesh render if you want but for the sake
of this we'll just leave for now before
you do anything you need to make sure
that your FPS controller has a tag of
player on it just for the sake of this
now when we play the game we expect to
run through this collision like we've
just done and if it's words we'll be
able to press when we reload we'll be
able to load and we'll move exactly
where we just saved at that collision
and we can add a line of code in so when
you've walked through the collision and
all this you could say they stopped game
objects active and then in brackets
false with a semicolon so what this
means is that when you walk through it
it's gonna set it to not active anymore
so you can't walk through it multiple
times into a save so you see I just
walked into it and it's disappeared but
it will still executed all the lines of
the saving before it turns off
and then you could essentially add to
your own sort of UI pop-up to say that
you've saving or you're doing something
with a game to make easier for players
to understand so that's pretty much it
just having a simple collision with a
non trigger event adding those lines of
code and then turning it off after and
then you can do your loading however you
like to do it if you're gonna do it for
them following me or the tutorials so
thanks very much for watching don't
