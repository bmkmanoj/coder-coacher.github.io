five editor extensions for August 2017
an embalmer got the kriti as a grass
system which is an alternate system to
what you'll find for the default unities
of grass rendering system and it
suggests that it's a fast and optimized
system for speech resale grass and it
can handle millions of outdoor blades of
grass in itself there is a warning on
this it does say that it's quite complex
to set up so if you're just a beginner
of unity' this might not be something
that you want to specifically jump into
a hundred plus FPS at millions of actual
grass samples you can instance all the
things that are there you can have an
LOD system wind effect in the grass and
saleable terrain support and math so let
me check this out if you're looking for
free solution to something that's likely
better than what you find out of the box
in unity and number two is my crossbow
which is a modular terrain shader and
this is from the person and created the
mega spot and this is a modular terrain
style shared of the design for ease of
use and to increase performance and it's
a replacement for the current shared of
which the unity terrain uses it supports
PBR a related rendering and automatic
generation of normal height smoothness
ambient occlusion and it supports high
based blending it has substance support
and it's significantly faster than any
other supported shared that you can find
for the terrain on the UNC assets top
number three is we've got something
called component finder which requires
unity 4.5 and above so it's for a lot of
different uses and you can find easily
find the actual components they're
actually live and you've seen any one
time and it's just a quick and easy way
to display the actual components that
are in you seen only on game objects so
you can find stuff like rigid bodies box
colliders audio sources without you
having to trail around
look friend and it's just a woman click
tool to do it and number four is a
selection of features that have provided
by and the octane render has just been
added into unity 2017 and it's their
octane render which is in preview
currently and it's a physically accurate
way to render and Youth the Unity engine
which will allow a lot more powerful
based GPU accelerated rendering and
allows you to create a lot of different
examples so you can take a look at this
one which is specifically a forest EMA
and you can see what features are
offered here we've got another one which
is their cue sticks demo so if you
imagine when something's underwater and
you see the sort of firm the godrays and
the acoustics they'll underwater when
the light changed through and even the
emissive materials and missile materials
of ones that give off light that you
could see these little white balls in
this sink and you can see this is
another example of how it works with
this new octane render and the last one
is the animation to the sprite sheets
animation and it's a 2d plugin which
instantly creates a sprite sheet and
I've mentioned avoiding the actual
animation or the editor which is in side
unity which is fairly easy to use you
can animate and by the actual frames of
the sprite reverse the animation after
the first loop you can infinite loop the
actual animation that you've got you can
configure the speed you've got a manager
with all the information and you can
check for duplication so those are the
top five editor extensions for August
2017
and I will put all the links in the
description so you can check out all the
assets that I have featured in the
series of videos this month so thanks
for much watching
