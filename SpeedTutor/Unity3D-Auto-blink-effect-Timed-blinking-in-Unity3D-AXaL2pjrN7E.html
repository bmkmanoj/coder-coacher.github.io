from my blinking tutorial that I did and
build down and this is just going to be
because a few people asked about almost
blink blink and automatically so I'm
going to incorporate this with my
previous one of my previous tutorials
which is about a timer so I'm going to
combine the blinking with the timer to
create something that where you blink
just automatically say every you know a
couple of seconds you can change it
depending on what you know you feel
that's best but I'll do this now and
what we do is I've deleted the left
click option from the update function so
we can pretty much start again so we've
still got the stuff the two variables
and the stuff in the start what we need
to do we need to make a variable called
timer set that type floor and set it
equal to 2.0 you know whatever you want
your timer to be equal to really then
we're going to make a private variable
and call that blink set that as type
boolean set equal to false and then
within the update function we want to
say that timer minus equals time dot
delta time so that means it'll just
count down every in our second or so
with depending what timer is equal to
then we need say if timer is less than
or equal to zero then add two curly
brackets underneath and we'll save them
timer is equal to two so we're resetting
the timer when it gets to zero and then
blink is equal to true and then
underneath here will say that if blink
is equal to true then add two curly
brackets and in there what we'll do
under here like we did in the other
script we're just gonna pair well we're
just going to put you know top lid to
animation up player and the animation
that we had and bottom lid the animation
dot player with the
the bottom animation that we have and
then we're going to say blink is equal
to false so we'll save that out and what
this does is the timer will count down
when two seconds gets to zero then the
turn will be reset to - blink will equal
true and if it is equal true it'll play
the animation after the animations are
played it will be set back to false so
we can't do it until the timer goes down
each point to make sure that's attached
to your main camera or wherever you've
got your script to go and you walk
around you know and then you'll see
automatically that the blink will
actually happen and you can see down at
the bottom you'll see that two seconds
counts down you know you can make this
as much as you want but um you see
they'll matter what I do the animation
still plays all the time till you tell
it to stop bar till you do a counter to
stop it after a certain amount of times
well that was pretty much it pretty
brief but it was pretty simple thanks
very much for watching and as ever if
you liked the tutorial don't forget to
