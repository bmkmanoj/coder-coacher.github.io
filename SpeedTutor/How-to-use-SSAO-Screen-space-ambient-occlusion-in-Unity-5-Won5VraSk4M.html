tutorial and now today we're going to be
looking at another image effect this is
gonna be screen space ambient occlusion
our SS AO now a lot of games would do it
by you can use light mapping and
probably the new features in unity 5 to
bake these inti textures because you
used to be able to put the ambient
occlusion in with the baked global
illumination we have a ambient occlusion
setting there so we can adjust that
accordingly now if you want it to have
the more of a real-time look are you
struggling with baking your textures out
especially for unity 5 this also did
work for you with unity fall but I think
it's a really nice effect now if you see
in my game and I play it and we just
have a look around everything's very
clean let's say and if you look in the
real world and you look an object that
say this object here or this object here
it doesn't have any direct light going
towards it so the sun's up here and it's
pointing down over here so this has
direct light on here and that light
bounces around realistically and that's
why you get the softness of in this side
now as I said objects in the real world
if you've got an object if you look on
your desk or whatever it might be
you'll see a shadowing beneath the areas
that touch another area I'm not sure if
that's the best way to explain it but if
we grab the unity 5 character controller
and we select the main camera which is
the first person control agar component
image effects rendering and then screen
space ambient occlusion we'll add that
to our scene and it will add it to the
main camera now if we go to the game
view without playing well I can do his
own ticket and you can see for every
edged area that meets another sort of
flat surface we get a darkened area
which can make it look a little bit more
realistic if you don't really overdo it
so we can Tom the radius turn the radius
down on this
side to about not point to you can
increase the sample count which will
increase the use of overall quality you
can increase the intensity so it gets
darker and darker and that might be if
you want a sort of stylized look for
your game if you want it to look maybe
more cartoony and you can see between
each of the areas we've got the actual
dark and areas you can increase the blur
amount I'll go back into Bell blur you
need some blur or a look and we'll take
it down there look very odd and patchy
down sampling will take down the quality
if needs be or to make it more optimized
the occlusion attenuation is how far it
sort of fades off along similarly with
the minimum sort of a Zed buffer is the
smaller amount that we give it on the
higher amount today say we can adjust
the amount that which we see so we don't
want something to over kill the entire
scene that we've got so again if we play
it and have a look you can see that it
adds an overall it might not be the best
for this scene in particular but you can
notice the difference
it looks quite clean and now we can add
some ambient occlusion to the overall
edges of our scene which is a fairly
simple we're just a simple image effect
on the camera but can sometimes add a
little bit more realism if you
struggling in that area so this was just
a short one so thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
