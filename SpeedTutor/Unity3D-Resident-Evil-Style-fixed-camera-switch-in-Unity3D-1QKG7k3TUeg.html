tutorial which is a little bit of a
throwback to what you might have played
if you played the original Resident Evil
games on the PlayStation 1 or somewhere
around that time it may well have been
another game since then but that's the
earliest type of game that I remember
all it is really is this one camera if
you can see my camera preview faces from
here looking towards the player in that
direction and then camera 2 if you can
see looks across in this direction now
there's no camera on your first birth
control obviously because we're not
doing it in first-person anymore so
we're doing it so there's a fixed camera
so what you want to create is two
cameras in fixed position looking
roughly across a room orbit within two
rooms so when you walk through a doorway
it'll switch to the other camera as if
you were playing a more traditional LAN
game that you'd see on the earlier
platforms now obviously if you want to
create a camera you can go game object
to create all that and then camera and
then obviously if you use your
first-person controller take the main
camera off the object and then all
you're going to need is a Collider which
is in between your doorway or wherever
you're gonna put it to try and do this
effect so really my Clyde is just a
really thin box and make sure that it's
set is trigger and always remember that
you play a needs to be tagged player so
we can make the collider work so
initially we're going to start writing
the script so what we're going to do is
create JavaScript and I'm gonna call
call this simple swap I don't know name
it's something that helps you remember
now I'm gonna open up in monodevelop
once mon develops up and what we're
gonna do is i'll delete these two
functions for now and what i'll do is
write variable come 1 as type of camera
variable come to as type camera then
i'll have a private variable called
walked
in its type boolean equal to false then
wonder what we're gonna do is go write
function start and then we're gonna add
two curly brackets below then we're
gonna say Camborne dot camera dot
enabled the equals true and then come to
dot camera dot enabled equals false so
that just means camera one's gonna start
off being our active camera or whatever
company you wanted to Spig in with when
you begin your game so what you want to
do is start by writing on the function
on trigger enter as we've done a lot of
times we fall open up the brackets right
cut Col : Collider then close that then
add two curly brackets below we'll set
if call dot tag but a unity
autocorrected it cold
is equal to player then for like two
curly brackets below and so that walked
in is equal to question exclamation mark
walked in and that just means when we
enter the collider else set walked in
between two men true and false so we can
we're going to be able to switch back
and forth between the two cameras when
we move between the doorways so what
we're going to do is then write function
update and two brackets two curly
brackets below and then what would say
is if walked in is equal to true then
we'll add two colored brackets and say
like we did initially here we're gonna
do is piss that in I'll just arrange
these more neatly then we'll say that
cam 1 is equal to what false and come
two is equal to true so initially once
we've walked in it once ill switch
cameras or will actually switch the
direction and then what we'll do is it's
copy this if statement again and we'll
paste it in below then we'll say if
walked in is equal to false
we'll do exactly like the top will do
that camera one is equal to true and
camera two is equal to false and we'll
save that so as I've said initially set
whichever color you want then when we
walk into the collider we want to change
the boolean value and then when it's
true or false it changes the colors
accordingly now what you want to do is
add the script to your Collider and then
once we've added it to the collider what
we need to do is add camera one and
camera two so I've named it come one and
come to so we don't get confused and
then we'll add those two into there and
obviously when I play this because a
first-person control is meant to have
the camera for you to look in the
first-person view the controls might be
a little bit awkward so you might need
to go into the controller itself and
change the script like if I press W
it'll go sideways and if PI press it
he'll go forward so you really need to
just change those controls up so I'm
going to try and get through this
Collider without so I'm gonna walk
through it and it switched my camera and
if I go back is switched my camera again
and vice-versa you can switch your
camera angle so as you would when you
walk down a corridor in one of the
earlier Resident Evil games you will get
that sort of look about it so that just
basically shows you how you can switch
between two cameras based on the actual
movement of your camera I've done very
similar tutorials before but hopefully
this helps you sort of go back in time
and make something like the made a long
time ago so thanks very much for
watching and as ever don't forget to
