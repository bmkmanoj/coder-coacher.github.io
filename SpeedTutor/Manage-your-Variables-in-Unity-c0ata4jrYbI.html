another tutorial today and this is gonna
be showcasing and sort of explaining the
best way to manage variables within your
scripts might not exactly be very
glamorous but in a way is really
important because you can help you in
the long run especially if you've got
lots of variables just cluttering up
even the inspector or in your scripts
and you just want a nice way to manage
them make them look nicer and have them
more user friendly if you do choose to
use them in the inspector but sometimes
if you have things as public ill make
them visible in the inspector but you
don't always want them to be public
because you might not want them
accessible outside of a script because
public allows you to make sure that if
you've got another script you can access
the variable or say a function or method
elsewhere which say in another script we
had a damage script we can update our
healthslider on our our health depending
on what we've done in our other script
and it can be a nice where if you need
to do it but if you don't it's good to
keep it private but then again if you've
got it as private you can't actually see
it in the inspector and you want to be
able to see it sometimes so for instance
if that we've got this in the middle
here max health as private we can
actually see it but if we write in
square brackets we can write in those
square brackets a serialized field and
now if we serve that out and go back
into unity you can see that max health
appeared and we've got it back in the
inspector where you can still see is it
is still a private variable so it's not
accessible anywhere else but now it is
visible similarly with the one below we
can have square brackets and so this
public fall rate that we never wanted to
be able to see in the inspector and we
just wanted to get rid of it so we
didn't have to be able to see it we can
just write in square brackets hide an
inspector and what we can do is we can
save that out it still means that it's
public so accessible everywhere else but
back inside unity you can see that then
disappears when it's compiled and we
don't actually have to see in the
inspector anymore so it's not cluttering
up anything there
now that's all well and good but you
know then the very
that we'd seen there in the inspector
we're all quite cluttered up and it just
didn't look nice it just was a bit hard
to see so what we can do is you can
break stuff up by writing two square
brackets or above whichever section of
variables you want you can write
something like header and then in two
brackets facing away from each other
inside quotation marks we can write
something like health variables and we
can save that go back into unity and
when it recompile so you can see that
now we've got a header which says health
variables so we've got a nice way to
sort of organize everything within the
inspector and from here we can do
exactly the same thing so we could copy
that head paste it below for the actual
first variables and edit a health and
call this first minimise this and you
can see now we've got another title and
similarly with that what we can do is we
can instead of having a header we can
just write in square brackets space and
then in actual just normal brackets we
can specify a value so we can specify a
value of 10 when we insert that out and
you can see now it's best out via value
of 10 usually good to go up in
increments of 10 so you can go to 20 if
you wanted a sort of double space like
these above but it just allows you to
manage everything and break things apart
when you don't need them all to be
together and what you can even do if you
want to solve try and give some hints
for specific actual variables that you
might want for the inspector you can add
tooltips so you can write in square
brackets tooltip and in quartz in
brackets in quotes you can write in
something like this is for maximum first
and then we can save that out and go
back into unity and you can see that the
map you can see that if I try and hover
over any of these other variables
nothing happens if I hover over the max
first you can see we now have a tooltip
this is for maximum the first and that
allows you to just nicely arrange those
variables so they're very much easy for
anybody to come in and have a look
really easily and not have to sort of
trouble you with anything you've got you
can use regions to organize the
variables that you've got here so you
can use
- region and then have this as all my
variables and then you could use an end
region here for instance and save that
out once you've saved it will have a
little icon at this side to just
minimize it so you can say that those
are all my variables but say I just
wanted to hide all the variables at once
so I didn't have to be able to see them
I can just put it at the end there and
we'll be able to collapse it and you can
see that all my variables are collapsed
in one so that just helps you to nicely
manage everything that's there that's
not just appropriate for variables you
can use that for all of your code so you
can region off different blocks of code
you can use to make a private visible
within the inspector and headers
tooltips and spaces and region off
variables when it's actually required so
hopefully this is just a fairly simple
straightforward - Charles just to give
you some tips and tricks on managing the
things that you want to manage so thanks
