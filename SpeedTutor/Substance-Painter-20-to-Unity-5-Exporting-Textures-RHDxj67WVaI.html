today and this is gonna be about
exporting your Maps or your asset from
substance painted to into unity 5 so
I've got myself an asset here that I've
made and I've texted it using substance
now we want to be able to export this
for use in unity 5 and people on my
advance will know what to do but if
you're new to the software and you want
a quick guide just go file X bar
textures obviously have to use text read
your asset you'll get the export
documents or wizard out here and we can
click on the configuration tab and we
can run down to the unity 5 standard
metallic is the most common type that
we're going to export out to you can do
the specular setup if that's what you've
chosen to do when you start up your
substance document but we'll choose the
standard Metallica and we will get these
channels by default so we'll get a
mission normal metallic smoothness and
I'll be the transparency and these were
the ones we need by default now if you
do have number in occlusion map that you
might have begged out during you know
when you were part in this asset you
might want to add that channel so all we
need to do is click at the top wire we
can go create we want to create a grade
Channel and we want to in the mesh map
slot we want to add ambient occlusion to
this side and choose a great Channel and
then what we like to do is just copy a
texture set above pissed in here and
just rename the emission to AO or
something like that
so we're going to have the albedo the
metallic roughness the normal and the AO
you can it will export a mixture
animation map if you have one on a
channel available we can go export then
we can choose what file format we want
so usually a tag is good 8 bits and we
want to choose the configuration so we
want to choose unity 5 stand metallic
which matches what we just made in the
config
raishin you want to set whatever
document says you want to export your
textures out so I'll just use 2k and we
want this texture set here and then you
want to choose where to save it so I'll
just save it into my unity project
so once I've selected a twitch where I
want to save it is we'll click export
and it will run through that it may say
there's some warnings that's probably
because it can export the emission map
because there's no emission Channel
actually on my model so now I can go
into unity again and this is the scene
that I already had open before all I've
got in this scene is a plan of a dark
material and I've already imported my
FBX model into unity and if you're not
aware of how to do that you can just
right click import new asset and choose
whatever file format your model is I've
said you just generate light mapping
movies and it's gonna bring the material
in for me so I can just put my textures
straight on we can add this into the
unity scene what I'll do is I'll rotate
this 90 degrees just so it's upright put
it in front of the scene here we'll zoom
in a little bit and we can drop down on
the living room mirror and we want to
just add the albedo transparency we want
to add the ambient occlusion that we
added specially we want to add the
metallic smoothness and we want to add
the normal map and it might look a bit
weird until you click fix and now and
then when you click fix now you'll see
in the scene and there's material with
the maps added you can add the emission
if it's available and the height if
you've exported that out if you have
that on your model but other than that
this is just a simple way to export
materials from substance painter to our
into unity 5 so thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
