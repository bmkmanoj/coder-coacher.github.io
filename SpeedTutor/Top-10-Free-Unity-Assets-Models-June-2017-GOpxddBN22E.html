models on model packs for June 2017 you
can get all the featured mold packs from
my asset link that I will leave in the
description so the first asset we have
here is the ultimate cannon tower which
is a low poly model and that's currently
rigged and you can see the video that's
playing in the background and it's
rigged with a various couple of
animations including idol and fire
number 2 is the a love Polly style tree
pack 1 and this comes with a range of
love poetry assets with three trees four
stumps a rock and a grass and you can
vary the look of each of these and this
is quite a nice little pack to create
some sort of low poly terrain and assets
to go with it number three is the genie
lamp which is a PBR asset which has a
2,000 by 2,000 texture with your regular
PBR assets and you can check this out on
the star and you can scoot around the
the sketchpad model to have a little
luck number four we have the sword a
under skull base which is a fairly high
quality sword which is about two
thousand triangles and it comes with PBR
up to 4k materials and it's quite a nice
very high detailed looking sword which
could use within you game number five is
the Roman city low poly pack one light
which looks like it will be as part of a
bigger pack is some building faces some
pillars of roofs some few assets and
some trees and it all looks pretty
modular so it should all snap together
nicely number six is the lovely animals
pack and this is a pack of six
characters with the various amount of
animations including idle walk jump
stone attack with fairly low resolution
textures which look quite nice and a
sort of cutesy style number seven is the
high detailed racing car zero five is
completely textured with
professional-looking content about
eleven and a half thousand polygons the
fairly detailed and ready to go with and
area and as well number 10 is the
survival kit light which is comes with
eight PBL models ranging from 256 to 2k
and all models have little miniature
icons and you can see them in here comes
with an apple a knife a flat battery
torch and our flashlight and some a
bottle of water and maybe a piece of
rope and these look quite nice if you
you know looking to create a lot of
survival game or even bulk abuse scenes
you know here after and number nine is
the 3d sci-fi kit static it quite a nice
one and it comes with Audia modular
assets to careers of sci-fi looking area
with bends and doorways corridors flaws
roofs and those types of things and it
should all start together seeing as
though it's modular and number 10 is the
stylized a male cowboy or the cowboy
character which comes from the
third-person cover shooter template and
this character doesn't come with any
animations or anything like that but
it's just the base character as you see
here and it's a quite a nice little
stylized character if you're looking for
that type of theme so yeah again thanks
very much for watching and you can check
out all the models that I featured and
all the other assets that are available

June 2017 on my link that I'll provide
