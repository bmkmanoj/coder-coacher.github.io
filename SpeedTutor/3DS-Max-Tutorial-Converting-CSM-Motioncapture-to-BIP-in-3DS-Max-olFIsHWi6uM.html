convert your standard CSM motion capture
files into dot bit which you can use on
a biped or a cat rig depending what you
want to do so if you just go to create
systems biped I usually like to use drag
positions so it keeps set stay at scale
so i don't need to adjust heights every
time as long as you've got your biped
selected like heavier click on the
pelvis wherever if you go over to the
motion tab and you got all the way down
to motion capture it may not be opened
up for you but just open it out then you
can go to load motion capture file click
there you may need to change the file
type to CSM if if not already so then
you're going to want to choose a motion
capture file you've got so here's the
range motion captures that I didn't
studio so if I open up my flinch
sometimes it brings up a warning talking
about some bonds and unrecognized but
use okay without and it should be fine
now most of these settings on here set
standard really you can put keyframe
reduction on if you don't want so many
keyframes down to the bottom of the
timeline but for my sake for showing you
this it doesn't really matter so if you
just press ok you buy a pedal change
position and if we scrub across the
timeline you can see that it's just a
range of the motion capture that I did
so once you've got that on your bipeds
got all the motion capture on if you go
up to buy a ped still on the motion tab
click save file and then you click the
drop-down save is dot bit you can save
it as flinch whatever you want and there
we go you can use it on your cat rig
later on Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
