tutorial today and this is gonna be
looking at another image effect and this
is gonna be color correction this time
so a lot of movies a lot of games a lot
of things like that that you will see
are even photos that people take would
use color correction to almost allude to
a different sort of style set or keep
everything in it and a set style that
you want now in real life sometimes
things look overexposed and look a bit
too bright and in movies you could to
make something look more dark and dingy
they'll put a color correction over it
to make it look dark and maybe bring the
Browns out or some Reds out greens it
depends and games like fallout 3 had an
overall sort of green tinge to it and
they probably used some color correction
to sort of get that overall feel now in
unity 5 if we select the first-person
controller you drag that into your scene
and you select the first person
character which is the camera now and
you've got a component image effects and
we'll go to color adjustments we can
choose color correction curves and
saturation color correction 3d lookup
texture and color correction ramp now
today we're going to concentrate on the
color correction curves and saturation
because this is what I'm more familiar
with from Unity fall now if we uncheck
the box you can see that we've got a
certain set of sort of parameters that
we can adjust we can adjust saturation
so if we pulled the saturation all the
way up we can get Marva a car to any
bright feel about everything we pull the
saturation all the way down we'll get a
black-and-white look now if you keep out
one that abyss and normal volume now
you've got two different modes simple
and advanced simple it just lets you
just the RGB values of everything that
you see an advance lets you change the
depth of the RGB so all that end up
changing your sky and things like that
now if we keep it on simple for now and
we go to the red curve I usually like to
have a curve which
is this curve that's preset at the end
you can make your own curves and you can
add your own keyframes in to adjust
accordingly
but with this curve that slowly moves up
and then curves back out and if you add
that to every single one you'll get an
overall darkened feel to your scene now
of the different presets we can change
so we'll get a more of a smooth curve
towards the top and I'll bring more of
the red saturation out we can do
something similar with the green so
we'll pull that as a sort of a belly
curve towards the bottom and we'll get a
really pink issue and we'll do the same
with the blue and we can make all sorts
of different colors depending on what
we're after within our scene so if I
take them all back to the end value so I
just over one want the dark or we can
right click at the curve at any point
add a keyframe and adjust the actual
correction accordingly you can adjust
the little sweepers and you can curve
that around depends how you want to have
it so we'll have more of a a bluish
tinge there we'll add another keyframe
in here and we'll pull it sort of
towards a darker purple and then we'll
select our red Channel and we'll pull
that again
maybe down towards a sort of dark blue
and we'll even that out really it's all
dependent on what objects you've gotten
you seen really my all my objects in my
scene I just very it's a very plain and
not very much to them so it won't affect
it greatly it might not happy how you
want so you can obviously add another
keyframe and if you want it to adjust
different areas so get a more purple
issue where we've got our direct light
and then the blue in the corners we can
add the advanced like I was talking
about so we can adjust the depth and now
we can see we can adjust the sky which
is going to affect everything else which
is not
within solve the range of the camera and
blend curve allows us to get an overall
blend of the objects that are there we
can choose selective which will sort of
even out the color on the brighter areas
and we can choose a color to be the set
color and we want to be the target
so really Marcel for the color
correction it's best to just have a
really experiment yourself and decide
what sort of luck are you wanting
something more Spacey something more
we're just too dark and the overall
scene so I wanted to make it look
margarin gee it's really dependent on
what you've seen your going for and how
you want it to look because with just
that simple curve of dark and a little
bit in the areas that and it sort of
brings out the contrast a little bit
more so really it's up to you on how you
want to portray but thanks again for
