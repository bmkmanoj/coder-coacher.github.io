things that you might not have known
about unity now number one is the one
the feature that I quite like to use is
that you've got the gizmos up at the top
farm moving of a moving panning rotating
and scaling now the other one which is
the is the rec tool and it's often used
for UI is to scale up you eyes but you
can also use it as a jaw functionality
for 3d objects so if you click on a 3d
object you get almost like a little
miniature bounding box around and you
can select on the very edges of the
bounding and you can be able to scaling
from the actual edges that you could in
a 3d program if you were to select on
the actual face of the object another
world another good one is if you've got
a light probe group like this as an
example you can use it for any gizmo
that appears in the scene and sometimes
these get in the way especially if
you're doing your lighting and things
like that I might be any particular item
you've got within your game you can go
to the top corner here and choose gizmos
and you can show and hide different
things that you might have not one so
you can go down to light probe group and
on ticket and you want I should be able
to see those just with the same with any
of the gizmos and elements that you've
got whether it's lights audio sources
and they'll have different little
miniature images and you can choose to
hide those if you don't want to have
them visible in the editor number three
is especially when you're in the editor
you have for some quick selections up at
the top so you can move to 2d you can
choose to show the lighting in you scene
if it's toggled on you can choose to
turn audio and title it off for the
entire scene or you can choose to toggle
off the skybox and other effects if it
includes image effects so this can be
something you can do to test without
having you to go into the game view to
have a look you can choose to have
lighting on our off take off effect and
you can see as it's just default late
later you can put the lighting back on
and the effects and they'll be fine for
the scene it's a good way to get a
ground of testing different things and
being able to see things without some of
the other things getting in the way if
you've put a lot of post-processing on
another one is looking at the rendering
modes we've got
of rendering modes that it might not
views before and if you click at the top
where it not often say shared it you can
choose a lot of different rendering
modes and they're good for debugging and
things like that you can check out
wireframes so you can have a look around
your scene and you can see the wireframe
is often you would see in a 3d program
you can see a shared wireframe so you
can still see everything as it is now
you can see a lot of different things
for miscellaneous things you can see the
text quality emit maps you can see alpha
channels the shadow cascades if you've
got any deferred think you can see the
things for global illumination and if we
hadn't new light maps backed out we
could actually see the resolution of the
little and texels that we've got there
and we can go through various different
muv charts and things to be able to see
your a missive albedo and all the
different channels that we might have
you can take a look at the different the
stats window which is often a really
good one to check out what currently our
fps is sitting up all the tries and draw
calls that are currently when you're
looking directly with your camera to
anything in the scene and you can check
out to see if something's really
different performance in one area you
can take a look at the area see what is
really high it might be a triangle count
which hits a really high number or you
might get an awful lot of shadow casts
or drop calls and you can choose to
optimize that where available and what
goes hand in that is if you go to window
and then you go to profiler that can
also do the job as similar with this
it's more of an advanced way and gives
you some add more advanced debugging and
will allow you to look at the GPU CPU
memory different audio and physics to
see what might be bogging down your game
at any one time so you can press play
and you can choose to choose any of
these settings and just scrub through
and it will give you a lower down if I
ples
you can now see that I can look at CPU
and I can see that the and you can say
that the initial thing for web tag fps
is the first thing that I see here which
is 90% because I've got the frames
capped because if I uncapped the frames
we'd probably go all the way to I don't
know infinity because it's not very much
going on in the scene and I'll give you
the example of exactly what I mean
another one that we can mention is if we
got edit projects
settings and we got equality on this
side you will see something called a
vsync count and vsync count is what it
will what we often see we see vsync
within games when you want to cap it to
say there refresh rate of your screen
which might be 60 and you can choose
every V blank or every sec second beat V
blank which would be 30 60 and then
don't actually cut the frames also if I
took that and said don't sink and I'll
play again then now in this instance you
can see that the fps in some cases went
all the way to sort of over a thousand
fps and things like that and you can see
that the camera renders the biggest
thing which is taking up the most actual
performance and the next one I'm going
to say is while we're on the still
assume the quality settings you can
actually delete different levels of
quality so we say we didn't want fastest
anymore we didn't want simple we didn't
want beautiful and we want to keep these
so what could we do we can make sure
make our own presets so you can actually
make a new name and call this love and
you can have this one as ultra and then
you could have your middle one as
essentially medium and that would
translate to the things that you've got
in your little output menu when you
build your game or in your options menu
you can see that now we've got different
levels that we've customized you can
delete and edit as appropriate and you
can just rename so you can actually save
them as you want so you don't have to
have the fast fastest and things has
unity by default the next tip that I'm
going to mention is in project settings
and you got to play you can you have a
lot of different options here in your
player settings you can choose to rename
your company choose the actual name of
your project you can set the default
icon which is the thing that would
appear down at the bottom in your
taskbar you can change the cursor if you
really want you can go to resolution and
presentation and you can choose whether
you want to have have the little Rizal
the resolution dialog which pops out
when you start a unity application where
you can often choose the quality and the
resolution you can choose to disable it
if you don't want to do it and you can
set yourself some splash images and
things like that and you can set the
icons here for the actual
the build that builds out and the next
one we shot is the ability to you can
sort of tag out objects with something
and this is something that people don't
always know if you click on any sort of
3d object in my house and you go towards
the inspector on this top left of the
inspector you can click on the little
drop-down and you can select an icon to
give any particular things so if I
choose orange you can see that it now
has an orange the name on it if I rename
then if I change the name to I am a cube
you can see that it's orange and no
matter where I went when i zoom out you
can see that it's marked and it can be a
good way to mark different areas so you
might give everything a color when maybe
they're a wall and interactable objects
or something like that way you can just
give a a brief description of you know
what it might be so you can just glance
at you scene and go all this green stuff
is what things I'm gonna interact with
all the red stuff is all the collisions
where I'm not gonna be able to go to
this area then you can easily see what
bits you might have done and it's a good
way just to mark off areas and perhaps
of your game just to have things to be
able to manage and let's let's just say
for instance you've got yourself a
camera that you've just created and you
don't like where that cameras positioned
and instead of having to you know wiggle
about and have to try and decide where
you want to put it you can sort of go
anywhere in your scene and as long as
your new scene view will scale around
and maybe we want our camera to be
positioned here in the game view you can
see that it's looking our cute weirdly
if we go and have the camera selected go
game object and we got a line to view it
will actually align it to where our
current scene natural sort of inspector
camera is looking and you can see from
the game view we're looking in that same
position so that's a really nice way to
sort of get a cinematic look without you
having to you know drag the camera
around the scene and awkwardly have to
place in weird places so these are my
sort of top 10 tips and I hope these
helped you out to sort of get a little
bit of extra usability out of unity so
thanks very much for watching don't
