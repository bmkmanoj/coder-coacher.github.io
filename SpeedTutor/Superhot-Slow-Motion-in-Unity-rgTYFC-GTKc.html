today and this is going to be looking at
how to create slow-motion are a look of
the superhot gameplay where you can see
that only time moves when your actual
player moves and will do this really
simply you can see the video playing in
the background to start give you some
indication I'm just going to show you
the basic implementation of it so like I
said when you control a moves and we
have some sort of velocity for movement
we're going to be then be able to sort
of move in real time and then if we're
Stood Still it's going to move in slow
motion to justify this I've got some
particle effects which are fireworks and
these are quite a nice way to represent
it and like I said we're going to make
these go in slow motion so what I've got
is an FPS control and the practical
effects you can use whatever you like I
just imported the standard assets by
right-clicking import package and
characters you can get them from the
assets start if you need them all of
them is added a first-person to control
a prefab to the scene because we're
going to use that and a user script
that's on there to tell when they actual
player so that is moving because we
don't want to have to detect things
specifically like button presses so what
we need to do is go right click create
and we'll create a c-sharp script and
we're going to call this slow motion I'm
going to up that this up in Visual
Studio and then what I'll do is I'll get
rid of the two starting methods and pull
start writing what we need to use so
what are first of all we're going to
start by writing using UNSC standard
assets dot characters dot first person
with a semicolon because we're going to
access the things to do with the
standard assets from the first person
because we want to be able to access the
script in this idea what yeah are we
moving or not so we're going to create
two private variable sub private float
and we'll call this slo-mo and have that
equal to not point 1f you can make these
public essentially any change during the
inspector if you want to but not point
one is pretty cool for the slo-mo then
we're going to have a private flat and
we're going to call
this I'll just call this norm time I
have that equal to one point zero F with
the semicolon and that's just going to
be our normal time that we're going to
have then what we're going to use for
later is we're going to have a private
pool as do slow-mo with a semicolon or
before that we can just say that it's
equal to false for now I'm going to be
able to use this to make sure that we
don't do a lot of checks over and up so
now under here that we're going to use
two square brackets and choose serialize
field and then we're going to type in
private first-person controller and we
can get access to that because we're
using the unity standard assets and
collections at the top and then we're
going to write our name as player and a
serialize field just mix it so I can
have a private variable visit visible in
the inspector but it's not actual public
variables I don't need to access it
anywhere else other than the inspector
and I've just added a little collection
to the top which is to use the Unity
engine UI and I've made another
serialize field and a private text
variable and you don't need to add this
to your script this is just so I can
show you a visual representation of what
it latched it looks like on what the
actual time scale all the time we're
currently running at any one time so
it's a by writing is a void update and
what we're going to say in here is we're
essentially going to say that if the
player is moving we're going to then
virtual idiot now give it just normal
speed now we need to go back into unity
and we need to go to our first person
control that we've got or whatever
controller you might have now on the
first person controller script you can
open that up and you can see you get a
big whole host of things going on now
one thing that wants to do is check if
the velocity and the magnitude are
greater than zero so that detects
whether we're moving on so you can see
here that we've got a private character
controller within this script so what we
could do is if we just set that from
private to public will be able to access
that outside of our script so within our
slow motion we can now say that if
player which we referenced
up here dot M underscore character
controller because we can now access it
then we can say dot velocity dot
magnitude is greater than zero and we
can add two color brackets below then
that just means that our referenced
first person controller we're going to
find the character controller and then
we going to detect the velocity and the
magnitude and see if it is greater than
zero so we're going to check if we'll
move it then we're going to say that if
do slo-mo and that just means soon as I
have left deulim I'll check is it equal
to true and we'll I can add two curly
brackets below that and if that's the
case if it is equal to true at any one
time it'll be the opposite of what we'll
do what one with stood still
so now we'll save time don't timescale
is equal to norm time time to time scale
is just something that we write to
yourself get unity to decide how much
time is passing and we can change this
to yet cool lot slow motion effects so
we're setting the time scale currently
to one which is a normal value of just
as in games will run on then we want to
add at time dot fixed Delta time equals
zero point zero to F times by time dot
timescale with a semicolon again so what
this means is that we're just going to
smooth out the actual slow motion
effects that we will see at any one time
so and the fixed Delta time just has a
fixed increment of when the next frame
will be updated and in physics it's
usually them fifty times every second
let's say and this is the value that
ended we normally use just to make it so
that it's nice and smooth out for all of
gameplay and then line I've got under
here is just the line you don't need to
really be concerned about and it just
lets my UI element update with the
actual value which is in the time scale
anyone takes just for visuals then what
we can say under here is that Deus Loma
is
then equal to false because if we're you
know if we just set it to normal
we're on slow Mart or equal to false for
them we can do something different in a
minute so we can now say under this
second curly bracket just before and the
two end ones we can say that else then
to calibrate this for lo thou or say
that if will compile measure Mac do slum
MA with two curly brackets below and if
we're saying that F do Salama if we're
saying that if it's equal to false and
we've set it to false when it's down
here we'll say that time dot timescale
is equal to slow-mo with a semicolon
then again we're going to say time dot
fixed Delta time equals naught point
naught to F times by time a dot time
scales with a semicolon and then again I
added in my line to update the actual UI
he'll that we've got and then we can say
do slow ma is equal to true so
fundamentally what it's doing is in the
update function we'll check and see if
the character is moving if it is we're
going to say that if and do some R
equals true it's going to be we're going
to run through the lines which set what
we're going to be so we'll move in will
be running at normal time so that's fine
so once we've done that once and do some
more we'll get to false it means that
we'll be running at normal times we
don't execute these lines any marks we
don't need to really do them once and
then if we stop moving at any point with
the else statement that we've got we'll
check that is do as form or equal to
false which it is and then we'll set the
slow motion when we're not moving then
we'll set still are Marcy true again so
it's saying it'll only execute these
lines once and then I when we start
moving so we've made the check and then
we're saying if it's true which was true
from the bottom we'll just repeat the
process again so only does it once and
when you actually need to do it so what
we're going to do is go back into unity
will create an empty game object and
we'll call
and time control more do is we'll add
our slow Martian script to that and you
can see that we can add our place or you
can just drop our FPS controller into
the slot and I just added my text
element to there
so we'll get visual representation so
when I press play you can see that time
scale is currently equal to zero because
we're not actually moving anywhere and
when I stand moving you can see that the
fireworks I've started and you can see
that the time scale is equal to one in
the top corner now I stopped moving and
it says the time scale is equal to zero
because it's only outputting a whole
number but I'll start moving again and
you can see that we're in real time
again and we're moving and everything
and I stopped again I'm going slow
motion once again and we can just do
that over and over and over so like I
say you can go as advanced as you want
to with something like this but this is
just a simple way to achieve some
cool-looking slow motion effects with
the fireworks that you can see so that
was how much for watching don't forget
