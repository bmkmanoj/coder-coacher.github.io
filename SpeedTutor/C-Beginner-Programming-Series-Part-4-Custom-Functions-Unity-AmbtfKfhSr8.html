tutorial today and this is going to be
the fourth installment of the C sharp
beginner series and today we're going to
be looking at creating your own
functions or where your own functions or
methods would be used now more often
than not if you're doing something you
might be as we've learned if you've
watched the previous videos if you're
using if statements and conditional
statements so if you might have a
certain amount of health left you might
then eventually have zero health so that
means you might die so you might write
your own function so there's not so much
content in the update function you might
want to manage your code by writing new
method so I'll give you an example of
this what we'll do is we'll right-click
in unity and we'll start by creating a
c-sharp script and what I'm going to
call this is I'm going to call this one
functions for the ease of this sake now
I'm going to open that up in monodevelop
now once that's there what I'm going to
do is I will start by deleting the
starting methods that it gives us and if
I look on the previous episode we have
we have a conditional statement so we
were looking at scar and what score is
equal to and we did some things with
that now I'll give you an example of how
we can use a method in this sort of
thing so if we start by writing the
public integer health so this is going
to star our health that will give to the
player now we can write void update so
we're doing something in the update
method so this will be done every frame
now we could say that if health is ever
less than or equal to zero then we can
do something in here we might do ten
different things in here
so we might want to split it up nicely
and write our own method so then what we
can do here is start by we want to
decide what our method is going to be
cold so we could call it death so we'll
write death
- Brad - the brackets after each other
and I have a semicolon now what we'll
then need to do is in between the first
sort of set of curly brackets below the
update function so you can see that
those two curly brackets encapsulate the
whole update method now we can write
void death just as we as we'd written it
up there add two brackets afterwards
then two curly brackets below again and
you can see that then the syntax highly
highlighting knows that it's a part of
it so from there say you've got a few
things in your update method and you
want to just keep it nice and neat we
could have as many as we want say we had
another if statement which said else if
if health is ever greater than or equal
to 50 let's have picked up lots of
health then we could say I don't know
this is just an example we could have
make another a method called God mode
and then under here we can have another
method called god mode - brackets and
then we can have two curly brackets
below again and you can see here that
we'll manage it in a way and we can have
you know ten lines of code here nicely
managed without it being in the update
function so it just depends what you're
trying to do and easily in any other
place if in god mode I need to for some
reason call death I can just write the
same as I would and it would it would as
soon as God mode is run so say here else
if if the health is greater than or
equal to 50 it will run or call god mode
so shoot down here God's God mud and
then god mode is tell me I need to now
do the method death and it will run
whatever's in death
now like I said before if you need to
call a particular function or method
from another script you can do that but
one of the things that you do need to do
if you want to be able to do that within
c-sharp
you need to make sure that it's a public
void because if you don't have the
public at the beginning it will be
classed as private and private means
it's just private to this script so it
won't be accessible outside of this
script if you make if you make sure
that's public you will be able to access
it outside of this script so in our
conditional script we could say that if
we hit the check point then we can
actually call this function okay so
let's say that we do want to access this
function from another script what we can
do is I will just write a debug line in
here so we'll be able to see it in the
report at the bottom so we'll say I am
here so we'll just close that up and so
when we expect death to be executed it
will say I am here down at the bottom
now what we can do is I can test this in
unity so what we could do is I could add
the function script here and health R is
0 because we've not given it so the
update function will set all we need to
call the death method when the game runs
so in the game runs you can see that
health was 0 and it is finding the R is
executing that we've done death now like
I said you might want to be able to
access it from a another script and just
call this function once so what we can
do is in our conditional script or
whatever script you might have we can
write a public variable and we can write
functions which is the name of our
script which you can see up here
and then we can name this other script
and put a semicolon so now it's saying
that we've got a public variable of
other script which we're going to look
for functions here now let's say that in
here if the score is equal to 50 and if
there's a check point what we'll do is
we'll get rid of this at debug log line
and then we'll say other script don't
get component and then what we want is
to angle brackets then to brackets after
that and then inside the get component
angle brackets we want to say what the
script that we're looking for so we're
looking for functions then we'll say dot
and we'll look for whatever a new
function that we're after so then we can
type in death make sure it's got a
semicolon so you can see that there the
other script we're looking for a
component we're looking for the script
which is functions and then what we're
going to do is we're going to call death
and we expect that when Skaar is equal
to 50 and if we've got a checkpoint
we'll be able to and execute that code
now what we can do is that in this
function I'll make sure that I will take
away the health so it doesn't do it when
we don't want to so in fact I will
delete that all this from the update
function and now we can see that we've
only got death and god mode and they'll
never be executed until you tell them to
now we'll go back in I will remove em I
am here from the console just so that
doesn't confuse you I'll put the
conditional in there and now it's saying
that all the script and it's looking for
whatever the other script is on this is
helpful if you've got it on a different
game object than what it actually lives
on so I can add my whatever game object
that it lives on so it lives on it's
this one and you could simply do it by
saying that you could just say get come
upon without the other script reference
but this is just an example of how to do
it so you drag what object that script
is on we needed to have a checkpoint and
we needed to make sure the scale was 50
all in fact what we'll do is we'll make
sure the scars 0 so we expect the
function not to be cold in the other
script so you can see that currently
that's the running that the score is
zero now if I've got a checkpoint and
now I set the scar to 50 you can see
that it's now saying that I am here so
it's you're always running the function
or method from the other script so it's
just a very simple way to make sure and
if I get rid of the public on the death
and I now make sure that scar is equal
to 50 as soon as we start it's going to
complain and it's going to tell me that
it's inaccessible due to its protection
level and that means that it's protected
just to this script so as long as we've
got a public we'll be ready to go so
that's just a really nice way to
organize and manage and add sometimes
just be able to call between other
scripts and you can do that as many
times as you need to so hopefully this
may be iron some things out and helped
you get to the next step of being able
to write and things for games so thanks
very much for watching don't forget to
