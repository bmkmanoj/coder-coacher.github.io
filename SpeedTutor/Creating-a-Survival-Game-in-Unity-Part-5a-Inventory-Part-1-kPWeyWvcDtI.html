the survival tutorial series now I
apologize for this again take it so long
but again I've been busy you know with
tweaking this and other projects that
I've been doing so this is taking a
little bit longer than I anticipated to
get round to doing
now this infantry system that we're
going to do is going to be split up into
a few parts so it's going to split up
into say three or four parts we're going
to start off by creating the basis of
the infantry then maybe showing you how
we'd be able to pick up multiple items
and you know create the items around the
game world and then once we've done that
add the variables to our health stamina
the water that we need to go up and the
food so eating and drinking those items
we've made and then you know after that
for the next part of the series after
we've done a few videos it's going to be
moving on to crafting and things like
that so that's just what will be to come
so be prepared in the next few weeks
it's going to be all about the infantry
system now I'll show you the base of the
infantry is I know people are always
after a really advanced temperature
system but I really doubt at the time to
create something like that know the
resources so I'll give you a quick
example of how we're going to start off
making it look and obviously you can
change this but I'm just showing you the
car basic so you can take it make into
whatever you see fit so we're going to
press I and then we're going to open up
a basic infantry which is going to hold
variables for whatever types of
resources we're going to find in the
game world so wood stone clay for
instance these are just what I've made
up then you can collect fish a bottle
and then if you've done a cooked fish
you forgot bottled water and if you've
maybe crafted a bandage or whatever
you've picked something up which will
heal you and you click these buttons and
then it will take away from one of the
you know empty slots that we've got and
then obviously like I said later on
we'll actually make it so that it works
with the GUI maybe do some boosts to the
game you know pick things up so when
we've cut trees we'll pick up the wood
one
a mind stone which will come a little
bit later all things like that but as I
said this is just going to be the core
elements of creating the basics of part
1 so first of all sorry about the long
long explanation but a go to create
JavaScript and what we're going to do is
we're going to start by creating and
infantry script so I'm just calling this
inv some open up in monodevelop
and then when you have done so what
we're going to do is we'll delete the
two starting functions and then we'll
call this variable menu skin as type GUI
skin and this is just to help us because
if you create a custom GUI skin the
obviously can make you GUI look slightly
different and you can just add that to
that slot then we're going to create
three variables which are going to
contain all the different items that
we'll be able to craft stuff with so
variable wood as integer equal to zero
variable stone integer equal to zero
variable clear integer equal to zero and
obviously you can name it whatever you
want and have as many as you want and
then we're going to have variable fish
as type integer equal to zero variable
cooked fish let's type integer equal to
zero then we're going to type bottle
let's type integer equal to zero and
variable bottled water as type integer
equal to zero then we're going to write
one last one call variable bandage as
type integer like all the others as zero
then we're going to have one private
variable called sure GUI and have that
as type boolean equal to false and what
that's gonna help us do is switch the
infantry on and off one you know one
we're pressing I or whatever button you
want to create now first of all what you
want to be able to do is have you know
be able to switch the GUI on and off so
we're going to create function update
to brackets two curly brackets below
then we're going to set if input if
bracket import dot get key down open
brackets I in course add two brackets at
the end underneath add two curly
brackets and so that Shoji y is equal to
exclamation mark sure Gy with a
semicolon and that just means it will do
exactly opposite so every time we pass I
it will do it if it's a false that set
its true for the true word set to false
so it's would have to take up too many
lines of code then under here what we'll
do is we'll say that if Shoji Y is equal
to true so if any point its equal to
true
we'll say time dot timescale is equal to
zero so that means we'll sort of stop
game time we'll just freeze it in a
sense then what we're going to do is
we're going to find out the elements so
that we can you know move the main
camera we can't move our character about
we can play any animations so we're
going to stop everything from working so
obviously the light would pause the game
in a way so then we're still going to
say game object dot find up and brackets
in quotes first person controller dot
get component up and brackets fps input
controller Clause the upturn abled
equals false and then what we can do is
we're going to copy that same line what
do is I'll paste that in again and then
instead of this time will you look for
Mouse luck
and very similar lick with what we did
up above will say game object dot find
up in brackets in course min camera
don't get component open brackets Mouse
look
plus the up dot enabled equals false
then game object dot find up and
brackets in quotes whatever you've got
your player control script on so I've
got mine on my FPS arms under skull X at
idle close that up dot get component
open brackets player control class up
dot enabled equals false so what we'll
do is we'll save that and what that
means now is every time that we click
and make sure that we can show the
infantry will make sure everything is
disabled so we can only do with the
things that we want to do in the
infantry okay so then what I'll do is
I'll copy this section entirely again
and what we'll do is we'll paste this in
just below and then we'll say it in this
case if then show G Y is equal to false
what we'll do is we'll make sure that
all these that were false before we're
going to set to true so we'll copy true
and we'll just paste it over all these
false values that we've got there so
that means you know if we press I again
to get out of the infantry will actually
able to you know enable all the features
of the game again now we're going to get
to the very nitty-gritty of the script
and hopefully this won't take too long
but it's you know you've got to get
around the basic idea of making this GUI
so then we're going to start our own
function on G Y two brackets two curly
brackets below and then we'll say that
if sure G Y is equal to true so as in
before when we disabled everything if
saying if it's true then we'll add two
curly brackets in there and then we'll
say GUI dot skin is equal to menu skin
with a semicolon then what we'll do is
run a little break and we'll put will
tab it across slightly so we just indent
it will say GUI dot begin group open
brackets new rect open brackets again
screen dot width / 2 - 150 , screen dot
height divided by 2
- 150 comma 300 comma 300 close up the
two brackets and put a semicolon so what
this means it will find you your screen
width so I'll divide find your screen
width divided by 2 which will go here
and then we'll take away 150 and we'll
do this both sides and then we're going
to set the GUI to be as big as 300 by
300 pixels so we'll make a little square
in the center of the screen obviously
you can change any of them and then what
we're going to do is I'm going to add
another line break in and tab it across
so we indent it again then I'm going to
want to put GUI dot box open brackets
rect open brackets again not comma not
comma 300 comma 300 close that up and a
comma will right in here basic inventory
or whatever you want a title to be gonna
have infantry system infantry whatever
but this is just going to be the title
at the top of our box so we're going to
have then what I'm going to do is add
two line breaks in here then set GUI dot
label open brackets rect open brackets
again and I'll say 10 comma 50 comma 50
comma 50 and a bracket put a comma then
we'll write in courts wood this is going
to be I just I'll label too
make sure that we know what we're
looking at and label doesn't do anything
it just obviously label stuff so what
this means is that we're going to have a
label ten across 50 down and the size of
50 by 50 so we'll be able to write the
text in that box and then what we'll do
below here which will say GUI dot box
over brackets rect open brackets again
we're going to say 50 I mean 60 comma 50
comma 20 comma 20 close that up add a
comma put two quarts in add a plus and
write the variable would then we'll add
a bracket and a semicolon so then what
we're doing here is we're going to say
that we're going to have this GUI box
which is going to hold the variables so
if we collect what it's going to add one
every time 60 across so if we started at
10 across say well we're here on my
screen we're going to go across a little
bit then we're going to stay we're not
going to go down any amount and we're
just going to make it slightly smaller
because it's only going to be a number
not a word so obviously if you can get
this round in your head you can make
persistent variables if you're going to
keep stuff the same values so here
instead of it being so say we're going
to always have 50 across you could
change this to a variable called across
and set a equal to 50 and then you'd
only have to write one word instead of
raining lots of numbers but for the sake
of this I might help you clean it up in
a letter to time but for the sake of
this and just letting everybody
understand that this is X this is y and
these two are always the size of the box
if you imagine that you're going to put
any object inside any GUI object so
again we're going to do very very
similar thing what we'll do is we'll
copy this these two sections paste it in
so what we going to do is when I do this
obviously let you may have imagined for
each thing that we've got like you saw
in my example so what we're now going to
do is change this to 90 and then we're
going to keep that
$50 to it 50 but we're going to change
this to stone make sure you add the
quartz and then the GUI box is going to
be a hundred and thirty and then we're
going to keep that at 50 20 and 20 keep
the quartz but instead this time we're
going to add storm so all we do in each
time is making sure that they go down by
a small amount so each time it goes up
so from there to there its moves by 80
it moves by 80 each time we move up so
it just spreads it out nice obviously
you can change these values as I said
now what you could do is then paste it
in again so this time what we're going
to do is make sure that this one is
equal to the x value is equal to 170 and
we'll change what to clay then the
bottom value we're going to change to
200 and as I said we're going to keep
everything the same again but we're
going to add then add the variable clay
at the bottom so I'm sure as you can
imagine this is just very pretty
straightforward
but it's just trying to keep everything
balanced so we remember everything that
we're doing so we're going to have
another GUI label which is for going to
fish this time and what I'll do is add a
little note and these are going to be
the initial ones for the resource is
collected so obviously with these ones
what we've done is we've only kept them
going down we haven't moved the value
we've just made sure that it moves
across so we have wood stone and clay
some a I've just described all that
wrong but if you imagine it it just goes
across rather than going down the others
we're going to actually may go down so
we'll start off by writing the fish so
that's going to be 10 across then we're
going to make sure that this is a
hundred and thirty going down and then
we're going to leave it to 50/50
then we're going to write fish in the
box then the GUI box for the bottom
we're going to leave at 60 but we're
going to change that to 130 and then
leave it at 20 and 20 and add fish here
so realistic will not change it not many
values we're just making sure we change
the X&amp;amp;Y positions for wherever you want
to actually position it in your GUI so
again what I'll do is paste another one
in I'm going to have this for an empty
bottle or whatever we might have so
we'll have this 10 across and then
instead of 50 we'll have 150 and 50 50
then we'll add the text bottle and then
we'll have a GUI box and then we'll
leave that 60 and we'll call that 150
leave it at 20 20 and then have that as
type bottle and then we're going to only
have a couple more this time so this is
going to be 1 we'll set empty holders so
that's going to hold anything that we
collect so if we collect some water if
we collect some food and then this lack
section is going to be maybe edible
items so then what we're going to do
this time is we're going to add one for
cooked fish this time so we're going to
say we're going to go down again so
we're going to leave at 10 across 190
down fifty-fifty and then we'll say see
fish for cooked fish and obviously if
you want to write the whole thing cooked
fish you want to make that 50 and 50
bigger so we'll be able to fit it in GUI
dot box then you want to leave that at
60 you want to make this one 190 then
leave that 20 20 and then have this as
cooked fish for the variable then we'll
save and then this is going to be
slightly different this time if you want
to create a button say to eat it if we
set if GUI dot button open brackets
recked open brackets a hundred comma 190
comma 100 comma 20 close that up right
comment and then we'll say eat fish in
quarts well add two brackets then we'll
have to color brackets below there and
say cooked fish - Michael - - semicolon
so this means that what we're doing is
we're going to make a GUI button a
hundred in the X so hundred across we're
going to keep it the same down so it's
on the same level as the cooked fish and
then we're going to make sure that it's
a hundred and then 20 so we can fit the
word eat fish in that button and then
when we click this button it'll take
away from our cooked fish variable and
obviously later and I'll show you how to
make sure that we take that away from
the health and such and now very
similarly what we're going to do is
we're going to copy that section I'm
going to paste it in here and we're
going to have this for bottled water now
we're going to leave that ten I'm going
to change that 190 to 210 leave it at
fifty fifty and have it as be water so
the level is bottled water then do the
GUI box have it 60 change that to 210
leave it at 20 20 and then write the
variable bottled water then we're going
to create another GUI button 100 across
like the other we're going to again make
it 210 down and then we're going to add
a little message in there so to say what
do we want to drink water and obviously
like before the cooked food fish
variable - - but this time we're going
to have bottled water - - so we're
nearly there now the last one but I want
to do is for a bandage set so we'll
paste this will copy this and we'll
paste in one last time make sure that
that's correct so we're going to do GUI
label
then 240 and I'll quickly edit these so
that once 240 that's 240 will add heel
there and then we'll maybe add bandage
here and then we'll say here use bandage
and then obviously we want to spot
instead of bottled water - - we'll have
bandage but one last thing just before
you feel like you finished your script
you need to make sure that you write GUI
dot end group because what we've done to
begin with we began an actual group so
the group began is the outer box that we
had and then we can actually every of
the GUI element within one GUI box so
then we can keep everything together not
floating around the screen so in its
entirety I'll quickly give you an
example if we add an inventory you can
create GUI skin by going assets create
and then GUI skin we can do is we add
the inventory to our main camera if I
just add my basic GUI infantry there and
what I can do is if I play the game
you'll notice that ah we had what we
created here so we had just the wood the
stone the clay each of the text is a
label the other ones are boxes and these
ones are buttons so obviously if I click
eat fish it'll obviously take one away
obviously we don't want to go into - we
can add we can change the values you
know up there so if we eat the fish you
know we take down and obviously run or
make sure look at go below zero but for
this you see that we've got a box 300 by
300 and we've got each of our GUI
elements inside this box so you know you
can create anything you want with
insider you know GUI group but like I
said before if you can see my code next
to it
and just quickly explain GUI infantry at
the top is I title then each of these
three here so it initially starts ten
across so this would starts at ten
across fifty down so fifty down from the
top and then we're going to create a box
fifty-fifty so we can add this would and
then we're going to say so 60 across so
this far across also just closed it 60
across we have the variable and again
for stone we have the label so we have
it 90 across this time 50 down so it all
stays on the same level but we're just
shunting the Y values or the X values
across slightly to change it and
obviously it works the same in every
single instance so really this is just
part one and maybe this took a little
bit longer than expected to do but it
was trying to get the idea across the
you just messing around with the
positions on screen on the GUI so again
I'll be going into more detail in the
infantry in videos to come but for now
thanks very much for watching and don't
