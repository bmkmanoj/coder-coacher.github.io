tutorial today and this is gonna help
people who want to create a sort of a
death see you know when you character
dies the specific script you want to do
something when you die so whether it's
respawn or whether it's actually go to a
different menu and say you know you have
to press a button to restart now I've
had a few questions like this so I'm
just going to cover it briefly you know
to give up people an idea of how you
know you can actually do it so I'm going
to show you two examples here one of
them is going to be adding the main
scripts in c-sharp and this is going to
actually let you respawn so it's going
to let you respawn a certain position if
to say you know you were making a 2-d
game or something like that and then I'm
going to have another one that you walk
into and it's going to actually cause
damage to your player and then make it
go to a different screen so that screen
then you know has a button which then
you just restart your old scene so I'll
go through the one which goes to another
scene first now my script is called
damage and all it is is like the script
that I had for picking up food and water
and things like that so all it does is
it references my script here the GUI
survival script it doesn't have to
reference this one this is just so I can
set the current health to zero when you
have something doing so when you enter
the collider it destroys the object as
it would and sets the health to -100 now
health is normally 100 so if it sets
it's minus 100 and the update function I
set something called if health is less
than or equal to zero then you actually
run a function called character death
and character death is down here and
what we have here is it says application
load level and then you write them
actual level that you've got inside your
quads so this one's called simple menu
so obviously when the carrot self is
there
and it will call this function and it'll
load this level now you need to make
sure that your level is in file build
settings and you drag it into there now
I'll show you what happens see obviously
you can create a new scene by going file
new scene and you just what I'm going to
do is walk into this Collider and you'll
notice the health went to zero and this
is my other scene you can see it here
it's death scene and then I've got new
game button so I've created a lot of you
know really simple button I'm going to
click it you spawn Bic back into the old
C so it almost creates something you
know very simple and all it requires you
to do is set make a new scene and then a
button within that scene to then respawn
back into that into this one you wanted
so I will actually open up the simple
menu and just show you what's going on
and all is I've got them just GUI
texture with a button and then a simple
script script which just says you know
on Mouse up your load D level again you
do exactly the same thing as you did
before so I'll show you the actual other
way that you can you know respawn and do
things like that
so in my other script here GUI survival
here I've got my mine and scripted in
c-sharp but you know in theory it's all
relatively the same you're going to have
two variables at the top even though the
public transform destination what you
would have in JavaScript would be and
you know variable destination as type
transform but you know it's all very you
know similar so all I'm doing this one
is that when we enter the trigger just
like we did before it calls a function
called killed player and what kill
player does has something which responds
them in different positions so you just
write player dot transform position
equals destination position so all you
doing within your mind is you add in the
destination which is an object that I
created over here so this is where
you're going to respawn and you just add
your player to that Saturn by inspector
slot so if a player
you'll notice that on a walk into the
collider you know I'll just spawn over
that in here you can make this invisible
so you don't get stuck in it or anything
like that but it's just in a similar way
that once you hit that and you would die
you would respawn in another place so
it's all really quite simple to do it's
just in one case and you can load to a
new scene when you hit zero or when you
hit zero
you actually respawn in the place and it
just requires that little bit of script
and I'll put the two scripts up for
download and you know you can look
through them you know get an ID yourself
but that was just going through the
basics of when your character dies you
can actually do something so thanks very
much for watching and as ever if you
