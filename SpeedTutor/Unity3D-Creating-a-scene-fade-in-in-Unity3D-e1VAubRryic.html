today and this is what somebody
suggested about wanting I sort of fade
in between the scenes so you initially
start a scene and it fades in from say a
black background now this is going to be
a you know really basic way and all I'm
going to use is a plane so it's a bit of
you know just a bit of trickery really
so all I've done is I've got a plane and
what I've done is created a black
material and you can do that by saying
right-click create material and once
you've created material you want to just
set the diffuse to black and then you
want to set the shader to transparent
diffuse and I'll yeah and just make sure
it's black and then what I've done is
I've selected main camera and I've
positioned it you know just slightly in
front of the camera so in the camera
preview you can see that it's totally
black and then I've just parented it to
the camera so we know that it's always
in front of the camera no matter where
it moves now the person who suggested it
wanted to actually make sure that you
couldn't move or you couldn't look
around until the third has ended so I've
added that to the script you don't have
to you could run around while he's
fading in but it doesn't really matter
so we'll start off and as long as you've
got all that going we'll start off by
writing a script so you can create a new
JavaScript and call this a fade script
my wife or like really then we'll open
up in monodevelop
and what we'll do is we'll write a
variable called timer set as type float
equal to ten pointer and then I'll just
make sure that I set the stand up date
function just um arrange those brackets
then at the start want to say renderer
dot material dot color
err
is equal to one so that just means the
renderer so the material on the renderer
and the color of the Alpha is set to one
and you set the Alpha between not and
one and one means you know fully 100%
visible like we're doing seen the scene
now and zero being you know totally
invisible so now we can actually disable
the elements that we don't want to be
able to use source a game object dot
find open brackets and quartz
first-person controller and close that
up
say dot getcomponent open brackets fps
input controller oops
input controller close that up
dart enabled equals false and then what
we're going to do is copy this in two
more times and then leave the FPS
control on one and then rename this one
this last one to main camera because
we've gotten mouse lock and both the FPS
controller and the main camera so then
what we'll do is change that
getcomponent to mouse lock and then what
we can do is copy that same one and
paste it below so actually both of our
mouse looks it get disabled so we can't
look around any more and then we won't
be able to move now within the update
function what we're going to say is
timer equals timer - time dot time dot
delta time and then put quotes that
means it will count down from whatever
time mosey so a bit initially then we'll
set if timer is greater than or equal to
zero then we'll add two curly brackets
below and so that renderer dot material
dot color dot air like we did at the top
is minus equal to not point one times by
time.deltatime so that just means we set
with taking the Alpha down by not point
one every second that we move
in Delta time and then what we want to
say is if timer is less than or equal to
zero
then we'll close the oven and two curly
brackets for lunch sir the timer is
equal to zero and then what we'll do is
copy these three at the top and then
below there I'll just space these out a
little bit then what we want to say is
that these then equal to true so then we
can run around and do anything we want
to do so once these are all set to true
that's good we'll save that out maybe
one last thing you'll want to do is
write destroy and then game object with
a lowercase G and that just means it'll
destroy the plane after we've used it so
you know it's not in the scene and doing
some stuff are you know taxing the
computer for anyone anywhere so what
we'll do is we'll minimize that and then
from the third script we'll add that to
our plane and then you'll notice at the
time is 10 seconds now if you watch my
screen when I press play and you watch I
won't be able to move about so I'm
trying to move and I'm trying to look
with my mouse it's not doing anything
as you can see the timer's counting down
you can see the opacity fade in that
little white bar below and as we come
back then we'll actually be able to run
around and do as we would now obviously
you've got to be careful that counts
down for 10 seconds and decrease the
opacity by a small amount obviously want
to make this quicker you can set that to
time or equal to 5 and then change the
countdown to not point to and it'll just
make it you know 2 sets over opacity for
every second that we've got so you know
it just depends how what you want to do
it and make sure if you plan is too big
and you've still got the mesh room
Collider on it it'll make you jump about
and stuff so you can either delete the
mesh Collider or the Box Collider
whatever you might have on your object
in front of your camera or you can just
make it smaller so when it touches the
ground it doesn't knock you can yeah you
player about so that's pretty much it
that's just the entirety of the script
it just all it does is sets the Alpha
material then we disable all the
components we count down a certain
amount of alpha every second and then we
re-enable you know the player to do
whatever it won't need x' to do so
that's pretty much it and you can see it
there the fade in to the scene thanks
very much for watching if you liked the
tutorial don't forget to like come and
