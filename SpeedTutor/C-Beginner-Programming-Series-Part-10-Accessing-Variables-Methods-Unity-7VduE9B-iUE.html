tutorial and this is gonna be the next
part of the c-sharp series and it's
gonna be focusing on how to access
functions our methods and variables
within other scripts so I will give you
a basic example just run through my
example so we've got a box here which is
gonna act as our trigger so I'll go
through that what we're gonna do is
we're gonna have something that controls
our health so in your game you might
have different scripts which control
different functionality so let's imagine
that we've got a script which controls
the health now we don't want to have
lots of lines of code in that health so
when we collide with something we do
damage we could have another script
which controls how much damage we take
and then it updates that health script
accordingly
to whatever damage we've taken so that
helps us just break the scripts apart
and have it in a nice sort of orderly
fashion
so I'll give you an example so I've got
a FPS controller here and it's just
tagged player I've got is I've got my
damage object here which is gonna be
this rectangle I've got a box Collider
on it and I've got it as is trigger if
you need to create when you can go a
game object 3d objects and cube and I've
also gone up to game objects called
health manager you can right-click in
the hierarchic click create empty and it
will create you an empty game object and
when you do that all you want to do is
on the transform you can just right
click and click reset just so it's
centralised and then what I've got done
is I have given that a tag of Health
Manager because we're going to sort of
reference this and I'll show you a few
ways to do it
as we're going along and I will actually
you know remind you as we go through so
all you need to do to create a new tag
is you can just add new tag and write it
in as health manager and then you choose
it from the list there that was just the
basic set up and this is just a way to
visually show it so you don't need to
have all this set up like this but if
you want to follow through you can so
what we'll do is we'll start by
right-clicking and we'll create a new C
sharp and then we'll call this Health
Manager and then what we'll do is we'll
open up in Visual Studio and once we're
there we'll get rid of the two starting
methods
and we're going to just start by writing
if we ever want to access something from
another script it has to be a public
variable because we it needs to be able
to be seen by other things then what we
want to do is we can set this as a float
for instance or it can be an integer it
doesn't really matter we'll call it
health and we'll set equal to 100 and
now we should be able to access that
variable and update it when we need to
anew the script now there could be a
function that we need to our method that
we need to access so we can call we can
do it in the same way we can say public
void and we can say updates health with
two capitals and then two brackets and
then two curly brackets below that and
this can be a method where we're going
to just do something to the health so
I'll quickly write something in because
I'm going to use the unity UI so we can
update something on the screen so I'm
going to say at the top using unity
engine dot UI and you don't have to use
this this is just to show you a visual
way and I'll just write in square
brackets serialize filled private text
so we're going to access a text UI and
then call this health UI with a
semicolon so what I'm going to do within
our public of debt health I'm gonna
choose that every time I call this
method we're gonna actually update what
is in the UI so then we can say that
health UI dot text because we need to
access the lots of text component which
is on the UI then we'll set equals
health docked to string in brackets zero
in quotes and then a semicolon and all
that means is that in that health UI the
text component in there we're setting
we're giving it the value of health
which would be a hundred right now and
we're setting it to a string and zero is
just a way to specify that it's just a
whole number and the reason why we have
to convert a string is because a text
field in the health component of the UI
is a string value and this up here is a
number or a float and it won't be able
you can't put a float directly into a
string so you need to convert it to a
string but it doesn't matter for now
like I said this is just a visual way to
show it that's all one and good
you only need to really remember that
you make a variable public and Method
public and then you'll be able to access
them what we can do back in our scene
again we can go right-click c-sharp and
choose damage object and then we'll open
up that in Visual Studio now once we're
in here will delete the starting methods
and we'll just have what we're gonna do
is we're gonna have a I'm gonna write
civilized filled and sterilized filled
just allows us to see a private variable
in the inspector without making it
public so we'll say private health
manager and this is exactly as health
managers spell in your script health
manager and then we'll just have Health
Manager again but this time a lower case
so this is just going to be our variable
which is gonna hold the health manager
we're gonna also have another square
brackets serialized field and we'll set
this to private float and we'll call
this damage so we're going to specify
our value then from here we can start by
writing void start and then when I press
tab it completed it for me so it's a
private void start because if we just
specify something like this void it just
makes that it's private and those in the
other script were public once we're here
we need to try and find a way to access
this health manager so we need to
specify it in the script now what we can
do is let us say we go to the health
manager here we just drag the health
manager on to our health manager game
object we go to the damage object and we
go to and drag the damage object script
on there you can see that health manager
is looking for an object which is health
manager so what we could do is we could
just drag health manager straight into
there and it would find it automatic it
would find it for us so there's no extra
code to write that's a very viable way
to do it now if you want to do it all in
script you can say that health manager
with the lower case equals game object
dot find game object with tag don't make
sure that it isn't game objects it's
just the one without an S then we can
say in brackets in quotes and we'll look
for a tag which is Health Manager like
we specified earlier then we can say
don't get component and we'll write to
angle brackets and
specify the health manager which is the
walnuts the actual script you can see
that when we hover over them they're
linked and we can write two brackets and
a semicolon and what this means is that
as soon as this script is executed it
will find the health manager
automatically with that tag that we
specified and it will find the component
on there which is this health manager
script so it means that we wouldn't have
to drag it in to the inspector every
time and just find it for us to do any
sort of damage we might want to do a
trigger event so we could again do a
void on trigger enter and it
automatically fills this in for me so
private void ontriggerenter then in
brackets we can set collider other and
we can then say that if over.com pair
tag in brackets is player in quotes we
can have two curly brackets below that
we just say in the if-then in the
brackets we've got other dot compare tag
and then we've got player inside quotes
and brackets and we'll end the bracket
at the end just to encapsulate it all
because you can see all these ones are
the brackets are linked when I click on
them then we can say that we want to
actually access the variables and things
so how we access that is we use this
reference here this health manager
reference that we created with the
lowercase H will say health manager dot
health and because we've referenced that
health manager already and health is
public we get access to it as we're
doing this and autocomplete we can write
health and you can see we can write
health or update health so we get access
to the method as well also that health
and we can say that minus equals damage
with the semicolon so what this means is
every time we'll go into the trigger
health manager will update the health by
the specific damage value that we give
now also in the similar way we can say
health manager with a lowercase dot
update health and we're going to be
calling this method we add two brackets
and a semicolon and just as we would if
we were trying to call any other method
that might be in this script and it will
run this method here so in this health
manager you can see that health is
currently 100 and all I need to do is
add my text component there the health
text and it will to help me display it
my damage output you can see that what I
can do is I can get rid of that for now
so you can see there's nothing in there
and it will find it automatically I'll
say that when we run into this trigger
or say that will do damage of five when
I press play
you will see that it automatically found
the health manager for us we still got
the damage of play and we just need to
in the health manager right I just a
start function to update the health as
soon as the game is actually built out
so what we could do is we can press play
again and you can see that up in the top
you can see that that's the UI is
updated and we can see it it's 100 you
can say the damage object has
automatically found the player manager
via that tag that we'd already created
and we've got a damage of five when we
could choose to go into it you can see
that a health manager has a hundred and
it's got a tag of health knowledge and
that's how it's been able to find it now
if we walk into this trigger you can see
that when I walk through it you can see
that health went down to 95 and so did
it on this side you don't need to have
this UI here it will always go down in
there so you can see it so as I keep
walking through it keeps going down and
you could obviously get rid of this
trigger with maybe a set active if you
didn't need to use it again every time
you've got it so it could be an
explosion which does damage to your
health over time so really the
fundamentals of it are if you've got
something like this the health manager
variables that are public all methods
that are public if you need to access
them elsewhere and that's fine then in
your other script that you want to be
able to get access to those variables
you can either you want to create a
private reference to the script that you
want to get access to you can drag the
game objects that you require to get
access to this into the inspector or you
can write a simple line which says that
the we're looking for the game object
with a particular tag and working we're
going to get the automatic component
which is the health manager and then
from there you can write the shorthand
which is your variable name dot whatever
variable or function you've got and
there you go you
Access's many functions variables that
you need to with another script so
hopefully this helps you out and thanks
very much for watching don't forget to
