tile today and this is gonna be one for
showing you how to make alphas and
things that you can use to mask off
areas to create details and things that
you wouldn't normally be able to create
within painter so what we're gonna do
today is I'm gonna quickly show you how
you can go about making an alpha you can
use any type of ship why normally like
to do is I use a square canvas this is a
thousand 24 by a thousand 24 you can
color your canvas black because it's
always gonna be a black and white or
grayscale image which is going to be for
your alpha now I'm gonna get my logo and
I'm just gonna copy that and put that
into this sort of container that we've
got here and we're going to turn this
into something that we can use in a
model in substance I'm not really taking
a great deal of effort to put all this
in here so that's gonna be like that for
now and we need to make they say sort of
black on white image so what I'm going
to do is with that object selected Algar
adjustments and I will say black and
white I'll press ok I'll go image
adjustments and then I will go to curves
and I will just the curve until we get a
completely sort of white version of my
logo let's say and then we can you
almost use this as an elf or a stamp
something that we can use within our
model then what I'll do is I'll just
save this out you can save this out as a
PSD you can save itself as a target PNG
whatever you need to then I'm gonna go
into painter and I've got an object here
that I'm gonna want to maybe paint my
logo onto and it's just a sort of
Cromley pitch frame now I'm going to
maybe put the logo on the back to add a
little bit of extra detail what you can
do is when you're in your sort of main
shelf you can click on this box here
which is import resources you can drag
it in but this is the way I normally
like to do it you can click add
resources and then from there you want
to just find the image that you want to
use and then once you there you
I'll have the Alpha that I want click on
the undefined box and change this to
alpha then I'm gonna import the
resources you can import it to your
current session so al only be used there
open your closet it will be gone again
you can import it to this actual project
itself so only when you open this
project will that alpha appear or you
can import it tea shelf so no matter
what project you actually have
it's usually if you've made an alpha why
not use it across all things if using
something generic like I might want to
use this across many assets then I'll
click import and it will be imported to
my alpha shelf you can click on your
alphas fold to see it you can click in
your search box and I will click type st
alpha and then when you see that you can
see my alpha at the bottom and if I
hover over it you can see it there now
what I usually like to do is that maybe
on my main body here I will select on
the material that I've got I'm gonna add
a new fill layer and I'm gonna right
click on this fill layer and add a black
mask and from here I'll then choose my
alpha that I want to use and it would go
into the Alpha slot now this is the way
I usually like to pin alphas you can put
it into the stencil slot and paint it
like that but I like to do is like we
can scale up a little bit and we could
just click that with a sort of
left-click on the back and because these
all share the same sort of UV
coordinates and you will get a I
actually get a repeat of the alpha that
I've just created now seeing as that
alpha stamped um that's pretty much all
you need to know and then you can go
back to your material for instance so we
have it there what we could do is we
could possibly remove the color remove
the roughness material and leave the
high on and we could reduce the height
so then it looks like it's almost
stamped into our object and that would
have if you'd have had to originally
modeled that in that would have been
quite a difficult thing to have to put
into your model so all it will come out
on your actual normal
when you export out from substance so
that's a really easy way you can make
anything you want within this you could
put any shape that you like and make any
number of alphas that you might want
this is an alpha that I have made before
I can you'll need to click back on your
actual masked area click on your alpha
again and you can see that there's my
alpha that I want spent on so I might
want it really big on here I'll just
click and seen as though it shares the
exact same details as the st that I put
on it looks like it's been indented on
the back of the object itself
and you can see it placed on your UV map
if you need to do so so that's just a
really easy way to be able to bring in
your alphas and pin them pretty much
onto a model depending how ever you need
to do them so it's quite it's good for
screws any extra details or anything
that weren't originally in your normal
map which might be quite easy to do with
some stamping an alpha so thanks very
much for watching don't forget to Like
