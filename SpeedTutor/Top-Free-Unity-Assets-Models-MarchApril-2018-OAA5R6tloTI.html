for March April 2018 number one if
you've got the medieval farms free and
it's a selection that package contains
of six different objects with animations
and different steps for each thing it
includes eight models which include
three boxes three farms on fence and a
warehouse and number two is the dirty
wooden crate and this is a 3d PPR model
there's three textures for this
particular model as you can see it
spinning around here there's a model
with dirty text without text and a clean
version with albedo metallic and bein
enormous up to 2k and it's around four
hundred and forty eight triangles number
three is the purple crystal minor and
it's a modular pack of models and
textures which include the tracks
minecart tools crystals London's rocks
and it has a spline tool included for
easy manipulation of the paths and
tracks and the next one is the wooden
PVR table and it's a basic VBR table
where three different parts the upper
table the metal parts the wooden legs
and connectors with all textures up to
4k and the next one is fantasy swords
PBR and this is 10 medieval swords
designed to be realistic and hand
painted up to 2k between 360 triangles
for the actual models themselves
wouldn't material for each and as I said
the Rena a PBR are roughing a set up and
you can see a bunch of these are look
like they're are pretty cool
the selection of fantasy swords the next
one is the Victorian brick building and
the package consists of 13 low poly
meshes they can be modulated and you can
create yourself a scene which Kabir
setting in London or somewhere like that
and the next one is this stylized
astronaut and it includes a fully rigged
character with eight animations and a
simple third person shot third person
roller so it's ready to use within your
screen as you can see down here for a
cute looking model so it's 160 vertexes
it includes an idle walk run jump start
flip jump loop float and jump end
as you can see and like I said like it
suggests you to be able to run around
with this character it comes with all
animations so much something if you are
looking to create with this fan of
character and the next one is called
character elf
it's a humanoid PVR related model with
up to 2k textures which is just less
than about five and a half thousand
triangles and includes all your
expectant Alvida I'm gonna include your
metallic and normal Maps no no me no
animations included for this but can be
used in either unity or unreal so that's
a pretty nice looking character right
there and the next one is the fantasy
lands free mini pack this is a smaller
version of a larger pack and the
Fantasyland mini pack is a small demo
package this has several app sets that
you can find in the complete pack and it
includes a house prefab comprised of the
house model and a few trees and
vegetation assets with two particle
effects and seven hand-painted terrain
textures in the demo scene and the next
one is we've got the candelabra and it's
a low poly home painted light fixture
almost for game environments and it's
part of the dungeon set prop now it
doesn't specify the polygon count but
low poly looking a set and the next one
is the folding table and share PBR and
includes the table and the chair with
1200 and just short of 2,000 triangles
respectively for the table on the chair
comes with object to care PBR textures
with the irregular Maps and last but not
least is the private tavern and this is
an interior with meshes for featuring as
a suggestive pirate tablet with seamless
textures for the walls and floor a lot
of batch objects to reduce the draw
calls and lot they're all fairly and low
poly assets with various different
tables chairs unique items Blanton's
particles and more so be sure to check
