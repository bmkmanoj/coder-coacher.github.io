unity horror game series now this is a
video that you could possibly skip if
you know you don't want to hear me talk
about level design and stuff like that
and ideas that you can do for your game
but I'm also going to create a terrain a
basic terrain with you know trees bushes
some grass and things like that that you
can use you know to make an effective
horror game now as I say you can skip on
off from this because I've gone to all
the tutorials about a flashlight some
enemy AI and more things like that but
first of all if you take a lot of games
like Slenderman or amnesia
you know it's built up within the same
sort of idea in mind whereas the
original Slenderman was in a sort of
wooded area you know you've got a
boundary which you can't go out of you
can obviously search around you know
however you like now other instances of
Sunderman have been within sort of a
small scene a small like just like a few
sets of rooms but it's all been quite
close quarters very tight corners you
don't really know what to expect around
either corner similar with and think
games like outlast you've got to opened
doors you're not quite aware you know
where the enemy is going to be so um you
know it's about realistically thinking
how you want to make um our game work
and how are you going to set it out so
you might want to draw yourself up an
idea on paper on Photoshop to how you
want sell a level but then the core idea
is you know make it dark and scary and
I'm going to show you a few ways that
you know you make it dark and you can
add a few effects like lights to make it
more mass farik so what I'm going to
start off by doing is if I go to edit
and render sentence what I'm going to
want to do is change the skybox because
I've not got a skybox in the minute so
I'm gonna go and add a skybox it's gonna
be cold I'm going to open the moon shown
once obviously if you look you know you
can see the moon and stars and
everything like that it's at night if
you want to import that you right click
on your project panel and you click
import package
and skyboxes now from there what I'm
going to do is going to create a basic
to rent now this is using unity 4.3 so
it's slightly different than before used
to have a tab at the top if you go game
object create other and terrain you'll
create a big big big train now if you go
to the settings option you might be on
this on there pen and raise height if
you go into the settings option and you
change the width to 200 and then you
turn change the length to hundred and we
can keep the height roughly the same now
once we've done that that's all well and
good we'll want to turn the wind
settings down unless you want grass to
move and things like that but I don't so
you know you can decide that so what
we're gonna do is we're going to go over
to a little paintbrush and we're going
to pin some textures on and this is just
going to be the base for our textures so
what we can do is we can add some
textures obviously you can import the
terrain assets within unity and you can
assign a texture now I'm just going to
add a sort of stone texture so stone
tell to and storm tell to and then the
normal map I'm going to apply that and
that means it'll just be applied to my
scene you know pretty tailed but that
doesn't matter for now we're not going
to keep it quite like this and I'm what
I'm going to do is add another texture
and what I'm going to do is add some
grass and then I'll probably just add
this grass I'll choose this I'll click
Add then we've got the grass selected
what we want to do is turn the target
strengths down so when we paint over it
you know we get a sort of a lower
opacity over the pen but what I'll do is
I'll keep it to about this amount so we
can see some of the actual storm and
rockiness below I'll increase the brush
size to the maximum and just you know
give the terrain a quick paint over you
know just something really simple
just to give the literary solve a
texture and we'll just you know break
this up a little bit once I've gone over
it so I've got over that you can still
see the stone a little bit you can see
the grass nuts all we can do is we can
go to our other material turn the target
strength down a little bit and then just
you know paint all over increase it
maybe a little bit and you can add some
patches obviously decrease the brush
size a little bit and you know you can
add some more patches to the terrain to
make that come through a little bit more
than other areas if you wanted you know
build up in some areas but anyway that's
just the basis of just applying some
materials and just pin in or you can go
and try it however you like now what I'm
going to do is I want to add some trees
so if you go to the place trees option
and add a tree you can obviously create
trees using the tree create in unity but
I have actually got a pack which is I
can't remember who makes it but it's on
the unity asset store it's a nature pack
the person who makes it's got a range of
brilliant packs which you've got the
pre-made trees bushes and all sorts of
great stuff make sure you check that out
if you're looking for some you know
brilliant trees for a fairly good price
now what you can do is I'll find a tree
that I'm looking for so I'll add tree
one here add it to my scene and then
I'll go edit trees add another tree and
I'll search again and I'll add tree to
click Add so what I'm going to do here
is tree one you can change the brush
size and the tree density so we'll take
the tree density down to 1/2 where what
I'll do is I'll just you know place some
trees about in here you know so we get a
sort of random spread now I'll select
tree two and maybe put the tree density
up a little bit and what I'll do is add
some trees you know in between here and
there so we get a more dense look
obviously you know we can add more of
these and you can take them down and
mess about without that way you can
change the tree height and the width and
stuff but we'll keep it on uniform what
I want to do is break it up
maybe adding a bush so what I can do is
add another place tree mesh and I'll
select this Bush here click out what
I'll do is I'll zoom into the terrain a
little bit and then what I'll do is if
we keep most brush size sort of in the
middle and then turn it to a tree
density up make sure you select your
bush and then you know what we'll do is
actually turn the tree dance all the way
up and then we'll just randomly add
bushes over the terrain so you know we
don't have such a boring look so you
know you can see where you've added it
here you know we'll just add them about
so we don't get such a bombing scene
which is you know I've got nothing going
on obviously now what you can do is you
know you may want to add a little bit of
grass to this so what we can do is we
can go to paint details and what we can
do is add a grass texture and if we
choose the material and we're typing
grass what we'll do is I'll choose a
grass material now when I add if I click
Add and add that grass there it's a very
very bright color not really much in
what we want so if we click Edit we can
change the material on it to maybe much
the actual and bushes and stuff that
we've got so if I leave that there and
actually keep the brush size you know
3/4 of the way on and turn the target
strength down a little bit we can just
add patches of grass here obviously you
need to you know work out what you want
to do and how you want it to look but
you can add patches all of you Tyrone
obviously if I turn the brush size up as
much as I can and just add bits
obviously you can press use one click
I'll hold it down to add more but you
know it's just whatever you know you
feel that's appropriate for your scene
that you created so
that's pretty much it for I didn't sort
of the basic element to you to ran and
adding that together now what I was
going to show as well is if you go to
render settings and you go to ambient
light if you turn the ambient light all
the way down you will actually notice
that you know we can't actually see
anything so if I go into game now I
press play we can't actually see very
much that's going on so obviously I said
that I'd help create a flashlight in
later tutorials and uh pretty simple to
do but for now what I'll do
so I'll go to the render settings and
increase the ambient light for now while
we can see what will go up what we're
doing and going on so what I'm going to
do is I create a prefab with a lantern
and my lantern all it is is a basic
model that I created in 3ds max and it
actually has a light attached at the
bottom of it and a self-illuminated
shared uh so it looks like it's lit up
now what I would do is actually select
the light in the bottom and just
increase the range so the range helps us
see from a distance so if I increase the
range on here you'll notice that the
floor slightly brains'll will knock the
ambient light down and if we click back
on the light again you know we'll notice
you might want to just change your
elements up so you add a bit more
intensity so this light actually has an
animation on it and animation is one I
made when my first tutorials about unity
was to make a flicker now I've added my
flicker animation I've clicked play
automatically so it will now flicker in
you see so what I'm actually going to do
again you know you might want to leave
this off but it's just keep in the mid
so we can see what's going on so what
I'll do is I'll select my London and
I'll press control D to duplicate it a
few times
around the scene it just can get a
little bit of light and a little bit of
an atmospheric mood so we've added a few
of those around I'll go to my
first-person controller and you need to
make sure it's sort of high enough
within your scenes with a press play you
know my characters about high enough in
the scene but if you want to change the
height you can change in the character
controller you can change its height
there so if I turn the render settings
and make the ambient light all the way
down and then we press play in the game
you'll notice the lights within the
trees but you will obviously after you
know adjust this to whatever you want to
work with in your level so obviously I
might want to adjust this slightly so
the intensity is maybe a little bit more
and then obviously increase the range a
little bit someone will play again you
can actually notice it much more within
the scene obviously that's a little bit
flat in the air but you catch the idea
that you get a sort of atmospheric look
about you seen and obviously with a lot
of games it's just about a lot of trial
and error and you actually want to just
take the core idea and add elements to
it another good way especially if you've
got unity pros you can add actual
effects to your main camera so I can
turn off some of the effects that I've
got an especially color correction
because color correction can give you an
actual idea of something that isn't
always there so if I turn my on being
light all the way back up so you can see
the scene and this is what it looks like
in game if I turn my color correction
off everything gets a lot more bright
and differentiating color now when I
turn my color correction on and i've
just adjusted this to make it look more
green
you get a more solve and sometimes more
darker and atmospheric scene so you know
you can combine this with a lot of
different effects to make your game a
little bit more and unique and exciting
to play so as I said just some key
features is you know there I showed you
how to create it around add some lights
use my other tutorial to make it flicker
make sure the ambient light is all the
way down and make a sort of spooky look
to a level that you've created and
obviously you know you just tweak it
anywhere you like so as ever
there's my tips on sort of making a
level and helping you design something
and giving maybe some ideas so thanks
very much for watching and don't forget
