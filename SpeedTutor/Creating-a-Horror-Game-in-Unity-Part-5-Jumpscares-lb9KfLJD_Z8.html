horror series tutorials and this is
gonna be about adding some sound effects
or enemy appearing effects that you'd
see in a horror game so you might expect
a a monster to jump out at you only walk
over a Collider or when you're looking
down a corridor or something like that
so I'm gonna show you how to make an
enemy appear just a basic mesh and then
add a sound effect at the same time then
make it disappear or very now
split-second so you know you get that
sort of shocking moment alright so first
of all what I've got in my scene is my
first birth control tag this player I've
got my scare trigger which is just on
the floor which is just a box I've
removed the mesh renderer and I have set
it to his trigger then what I've got
it's got my enemy over here which is
just a cube and just named the enemy so
we can keep it constant then what we're
gonna do is we're gonna write a quick
script now this is not going to be a
long tutorial but it's just the basics
of making an enemy appear and scare your
player so we'll call this enemy fright
I'm gonna open up in monodevelop once
that's up and we'll delete the two
functions and then we'll write a
variable enemy as type game object then
I'll write another variable type sound
scare as audio clip usable write
function start two brackets and then two
curly brackets then we'll set enemy dot
get component open brackets mesh
renderer close the up dot enabled equals
false so initially you won't see the
enemy so we'll disable the mesh renderer
so we can't see anything then we'll say
function on trigger enter
open brackets call call on Collider and
then we'll open up two curly brackets
below and we'll say if call dot tag is
equal to a player then we'll close that
up and add two curly brackets below and
then set enemy dot get component just
like the top in brackets mesh renderer
close up that enabled equals true then
we'll set audio dot player one shot up
and brackets then we'll write in scare
sound close that up then we'll say yield
wait four seconds and the world packets
we can put one point five close that up
add a semicolon and then we'll also copy
this line again paste it in below and
what we're going to want to do is set
this to false so then after a certain
period of time you can't see the enemy
anymore and then under here we're gonna
say destroy lower case game object so we
can make the enemy appear again so what
I'll do is I'll save that out and go
back into unity then what I'm actually
gonna do is go on my trigger that I've
got here I will add my enemy fright
script make sure this has got an audio
source on it so it plays a sound so a
component audio audio source now you
want to add the enemy game object so
I'll add it in over here and then you
want to choose a scare sound some their
Bell just choose an explosion sound
effect for this so I'll play my scene
and you'll see I'm in my scene again and
I'll walk into the collide activated and
the sound of a player as well as the
enemy appearing
and then you make it disappear so
obviously you can adjust all the timings
you can make it short you make it longer
you can change the sound effects but
that's just a simple way to make an
enemy appear disappear and play a quick
sound just to scare you player so that
was really simple thanks very much for
watching the tutorial don't forget to
