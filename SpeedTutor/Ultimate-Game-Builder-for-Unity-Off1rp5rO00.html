today and this is sympathy I've been
saving up for a long time because it's
been something that I've spent just a
great deal of time just trying to
perfect put together and you know it's
just his first sneak peak announcement
to look at the ultimate game builder for
unity as funny as this sounds it's going
to be or it's very much starting to be
the sort of ultimate base for building a
type of game that you might be wanting
to create so it's trying to be as user
friendly and incorporate as many
features whether that be from free
content on the unity asset store stuff
I've written for custom purposes to
create again from the start to give you
an absolute solid base to give you a
game from the get-go without you having
to do all that sort of a legwork in the
background to start with I will show you
the sort of look of it the things that
you can expect and a little sample
because as I say it's still a work in
progress but it's something that you
might want to check out and I will keep
everybody updated in the future so like
I said I've spent an awful lot of time
trying to just perfect little things and
make it easier for people to do and it's
got to you know essentially buttons to
start with to make it simple an FPS
builder and RPG builder and there'll be
more and more things added to it in the
future and just to start with these two
buttons they have some basic
functionality at the site to decide what
type of content you want to add to your
game to at the very start whether a
single-player cooperative on multiplayer
if it's an FPS game if they're usually
more swaying towards multiplayer and
again with more features will more
things be added and you have a little
slot to write your game naming so I'll
give you the FPS example the final stand
and we've got the full FPS add-on and
you've got other kits which I would
explain it if in the documentation when
it releases and maybe more features when
it is expanded and we can choose
different elements so I'm going to just
choose the best multiplayer mode for
this one and then what I'll do is I'll
then click
as easy as it can be here is we'll build
the actual FPS and we'll just building
all the sort of required settings that
were required to did I start this going
so it works specifically with gonna be
for unity 2017 onwards and you've got no
one to choose what sort of target
platform whether it's higher or lower
you can just choose the custom sort of
packages in here whether it includes the
full FPS pact for multiplayer pack
includes a local and just the core
gameplay mechanics that you would expect
from a lot of different games so for the
most part with the full FPS kit it comes
with all the things that you expect with
the FPS controller motion for characters
and weapons some default prefabs you can
choose to have a health system AI and a
simple perk system so you can use it
directly out of the box for the
multiplayer kit comes with the unit sort
of integration we can track statistics
have a basic multiplayer map selector
simple game mode selector lobby
integration lots of things have just
been spent an awful lot of time adding
core gameplay is just a basic debug
level basic saving the loading menus
credits and any additional settings that
have decided with post-processing an
input manager because unities isn't very
good out of the box
additional effects and any other packs
that are found and also specific
platform support that might be required
if you choose to release to a specific
platform like if we choose to release to
steam it will have some details
documentation and features in there to
get you started on that whole front and
then once we've got this say all had add
all these sort of packs together which
you've decided that you want to choose
and we can just press the build button
and once we press build it will build
all these packages together and
everything that's pre either custom Lee
developed or things from the star and it
will give you a just a base to have
yourself get going with it with what
we've chosen a multiplayer FPS game and
depending on what you've chosen and what
sort of assets you've decided to come
with it it might take a while this is
already built on my machine so
it's slightly quicker but I will skip
this on just to make it a lot easier so
I don't want to give too much away
because this is just the start and just
the basic demo scene that you get and
you can press a pause and going to all
the extra functionality we've got and
you can check all the things out in the
editor but this was literally just a
sneak peek of what you can expect from
the ultimate game builder which set to
release this year and I'll release more
and more content as it becomes more and
more applicable but it's trying to get
there base so you have to do as little
work as possible to make the game that
you always dreamed of so yeah again
