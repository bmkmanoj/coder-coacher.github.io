March 2018 and this is just a mere
run-through of all the ones that have
been featured this month
so number one is the free RPG icons and
this is a set of 20 hand-painted soft
RPG icons all with a fairly a high
quality and suitable for any sort of
modern RPG MMO style game and it comes
with 256 by 256 pngs with 20 as I said
unique icons all with a transparent
background and you can see a selection
of portions books bars gems and things
like that and these are a really nice
style so make sure to check these out
and number two is the pixel art filters
from emulators and this is a set of
shared as which are to sort of style you
game in a particular way and it includes
various functions for us of soft pixel
pixel interpolation and an awful lot of
different configurations and these
shaders were parted from the shaders of
the retroarch
emulator from the unity shaders lab and
it's compatible with most sort of mobile
compatibilities and the originals and
sprites you can check out on the star
over here so this might be suitable if
you want to style your game in a
particular way and I'm three is the
fantasy 2d character free and this is a
pack which is made from various kinds of
unique and colorful characters and it
allows you to customize it depending on
the body the head the clothes that you
might be wanting to make and each
character is divided into joints such as
the body face arms and head so therefore
you can perform natural movements and
the basic setup is really easy and
includes pngs and the PS DS all with the
modification available and it comes with
animations which include idle for an
attack attack to hit and die and the
next one is the skill icons Guardian and

prefabs and this is a library of
textures and prefabs of game effects
