discussion today and this is gonna be
talking specifically about bundles and
the age-old question of when do actually
need to put I want to put your game or
even when you should put your game in an
actual bundle now over the time when
I've developed my previous game you got
you can often get quite a lot of emails
with people coming in from various web
sites saying you know we've got this
bundle here for this certain occasion
whether it's Halloween Christmas
whatever it might be depending on the
game that you've created
if you've released on a platform like
Steam you will often get you know a fair
few a year saying look you can be in
this thing will give you a certain
percentage and you need to provide a
certain amount of keys which is
absolutely fine but you've got to ask
yourself look at the examples that are
out there and even search it for
yourself
the bigger examples of you know the
bundle related websites is usually the
the humble sort of bundles and you can
see even on the website if I'm on here
now as of where I am now on October 2017
is that you can see that they you know
bundle a lot of games together and you
can see the amount of bundles that
they've sold and you know you'll get a
steam key and what and whatnot and
depending on the bundle that you're in
depending on the value of you game
you'll be in the different price
brackets and you will get a percentage
it can range between 10 and 30%
depending on how many games are in it
and you know whichever bundle and
depends where they're gonna sit you on
the front page which is another good way
to get exposure it's not a great web
because you're not gonna get a great
deal of money out of the amount of keys
that you gonna give away if you give
away say a thousand keys two thousand
keys you might get only that you know a
share percentage of how much they
actually make of these things and if
they've got to share it out between 20
games let's say you're gonna come out
with not very much per you know actual
sale back to the question is when should
you do it it should be when your game
has actually died down in popularity in
you know in terms of places like Steam
or wherever you're else you try to sell
it because there's no point you know if
your games is still selling you know 10
20 30 100 a day you know however popular
it might be what's fun of giving us 2000
keys away if you're gonna get you know
1% of you what you would have got on the
other platform it's just almost like
suicide in yourself when a customer from
the bundle might have bought it from
actual steam themselves so like I said
there's plenty of websites where you can
take a look at you know what's available
you have my half you can see the stats
on the amount of games that are sold how
much is selling them you know what price
is this plenty this group of groupies
indie gala bundle stars Humble Bundle
lazy guys fund up there's an old sorts
of different bundles so it's a good way
to you know boost of the revenue if you
need it at the time but I wouldn't rush
into it is the first thing that you do
because there's a lot of people who've
ended up rushing into it straight away
as soon as the game releases to go into
a bundle and that will just kill off
what you might have made especially on
release my advice would be to hold off
until you find a mid ground where maybe
six months down the line a year down the
line depending on what you're selling
then maybe think about putting yourself
in a bundle and then you can go from
there because there's still in places
like steam the still seasonal sales and
sales you can put on yourself so it's no
it's up to you to work out what put
yourself in that soft category that's
just pretty much me soft discussing
these things that I've looked at in the
past and some mistakes people have often
made in the past so try not to fall into
the trap of going straight to the bundle
straight away but hopefully this helped
you out thanks very much for watching
