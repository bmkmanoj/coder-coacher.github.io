showcase for another asset that I've
made for the stop this is a run-through
of the combination system and all it is
is a selection of PBR related padlocks
and you can see on this side is the
example we've got one dark metal and one
brass related padlock with all the
textures that are included and the
system works with a simple rare cast and
there's a simple description here you
will notice that we have a basic
crosshair and with instructions on this
side that you can see a bunch of
padlocks on a door that you might have
and a combination above the doll what
we'll do is we'll walk towards the
keypad will press e to select it will
become in front of the camera and we
have a code of 4 9 3 2 so what we can do
is we can cycle to far nine three and
two you'll get a small animation for it
opening you'll get sound effects for
interacting moving the lock and it then
unlocking two four two one there it's
opened again and you'll get back control
of your character each time you have a
choice between using the two locks and
if you go past you can still move back
to the same point just by doing so and
then once you unlocked it there's a
space left in the code for you to write
whatever interaction you need to do so
if you can then open a door if you can
open it chest if you need to play an
animation it's entirely up to whatever
happens but this is just a simple way to
have a padlock appear you can interact
with it you can you know lock things
away you can do things within the game
and then have a simple way to just
interact with it it uses a simple ray
cast with a few scripts we interact with
an object and we have the controller on
the objects parented to the main camera
and you can change the code by changing
your combination which makes it really
easy and all the documentation explains
how to sell if you have any problems
just let me know so thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like and
subscribe
