tutorial today and it's going to be
about something really simple it's about
spinning an object in unity and
sometimes when you spin objects you
might notice this in really classic
games like Sonic the Hedgehog and things
like that and often and some maybe more
bile developed games where you see the
item spinning that you can pick it up so
really to get this olive Deniz I created
a quick tourist ship in 3ds Max and I
just put a gold material on it with a
bit of specular now in 3ds max the
actual coordinates a different in you
unit is X across wire and Z near the
direction whereas 3ds max has X going up
Y going across and it's just slightly
different so you'll notice it's slightly
differently when I show you this but on
the cube which was created in unity
you'll see that it's correct on that but
first of all what we're going to do is
going to create a script and we're going
to call this object spin and when we
open a mob develop and what we're going
to do is we're going to delete the start
function and we're going to still have
the update function we're going to
create three variables we're going to
call it spin X as integer equals zero
I'm going to copy this line I'm going to
create two more variables and call it
spin Y and spin Z you know our update
function at a time trans transform
lowercase wrote it with an uppercase
open up brackets going to write spin X
spin Y and spin Zed I'm going to close
that off and we're going to save that
script out and when we're back in unity
we're going to actually select our
objects that we want we're going to add
the object spin there and the object
spin here
what we do on this box want it just to
spin
around on this axis or on its y-axis so
if we change the Y to five on there or
we play the game will see that it spins
round by itself and then if we click on
the ring we're going to want to do the
same thing we're going to want to spin
it round on the Y but you see it does
something slightly different because the
coordinates were different in max so if
you set that to zero and you set the
x.25 you'll notice that it spins around
correctly while you're in the actual
game you can increase these amounts
accordingly so if you change that while
stirring game you can see it picks up
speed
and accordingly if you reduce that so
that's pretty much it and that's a
really easy script to actually spin
objects in unity so if you liked the
tutorial don't forget to Like comment
