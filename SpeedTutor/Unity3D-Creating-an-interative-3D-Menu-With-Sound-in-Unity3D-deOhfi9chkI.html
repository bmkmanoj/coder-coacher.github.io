how to make a 3d looking menu which can
be used with some simple text which have
made in Photoshop instead of you having
to either make something in card or
using to build it in with the textures
you can make it on sort of like plans to
make it easier for you and something
more interesting so what I've got in my
scene is I've got two plans one named
exit one then play again as you can see
at the top and the both white plans and
I put them near this wall and I've got
an egg art camera in the scene as well
that looks directly at them so if you
can see from there but what I'm showing
you is with these plans what we're gonna
do is I've got two other images that you
can create and I've got exit and play
again and as you can see for Photoshop
all I've done is created a simple bit of
text on a thousand by two five six work
workspace and I've put the text as white
and then made the background transparent
by deleting the background layer and
just saving that as a PNG show it so it
holds transparency so what you can do is
if you select either be plain see your
exit plane you can drag your exit
thoughts on there and what you want to
do is cuz you can't see anything now cuz
it doesn't have it doesn't know how to
translate the transparency on you shared
is on the right hand side you can go to
transparent cut out diffuse and you can
see your text appear because we had a
alpha transparency in the background
sometimes your text will be upside down
on the plane so you just need to rotate
it around and they'll be fine and you
can do the same with play again so I
play it transparent cuts out diffuse and
you get both both pieces of text there
looking on your wall whatever you want
can do anything in Photoshop really easy
to do so what we want to do is now
create
script so you can do something with your
main menu because essentially that's
what you want to do rip so what we want
to do is create a new JavaScript file
and you can name that button whatever
you want so I'll make that open up my
open up monodevelop and we can get rid
of the two functions at the start it's
what we're gonna do is be able to so
when we click the actual wall button
themselves they do something so we're on
a write new function and put a new
function on mouse up and then put you
and brackets in then put your two curly
brackets on the wing and then
application dot Lord level and then
whatever level you want to go to so we
named I named it game so we can serve
that out and what we can do is we can
click on play again and what we can do
that is then add the bottom script to
play again but we'll wait for the xyx we
don't need to do that yet and what we
could do it is if we press play and if
we got of the play again when we click
on it it says the game couldn't be
loaded so it could bring up an error
it's because we haven't added this to
the build settings that's what you
always must remember
so I've already added this one before so
I'll disturb me a menu and whelmed here
so you make sure you drag them in so
when you played again again press play
and it'll go to your room others of the
scene which works fine but realistically
we want to do something that
incorporates the quit button and then
maybe put some sounds and everything so
if we go back to the button script that
we've got we'll wanna add the quit
button so we want to make sure that the
game quits so what you can do is we can
add an actual if statement in the hole
and the whole thing so if we right
across here if and then we'll pop write
a variable here quit bond
and then we'll open up our curly
brackets and they'll put application dot
quit open and close and then you
semicolon and then what you want to
write is else open up curly brackets
inside the application dot Lord level so
what this says is that if it is a quit
button then the application will quit if
not then you will load the level so what
we want to do is add a variable up here
called quit button like we did down
below and then have that set to a
boolean which he which is true or false
or set to false at the beginning but if
we tick we'll have a little tick box
when we go in and we can set that to
true and then the class is a actual quit
button so we can save that out go back
into unity and if we add this script to
the actual quit button you see the quit
button there if we tick it and that'll
make it true and we go on here you won't
see anything because I'm actually in the
editor but if you built your game you
could click it and it would essentially
quit and it'll change your script above
so you could have either one as a quit
button but for now that doesn't matter
so you have something basic here which
quits
if you want to quit or load a new level
based on whatever you want but you might
want to add a sound so if we had a new
variable above that sound just call it
sound if we set that as an audio clip at
the top and what we want to do is you
don't want to activate the sound when
you actually click it you can do if you
like so you can add the sound in below
but what we can do is add another
function called on Mouse enter so in
your actual Mouse enters the actual
object we can put audio dot play one
shot which means it plays once every
time you hover over it and then you put
your variable name sound and then I just
semicolon
you can actually see on either side that
there is an actual place toward your
audio clip now and what I've already got
is I've got a little sound clip which is
just essentially like that so it sounds
like a little clip so you can drag that
in on either or both whatever change it
however you want and if you bring you
again and you're seeing it that it
doesn't work and you'll get an error
because you haven't had an audio source
and see if you guys component audio
audio sauce and then for exit if you got
upon audio audio source you can then
click on what you can also do with your
camera is this if you have if you've got
the mouselook script you may need to go
import package character controller and
if you haven't already got it on your
camera you can go to component camera
control and mouse lock and then on the
mouse lock you can actually change the
sensitivity down to say 3 is usually set
a default at 15 so you could say it's
whatever you won and then it will affect
and you can also change the minimum
maximum values to see how far left right
up and down that you can actually look
with the camera around but what I like
to do is add some components so I've got
two spotlights in my in my scene and
also if you can if you change your
render settings gender ambient light
down then you press play
you can get more of an atmospheric
freedom again and I've shown you how to
do flickering lights in another tutorial
but thanks for watching
Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
