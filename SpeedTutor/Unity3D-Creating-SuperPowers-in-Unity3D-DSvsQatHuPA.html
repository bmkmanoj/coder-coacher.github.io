today and this is gonna be about
creating superhero style powers for
stuffing games so you know as I said
really suggest that superhero powers you
know you can have any sort of element
that you want but I'm gonna cover for
almost four features today that you can
add to make a sort of a super character
the elements that I'm gonna cover you
may have seen in some of the other
tutorials but I'm you know I'm gonna
refresh over those and show you how you
can incorporate them all together to
make something that encapsulates a full
sort of system in one so what we're
going to do is you don't need to do
anything fancy so all you need is a
first person controller with the general
scripts on that come with the package
and I mean that we're gonna do is refer
to some of these elements in the
character martyr so what I'm gonna do
first is when I start by creating a
script because the script is gonna
actually hold everything that we need to
do so I'm gonna name this script as
hitch controller for superior controller
and then I'll open it up in monodevelop
so I'll delete those two functions and
then what I'll do is we'll start writing
the variables that we're going to use
for this script in itself so I'll create
a private variable and called this CH
martyr and I've got as type character
martyr because what we're gonna do is we
actually reference that script on the
FPS controller so we can change the
speed and the height and everything like
that then what I'm going to do is create
four private variables and the both
they're all gonna be a solve boolean's
for this type of powers I'm gonna have
so super sprint and then we're gonna set
that as type bool in and set it equal to
false what I'm gonna do is create three
more and then I'll create one called
super jump
and then another one called slow-mo and
then and the one called
ha I so I'm gonna have is gonna have as
they suggest super sprint super jumping
slow-motion and sort of a zoom in sort
of look at the distance effect then
under they were gonna have far normal
variables so one variable called main
camera set it as type camera oops
don't let it change it for you then
we're gonna say variable zoom integer
equals 20 variable normal call on
integer equals 60 then variable smooth
as flawed equal to 5 now what we're
going to start off by doing is we're
going to write function start so we're
going to actually reference the
character Marcos script that we're going
to try and get hold of source ACH Marta
equals get component open brackets
character Marta now if you ever seen any
of the strip scripts and you'll say that
I always do a game object find and then
the game opera that we're looking for
the script on but because we're going to
place this script actually on the first
person in troller itself it knows to
already look at that game object so we
just need to find a component in it so
I'll make sure that's safe for now and
then we're gonna go to the update
function and start right in the main
majority of this script so we'll write
function update and then add two curly
brackets and then from there I'll put a
little core and I'll put you know this
is going to be our super jump section so
I'm gonna start off by saying is if
input dot get key down open brackets
quartz one close the brackets in the
core then I'll add one curly bracket
yeah
and says super jump equals question mark
super jump then put semicolon and then
what that means in itself is that every
time we press one it will the the
exclamation mark above the same word
means do exactly opposite to why it's
doing each time so super jump
so if super jump here is equal to you
know some false if we press one it'll do
exactly of why it's set at the moment so
if it's set to false it'll set it to
true then if it's true I'll set it to
false so just alternate for what we want
to do and then what we'll do is under
here I'll say if super jump is equal to
true then I'll add two curly brackets
then I'll say CH Marta dot jumping dot
base height is equal to 100 and then
I'll do a similar thing CH Marta dot
movement this time dot max fall speed is
equal to 200 so what this means is that
if super jump is actually set to true
then we're going to change the actual
height of which we can jump so the best
high and the fall speed of which we
reach the ground you can find base
height and max false group speed in the
actual character Marta script here so if
you click that you can find all the
variables that you might be after and
then what we're gonna do is under there
are set else
if super jump is equal to false add two
color brackets then we'll say just copy
these two lines and then say base high
equals ten and that equals 20
you can set this to whatever you want
and then what I'll do is I need another
curly braket to finish this off so if I
save that now and I'm going to unity and
if I add the superhero controller to
that and then we press play you'll
notice that everything is normal until I
press one you'll notice that these
values here changed and you'll notice
that you know I can jump really really
high now all the way out of the actual
scene that I've gotten if I press 1
again you'll notice that I cannot quite
jump as high just depending what you SAP
now that's for jumping and make sure
that you you know you leave this curly
bracket right at the end so it's on this
one I'll actually add something called
super speed this time so super speed so
we'll add a little comment and then I'll
say that if input dot get ki down open
brackets - it's gonna be very similar to
what we did before then I'll add two
curly brackets and then I will say super
sprint Super Sprint is equal to
exclamation mark super sprint and then
close that and what I'll do under that
is say if Super Sprint is equal to true
then add another two curly brackets and
say C hitch martyr dot movement dot max
forward speed is equal to also 50 and
then CH martyr dot movement dot max side
where's speed is equal to 50 and then
I'll underneath that curly bracket set
else if super sprint
is equal to false then we'll close that
and add these two curly brackets will
copy this same line there and we're
instead of having 50 all hat we'll just
add six that's normal so now as I say if
we save that we try and play the game
you'll notice that we're moving at
normal speed if I press two you'll
notice that the things change and I can
move quite quickly
but you gotta be careful you know
because my scene isn't very big so you
can fall off the end so once you've done
that that incorporates the soup the sort
of sprinting now under here what we'll
do is we'll add the slow motion make
sure you have two things and then I will
say again that if input don't get
keydown open brackets quotations and
three close the two brackets add two
curly brackets at the end and then I
will say slow ma equals exclamation mark
slo-mo and then I will say that if slow
ma is equal to true and and time dot
timescale is equal to 1.0 close the
brackets add two curly brackets and then
the same time dot time scale is equal to
naught point three with a semicolon
under there I will then have else leave
a line break and said time for the
capital dot time scale is equal to one
point or with a semicolon and then say
time dot fit
Delta time equals naught point naught
two times by time dot time scale the
semicolon and then we'll save that and
we're going to unity never press play
but you gotta be careful because I
accidentally made my slo-mo a capital so
now go back into unity and you know
we're working as normal now if I press
three you'll notice that everything goes
slow motion we can have things on top of
each other so if I press two means that
we're moving even quicker but slow
motion on press one and we can jump
really high in slow motion activate
things all at once and then one of the
last things that we're going to do is do
the actual zoom so we'll have another
script comment cold Hawkeye and just
like we pretty much did before we'll do
it at the if input dot get key down open
brackets for close those brackets add
two curly brackets and we'll say hawk-i
equals hawk eye with the exclamation
mark add the semicolon then what's it if
Park I is equal to true we'll close that
up
and we'll say that main camera dot field
of view is equal to mouth F dot ler open
brackets main camera dot field of view
commas oome comma time dot Delta time
times by smooth
and we'll also go beneath those to go
back and set else/if Park I is equal to
false but then under there with the
curly brackets or same man camera in
fact before I write this I will just
pretty much copy this line and the only
thing that I'm going to replace is the
zoom to normal and I will do that how
much they're gonna do is set this smooth
amount to 100 oops and then save my
script and then we'll go back into unity
and what we need to do is actually add
the main camera that we've got in our
scene to script there so now if I press
play you'll notice that if I press far
will zoom in but what we might need to
do is just change that smooth value to
100 there
and then when you press play you'll
notice that we get you know a good zoom
so we can enable super jumping slow
Marsh and zoom in all at one time just
to see what's going on in the world now
that's pretty much it for what was going
to show you for the actual for
superpowers that was going to cover
today you know I'm making something so
you can turn all the powers on and off
you might want to actually add something
you know appropriate to the scene or if
you've seen like a P G's you might see
sometimes like an action bar at the
bottom of the screen which shows you
know what soft skills that you can use
so to add something like this you know
how to make obvious to the player you
can incorporate this anywhere you like
I'll just write a new function called on
function on GUI should I say and then
I'll put and will write on GUI draw
texture open brackets rect open another
bracket so 10 comma 10 comma whatever
the size of your image you want to use
some
it's 500 by 101 applause that bracket
spot comma and write your variable now
my variables called commands so what we
need to do is go back up to the top and
write a variable called commands and set
that as type texture and then I'll save
that I'll close that
go back into unity again and on my first
person controller you'll notice that I
we are now off a texture slot and now if
I find my texture thing called it super
commands there's my texture and then you
make sure you have it set to a GUI and
now you'll notice that at the top of my
screen I've you know got press 1 for
jumping two for sprinting 3 for slow-mo
and then far for zooming in so
realistically you know you get sort of a
visual element and you can place that
anywhere you want on your screen or you
know on you again just to show that you
know you can create some dynamic
elements really so as as I say that's
pretty much covered the entirety of that
superhero script and you know if you
need if you want any more powers that
can maybe work this into another
tutorial but for now that's pretty much
it and as ever if you liked the tutorial
