today and this is gonna be a sort of
quick guide and some examples of the
best ways and the best practices in the
ways of organizing your scripts and your
actual code itself so I'm just gonna
give some examples these are the best
visual examples but they all work in the
same kind of way if when you ever you
start in unity you want to remember that
you know down the road it's gonna get
might start getting a bit unmanageable
and you might have a laugh a lot of
stuff just in your face and it sort of
gets a bit crazy when you're looking at
it so there's ways to break all this up
so when you first get started it's
always people always often rush into
just writing the scripts and then you
think to yourself well I've got a script
about 500 lines and this is far too much
for me to manage now it's always really
important to as the example I'm just
going to briefly show here is split your
scripts up into specific sort of use
cases so say for instance you can see
the player vitals the level manager and
the game controller now the game
controller might might control
everything to do with managing scars and
things like that with him again level
manager might control what levels we
might need to move to and the things
from there and then the player vitals
might control health and information
based on how we're going to take damage
now they're all have specific uses and
yeah we could all shove them into one
script but it might end up become
manageable so it's always really
important to split them up into actually
specific cases where they all have a
specific job so when you go back to it
you can look at a script and look in
your folder and go right ok flute-player
vitals I want to look in that today oh
I'm gonna do something in the level
manager and you don't have to scroll
down lots and lots of hundreds of lines
just to find the parts that you need
that's important from a base level and
once you've got that it will save you a
lot of time because you can look at
those in a glance but so we need to
we're going to adjust a specific script
and you can see that it might be already
so many lines long you start usually
start at your variables that you've
actually declared and the
a way to tidy these up so when you're
actually in unity yourself and say
you've got a script you'll have your
variables are pairing at the side
especially if the public or something
like that if you want them visible in
the inspector now most of the time if a
public variable are you want it
invisible in the inspector isn't
required to be seen or used in other
script it's good to keep them sort of
hidden away so they can't be
accidentally used or used in other cases
if somebody say gets access to your code
or tries to solve manipulate in some way
so the best way to do this if for
instance that I never wanted to be able
to access the max health health and I
wanted to specify in script I can write
in square brackets before any
declaration of a variable and actually
write serialized field and then instead
of having a public whereas sometimes we
don't require it to be public if I'm
never going to act change max health
it's always going to be the same I can
write that as a private integer max
health and when I go back into unity now
you can still see that max health is
available to be used but it actually
made no difference to its use case cuz
it's still available in the inspector
and I can still set the value I just
don't have it actual you know accessible
outside of this script so I can't
accidentally change it if when I did
something wrong similarly with the
public integer health all right sounded
that to be public but I didn't want it
to be actual visible in the inspector at
any point I can write in square brackets
before it hide an inspector just before
it which means I will actually hide this
from the inspector any one time you'll
see it little disappeared from the
inspector now so with these two use
cases that I've been able to keep a
variable private but also make it
visible inspector but also if I don't
want it visible I can use hide an
inspector in a similar way if you're
trying to manage your code and you've
got a lot of variables and you just want
to have a quick glance in the inspector
and you don't know what anything what is
actually going on you might want to do
little tooltips or little information to
this to declare what actually these
things do so what you can do is to say
above this private integer max health I
write in square brackets and what I'm
going to do is write tooltip and then
I'm going to write in two brackets
then two quotes and I might write this
is a variable for maximum health and
then I could say maximum I want to
specify of 60 health at any one time and
I can save that and then when I go back
into unity you can see that when I train
all hover over any of these other
variables nothing happens but I can go
to max health now and I can say that
this is a variable for maximum health
maximum 60 health and then you can
specify now you have a little tooltip to
remind you what was going on because you
might have a big list of variables which
might get confusing
similarly with that you can give this
whole thing a title just to sort of give
it a header so you can remember what it
does so I got header then as I did
similar with the tooltip I can put in
quack in brackets and then in quotes
I can just say health variables so it
helps me sort of split it all up I will
save that out I can go back into unity
and you can see that now it's broken off
from the men and I've and I've got
health variables I can do a similar
thing here I can put another square
brackets header then in brackets in
quotes I can write first variables and
then you'll see that when it's run
refreshes it's broken these up together
and I've got a sir nice way of actually
managing what's going on now for
instance say I've got all these and it's
looking quite messy now and I don't want
to see these all of the time what we can
do is we can use region to actually
specify whether we want to show
something or not so we can pop so you
can write a hashtag and then we can
write region and then we can have press
to shift if we saw one ill specify in my
region I want to say this as health
variable region and I will save that
what I'll do is I will copy the hashtag
End region because that's how we end a
specific region and what I could do is
just underneath the final set of sort of
health variables I can pass the N region
and you can write that yourself
it's just hash and region and then you
will get a little sort of you'll get a
minimization box on the left hand side
of the actual scripting editor and you
can close that up and you can see the
health variable region I've just closed
up so I've just hidden
and I can do that for all of the things
that are available and I can just make
sure that I close it up so I don't have
to see it all of the time because you
might not need to see all the time
especially if you're just writing a few
things in and you just want to hide
specific sections similarly down here if
I'm doing a lot of things with adjusting
the health control you can write little
comments just by writing two forward
slashes and then whatever you want is a
comment you might want again adjust the
region here and just have a hash my hash
region as my region and I will just put
this as health control and again I can
just select that portion just paste it
under here and then what we can do is we
can hide that up and now we've got the
health control just sort of a tag on so
we can't see exactly what part of code
and we can choose to open it or hide it
at any point we like and that just helps
with pure management and they're all the
things that we can do all in all is you
can build up a picture of managing the
variables you've got managing all the
content you've got on hiding things when
they're not appropriately required to be
visible and it's always important to
make sure that you name things
specifically sort of appropriately so
don't give everything to try and avoid
giving them too many things a similar
name because you can get quite confusing
like even though some of these might be
a little bit confusing you want to don't
have something as health slider one or
health slider to our health slider three
because they're all quite similar you
want to give something a specific name
which means something so if somebody
else looked at your code didn't know
exactly what it does so you'd see the
first slider the max thirst and then the
first fall rate you want to give
everything an actual name that's
distinguishable and from for the most
part you probably want to try and avoid
having constant values which you've had
coded into your scripts so you can see
here I use a lot of zeros when you know
I'm referencing the code what I could do
to sort of make this more manageable and
make it better maybe for the future we
could just write a a in square brackets
serialized field we could say private
integer as well let's say for instance
minimum value and I want that always
to set equal to one so I never actually
wanted to particularly be able to adjust
this and yeah that would be visible in
the inspector if I wanted to adjust the
minimum value but said didn't like
before we could just say hide in
inspector and this would be equal zero
now what we could do is just copy that
variable and paste it in in every single
one of these so we'd never see zero
again we'd always have the minimum value
which we could adjust because it's
always important to keep everything very
consistent throughout so you don't have
any sort of hard-coded values it's
something you can change a glance if you
really need to so really it's just a way
for you to try and find steps in your
own mind and you can have a look on
Google for more and more tips for
managing your code and making it more
efficient but these are just some sort
of quick tips just to go through and try
and make it more manageable for yourself
and even other people who tend oh my
corner read your code in the future so
thanks very much for watching don't
