this is going to be part 5b of the
survival series and this is going to be
the continuum part to the infantry
system and today hopefully this time
we'll have a short video so this one's
going to actually show you how to
incorporate a more advanced element to
your infantry system so we needed to
make sure that when we used items in the
infantry like before I'll make and do an
example for press infantry when we eat
fish or use drink or use a bandage
we need to affect the GUI elements that
we have and then obviously not be able
to let us go into - figures okay so what
we'll do is we'll open up our infantry
script script again like we use last
time so you can download that from my
website if you don't already have it but
obviously I look upload an updated
version I'll zoom in a little bit and
what we'll write under our show GUI
variable
I'll write variable minimum Val as type
integer equal to zero and then I also
want another GUI which is going to be a
private variable called player GUI as
type player GUI like we've done before
and obviously people have had this
problem before because you need to make
sure that player GUI within unity so the
script is called this with a capital P
and your variable has got the lowercase
so then what we're going to do to start
with under here we'll start by writing a
function update because we're going to
want to find the script that would go in
for so and the function stat will say
player GUI equals game object dot find
open brackets inside first-person
controller where we've got the player Gy
script dot getcomponent
open brackets player GUI so the name of
the actual script that we've got in
unity so we'll save that out
and now we're going to write some things
in the update statement so we can't go
below minus one in any of our options
for our items that we collect obviously
can go higher because you can collect as
many as you want unless you set
otherwise so we'll make few line breaks
and tab across so just above the if
statement for pressing I to open the
infantry we're going to say that if wood
is less than or equal to zero then we'll
add two curly brackets below and say
that wood is equal to minimum Val with a
semicolon
so that makes sure that if wood is ever
and less less than or equal to zero it
can never go below zero at any point
then we'll paste it in again and we'll
say that if stone is less than or equal
to zero so we'll just pretty much write
stone and we'll paste lane that's
exactly the same will paste in exactly
the same thing for clear
so we'll say if clay is less than or
equal to zero then it's going to be
equal the minimum value which is zero
and then we're going to need another
five more another five more for what
we're going to be doing so one two three
four five and obviously we've got Claire
and then after Claire we have fish and
obviously if you confused all these are
up here so our next one is going to be
cooked fish so we'll find fish where we
had it I'm more pissed in cooked fish so
we keep all our variable names the same
if you copy it from the top
so next one is going to be bottled water
so we'll paste that in here neat and not
piss that in again then we're going to
have a normal bottle
we're going to paste that in paste that
in and then the last one is going to be
bandaged so we'll find the extra we've
got and then we'll paste bandage in here
so this just means all our variables
that we've got which held in the
infantry will never be able to go below
zero so obviously you won't be able to
break again so now everything's going to
save pretty much the same but what we're
going to do is we're going to go all the
way down to where we started with the GU
is to control obviously when and we can
press a button we'll eat the fish but
we're going to actually want to affect
the player GUI so when we fish we're
going to get some hunger if we drink
some water we're going to fill the
thirst bar or use a bandage I'm going to
heal ourselves so what you want to do is
create a function in each of these so
you can write a function by column to
eat with two brackets in Anna semicolon
then one under here for Bob water called
drink with two brackets in a semicolon
you don't have to have these names you
can have whatever you want and then
bandage as type heal with two brackets
and a semicolon and then each of these
functions we're going to have to create
below here so welcome to write function
eat with two brackets two curly brackets
below then we're going to write another
function called drink two brackets two
curly brackets below and the last
function as heal two brackets with two
curly brackets below and then what we're
going to do is obviously reference or
the script that we started off I'll play
a GUI up at the top just here and then
we're going to if we go straight back
down to where we were then we'll save
layer GUI dot hunger bar display plus
equals not point one with a semicolon so
that just means we're looking for the
player GUI script and the hunger bar
display is the variable that we've got
to control the bars going up and down
and then we're just going to add know
I'm one too that you can obviously
change those values according the TR
game then for drink also play a DUI dot
thirst bar display plus C equals not
point one I can imagine you can see
where I'm going with this then for the
he'll player GUI dot health bar display
plus equals not point one so we can save
that out now if we go back into unity
and you can see on your main camera what
I'm going to actually do is make cook
fish equal to three
bottled water equal to three and
bandaged equal to three so you can
obviously see we've got some values so
far so you'll notice that first goes
starts am falling the fastest with
hunger not far behind it obviously if I
bring up the GUI the the stop just while
we've paused the game obviously don't
need to power to the game if you don't
want to and then we're going to do is
eat the fish hunger goes back up goes
down to two bottled water is it will go
up then what we can do is obviously if
you keep on eating then you won't be
able to use anymore and that's pretty
much it for that um tutorial so that's
all be showing this time next time I'll
show you how to pick up the items and go
a bit more into depth with eating and
dealing with your food so hopefully
that'll be in the next few days thanks
very much for watching and don't forget
