today and we're going to talk about
specific platforms and what platform you
might want to release your game and what
might be for you now I know with the
introduction of actual steam directors
do have a lot easier to get your game
actually on the store and others only
pretty much a fee and then you can set
up everything along with that now seem
and unity' you've got a lot of bad press
especially you know when people use the
words quad core now it's again made in
unity that's obviously not going to be
very good it's a little bit unfair in
most cases I mean sometimes newer
developers might come in and you decide
to make a game it might be your first
game that you've created and decide to
you know bring it on to a big platform
like Steam and knowing from you know
I've released a game on Steam that the
communities can genuinely be quite
opinionated so you've got to be prepared
to deal with things like that
I wouldn't recommend uploading anything
to Steam if you've not first maybe made
sure that you've put a lot of effort
into your game especially if it's your
first or you've made something and
previously and you're quite happy with
the outcome you need to see it more of a
factor if you saw your game on the steam
platform you need to take a step back
and think to yourself would I actually
want to play this - why screenshots look
professional does my artwork from a game
look professional let's say we take and
we can look at Resident Evil 7 I know
this is more of a triple-a standard book
it's good to have a look at other star
pages and things like that and have a
look at how they'd set everything out
what they've written what images they've
created what and the things they decide
to do in the discussions how they reply
to the customers themselves
how they organize their entire page and
if the value achievements what support
that they give them you want to make
sure that you've got a good trailer like
I mentioned before if you were to browse
a catalogue like Steam would you want to
see or would you want to pay for a
where it looked like somebody might have
spent a week making some assets or
something cobbled together from the
unity store some tutorials that you
found on YouTube so you've got to think
of it that way like I said take a step
back and think to yourself is my game
suitable for the start of I put in
enough effort to release it on Steam
because people are not going to hold
back and when they you know give you
feedback on your game and the whole
point on what I'm saying is the more
effort you put in the more you'll get
out if you give yourself a bad
reputation let's see the likes of people
like Jim sterling and they have had you
know potential legal battles and stuff
with certain developers making you know
particular types of games but you want
to look at it in an objective way and
make sure that you don't fall into those
things now more over on the subject if
say that you confidently game but maybe
you don't want to push out to steam
maybe see how it does on other platforms
there is other platforms that you could
potentially sell your game and you could
give it a sort of test run before you
move to such a big platform so you can
take your games and stuff to somewhere
like game Joel and you can offer it for
free you could offer a demo for free you
can even charge with the introduction of
the marketplace and this is where you'll
find a lot of people love and you know
smaller indie devs that might be
interesting giving you feedback and you
can find a lot of cool people on there
there's even a places like each year
where you can can offer you game for
free just like game Joel or you can
offer a paid service and just because
like it's just because what I was
pointing out that voice a quality quite
a bit steams you know should have better
quality that doesn't mean to say that
you don't see top quality games on
platforms such as this you just want to
have a look around and see what quality
you want to reach and take an idea of
the types of people and the types of and
you want to take a look and decide what
platform you want to release on remember
people on the likes of itchy on gamejolt
will be maybe a lot more lenient in
terms of sort of giving you critical
feedback without sort of you know saying
against really crap or something like
that because that's what you you know
often see or
steam and things like that so it's about
reflecting on some things you trying to
create seeing if it has a good enough
quality to any of these platforms at all
and if it does that's great make sure
that you take into account that you
should always be mindful of the audience
that you're trying to reach and go from
there so thanks again for watching Doug
it's a Lincoln and subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
