make a simple countdown timer in unity
and this can be useful with a lot of
different things whether you're making a
cool-down for a power or whether you
just you're not counting down towards
something again but I'll just show you a
simple basic way of actually doing this
you know just so you can use it in any
way you see fit so what we're going to
do is create a new JavaScript file and
we'll call this timer and then we'll
open up in monodevelop and then I'll
delete these two normal function so
variable timer as type floor and set
equal to ten point zero for instance
then we also function up there
add two brackets add two curly brackets
below and so the timer - equals time dot
delta time with a semicolon means at the
time we'll just count down every second
or so until it reaches a certain point
now that's pretty much the entirety of
it that'll count down forever you know
till you tell it to stop so what I'm
going to do is save function on GUI and
then add two curly brackets and say GUI
dot box open brackets new rect open the
opposite ten comma 10
comma 50 comma 20 close the output comma
at two quotes then said Plus timer dot
two string open brackets inside there
we'll say zero pause the brackets poor
semicolon that just means we set timer
and so it doesn't output as a float so
on that floor is a decimal place so if
we say to that I'll just make it as a
whole number and now what I'll show you
is if I go back into unity add this to
my first birth control you can see my
time on this side and you can see it in
my scene you can see that it counts down
from 10 seconds you know really basic
you don't even have to have it on a GUI
if you just want it running in the
background but you can see the flow on
this side view and now you can see it
goes into minus seconds so we don't want
that to happen then what we'll say is
that if timer is ever less than or equal
to zero then we'll actually say that
timer is equal to zero and that just
sets it to zero when we reach it and
then you can just do something cool with
that then and that means that you know
if ever reaches zero then you can do
whatever if you wanted the time let's go
the other way you can plot prep band pop
plus equals and it'll count up from 10
and then you can oh you can create
something in that sort of where so if I
press play again you'll notice that it
counts down all the way you know until
we get to the point where it reaches
zero and then you know it doesn't go any
further and you can do whatever you want
with them so that's pretty much just the
sim you know the simplicity of creating
a simple count down count up timer you
know whatever you want it for with you
on it in the background or not so thanks
very much for watching and as ever if
you liked the tutorial don't forget the
light-cone and subscribe
Cheers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
