today and this is gonna be about looking
at creating a live feed security camera
within unity Pro so this is something
where if you've ever seen in a game on a
screen in real life as a sort of
security room where you might have
guards stationed then looking at
security cameras and you might have an
output ever camera that's looking down a
corridor somewhere on which you can
actually display an output to a screen
that you want so it's just gonna almost
output it as a texture and it's called a
render texture in unity now I apologize
to all the people in unity free or watch
my tutorials but this is just gonna be a
one for unity pearl while I had the idea
in my head I thought I might cover it so
all we need to do is we need to do a few
things obviously you'll need unity Pro
you can get the free 30-day trial if you
want to you know try it out for yourself
so first of all what we want to do is
we've got our scene what we first want
to do is right-click on our project
panel and choose render texture and then
what I'm going to call this is security
cam Tex could be anything you like
really and then we can set sizes to how
big we want the texture to output if you
want any anti-alias and to make it
clearer and then other things to help
with certain sharpness and so on but
we're not really concerned about that
you can fiddle with that as you want so
we've got the texture now but the
textures it's got nothing to show
nothing to do so what we want to be able
to do is I'm in this position here in my
scene game object Korea other and camera
and you'll see the camera output to do
this looking at my character now well I
want to align it to this position that
we've got if I've got an object or a cam
this camera selected got a game object
and I will align to view now it'll be
aligned to my view that I've got here so
if you go into game you can see that I'm
looking through the camera there and
what we'll do is we'll rename this
security camera for now and then what
we're gonna do is we're gonna put the
security camera texture texture into the
target texture slot which is looking for
a render texture and once we've done
that what we can all then do is you can
create a plan a cube anything you like
I'll quickly create a plan and it's just
been POW and we'll class this is a
really big screen if you ever watched an
event in like a big town or something
like that and you watch an event on a
big screen will roughly put it like that
now what we can do is we can drop this
security camera texture onto there and
you'll notice that it now outputs our
scene onto there so you can see if we
play our game you'll notice that you see
our player looking for where that camera
would be in this and it outputs to a
texture on the screen now you can change
the quality of the texture so if we set
it to 1024 by 1024 you'll notice that
the resolution will sharpen up for our
scene but we're not really as I said
really concerned with that this is just
a simple way so if you set a camera
choose a render texture you can display
an output of your game using that
perfectly simple perfectly easy and can
be used as a security camera and many of
the different things depending what
you're looking to make so thanks again
