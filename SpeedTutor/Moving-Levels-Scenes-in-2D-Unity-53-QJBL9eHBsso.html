tutorial today and this is going to be
showing you how to move scenes in 2d in
unity 5.3 and above ok so we've got a
new 2d scene when you're launching so
you can choose to make it a 2d and I've
got a few things and all I've got is a
basic platform so the character can run
of it we've got our character here which
is from the standard assets which you
can right click and import package in 2d
and you can just drop this character
rigidbody and because you always need to
make sure that if you're going to want
to move is seen on say a trigger of what
I'm going to show you here you need to
make sure that it's got a rigidbody 2d
unnatural character itself and then at
the end we've got ourselves a sprite
which is just pink sprite here and
that's also got a box Collider 2d and
you can go add component and you can
choose to start typing in box Collider
and you can box Collider 2d to that and
make sure that it is is trigger you can
then click back on your character you
may have and you want to make sure that
it has a tag of player you can click the
drop down an add tag if it isn't already
you know tag this player or if you had
need to add one and that's pretty much
the basis of it you just make sure that
you've got a trigger is set it is
trigger we're going to be able to run
into this and change seams what do we
want to do we need to maybe make sure
that we've got aim at the end of the
scene I'm also have that scene out as
level to underscore 2d we'll go inside
that see now you can tell it's that
scene if you look at the top what I'll
do is I'll just get rid of this sprite
just so you can tell then I'll go back
into level one by double clicking it and
you can see that our sprite is still
there or we can do is we can go in file
build settings and we can add level two
to the build settings just to make it
easy because that's what we're going to
need to move to then we can right click
in the project panel go create C sharp
I'm going to call this move seems 2d
open that up in visual studio or what
editing program they have we'll get rid
of the two starting functions that we've
got and then we're just going to use a
new reference to the top so we're going
to say using
lunacy engine
dot scene management with a semicolon
the end and that allows us to use the
shorthand for accessing some of the
stuff that we need to move scenes in
unity 5.3 and above so we can do is we
can write two square brackets and write
in the square brackets serialized field
and then we're going to create a private
variable and have this is set to a
string and we can set the variable name
to say new level and all doing here to
use serialize field is it makes a public
variable visible in the inspector
whereas normally we'd need to make it
actually instead of private would have
to make it public but because we don't
need to access it from elsewhere we just
might as well leave as a protected
variable then we're going to have it as
a type string because we're going to
write the name in that we just created
and we just give it a variable name so
we can reference it in this script so
now we're going to write an on trigger
enter but for 2d so we're going to say
void on the trigger and 2d open up the
brackets and type in collider with a
capital 2d then you can write whatever
you want in this end with here which is
going to be our collision so we can
write other we can have two curly
brackets below then we can say that s
over soft compare tag in brackets then
in cause player with a capital we will
then close up the two brackets towards
the end and add two curly brackets below
and say that scene manager dot load
scene open up the brackets and choose
the variable that created which was new
level and then we'll just put a
semicolon at the end so we're doing
there is we have to put a reference to
the top of scene management to do the
shorthand to access scene manager and
we'll load the scene and we're choosing
the new level which we're going to set
in the inspector so what we'll do is
we'll save that out now and then what we
can do is we can click on our sprite
here which was going to be the thing
that we're going to move to when you see
we're going to add the script there and
you can see that new level we need to
write something in there so we can name
it level to underscore to D like Rio you
know originally brought the level up and
then once we've done that we want to
like I said check that it's in the build
settings
and we can hit play and we can run
around with our character and go towards
the collision and you can see the
removed scenes you can see the new sinks
we moved to level two on discard 2d and
we don't have that sprite there anymore
so that was just a really simple we just
need to make sure that you player has a
rigidbody 2d it's tag display anything
or the collider you're going to use me
to have a boss Clio 2d and if set is
triggered into make sure you add as you
know these many scenes as you you're
going to move to in the build settings
by file build settings and you create a
basic script which just has a basic
ontriggerenter 2d and checks for the
player and if it's collided and then
moves the scene according to the wall
we've set so pretty much that's the
Beyond and I love it
