tutorial today in unity which is all
about the cloth modifier and what I'm
gonna show you to do is to have a sort
of washing line effect because sometimes
in games you want sort of dynamic
elements so clothes can be a thing that
you could run through it doesn't have to
be clothes
it could be a poor street could be
sheets it could be anything it could be
hanging out of a window your character
could run past it you want something
that's got physics on it to make it a
little bit more interesting
so really all I've got in my scene is a
plan a directional light and a
first-person controller all I've got
here is just my if you see the object
flying that's gonna here you'll see the
object floating and that's just going to
be my washing line for this example and
what I want to do is go to game object
create other and go to cloth and you
will get a the cloth and you'll get the
cloth system out but and the problem
with this cloth is the fact that it is
actually on a plane in itself and with
it being on a plane you can't see behind
the plane so it can be a bit of a
problem you can make it two-sided and
aware but really the way I'd wear I'm
gonna do it is all I'm gonna do is I
made some meshes in 3ds Max and put some
edge loops in it because you need edge
loops to actually let the mesh Bend as
if it would realistically so I've got a
box here that I created and I need to
rotate it so I've just made this but if
I just made this a little bit bigger so
you can see what's going on I will put
it very close to that plane as if it's
because if it's hanging off maybe make
it a little bit bigger
and just pull it underneath that plane
and what I'm going to do is gonna let
you edit that I'm gonna pull it to the
other end so we've got two now two with
the same thing and what I'll do is for
something basic
I'll just put I'll just put the dirt
texture on it just so you can see what's
going on and then what I'm gonna do is
do with care another two of these and
I'll take one and I'll change the mesh
again it's a box one I'll do is rotate
that and bring it up toward the washing
line again and I'll put a different
texture at this time it looks at the
terrain dirt so it looks a bit like a
come on top so we've got all our cloth
and modifiers in there really what we're
going to do is select each piece of
cloth there's varying different elements
on each side but there's something at
the bottom called the touch kaleidos and
it's depending how many colliders you've
cut you can have one two we can have as
many as you want and you just need to
pair and all the the cloth modifier to
the actual object that it'll hang from
so if we set this to one and we set all
into one press ENTER we get an actual
Collider option and what we're going to
do is we're going to change that to cue
1 I've got to press ENTER so if we can
just drag that in cube one
check then cubed 1 and again cube now
that's all we will need to do for those
you can adjust varying amounts of
settings but what I'm going to show now
is I can run around in the scene and I
can run into each of the objects and
they'll act like the would if they were
on an actual washing line in your game
so you can actually it actually acts
like cloth wood and it gives you an
interest in fact and something very
basically can use just similar all sorts
of different things in your game really
easily so anyway that's pretty much it
