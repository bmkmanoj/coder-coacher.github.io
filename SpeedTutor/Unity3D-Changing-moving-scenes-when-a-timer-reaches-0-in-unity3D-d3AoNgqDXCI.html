at using triggers to makers I'll move on
to all the scenes but this time again I
had a lot of people asking it's same
when you have a timer that runs down or
goes to zero we want to be able to move
a scene that way so this is very similar
I've done a tutorial which is about when
the timer and gets making a simple
countdown timer shooter so and then from
there what we're going to do when it
hits zero and we're just going to do
what we did before application load
level it's very simple but I'll cover it
again so everybody's aware what we'll do
is what I'll do is the old script that
we had you could just create a new
JavaScript if you need to but I'm just
going to duplicate my old one so I'm
going to call this move scene timer so
it's in my scene that I've opened up
what we need to do is just me need to
make sure that you've got a first-person
controller in your scene then what we'll
do is we'll open up move scene timer in
monodevelop if once you've created your
new JavaScript file and then it'll be
like what we had before so the on
trigger event but this time we don't
need an on trigger event what we'll do
is we'll delete that function and we'll
just remove it on then what we'll do is
with like variable time I have it set to
a flow equal to ten point oh ma that's
going to be our ten seconds then we'll
write function update to brackets then
two curly brackets below then we'll say
timer minus equals time dot delta time
with the semicolon so that means that
whatever we have set the timer is
counting down every second or so and
then what we need to do within we need
to make an if statement to check every
time we run the update is that if timer
is ever less than or equal to zero what
we're going to do solve is that if that
timer hits zero we're going to set
application dot load level open brackets
and then we can have something whatever
your scene might be called and have that
set to new scene in brackets in quotes
and then have a semicolon and then what
we'll do we save that out and then from
there what we're going to be able to do
is if we add this to our first person
controller
I'm just deleting the old asset that I
had for this scene I will add move scene
time and you can see the timer is set to
ten seconds and then what you need to do
when you build settings is you need to
make sure that new scene is added to
there so create a new scene with file
new scene then save a/c now I'll save it
as and then just drag it into here and
then we'll be able to run it what I'll
do for now is I'll set this timer to
five just so it's a little bit less so
you can see it counting down on this
side and we can do whatever we're doing
in our game and when we get finished it
will load and when you see but there's
nothing among you seem to see but all
I'm again showing like my last one is
that something very simple is that my
timer is equal to ten in the update
function we count down if it hits zero
we'll do application load level and then
it's equal to new scene almost so that's
it for both going on and trigger and
when you hit to zero from a timer you
can just load a new level member
application that load level does just
that so again thanks very much for
watching and don't forget to Like
