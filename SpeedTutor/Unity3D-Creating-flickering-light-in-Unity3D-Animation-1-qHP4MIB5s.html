simply make a flickering light in unity
which is really simple and easy to do
anybody can pretty much do it and it's a
good effect to any game essentially so
what you want to do is you want
depending what light you want to use I
think spotlight works the best because
it's generally how a light would be in
real life so if you got to spotlight so
you want to go game object create other
spot line and you can see it's in my
scene which I already set up which is
just a plane with some cubes on with a
camera lock and I just so you could see
what was going on so what you want to do
is just set set it to zero zero zero so
it's entirely in the center as out with
everything else you can see the spot
light in the scene and if you pulled the
little nodes at either side you can see
that the spotlight angle changes so I
just want to have it so you can see
what's going on so essentially we've got
that there we want to create an
animation on this light to make it
flicker essentially so if you go to
window an animation you get this dialog
box
almost the animation box that pops up so
if we click on the little record button
the little red circle it pops up is a
little Unity box so if we name the
animation or whatever you want to
flicker whatever you want you get now
you now get that appear in with your
animation so you can now adjust your
intensity so on the intensity you can
click a little drop-down which is AB key
so you've added your first Cree frame
and the intensity is at one then if you
move across to say you know half a
second from we at the top here if we add
a new keyframe and set the intensity to
zero and then move to a second set the
intensity to one again and then some
ways down we set the intensity to zero
again
and then that we say back to one
so essentially what it will look like is
just like that and essentially when we
click off the little player button you
can see that it makes a smooth curve for
us so the actual light is in a smooth
smooth instance and you can change that
but for now we'll leave it as is and you
know you just get like that you can
speed everything up you can select you
ya know it's individually and just drag
them up change them as you wish but what
I always like to do is leave your end
keyframe there exactly the same as you
beginning to keyframe to make sure
that's one that then when you scrub
across your timeline and when you play
it loops almost perfectly to what it was
originally if we close this dialog box
and you can see when we've played the
scene you can see the flicker it only
does it once and we don't want that
because realistically all that would be
flickering on forever until you do
something otherwise if you click on the
actual animation go to wrap mode loop
and if you have that loop now you go
back to your scene it always it will
always flick forever until you do
something else to it so essentially you
can change any of these options inside
the animation on your light you can
change the color the range the intensity
the the shadows that it gives off
anything that you want but simply for
this there you go create the simple
light we just flickers infinitely so
