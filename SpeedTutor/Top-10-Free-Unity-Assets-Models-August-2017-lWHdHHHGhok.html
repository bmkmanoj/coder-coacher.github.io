models for August 2017 now this video is
gonna be a slightly longer one because
there's so many cool 3d models in this
package I didn't want to leave any out
so there's gonna be about 14 so I will
strainers I will trim whizzed through
these as fast as I can so the first one
is the free stylized nature environment
and it comes with a range of trees seams
grass flowers mountains skybox ground
textures and more so if you're looking
for a bunch of assets which could go to
towards your maybe a survival game or a
nice little environment you can take a
look at this package the second one is I
don't really know how you to pronounce
this juicy lungs characters something
like that sorry for butchered the name
but this is a selection of sort of
monstery or fabled characters which are
based on does 3d soft and Eric models
and they're a repurposed for this use
sellers a few different ones a gorilla
solve elf looking people and various
sort of creatures that can be used in
this style the next one is the toon RTS
units undead demo which is just a sort
of miniature our TSL or skeleton which
includes one model and texture and a
material which comes with various
animations which can be idle walk and
it's happen as you can see from the
video down here so I'm a tree cool if
you spawn a lot with these in a sort of
battle game and the next one is
high-quality old books and this is a
range for nepali books which come in
between 1k and 2k resolution textures
and it's very low poly with 60 triangles
each and they're all PBR related so
they're all nice little models and I
thought I throw this in because it might
be a nice one to clutter up and see and
the next one is a high quality and field
rifle so our base model and it's a rifle
with about 7,000 triangles with PBR
materials up to 4k and you can see the
very detailed look of this and I think
ever featured a few of these different
sort of PBR related assets that I'm
gonna available from this developer so
you should check all those out if you
look
for some high-quality PBR weapons and
next one is the fire fire word light
machine gun and laser soft some little
sci-fi looking pistols machine guns type
of things which range from 1,000 to
3,000 triangles with 512 textures and
these might be a cool one to just add to
a sci-fi looking game and the next is
the metal tower 3d model and it's quite
a large tower by the looks of things
which includes 2 mm textures and it's a
model about 19,000 triangles and it's
all includes PBR materials and as you
can see this KABOOOM that you could use
for a vast amount of games and it looks
quite a nice detailed asset if you're
looking for somewhere to have little
watchtowers or things like that the next
one is the medieval weapons set not one
which is another nice selection of PBR
quality assets which include for prefabs
with a bunch of LEDs three level of
details for each eight PBR textures
ranging from 4k and to 512 and you can
down scale in size as required and you
can see it comes with a range of swords
and axes the next one is the farm
animals set and is a set of five law
polygons farm animals with solve vertex
colors and they range between 500 and
knowledge triangles and includes a duck
chicken cow pig and sheep and if you
look into create a little low poly
farming game or maybe games just to
stock out a little nice area this won't
be one for you and the next asset is the
all packages demo which is a demo of 3d
and 2d packages all as one it's a
collection of different sets of low poly
world skyboxes art UI elements and you
can see in the video
who's with 2d forests fantasy and an all
array of quite sort of fancy looking 3d
and 2d items so this would be a cool one
to check out and it's just a sort of
have a look at probably what would be a
bigger package and these might be really
cool if you're looking to Korea that's
these I love fantasy environments
skyboxes
and a lot of different 3d UI elements
and the next one is the awesome a low
poly fantasy clouds as a selection of
just low poly cloud assets which have a
custom subsurface scattering shed which
allow you to sort of see the light
through the object itself and does some
fancy technique they're sort of similar
to a style of like a clash of clans type
of game and the next one is this simple
cars a pack and this includes a variety
of low poly models which range from 370
to 450 polygons and it includes a police
car a taxi two color variants for each a
family car a coupe a with all different
color variances for age and you can have
a look at the simple town pack which
would go with it the next one is the a
warden barrel pack and this includes six
hand-painted variants of barrels which
include 1k by 1k diffuse and normal Maps
which include a variety of that what
looks like to be it could be magical
powder it could be closed up boxes could
be gunpowder water and things like that
but this might be a nice one
just with again another nice look on the
asset to create a stylized hunters a
game and the last asset that I'll be
showing today is the mountain terrain
rock and tree package and this is a free
package which includes a free
high-quality terrain with the rocks and
the trees and it all includes PBR ready
assets and the mountain terrain is 2,500
polygons the rock is about 350 and 3,000
and each object has a bunch of PBR
materials which include transparency and
other things ranging up to 4k resolution
so all in all there's quite a few 3d
models that are available that I think
are really really well in the best
months I've seen so far on just the
sheer amount of 3d models available our
