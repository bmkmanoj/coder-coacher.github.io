tutorial today and this you're gonna be
showing you how to create a simple
countdown timer within unity now I did
show this in the past but it wasn't
always the best optimized way and you
got a lot of calls in the update
function some just going over this for
people that might be new or people don't
want to not learn the bits about making
sure it's nicely optimized and ready for
you to use so you can see my example
here I've got an image which has got the
text UI above it and I've got button now
we've got a countdown timer script and
we can set the amount of time but we're
going to count down now I've correctly
set it to 5 when I press play it will
count down to zero now this is all well
and good it's counting down all the way
to zero as we expect and then it will
get to zero on that solid fine we can
press the button and this could be our
reset button and you know we could do
this and the functionality of the reset
button doesn't have to be an actual
button it could just do the same
functionality when you reach that you
see whether you restart the actual scene
or not but this is just a concept in
itself so what I'm going to go with it
to start with is if you've got a new
scene here what you can do is
right-click on the hierarchy and create
a new canvas so what we can do is you
could right-click UI and create an image
let's say will create the canvas and
we'll create an image with this what
we'll do is we'll just scale it out a
little bit so we get sort of you know
more of a rectangle than anything else
and then now we'll just pair it place it
roughly in the middle then what we can
do is click on the canvas right click
the canvas go UI and select text and
we'll get text over this actual image in
itself now what we can do is on the UI
text over this side we can just rename
this to count down just to make easier
so we understand what's going on we're
going to then align this to the center
and then put it in the middle and we can
align this using the lines in the in the
UI to help us out
you've potentially scale it up if you
like but we'll leave it like this for
now what we can also do is right click
go UI and create a button and we can use
that for later when we need it so we
have everything now we have a countdown
just some things going on so now we need
to create the scripts all right click
another project Power Core career and
we'll choose
see sharp and we'll call this and we'll
call this countdown that the skirt will
open up in Visual Studio will do is I'll
get rid of the two starting functions so
we're in our beginning here so what we
want to be able to do is we need to
start by using the collections for the
UI so we can actually access the UI so
at the top we want to using unity engine
dot UI then what can save that we can
move down back into our initial class
and we can choose to make a few
variables to reference what we're going
to be able to use so I'm going to put in
square brackets serialize field because
I want to just make these private
variables that I'm going to make visible
in the inspector now I will add make a
private variable call this text and now
we can use this text because we're using
the UI and then call this UI text with a
semicolon and I'm just going to place
this next to the serialize field to keep
it nicely ordered we're going to have
another serialize field because it's
going to be another private variable
that we want to see but we don't need to
make it public it's going to be flow and
this is going to be our main timer that
we're going to use so this is the thing
that we're going to set in the inspector
and say you know this is only a seconds
we want to countdown then we're going to
kick create three four just private
burials by themselves because they don't
need to be actually an inspector and we
can just have that private float timer
so this is going to be the thing that
works you're going to count down so
we're not going to count down the men
timer because that's the thing that we
want to specify what the maximum amount
is if we restart it so more that another
private pool can account and we'll set
that equal to false and I'll show you
what these mean as we go along
I'll have another private bull called do
once set that equal to false I'll
actually change the one at the top to
true and like I said I'll explain as I
go along what we could do is save this
and we'll start by writing a void update
and then add two brackets and two curly
brackets Bellomo wolf is first by saying
that if the timer is below a certain
value then we want to count down and we
want to update the UI element that we've
got what we can say is that if that
timer not men timer just a term that was
currently got it's greater than or equal
to zero point zero f so if it's greater
than zero
because we're using floats we need to
take into account decimal places and and
can count by itself which means if also
can count is equal to true which is when
we start because you can see camp can
can count is equal to true the beginning
so then we'll want to say that timer
minus equals time dot Delta time with
the semicolon so what this means is that
the timer will count down in Delta time
based on the seconds we have since the
last frame so I'll just count down in a
nicely order which is framerate
independent then what we'll do is we'll
say that UI text which we created the
variable up here then we'll say dot txt
to access the text component on the UI
and we'll set a timer which is the one
that we're going to count down dot to
string and then we'll open up the
brackets in quotes for right F and for
semicolon on the end and what that means
is that timer is a float value but the
text element is a string and a string is
a word and a floor is a number now we
can't just shove a number into a string
without first converting it so we're
converting the timer to a string and the
F just corresponds to creating that
string into a float value so it's just
the functionality behind it that then
what we're going to do is if we reach a
certain value going to do something else
or so the else if timer is less than or
equal to zero point zero f and and I'll
put as exclamation mark do once then
below here I'll add two curly brackets
what this means is if the timer ever
goes below zero and dowon's is equal to
false which the exclamation mark means
do the exact opposite then we'll say
that can count is equal to false do once
is equal to true then we'll also say
that UI text dot text is then equal to
zero point zero zero in quotes with a
semicolon and the timer then will equal
zero point zero F with a semicolon so
what this means is that when the timer
reaches zero
and do once give equal defaults which is
at the start so when it reaches error
and it's false at the stat we'll say
that can count is equal to false so
we're not counting down anymore because
it's not greater than zero and we can't
count anymore it's not going to do any
of that do once is equal to true so I'm
going to do this once once it reaches it
it's going to set the UI to zero and
it's also going to set the timer to zero
so we will just got everything on an
even keel so it just means that these
boolean's just control whether we can do
it or for this case just do it once so
we done in an update function it'll do
it every so many times every frame where
we don't need it to do that if we don't
want it to because it's just a waste and
then that's pretty much it for this
we'll save out what we can do in the
hierarchy is you can right click empty
create an empty we can right click over
on this side on the inspector and just
reset the transform values we'll rename
this to let's say timer controller then
what I'll do is I'll add the countdown
script to that you can see it here you
can see the UI text and you can see the
main timer half set the main timer to
five and then I'll add the UI text here
and one last thing we need to do up here
is that we'll create a void stamp
because we need to actually specify what
the things are going to be equal to so I
need to say that timer equals men timer
every time we start what this means is
that the timer has no value at the
beginning but men value men timer does
have a value because reset it and
inspect us all we're saying is that
timer because that's going to be the
thing that counts down is going to be
equal to what we set in the inspector
now because we've added men timer we've
added this because when we reset the
button one we press the reset button
we'll need to actually reset this rather
than this one so what we could do is if
we go back into unity you can do vc
morale back immunity
i'll press play and you can see it
counting down from 5 and you'll see it
hit zero and our button currently
doesn't do anything now to make this
functionality work what we're going to
do is we're going to create ourselves
our run and public method so just to
control the buttons or source a public
void
reset BTN to brackets in two curly
brackets below and then we'll say that
timer equals men timer with semicolon
like we did in the start function then
we'll say can count is equal to true and
also do once is then equal to false what
you could also write in this else if
statement is that when we hit zero you
can restart the scene you can show a
game of whatever you need to do in that
respect so when we go back to unity what
we can do is we can go to the button
here on this side we can actually I
click the little plus box on the on
click event and we can add the timer
controller to it then we can select no
function go down to the countdown script
and we can choose the public method
which was called reset button and then
once we do that it will every time we
click it will do that same functionality
so I'll press play it will be counting
down into five and then this button is
going to be our reset button or we press
play it resets and we can reset it at
any time if we so wish you can obviously
control different things you can
increase the timer just in general and
you can see that it goes all the way
from that and we can do the same thing
just reset it every time now like I said
you can create your run and we could
just call this we could call this
something like game over with two
brackets and a semicolon and what we're
going to do is we're going to call our
own function called avoid game over and
it could be something like this and then
every time it hit the zero we're going
to call this game of a function and
what's this going to do it is going to
maybe through large a new C whatever we
needed to do at that point so all we're
doing with this countdown is were
updating the UI updating a timer
creating a couple of boolean so we don't
have to do these checks at every single
time because we don't need to if we you
know don't need to be doing at any one
time then we create a simple button to
just reset the boolean so we can start
doing it again because the alert
function will always be checking and
this statement and this statement if
this one isn't true it won't have to run
through any of these extra lines if
these are not the values that it expects
to
so hopefully this helped you out just
creating a simple sort of countdown
timer and helping you understand some of
the basics of the things that you can do
that and using the basics of unity UI so
