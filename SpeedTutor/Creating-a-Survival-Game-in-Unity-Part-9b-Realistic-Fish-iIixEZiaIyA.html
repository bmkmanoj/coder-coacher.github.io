thank you to everybody that ended up
voting for left alone on Steam
greenlight
because we eventually got the game
greenlit so again thanks to everybody
that voted really we really appreciate
the votes that you've given and the
support that you've shown with all the
comments and everything so again
hopefully we can make this game good and
everybody it was looking forward to
playing it can have a really good time
so moving on from there
is we're gonna look into the next part
of the survival service so this is going
to be a continuation or a follow-on from
what I did last time which was showing
you a very very very basic sort of
really basic fishing mechanic so if you
remember last time that we had this
square that would move to these pink
boxes now I've only made them pink so
you could see them because I I deleted
the mesh renderer last time so if I play
the game you'll notice that that box
moves towards the random points but
doesn't really look like a fish and I
did say in the comments in the last
tutorial that I'd show you how to make
something a little bit more advanced
with a couple of code tweaks and bring
in your own model so what I've done is
I've modeled something a quick basic
fish I've rigged it and I've animated it
just to move the sort of the tail fin
around so it looks like it's moving or
swimming so all we're gonna do is that
when you go inside the pack which you
can download from our website on the
survival series link what we can do is
we can import a new asset what would to
do is import fish at swim and fish at
swim is just going to be the model of
the fish with the rigged animation so
what I usually like to do it's dependent
on what you want this to be but I'm
gonna scale this up so if you click on
the actual fish at swim scale it up to
not point not two and then just click
apply
and then on the rig settings it'll be on
generic if you switch that to legacy we
can use the old legacy animation system
so then what we could do from there is
we can just drag
that fish into our scene so what I'll do
is actually delete the old script and
the old box really is just a basic model
it's got not got any textures on it so
it can be up to you if you want to do
something similar or edit the thing or
however you like but what goes on here
is that we've got the fish model and
it's gonna have an animation and we can
see the animation if I show you the swim
animation down here I'll have to pull it
up fear for you to preview and then have
a press player you'll notice that within
the editor it does a simple sort of
animation so what we can do from there
is like how we added to the box we'll
grab the fish mod love from this side
and we'll just add fish movement to this
now what we can do is we can change the
size so however many objects they're
going to be able to move to you can add
that tool and far and then what we'll do
is we'll just quickly drag the
destinations that we've got into the
inspector slots for this model
specifically and now what you'll notice
is that if we play it there'll be some
issues with everything that's going on
it'll play the animation l move pretty
fast and it's sort of not doing
something very realistic at all so we're
gonna need to saw out the animation so
it loops all the time and actually looks
towards the destination that it's moving
as I said towards so what we'll do is
we'll open up fish movements in
monodevelop and now once that's open
we're gonna do a few basic things what
we're going to do is going to start off
by writing a function start two brackets
then two curly brackets below and now
we're going to reference our animation
and tell it to loop so what we're gonna
say was gonna set animation dot player
open brackets then in quotes the
animation name which is swim add a
semicolon to that then we're going to
set animation and then we're going to
have two square brackets and within the
square brackets we're going to name the
enemy
circuit he had a to cause then we cannot
swim in there again and we can say dark
rap mud equals capital rap mud dot loop
and then for the sake of this we thought
I might have thought you might think the
animation might be slow might be fast
it's a little bit slow on reviewed in
the editor so what we can say is
animation and in the same way if we add
the two square brackets and then call
the animation within that will say dot
speed is equal to 2 so it'll speed up
the animation by 2 you can decrease it
but not point 5 so that behalf as faster
than original animation or you can add
it something ridiculous 5 so it could be
something really fast it's dependent how
really you want this to work and how
close to the objects it might be so this
is going to control our animation so now
if we go back in here and then we press
play you'll notice that the fish is
always playing its animation now and
it's just looping forever what we could
also do is on the actual script itself
we could make the speed go down to about
a 2 and so then it's not so crazy and it
doesn't move as quick and it's gonna be
a Liz yeah looks a bit weird on top of
the solve floating around in the air but
maybe if you hadn't in the water it'll
look a bit better but as I said we want
it to look toward the target so it
doesn't look like it's very inside where
as I'm moving backwards and very
unrealistic so what we can do underneath
the line we've got which is transformed
up position I'm look talking about the
vector 3 move forward what we can
actually do is say transform dot look at
and then in brackets we can write new
target so what this means is that it's
gonna transform and look at so transform
just means it's gonna adjust the
movement always just the just the
transform value so when we speak of
transform values it means the transform
values in
usually you can set this position you
can say it's rotation so it's gonna
adjust does and it's gonna look out the
new target and the new target is a
target of which we found randomly when
we're using what we talked about last
time within the array so if I save this
out and we now press play you'll notice
that the fish now swims towards the
random target looking the correct away
because then it's actually slightly more
realistic then it just solves swimming
sideways ah swimming in a sort of weird
direction now again it's not 100%
perfect because it's still a little bit
of a shout maneuver like I said that you
might want to look into using a loop
sort of function or something like that
to make it seem like it's a much more
smooth when it changes its angles you
could obviously add more position boxes
so there's not so many for knots or sort
of jagged movements between each but
because it always searches for a random
target it's gonna look a little bit like
that now we need to make sure that it's
tagged as fish so the object on it and
you might want to also make sure that
you've got physics and a box Collider on
your fish and then what we can do is
within the game you can see it there and
we want to be able to pick up and then
we can grab that fish and it'll go into
our inventory like we showed in the last
video so again it's a really really
really simplistic way to actually make
fish song is a simple model with the
simple animation of it you know
basically swimming and though all we did
was add a couple of things to the script
making sure that the animation loops
changing the speed of it if you want to
changing the speed of the actual
movement itself and then add in that
simple lining to make sure that it looks
at the target that we're finding so then
it adds a touch more realism to the
whole thing so again I'll provide this
model and all you need to do is import
that into unity and I'll put that on my
website
I hope that helped everybody out so stay
tuned for some more survival tutorials
so again thanks very much for watching
