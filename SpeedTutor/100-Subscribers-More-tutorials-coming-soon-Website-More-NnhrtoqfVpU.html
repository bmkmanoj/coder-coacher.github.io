today and this is just to fill everybody
in on some of the stuff that's going to
be coming up near future really got
quite a lot of things to cover and I'm
going to cover other things which
include 3ds max which is going to be
some modeling and things that you can
use in unity like rigging characters and
things like that rendering using vray
mental rare some basic tips I've still
got a lot of stuff to show you in unit I
was thinking about doing some also some
series of different things so my Sarah's
would probably include stuff like the
workflow of making a sort of concrete
barrier in ZBrush what I'm also creating
a torch in unity which has GUI
indicators for your battery and pickups
as I said before covering a ISO basic AI
which followers attacks the player
things like that also might be covering
a melee system so having a weapon that
attacks with the rigging important in
emissions adding the weapons attacking I
was also thinking about covering sort of
companion AI cuz I hadn't really seen
this before so working with us maybe a
dog model rigging that dog animating it
and then having some AI script put with
it so it follows you about something
similar to fallout and a lot of other
tutorials that are not always related to
unity but I'd feel like I'd like to
cover and show people how to do these
things and really as every if you need
any tutorials so you can think of
anything the one doing and you think
people might want to see it then by all
means leave a comment or send me a
message and I'll go right ahead and do
it and I just like to say thanks to
everybody who subscribed because I've
just reached the 100 mark it's been in a
couple of months now and
it's been a slow process but hopefully
everybody enjoys the videos and carries
on watching them when I bring them out
currently somebody left a comment and
I'll be working on a very simple sort of
version of they wanted to do base
building so I thought of looking into
how minecrafted dares with blocks now
I've got something that works pretty
well currently which add blocks lets you
take blocks away and you have to pick up
blocks before you can add them to build
them you know buildings like you could
in Minecraft but I was thinking of doing
it more like it so you have to have the
actual weapon in hand or the block in
hand to actually use it so when I get
that done i'll post up but I've been a
little bit slow recently cuz fractured
my ankle so everything will be a little
bit slow but if you need any help or
need anything doing don't hesitate send
me a message and I'll try and help you
out also you might want to check out my
website which I keep on updating and
that's um ww-p to to calm I'll leave it
in the description and put it in the
description for every other video but
i'll be keeping the up to date with all
the latest videos that will be doing
anything or future videos that will be
doing and they'll also be a page about
all the tutorials that i've done so
giving you access to all the scripts and
maybe all the scenes that i've used but
as i say i'm still working on that and
i'll be getting that I've done in the
next few weeks when I have a time and
thanks very much for watching the videos
as ever don't forget to Like comment and
subscribe thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
