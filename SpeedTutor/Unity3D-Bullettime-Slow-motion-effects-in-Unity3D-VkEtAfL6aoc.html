tutorial today and this is gonna be
about showing you how to do slow motion
within unity so you you know you'll know
slow motion from a lot of different
things like films games you know maybe
The Matrix Max Payne and things like
that
and they all had elements of slow motion
where you could control it and you could
you know edit elements to again so this
is just gonna be a simple way to I did
and you know we've got nothing fancy
it's only gonna be a single script
that's not gonna take you very long to
do so I've just got my standard scene
with the first person controller so what
we'll do to start off is go create
JavaScript and we're just gonna make a
new script called it's a lot more and
then we'll open up that script in one
develop once that's open we'll add two
variables one variable called current
slo-mo and set that as type float and
say equal to zero the semicolon and I've
been the variable called slower time
allowed and set that also as type floor
and say you could whatever you want it
to last for the time at which you know
you slow you don't really slow motion
last forever unless you do I'll set it
to about two seconds then what we'll do
is do function update add the two
brackets add two curly brackets under
then we'll set if input dot get a
button-down open brackets in the speech
marks fire fire to close the two
brackets and the speech marks will open
up at one curly bracket this time and
set if open brackets time dot time scale
is equal to 1.0 close the brackets then
we'll set under here time dot a
timescale
is equal to not point three and then
we'll add two breaks and we'll put else
add another couple and then we'll say
time dot
timescale is equal to 1.0 add a
semicolon then we'll say time dot fixed
Delta time equals naught point naught 2
times by time dot time scale another
semicolon so what this means is that
what if we press so the right mouse
button the it will check to see if the
time scale it's equal to actually the
normal times or 1 then it will set the
time scale to not point 3 which is mean
it'll slow actual time down if we don't
press anything then time scale will be
set to 1 which is normal and fixed at
the time equals not quite not two times
a time scale just means that it's more
smooth if you don't have that it'll be
slightly choppy and then underneath here
what we'll do is we will add closing
curly bracket and what we'll do now is
be able to now that would just let you
have slo-mo forever as soon as your
right click no if you don't want that
we'll just add these for your lines will
say if time dot timescale is equal to
not point three so if that if if you are
actually installed in a minute then you
will want to say current slo-mo plus
equals time dot delta time with a
semicolon so that means that if we're in
slo-mo we're gonna start counting up to
whatever we says and the slow time and
then we'll say if current slo-mo is
greater than slow time allowed then
we'll close the brackets and two curly
brackets in that I will say current
slo-mo equals zero at the semicolon and
then save time dot timescale equals one
point over semicolon so this means that
if you're in slo-mo then we'll start
setting the current slo-mo you know with
seconds depending on how fast your games
running and then we'll say if current
slo-mo so if this variable is ever above
two seconds which we set here then we'll
just set the time scale to 1 and set
current some water to so it's off until
you press the button again make sure you
save out we'll go back into unity and
then what we'll do is we've gone our
first-person controller add the slo-mo
now we can change the slow-motion time
with whatever you want but I'll should
give you an example we're running at
normal speed here I'll maximize this
game so you can see what's going on I'll
maximize it here so you can see
everything and when I actually right
click not ii do everything normally as
soon as i right click we go into slow
motion and then we'll wear a period of
two seconds now two seconds will be
slightly longer in this because time is
actually slowed down so you're just
gonna want to set it to whatever you
feel is best for your again and if I
stop the base I take it off maximize for
player and just press play you can watch
it at this side so if you see I'm
running about if I go slow-motion you'll
see this counting up to the two second
mark and as soon as it actually reaches
that value normal play again so that's
just the basis showing how to make a
slo-mo sort of effect within unity and
as ever if you liked the tutorial don't
