and this is gonna cover and what
somebody suggested to me about almost
making a sort of crisis effect where you
can go invisible and having a sound
effect which you can play once you go
invisible now this is gonna sue more of
a unity Pro user but I may be able to
make another tutorial if you're a unity
free user and you because we're gonna
actually use a unity Pro sort of asset
which is the refractive glass shed which
can be used to make sort of realistic
glass effect now the way we could do it
if you're a unit free user is disable
the mesh renderer and when you know you
press a key but for this we're gonna
actually add a shared oh and be able to
change material shape is based on the
area so what we're gonna make sure dim
is that just for this tutorial I've got
first person control obviously and on
the main camera I've just attached a
cube to it so wherever I go
the cube follows yeah so just pretend
that's the player for instance now we're
gonna actually have a few things here
now in the description I will add the
two sound effects that I've got on the -
there - the package for the refractive
material now what guys got one material
which I created if you just right-click
and create new material you just want to
create one normal material and then you
want to choose this FX refractive
material which is the other normal map
and it will actually create I solve the
crisis style effects we've actually add
it to my object you'll notice that you
can see it in a way that it looks like
you might be slightly invisible now you
know you want to make sure that you
leave that on and I've got two sound
effects for a clock and a non clock
now we're gonna have to actually create
a script to control this so what I'm
gonna do is have a script called Clark
I'm going to open it up in monodevelop
and then we're gonna actually write
something new I haven't really covered
the rares much because I've just been
learning that mainly myself but for this
I it will show you how to swap two
materials and swap to tell sounds
depending on what you're writing so I'm
gonna write two variables and I'm gonna
write variable materials as type capital
material with square brackets then add a
semuc semicolon write another variable
called up and materials underscore
counter and have that set to as an
integer equal to zero the semicolon then
as we did before the variable sounds as
type audio click this time with two
square brackets and now I want ton of
the variable called sounds underscore
counter and have that as type integer
equal to zero
and then we'll start by writing update
function so a function called a we need
two brackets and two curly brackets
under them and we'll set if open
brackets input dot will make sure the
input as a capital input that would get
key down and then open the brackets and
then we add Barb's and F are whatever
button you want to actually do the clock
effect there are two kind of brackets
and said renderer
dot material in equals materials that we
set as the variable and then we'll add
the square bracket and we'll pop get
next material index add a square bracket
on two brackets sorry then I'll describe
bracket over there and put semicolon
then I want to write our deal don't clip
and equals sounds square bracket get
next sound index up to brackets then 1
square bracket on the end and then 4
semicolon and then we'll say audio dot
play with 2 brackets and then a
semicolon now we'll need to actually
create two functions and to work with
the arrests so now we're going to write
function called and it's going to be the
this one that we added here it's going
to be copy all that so we're going to
write function get next material index
and have that call on set to integer
then below that we need to set two curly
brackets and then we'll send materials
underscore counter plus plus with a
semicolon
so that means it just adds one and then
we'll say if materials under Skaar
counter is equal to materials dot length
with a capital close the bracket then
under there were like two curly brackets
and said that materials underscore
counter is equal to zero zero the
semicolon and then underneath Allah and
the curly bracket we've got we'll say
return materials underscarf counter
so in effect what it does that if we
press F will want to change the material
that we've got in the array so in the
array of we've got to find the index so
once we press F it will add one to the
counter and then if the counter is equal
to the you know the end of actually our
a rare then I'll just say it's a zero so
it always goes back if we get to the end
so we can you know keep on going forever
now we're gonna do a very similar thing
so what I'll copy that paste it here and
then we'll say get sound index get next
sound X and replace that with that
function and then what we're actually
gonna do is I'm gonna copy sounds
counter because I'm gonna paste it here
here here here and then I'm gonna change
materials to sounds dot length but make
sure in all your scripts I've just
noticed now that I had a little spelling
mistake in materials when I was just
typing it up so now if you click Save
and go back into unity what we're gonna
do is we're gonna go on whatever object
so it could be a player it could be your
mu no FPS arms it could be anything but
for this it's gonna be a cubed now at
the o'clock script to this now we'll
actually get two variable arrays that we
can a change so if we click sighs and we
just add two to both of these we can add
it you know as many materials or sounds
as we want so in my effects I have got
normal and I'll set normal to this first
one element zero in the material section
and then I'll add refractive to the
second one then what I'll do is set
unclogged to element zero of the sound
and then cloak to element
all of the opportunity of this once
we've added the the components to the
slots retouch the make sure that we add
an audio audio source to this so when we
press play now if we're going around
we've got normal until we press f you
know you sound effects saying that the
clock was engaged like you're doing
crisis and you in order to get the sound
effect father so realistically you know
you get a sort of crisis stay aware of
making your character seem invisible and
it's not and then you could change all
the elements to your AI depending on
when you know you set your own you said
you play it to that refractive material
so I hope this helps people out and that
was just a simple way of starting with
arrays and changing between you know two
particular objects so thanks very much
for watching and as ever if you liked
