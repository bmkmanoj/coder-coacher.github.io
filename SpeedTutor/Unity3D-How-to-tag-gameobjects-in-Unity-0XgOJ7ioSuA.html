tutorial today and this is maybe more
for the very beginners who are starting
unity but sometimes I get asked a very
common thing is how to tag objects
within unity now this is a really basic
thing that everybody should learn how to
do because it's not just good for
finding out when you're writing scripts
and you need to tag an object for a
certain reason so if you need to tag
your first person controller player
because you need to reference its
behavior if you go through a trigger or
if you need to reference it when you're
doing rare casts it's useful for a lot
of different things so all we need to do
is if we've got a particular object
within unity and within our scene all we
can do is if we select our first person
controller what we can do is you can see
in the top right hand corner we have the
name of their first post controller and
then we have a title called tag at the
top and by default in most recent
versions of unity will already have the
tag of player because it's the most
common thing that goes on within the
game ah but I've decided to untag
because this is what other objects when
you create them might be so this cube
I've created is untagged so we'll click
back on the first birth controller so we
want to call this tag player it's so we
can reference it in scripts most of the
time now if we click this drop down
we'll get a whole host of tags and I
might add more tags in you because I
have creates its down the line of doing
these tutorials so in this drop-down all
we need to do is click add tag and we'll
get a list of tanks and we'll get a
series of elements with tags by the side
and all you need to do is write a name
within one of these boxes so within the
spare box so for me it's element 16 and
you can add anything you want to these
boxes so we can tag this new player and
it will automatically create as a new
element when we need to add another
script so we can click back on our
player on our first-person controller
and then we can choose the tag new
player and you'll see what we tagged up
and for new versions as I said it will
already have a tag of player and
similarly with a box just the same we
can tag that new player if we need to
add a new tag we click the drop down add
tag right in and we can tag it whatever
we like so that's a really simple way to
tag your objects in unity so thanks
again for watching and don't forget to
