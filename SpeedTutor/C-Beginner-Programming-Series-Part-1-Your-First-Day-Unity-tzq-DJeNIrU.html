series and this will be a brand new
channel to go along with everything that
I'll be doing within c-sharp so the very
beginning of this tutorial series is
going to be talking about specifically
c-sharp and pretending today whether it
is or isn't your first day in c-sharp
because I've had this asked quite a lot
so I thought I'd be able to cover it now
this video is going to be a specific
brief on the major things that you will
find when you're programming day to day
in unity with c-sharp and it can lend
itself in other areas as well so let's
get started when you're opening up a
unity scene
I wanna show anybody how to do that so
I'm sure you do when we're in the
project with what we can do is we can
right click press career and we'll
choose c-sharp script and then from
there what we can do is you can name
that whatever you need the script to be
we'll just name this first script for
instance and then what we'll do is open
up and you will open up in monodevelop
our visual studio doesn't matter which
because they both do the same thing so
at the top we've got the two items which
are required to for all scripts in
c-sharp we've got the first the public
class which is the name of your script
which if you do change the name of your
script within unity you need to change
this here and it's a model behavior
script what I like to do is this is just
for my peace of mind I like to move all
curly brackets below any sort of
encapsulating things so what we do is it
starts us off with some basic voids and
they're very similar to functions that
you would find in JavaScript and what
you'd find when I've done other
tutorials in unity what I'll do is I'll
start by elderly those and we'll start
from scratch so we're going to start
with the most common things that you'll
probably find is that when you're
writing your scripts you're going to be
probably writing two different types of
variable type
and this you start by it you can either
class a variable as public or private
and the difference between the two is
that a public and a private public is a
public variable is accessible outside of
this script so say you wanted to access
a variable in this script and another it
needs to be public so it can be seen
elsewhere just imagine if you are going
into public and you want to be seen by
everybody that's what's going to happen
private is as it suggests and you can
hover over it and it will give you some
indication that it's protected within
this script so if you wanted to keep
everything private it'd be private to
this script alone so keep things
according to how you want to access them
and from there what I'll do is I will
get rid of the private for now because
if we also keep it public we'll be able
to see in the inspector on the right so
from here I'll go through the most
common variable types that you'll find
so you will most likely have an integer
which is just a whole number and in
c-sharp you'd write public int and we
could write it as health and we could
say health is equal to 5 and that's
simple it's public it can be seen
everywhere it's a whole number integer
we give it a variable name which is
health and we set equal to 5 now we
could have another variable which is
public and this could be called a float
and then we could have this called
health float and have that equal to 5.0
F with a semicolon so this means that
again is a public so you can see
elsewhere it's a float and a float is a
decimal place value we've giving it a
different variable notice it doesn't
clash here and 5.0 and F just stands for
it's a value of 5 with a float value
again like we've done is up
public and we work in class as a bull
and bull can be either true or it can be
false so then what we could do is we
could say if it's true or false we can
say for this instance it's true so boom
and you give it any variable now any of
these names can be anything you like and
a common one would probably be public
game object with two capitals for each
word and then maybe player with a
semicolon and what that allows you to do
is find so allow you to put a game
object which you're referencing as
player within the inspector it just
depends how you're going to do it I'll
show these in the inspector so I'll save
this out I'll go into unity now I will
select my FPS controller that I've
already brought in in I will select my
first person character which is closer
than my camera I'll add my script here
and you'll notice that we've got a
script which is our first script we've
got health equal to five we've got
health flood equal to five now the
difference with a float and a whole
number is we can save 5.5 there I cannot
actually put a decimal place in an
integer value so if you wanted to be
more accurate we're going to have to
true our false is just a tick box and
then player is a game object you can put
in so you could just drop your FPS
control in there if that is your player
and they're probably the most common
things you will find but in next
tutorials I'll go into these more
specifically and then your most commonly
going to start by writing new methods or
what we call it in JavaScript functions
so we have void start and you always put
two brackets after the beginning of that
and then you can put two curly brackets
below there and
start means that as soon as the script
is all the game is started and the
script is actually executed it will
execute that code before anything else
then you have one similar update which
is something that's executed every
single frame so you've got 30 frames in
your game it will be done 30 times every
frame essentially or every second and we
can also have a different one so if I
put them in sort of order of execution
we can have avoid awake and avoid awake
is extremely similar to start but the
difference being is a wake is executed
so we have this list first script on our
camera here and we on ticket so
technically it's not running any more on
star or void start means that void start
will never be executed but void awake is
executed as soon as the game is started
running and whether or whether or not
the actual script is enabled whereas
start is only actually executed if the
script is enabled as well so this way it
could be used for initialization and
doing things that you need to do before
anything as soon as you game starts we
can have our own custom methods so it
could be void death so it be anything
you like you can name anything that you
want it's really dependent on and the
things that you need to do and of course
I'll go through it in the future and
below here again will say we can have
one a common one void on trigger enter
and we'll have it as collider and other
and then we can add two curly brackets
in there so from there is the only
difference between that and JavaScript
is the classification of the method and
you have ontriggerenter but you have the
collider which
the class and then you give it the
actual name that you want it to be
referenced as the only other thing to
quickly mention is with these with
c-sharp you can actually make a you need
to make a function public if you want it
to be accessible outside of this script
so if we have public void and new death
for instance for it to be able to be
accessed
similarly with public and private if
it's void it will be prior private and
if it's the public void it'll be
accessible outside of this script so
really this is just a brief overview of
say your first day of learning the
basics of knowing all the things that
you're going to be doing probably on a
day to day basis when you're going to be
doing c-sharp programming within unity
so you've got to remember that you're
going to have variables which is going
to be used integer float boolean and
usually a game object there is many many
more but I'm just going to things that
I'd even use on a daily on a day to day
basis usually it's morphed and start and
update and then an on trigger enter but
again I will go through these in more
detail in the future so hopefully this
gave you an understanding of get into
sort of grips and dealing with the most
important things so thanks again for
