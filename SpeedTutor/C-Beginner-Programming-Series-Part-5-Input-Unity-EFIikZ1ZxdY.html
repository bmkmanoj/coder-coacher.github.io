tutorial today and this is going to be
looking at the continuation to the
c-sharp series and we're going to be
looking into input types are using the
input manager to do things within your
code for c-sharp now this is pretty
important whether you want to you know
be able to sprint pick up items do
anything with the keyboard or any input
that you will find when you're using a
game so whether you know you want to use
one two three four five any different
numerical key on your keyboard now I
will go through a few ways that you can
go about doing these things and maybe
better ways that you can do it and I'll
explain what the input manager is what
it does and what it helps us achieve now
the example that I've got here are will
help you make a script after to show you
how to do it but in our update and
method here what we've got is an if stem
which says input get key down key code
air with two brackets and then we're
going to run a line of code if that is
true now what this stub means is what
get key means is that it will get a key
from your keyboard as long as it's the
key code that you want so in this case
we want as long as we press down on the
key we want the key code air which is a
on the keyboard so if we hit a on the
keyboard we expect to see the debug line
have a party in unity or anything else
that we intend to do with then if you
press any of the key it won't do
anything and there's three different
types of input or that you can actually
do now in my example here I will go into
this a bit more thoroughly we can use
compared to this get key down we can use
get button down and get button allows us
to use the input manager and the input
manager lets us specify a key in there
so then when we come to run the game if
you built it out for unity
you can easily remap it for anybody who
might want to use it so say people don't
want to use the button you've given they
can remap it to whatever they want
whereas if we use the get key they would
be forced to use a no matter what they
try to remap their controls to so it's
better to use those actual items rather
than the actual get key option so if we
use get button you can see that there's
a get button down get button and get
button up and the they're all very
similar get button down means you will
have to press the key or press the
keystroke all the way down and it means
that it will only be activated once when
you've pressed it all the way down get
button up is similar but it's only when
the key is all the way up and you've
almost you've let go of it will activate
only once and get button means that you
can press it and if you hold it it will
activate for as long as the button is
held down so say get button would be
something for say you sprint and you
would hold the button down for sprinting
or maybe you were dragging a physics
object with a particular key you would
need to hold the key actual down so you
need to use get button whereas if you
were just doing a command that you want
to need to do with one click set opening
a door picking up an item that went into
an inventory then you would only use
need to use get button down because it
only needs to be done once on one click
now the debug log line just means it's
something different each time is to just
display it so we can save those out and
depending on what line now we'll go
through this with you so you can create
your new script and I've just called it
input key type and from there what we
can write is M if input dot get
button-down I will use get button down
in this Stinson instance and then we'll
set in brackets we're going to say quote
and we're going to just call this TB for
test button or something like that then
we'll add two curly brackets below and
then we'll have a debug dot log and then
in quotes we'll just say do something
here and then we'll do is we'll add a
semicolon to end that statement or save
that out and here we're not really
specifying a keyword just expresses but
they're specifying a string almost or a
name that we're going to give to
something in a minute so what we'll do
is we'll go into unity again and we'll
go edit project settings input and you
will notice that I already had one
created here called tibi but say you
don't and you will probably start off
with however many items you have here in
the input manager list now to add
another you just add one to the actual
count you've already got so I had 18 I'm
going to set that to 19 it will add
another button which is just a copy of
the last and you will set the name to
whatever you wanted to reference it in
the script so mine was tibi so I'll have
it to uppercase T and B we want the
positive button to be whatever button we
want this to be so we'll set it to R for
this we'll get rid of alt alternate
positive button you can also look on the
unity document page which will tell you
about conventional input types or
conventional game important they'll say
that you could use normal keys number
keys and the will sort of give you an
idea of what right right shift and left
shift and how they meant to be spell in
that case now what we could do is you
can see that my positive button is a
lowercase R that's fine I can leave the
rest of it as it is as long as the type
is a key or a mouse button now what I
can do is I can go on to the main camera
drag the input key type what I'll do is
I'll get rid of that stuff from the
inspector because that's not for this
particular so what we expect to see is
that when we hit our it's going to just
push push that lot debug line out
so if we press play and then I press R
you can see that it's just said do
something here so that's nice and easy
so when we pressed out we can change it
I know you can't see my keyboard but
it's good if you want to test this out
yourself you can go to input you could
change this to something like E and I
press go back on to run the game and I
press E so if I go to run the game and
press E it will say something here again
and we can do the same thing we can add
as many as we think we might need so we
can have if input dot get button down
and then in quotes we can use TT for
instance and what I'll do is I'll just
copy those two are those three lines
paste them in and I will say do
something well we'll say do something
else
for this and TT so very similarly we
will be able to say that edit project
settings input we can add another so we
can add 20 to the size and you'll see
it's just a copy we can add TT there we
can have the positive button ah this
time I'll make sure that it isn't
capitalized so that's fine so we should
expect to use E&amp;amp;R when we go to place a
1 with press e we expect to see and do
something and then when we press our
will do something here so if you're
looking at the bottom corner we'll press
e do something here and AH do something
else so that allows us to when the game
is built out especially for windows you
get a little dialogue box beforehand and
you'll be able to remap the keys
accordingly to whatever you need it to
be and you can do the exact same thing
with the get button down up or just get
button by itself it just depends how you
want to use it yourself so it always
remember it's in
get button get button down I'll get
button up and whatever you want to do
inside your curly brackets this debug
log line is just an example and you'll
use your input manager by going to edit
project settings and input and you can
adjust things accordingly there and if
you ever want to look anything up you
just go to the unity documentation to
potentially help you out so hopefully
this maybe helped you get an idea of
using inputs and getting it to work with
the input manager so you don't have
everything hard-coded into your script
so again thanks very much for watching
