and this is going to be the part two to
the tip series that was going to do so a
lot of people have actually asked me
about and know it's not the best way to
work around with trees and terrains and
things but before we had to make sure
that we had if you look down here we had
to make sure that chopper ball trees
were renamed for every item that we
duplicated now I did a tutorial on the
bushes quite recently and we didn't have
to do anything like that to collect the
objects so I went and revised the tree
chopping script and doing it the similar
way to how I will program the bushes we
can make sure that when we duplicate a
tree it we don't have to actually rename
the the trees itself so therefore it's
not as a tedious way for you to actually
make your trees and now it's still not
the best and you can do it from the
terrain editor I've not really looked
into that because I think that'll be
more complicated but this should save
people a lot of time so people don't
have to rename 300 trees between 1 and
300 and so on so hopefully you know this
helps everybody out and remember with
programming you can sit there for 10
hours and never work out something on
you can sit there all day and try and
work something out and it'll never
happen
you come back another day spend an hour
and you can work work out it's just one
of those things so hopefully this helps
everybody out so what I'm going to do is
we're going to open up the rare cast
chop script in monodevelop and when
you've opened it up you'll notice that
we had a rare cast looking for some game
objects and things like that now the
difference is if I go into the other
script that we had that we did with the
rare cast collect script for the Boche
that we had if I go all the way down to
the way we find the collider which is
Bush what we did was we set a variable
at the top and then we looked initially
when the rare cast happens before we
even clicked anything we wanted to hit
the collider and then we find the game
object that were lucky now
then when we press a button it will set
that game object and look for the script
on it and then do it accordingly which
is slightly different to how we did it
before because we were looking at the
game object name rather than the actual
game object itself so a simpler way to
do it what we're going to do is we're
going to quickly revise this script I'm
going to comment out this top section
there and then I'm going to write a new
variable and call it tree as type game
object with a semicolon we'll save that
then inside the if Collider game object
equals tree what we're going to do is
we're going to comment out the tree
script equals game object up find and
that Langley you can delete it after to
comment it out by always like to leave
it just so that you do what you've done
before then we're going to say 3 equals
open brackets hit dot Collider dart game
object close that up with a semicolon
and then within the if statement what
I'm going to do is we're going to
comment out that section where it says
tree script tree health but this time
we're going to say tree dot getcomponent
open brackets tree controller because
that's what we were looking for before
up here tree controller and here we're
looking for tree controller close that
up and then we'll say dot like here dot
3 health minus equals 1 and we can save
that out now if we go back into unity it
should have updated our script on the
main camera you can check us now you've
got tree on there so now what I'm going
to do is I'm going to go to my game
objects and I'm going to delete the
names of the trees so when I had 1 2 &amp;amp; 3
I'll just make sure that they're all
named tree chopping and then what I'm
going to do for testing sick I'm going
to have health tree health as worn for
each of the trees because we don't want
to have to cut down too much so I'll
just save those and I'll duplicate them
a couple more
times just so that you can see what's
going on so I'll put that one roughly
there and there so what we'll do is
we'll test the game and you'll notice
that if I when I've set all the trees to
a health of 1 1 we hit it once it will
fall so we hit that tree and it will
fall down where it expected and then
produce the items that we wanted I'll
hit this tree but you see I'm just
hitting random trees you know it's show
that it actually works properly
obviously that tree fell down again but
that log went straight into the water
and hit this tree that one is doing the
same thing and hit this one so you can
see we can duplicate as many trees as we
want and it'll always be the exactly the
same way that we did it before so so you
can see with these slight code tweaks
just having a variable of game objects
which we fill with the game object
itself when we hit the Collider looking
for it and then we'll get the component
from that object we've just found and
that will make the game not just easy
for you to rename the objects I'll
duplicate as many trees as you want but
we'll also make it more efficient
because we don't have to use game object
find so I hope this helped people out
and a whole pitner it gives you one step
further to make a slightly more refined
game so again thanks for watching and
