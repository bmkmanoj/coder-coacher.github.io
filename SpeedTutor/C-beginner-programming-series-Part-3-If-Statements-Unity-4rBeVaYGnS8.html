beginner tutorial and this is going to
be part three I'm going to be looking at
if statements and cut are what we call
conditional statements so if you do one
thing if you reach a particular sort of
condition we might do one thing we might
do another or we might do something else
and now this is very important with
doing a lot of things in games where you
need to check say every frame and you
need to do it constantly within your
game because you need to check if you
found a key
if you've reached a particular value if
you've reached a particular score and
then you might complete the game you may
lose the game it's you know very
dependent on what type of game e
creating on what you want to make so I
will go into the sort of basics of doing
it because once you have this you can
really you can do a hell of a lot of
things with it what we'll do is we'll
create a new C sharp script and we'll
call this conditional then we'll open up
in monodevelop and now we're in
monodevelop like I always show you like
to do is I'll just move this curly
bracket down and I will get rid of the
two all the sort of information within
the two beginning curly brackets so then
we can start from the fresh so now we're
going to start writing our script so
first of all marked and then not is you
can use an if stem anywhere it doesn't
have to be in a update method but that's
the most common place probably to
actually put it but I'll show you a few
examples as I go along
so we'll start by writing void update
there will have two brackets and then
below there will have two curly brackets
and if you see with M in the previous
video you always need a left and a right
facing curly bracket to encapsulate
everything and I like to just follow my
card like this to make it nice and
manageable so I'll go through the sort
of the very basic types of conditional
statements that we'll use within what I
use in programming so we'll have F
elsif and else and these are pretty much
they do a similar thing but they all do
it in a slightly different way if I give
a brief example is that if you start
with an if statement you're saying that
if you are and you give it a particular
condition so if we've reached a
particular scarf then we'll do something
if you put an else if after your first
if net statement it will say it will run
through the code in execution order line
by line and say if a scar is a hundred
do something if say we've got an else if
after it it has else if Skott is 50 then
we can do something else because unless
it meets a particular conditional
statement it will move on to the next
one and else is just a nice one to end
it so say if you've got several if
statements all the way down here saying
if it's 150 or whatever else else
statement can just say if it isn't any
of the things that you've already done
do this so it could just mean if you if
your score is not 100 then you can just
have an else statement and say that if
it isn't any of the stuff above do that
but I'll go into this more thoroughly as
we go along so we'll start by doing this
so we'll say that if and we'll start by
writing skull is and we can set equal
equal to 50 then we can close that
bracket up and add two curly brackets in
below there and like I say I like to
keep them below each other to make it
apparent and now we'll start by writing
our variable so we'll start by we'll
make it a public variable and we will
make it an integer and we will call this
scar just like we had there and add a
semicolon so what this saying is that if
score
is equal to 59 double equals just means
that if it's directly equal to that then
we can say debug dot log open brackets
in quartz then we can write Skaar is 50
and if you see my other video you'll see
that debug log just pops up in the
reporter at the bottom so that's all one
and good so Alex saying this will check
30 so if your it's really FPS dependent
so if you're running at 30 frames per
second it's going to be checked thirty
times every second so you'll say it'll
check if the score is equal to 50 then
it will do this then what we could do is
we could say that if Skaar is then equal
to say 40 we could do something else and
again I'll have the if statements and
then I'll have my statement I want to
check within two normal brackets and
then two curly brackets below and then
we can pretty much do the same thing and
so that debug log now your score is
equal to 40 and say we test this in our
again I go to my first person control I
add my conditional script to there you
can see that score is equal to zero you
can see that there's nothing appeared at
the bottom down here now my score when
it is equal to zero it does nothing now
if I set my Skaar 250 press ENTER you
can see that scar is 50 and you can see
that because it's in the update function
it's given me this report every single
30 times every second so it's telling me
yeah we've got 250 we can do that now if
I set that to 40 you will notice that
scar is now equal to 40 and we're just
checking each time that it does
something but it's better not to use a
debug line for something like that
you'll want to set a a a win parameter
let's say and so you can move to another
scene if you reach particular skull or
have a new objective now another way we
could do it is that we could say if
Skaar is equal to 50 we can do that then
we can change this if statement to an
else--if step and what that means is
that it's either if it's this or else if
and else if it's just slightly more
refined in terms of the programming
behind it and it will match itself to
the conditional statement above because
if we just had lots and lots of if
statements that's slightly slower than
having the elsif according to the first
one and let's for instance then we can
below here I will show you the else
statement else and we don't actually
need to write anything within brackets
for an else statement that's what we can
do is just put the two curly brackets
below again and we'll set else now we'll
say debug log and your scar is let's say
zero for instance so if it's not 50 and
it's not 40 it will do this so once we
start our game we expect to see that it
reports that scar is zero because we're
not much in any of the two conditionals
now if we have it fifty score is now 50
if we set it to 40 scar is now 40 and we
can stop that running and go back into
here and like I said you could do it in
any other type of function so like I
showed in a particular in the other
tutorial you can say void on trigger
enter collider older then two brackets
below and then we can say that if like I
mentioned in the other tutorial over dot
compare tag in brackets player close
that up see we're doing an actual
statement here and we're saying that if
the collider were running into finds
this player then we will do whatever is
in between the curly brackets so
saying the f it is unfine the player
will do this and it's just a way to
refine your amount of coding and to make
it so that you can only do a certain
amount of things when you want to so you
could do it in your own functions you
can do it in the on trigger you could
even have another if statement here and
then you could start writing and
managing variables and checking that if
you've hit this player and you're a
particular variable value then you can
achieve something so I'll give you an
example is that if score is 50 let's say
and then in here we can write an and and
which means do this and something else
we can say and and let's say you've work
so we call this checkpoint so you've hit
the checkpoint we're going to need to
create another variable source a public
bull as type checkpoint so what this is
saying that if the score is equal to 50
and checkpoint equals true because
checkpoint if I give it the proper name
here it will just be equal to true now
if I do something different and set and
and if I put an exclamation mark it will
do the opposite to a true value it will
say if it's false and we're equal to 40
then we'll do something else so now I'll
go back and in my script it will update
and checkpoint will appear now if I
press play I look at the bottom you can
see it's zero because we've not reached
any of the conditionals if I type in 40
you can see that from my script is that
if checkpoint is false and we reach 40
will display the score is 40 because
it's currently on ticked which means
it's false now if I put 50 in the box
you'll notice that because the Scot
isn't equal to 50 and checkpoint is true
it isn't equal to 40 and the checkpoint
isn't false it's
something else so it's displaying that
scar is there and now if I press true it
will say that the score is now equal to
50 so like I've been saying you can
manage any amount of things with doing
these if stems so the just really
checking whatever you need to check so
if is always the thing that you want to
start with if you are having an if and L
and want to check other things specific
to the first if statement use else if
else if you want to check if it's not
equal to anything of the above then do
that and you can use it in trigger
events you can also use an if statement
within a statement itself so say I get
rid of the skull equal to 50 and I say
with it this if statement if scar is
equal to 50 and let's remove this
checkpoint then I can say within the
statement itself then if checkpoint is
true and that's this is pretty much
doing the same thing as we did up here
but we're saying that if this is true
then check this so what is doing
something something sort of slightly
shorter so if it doesn't reach this it
will never execute these lines of code
so what again is saying that we're just
doing it a slightly different way if
score is 50 then it will say that if
checkpoint is now true then it will do
this but if that one is never reached it
will move on and move on and it will do
exactly the same thing and like I said
you could even do it in here then you'll
say that else if you could say something
else checkpoint
so if checkpoint equals true and and
then you could do something else like
you've hit checkpoint 2 and then you
could have something else here and
you'll need to create yourself a new
variable so like I said you can have the
statement and then and else F and you
could even use another else statement as
well but it really is it might seem a
little bit complicated but it takes a
lot of practice on your part to just
look at everything that you're creating
look at how you want it to be set out
how you want it to work and the think to
yourself how was the best way that I can
use this
so hopefully this cleared up some things
and helped you move on with the Sonex
part of games program in c-sharp so
thanks very much for watching don't
