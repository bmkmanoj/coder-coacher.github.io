tutorial today and I'm going to show you
how to change the GI cache location of
say the light maps when you bake them
out not the real time illumination that
unity 5 uses so sometimes if it's
installed on your C Drive it's going to
take up some space if it's a it's an SSD
and you want to just put it on a
different hard drive which it won't take
up as much space so we can go edit
preferences and from preferences we can
go to GI cache cache err well however
once pronounce it we can choose the
maximum size of what we want it to be
some mines currently five gig and we can
choose a custom cache location and if we
tick this box if it's not already done
for you then you can choose where you
want to save that location and you can
clean it if you need to get rid of how
much it's holding at that current
location so it's just a way that in case
you've got a solid state hard drive it
might be taking up a bit of space five
gigabytes a lot of space you can put it
on a spare hard drive and just clean up
some space depending where you need it
so that's got a bit to do with the
lighting options if you've got them from
the lighting tab and that's what it's
going to build out it's going to save
all the data in that folder that's
pretty much it so thanks again for
watching Dolph it's a like comment
