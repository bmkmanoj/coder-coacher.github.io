slash sort of tips video and after I've
done my stream people wondering why are
abouts I actually get sort of sound
effects and audio from and how you can
go about doing this now I'm going to
show you a few examples some paid
examples and some free examples so you
can pretty much get every sound that you
desire whether it be putting a little
bit of money down or getting them all
for free so my first example would be
looking at the universal sound FX pack
now this is an absolute massive pack on
the unity asset start of around $40 but
for that $40 you getting over 5,000
sounds and some people said they can't
always afford it but if you're really
into you know making the games and then
you're going to be doing all the sounds
this pack literally has that all the
future updates included so if they do
update the package you will also get
more and the last time it was updated
was on the 3rd of November 2017 so
they're always adding new tracks which
are royalty-free so you can use them for
you know games whatever it needs to be
and there is absolutely so many whether
it's coin collections her sounds
explosions you can look all the examples
on here but for such a small price that
you would pay you would pay thousands
and thousands for if you wanted all
these specifically custom-made but it's
a fantastic package to get you very much
started my second option would be
looking at Sonic's comm and I'd followed
these on Facebook a long time ago a few
years ago and they offered a soft part 1
part 2 part 3 of their GDC pack and
they've offered you know tens 20
gigabytes worth of sound effects from
all different places so if you search
for sauna s-- free audio free sounds on
google or something like that but you'll
get the links i'll put them in the
description for you check them out so
the links aren't working anymore but you
want to check out their do DC part 2
part 3 especially and I think the
torrent links and stuff still work so
they're just a comprehensive like the
other one just a mixture of loads of
sounds so you want to build up your own
sort of sound library so when you need a
sound
are a few effects you can search in your
own folder and get those together and
another really awesome place is free
sound dog and this is the one way you
can search any type of audio or anything
like that in the top and you can search
for something like gun and you'll get
one hundred if not thousands of gun
sounds and you can filter by the type of
attribution that you require whether you
allow to use it for commercially on long
commercially or you can use it with
Creative Commons so if it's got the
little zero in this corner with a sort
of cross through it means that you're
free to use it in whatever project that
you desire but you've got to be careful
some of them are oil T related so be
wary of that but needless to say this
website has doesn't really matter what
you need somebody's probably recorded it
sometime or the other there is other
some websites on Google but these are on
best three examples of the one of the
packs that you can get for the 40
dollars you can get the solace packs
which are free to download as long as
this links is still available and all
these sounds available on free some dog
obviously you have to do is register for
an account and away you go
so hopefully this quick video helped you
out and hopefully that you don't
struggle trying to find sounds any
longer so thanks very much for watching
