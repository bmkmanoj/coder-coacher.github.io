video and it's to tell everybody that I
will be redoing the Survival Series or
the survival series of tutorials within
unity 5x I know an awful lot of people
have had problems with you know
converting it from unity 4 to unity 5 so
I will be redoing it from start to when
I get to a finish point from unity 5 it
just caught up on me because unity 5
sort of appeared before I had finished
off the tutorial series for unity 4 now
seen as everybody's moved over I will be
continuing there the reason why it's
taken a while to get round to doing this
and uploading videos and stuff like that
is because as a lot of you know I'm
already developing my own video again
and it's left alone so so once that is
fully complete a lot more time to really
go into doing my tutorials and looking
at the Survival Series so thanks for
staying with me and I will be bringing
up the whole series tweaking all the
things all the problems that we might
have previously had I'll work on those
and we'll make something great in unity
5 so thanks again for watching don't
forget to Like comment and subscribe
Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
