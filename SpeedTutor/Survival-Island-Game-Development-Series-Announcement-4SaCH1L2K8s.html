tutorial today this is just going to be
a announcement for something that will
be covering I will be covering as long
as everybody feels that it's something
that they'd gladly like to see so what
I'm going to announce today is I'm going
to be making a series of tutorials
there's going to be helping everybody to
go on career survival island or a
survival sort of game now I haven't
really got much to show so far but I've
got a few clips just while I'm talking
over this just showing what I've done
because I've only spent about a few
hours just planning some bits and
getting some things together so what I
think I'm going to cover in terms of
making a survival game a lot of people
might have seen the forest that's being
an alpha quite recently now I'm going to
take a lot of elements from a few
different games so we're going to first
off by maybe creating the terrain
getting objects in there like trees
rocks water and then we'll cover things
like cutting down trees collecting
objects adding different objects and
fishing it could be catching animals it
could be collecting different items it
might cover sir buildings may be making
a fire so you can cook certain items I
don't necessarily think I'm going to be
covering a specific infantry system or
crafting system but it's going to be
something basic so I've we can get the
hang of it because if it was to do a
proper crafting and infantry system like
you might see in a lot of games where
you take little bits and you can create
depending on what you like that gets a
bit complicated and it will take me too
long to manage to do it so this series
is going to be Belle so maybe creating
the car elements of the game the forest
along with many other sort of initial
bits and I also show you how to create
health and stamina but at this time I've
shown you in other tutorials but with
bars so that can be depleted and we're
going to make a lot more finished game
out of it when we've finished so give me
any ideas in the comments about what
sort
things you'd like to see in a survival
sort of game and i'll see if i can bring
those to life really and teach everybody
how to do it just remember i probably
would be going into too much detail on
infantry and crafting it's going to be
as i say more simple you can still give
some ideas but don't get your hopes
he'll die for something really complexed
something useful because there is a lot
of other things out there the bill
there'll be much better than systems
that I could possibly put together in
the time that I've got so I hope
everybody's looking forward something
like this please comment and tell me
what you think and if you would be
interested in watching those types
tutorials so thanks guys thanks very
much for watching the videos Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
