recording a few videos but I'll be back
on track now and get through everybody's
suggestions that have been suggesting
over the weeks and all the things that
people have suggested before now what
I'm going to create something that
people have been asking for quite a few
times is actually seeing your
character's body and sort of feet and
movement you know when you've got a
character you know like a lot of
first-person games you'll see feet
moving and you'll see hands and stuff
like that now this is only going to be
very basic so I'm not going to show you
how to break a character or do that sort
of thing but I'm just going to show you
basically with unit is default assets so
what I've brought in I've got em the
third-person controller and that's from
unities assets so if you don't already
have that you can right-click in your
project put import package and character
controller and once that's in you can
add the drag this third person
controller prefab in teasing and you
know you'll get this and I've just
scaled it up slightly now all you want
to do is you will have a third-person
camera script actually on that prefab
once you drag it in but what I've done
is deleted that script because we don't
want the camera to follow it like the
script asked we want to position the
camera ourselves so if you don't already
you know import a new camera so I've got
a first-person camera and what I've done
having positioned it directly in front
of the characters face you know as you
you know you may expect then what we'll
do is we'll actually add and parent that
camera to the actual object itself and
on the camera what we'll do is you make
sure you clip in planes all the way down
to the lowest it can go so not quite not
one because I'll show you here is if I
play the game you know you can see the
hands a little bit now if I you know
increase the clipping plane you won't
see anything so if I take it all the way
back down you know you see the things
that we want to see
and if you move that you can see you
know part of the legs now what we can
actually do is actually increase the
minimum and maximum y-values where you
can look up and down so if we decrease
the minimum so we just put it to about
what if we set 80 - 80 roughly now you
can look further down at your character
so then when you're you know moving
about you can see yourself you know all
around this isn't perfect way to do it
but it's you know just a very simple way
for you to get this you can see that
when I jumped the character's position
slightly change so you might want to
parent the camera to the actual head of
this character so it will follow the
position over the head you know anywhere
you go but you see that's just shows you
basically as long as your character
doesn't particularly move forward when
it jumps you can keep this camera in
this position and you know just change
settings accordingly so all it really
required was the B character that you're
going to use which will have you know
obviously a character controller so you
can move with it have a camera in your
scene which is just it's slightly in
front of the face you parent that to the
actual character that you using and you
can change the minimum maximum values on
the Y and on the X if you're doing that
you know so you can look up and down
further and make sure you clip in blends
or all the way down so you can see quite
close to your character so that's pretty
simple and not just the basics so hope
you liked it and thanks very much for
watching as ever
