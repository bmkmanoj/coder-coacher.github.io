this is gonna be about a more advanced
pause menu I know I said this for the
longest time that I would get something
out but it's just taken a long time to
get around to doing it so this isn't my
script this is a sort of script that you
can find on the unified community
it's the wiki dot unity3d com and this
is one of their more advanced pause menu
scripts and you can get it in both
JavaScript and c-sharp and I'll you know
briefly go through the setups and the
things that you can learn from it
because with working with menus and
stuff it's not as advanced for the new
user interface system but it's quite
good to get in to grips with how to
increase and decrease your quality
settings and look at showing fps if you
need to and look at change in a volume
slider more so in the older version of
unity but also adds different buttons
locking the mouse cursor see so you can
actually learn a lot from the script
even if you've just had it have a little
look through the card and you know you
can chop and change bits as you like so
all you do is when you've got the pause
menu script whether you've got it in
JavaScript or C sharp it'll you know you
can import into your scene all you need
to do is if you drag and drop it onto
your main come you'll see the script set
up like this now what you can do in with
this style of GUI is create your own GUI
skin so if you go to the top and say
assets create and GUI skin then you can
set the custom sort of GUI elements for
your buttons and such what I'll look
like just really quickly to show
everybody what's going on if I look at
this back wall you can press escape and
you'll get a little menu at the top
it'll have credits so you can write some
things in your credits and it's just got
the copyright for the person who wrote
the script it's got an options menu so
you can change audio
graphics you can increase our decrease
the graphics there you can look at
adding some controls you can get
statistics like FPS so that you can see
it in the corner within your game and
it'll actually give you some details on
your system if you need it so and then
you can press escape to go back oh this
should be a little button at the bottom
and then you can press Continue to go
back into your game so it's fairly
straightforward in terms of the GUI
styling so if I look at this side you
can obviously add your own skin you can
allow the game to be paused if you need
to you can start it paused if you want
you can lock your cursor if you want
that to happen you can set the width and
the menu height you know bearing in mind
on what you like the material is for a
FPS graph if you want to see the graph
actually on your screen you can change
all the things in the text boxes to have
things for the credits so that you can
see whatever you know you want to be
your font or your text you can change
the low and high FPS value in it just
shows that when the FPS values go to and
from a certain point will change color
just to see what you want and then you
can change what's in the help options so
you can add as many as you want so I
could add three and if I press ENTER
then I could say that we need to press
one to change weapons and we can do
whatever there and along with the
credits you can change the size and you
can add different lines and credit icons
you can add some little pictures now as
I say if I pause it again go to the
options and then go to controls you can
see that I added want to change weapons
you can hide and show the cursor as you
wish now if we quickly have a look at
the script in malm develop you can see
that there's just it's quite a lengthy
script but it just has everything that
you need to look at so if we scroll on
down you can see at the start
lock the cursor if it needs to LLL
suggest in the time scale so we can
pause and continue the game some of them
are interesting things that we can look
at is its column but various different
functions and different case statements
and here you can see that this cover
function with GUI layout and it's
labeling things from your system it's
also if we have a look at quality
settings so you can see that you can
call a quality setting by quality
settings not a particular item you can
do quality setting decrease level and
that's what decreases and increases
equality you can see that there's an
audio slider that's been created you can
see the status control and you can show
fps quite easily with a simple little
command and it's just something to look
through to get the hang of getting your
own pause menu but obviously you can use
this as your standalone sort of item to
meet your own more advanced pause system
in case you need some ideas so as I said
this wasn't my script this was got
gotten off the wiki but it's really good
for looking at how things work and if
you need something more advanced in that
way so thanks very much for watching and
don't forget to Like comment and
