to travel today and this is gonna be a
very simple sort of material slash
shared every two time it's gonna show
you how to go about making your own set
of gold material so you can make itself
simulate that you've got gold bars or
something like that now this is
extremely simple that these are my god
bats and all it does to you know to
recreate this sort of scene all this
look yourself is that you need a
reflection probe I've just got
everything in sort of like a little lamb
just encapsulated area it doesn't really
matter where you've got it you can have
it outside we've got one material one
point light for the inside of the actual
model itself when it helps when it's got
some smooth edges and I can provide this
model on my website okay so I'm gonna
give the example of here's the gold bars
with you know without the reflection
probe and I'll show you how to quickly
make the material all I've got here is
just some boxes with a material on
texture and I haven't got a point like
yeah alright reflection probe ever got
main camera there is a directional light
outside but it isn't really adding much
to these sort of environmental lighting
if we go to my lighting tab there's
nothing really anything going on here
apart from the real-time GI which is
ticked but you can either have that or
not on your material my gold material I
have created there will create a new one
you can right-click create and choose
just a new material well do this is I'll
call this gold bath mats for the sake of
this and the more one to do isn't want
to go to the albedo color and so mu
knock it down to solve sort of a yellowy
orange and it's really up to you to sort
of try and get an idea so you know if we
maybe stick with something like this so
you can see that smile right Ariel's
changed suffer and you can see that
intelligence moving the sliders sort of
where they are by default you cannot
just move this
Slyder old whale to make it look like
it's almost become very shiny then what
you can do is knock the metallic slide
all the way up and then we're matching
the original gold Basset that we had in
my scene here I've got a point light and
other than you can enable shadows if you
like and it's got nothing other than a
slightly increased range just so you can
see everything in this scene now the
important thing with this is now yeah
we're starting to sort of get some
reflections but it's not very accurate
and it doesn't really take into account
water around it so the one of them
unimportant things is you can go a game
object light and reflection probe so
I've just added a new one to my scene
and you can notice everything's black
and I've got my reflection probably
probe here and if I pull it up and just
put the actual sphere into the middle of
the room and then what we can do is we
can change the box size of our and
reflection probably so we can set the
box size to maybe two and two for now
and we can see it here now and what I
could might be able to I could do is
pull these down and you can see that it
starts grabbing all the objects that are
within the range of this now we can
click on the top left here and we can
adjust by the actual bounding box that
it has and we can just pull out and we
can just pull these out manually so we
pretty much just encapsulate the full
room and once we've just extended the
bounding all the way across what we can
do is on a reflection probe it might
currently be set by default at baked now
you can leave that if you're gonna do
baked lighting but for the sake of this
one set it to real time so then it will
update our actual preview of what the
room actually currently looks like and
we get start to get a slightly more
accurate look of what gold should be
based on the soft look of this room and
the lighting that is in here you can set
your reflection prompt of real time and
you can set on away
if you wish and one of the important
things if you've got in a room like this
which is almost like a box which would
be for most interior sort of
environments you can set it to box
projection and it puts a more accurate
projection inside based on what we've
got in here and you can notice that then
the reflections get updated and the
looker saw a slightly bit more towards
how it should do based on the other
things that are in our scene and when
you've got your material out you might
want to just play your scene to make the
reflection probe update its reflections
so pretty much to get a basic gold
material is you want to slide your
metallic all the way to the top
smoothness pretty much all the way to
the top so you get a very smooth surface
you'll set your albedo color to
something that you like you can create
your own reflection probe put it make it
baked or real-time and set it to box
projection if you want it in a scene but
other than that you can get a fairly
nice looking gold material quite simple
in a few easy steps so thanks very much
