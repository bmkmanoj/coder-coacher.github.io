you today and this is gonna be about
creating a natural survival system so if
you've ever seen there's that and you
know while setting stuff like that they
all have a sort of survival system way
after you know you keep yourself alive
by either you know eating or drinking or
something like that now this is going to
be quietly similar to another tutorial
that I actually made and that was about
actually creating you know like an RPG
soft system where you used manna and you
could sprint and you had health but this
is gonna revolve around health and
thirst and hunger so it's gonna be very
similar in sort of like the scripting
and the basics but in a way it's just
showing you how you can create a similar
thing but using different elements to
make different gu eyes for you game
which you know in turn can you know make
a lot more realistic so what I've got in
my scene it's my first person controller
I've got my just my test scene here now
at two boxes blowing green there just to
represent food and water and they've
just got a material on them so nothing
nothing fancy on so as we always start
off we need to do watch to write a
script so if we create a new JavaScript
and then we actually call this GUI
survival and then what we'll do is open
that up in mana development once that
solved now you delete the two functions
then we're gonna write about seven
variables but if you looked at my other
tutorial you'll probably know what's
coming up so what we're gonna do is
gonna try and hold health first and
hunger so what we'll do is write
variable current health and as Flo say
equal to one hundred and another
variable called max health and set that
to integer and make it equal to 100
but I'll just podcast is a flopper point
zero on it to make things easier then
I'll copy those two and just pass them
in so we've got another two of the same
then we'll change the second one to
current first and the other one below
change it to max thirst and then the one
below that current hunger and MUX longer
and you leave all the values the same
and then we'll just create a private
variable called bar length and have that
equals zero point zero then what we need
to do is we need to write so start
function so function start not the
brackets in at the two semicolons and
set bar length is equal to screen make
sure it's a capital tall dot weight
divided by eight now you know you can
change this up depending on what the
size of your screen is to where you want
to position you GUI
but for the sake of this is that's where
it's going to be and then what we'll do
before we start writing the update
function just write the GUI so it can
appear source right function on GUI then
two brackets two curly brackets
well icons as a comment and I'll say GUI
dot box open brackets new rekt make sure
that is a capital then Open bracket say
5 comma 13 comma 50 comma 23 and close
the brackets ba comma and then we'll say
in quarts health applause that put a
semicolon then what we do copy this line
is that in twice and then we'll say 30
what's a 55 and what actually say 80 and
then we keep the rest the same except
we'll change health too
first and this button health to hunger
and I will put here health holy go first
bars and then under here what we're
going to do was gonna do a similar thing
with GUI dot box open brackets new
wrecked the most a 55
comma 13 comma bar length comma 23 then
we'll close that off put a comma then
we'll say current health adopt two
string so with both capitals there open
bracket Spock what 0 and the coil and
put the bracket then say plus quote
slash quote plus max health close that
bracket by semicolon and then what we
gonna do is gonna copy this line paste
it in twice and then we'll say just I
was like before will change this one to
55 this one to 80 and then we'll say
current first to string and then current
hunger to string and then we'll change
max health fair to max first and then
the bottom one - max hunger so all these
G wise mean they're little
I come to say hunger thirst and health
and then these are drawing the actual
bars that we're gonna create and what we
have to do current health doc to string
means that it converts current health
from a flux or pop you know a decimal
value to a whole number so we can
actually see as a whole number now if we
got back into unity and add this to the
first person controller you'll notice
that now we've got health thirst and
hunger out of 100 and so we need to do
the sort of nitty-gritty of the script
now so what we're gonna do is under here
or say function of debt
they'll put the two brackets than the
two curly brackets and said I'll just
write in here with my common and say
first control section just so we know
what we're doing and then I'll write
normal first degradation so as it goes
down so what we do if and then we'll say
in brackets current first is greater
than or equal to zero then we'll close
the bracket I'm gonna add two curly
brackets and then say current oops
current first is minus equal time dot
Delta time divided by 2 semi-colon and
now from here what we'll do under here
which will say if current first is less
than or equal to zero then like two
curly brackets under that and say
current first is equal to zero then one
martin to here then if current athirst
is greater than or equal to max first
close the brackets add two cutter
brackets under there then current first
is equal to max first and then add the
semicolon then that's all okay for now
we'll copy this line here and we'll just
paste a normal say longer control
section what we'll do is we'll copy all
of these exactly from the how they are
above paste them in and what we'll do in
the hunger will just change each of
these so what I'll do is I'll copy
hunger there
best at their best at their first ik
their first at their past it yeah yeah
yeah anteus wherever the way you hunt
thirst under the home control section
you changed it to Hunger Now so it does
everything that first does so it
actually counts down at a certain time a
man what should do / far for hunger
sorry I doesn't actually go down as much
as thirst now under here
what copy this same line again just so
we keep everything you know under wraps
will say damage control section so this
is where you will actually get damaged
and it will do damage to your health so
under here will say that if current
hunger is less than or equal to zero and
and open brackets current thirst is less
than or equal to zero then what caused
the clause to brackets here should I
serve it make sure it's to a number like
two curly brackets and set in curly
brackets or say current health minus
equals time dot Delta time / - Allison
akahl then under here we'll say else
like - curly curly brackets instead if
current hunger is less than or equal to
zero then what we're gonna do next is
zenki and opposite you and next to you
chef there's like a line that you can do
if you hold shift and tap in you'll make
two lines and this means either off so
once you've had that in we can anchor in
first and then we can say that is less
than or equal to zero
we'll add the closed brackets or like
two curly brackets in there and said
that current health minus equals
time dot delta time divided by four so
what this essentially means this section
it means that if hunger and thirst above
the zero will count down you know fairly
quickly but if either one of the two is
it zero it'll count down more slowly so
anyone the boss that zero it'll count
down more quickly now for both the
hundred and first you'll notice that you
know you can't go both of the max
amongst all sets it to the next one you
can't go below zero it always sets it to
zero and D thirst and your hunger
countdown by separate amounts because
you most likely die of dehydration
before you do off a hunger so that's all
done now and it's on the FPS control and
when we play the game now you'll notice
that thirst and hunger both go down and
that if we set current thirst have more
safe through three and then current
hunger to three you'll notice that when
I press player
but both countdown thirsteth countdown
slightly quicker and when it gets to
zero your health will start counting
down by the rate at which hunger
countdown and when the birth is zero
it'll count down slightly quicker and it
can all be changed dependent on what
values you are to so in here if you
actually change this to just
time.deltatime it would do it every
normal second if you did it times by ten
it do it every second times by ten so it
almost make it go down one every ten
units every one second so it just
depends on what speed you want so divide
it R times it depending how quick you
like it's a bit so what we're gonna do
now is gonna actually be able to adjust
these values we get so that when you
pick up an object yeah thirst and hunger
can go back up so food and water so
we'll create a new javascript file
this water now we'll just make water for
now cos food will be very very similar
now what I'm gonna do is actually add a
private variable and call this survival
script and then I'll set as type of the
GUI survival with a semicolon then I
will put this under the start function
and say that survival script is equal to
game object dot find open brackets open
course first-person controller and then
say don't get component open brackets
GUI survival and then it cause that
brackets and a semicolon then I will
delete the update function and say the
function on the trigger editor open the
brackets and put Cola Cola on Collider
then close the brackets add two curly
brackets then we'll say if coal dart tag
is equal to course player clause that up
and on to other brackets underneath will
said destroy open brackets game object
lower case then I do semicolon then
we'll say survival script dark current
first pull-offs equals now that's just
for water so what we'll do we'll go back
into unity and then say for water would
you look at that and rename that to food
and then if I open food up in
monodevelop what I'll do is change only
one thing to current hunger
so I'll click Save and then what we'll
do we'll add to the water Collider will
like the water script and to the food
one will add food you need to make sure
the bath got is trigger as a set to the
collider sort for best player you'll
notice that the boss going down and
before we lose
you know any health will go back up to
ten and then they'll go by 10 so both
the values go up to keep myself alive
and that shows we know you quick and
simply easy where that you know when
stuff when you create something with GUI
is it can actually spread across many
different elements and you can actually
make it to suit your game now I'll just
show you quickly that in the GUI
survival the what we want to do is that
we'll do this at the top just for
instance will say that if current health
ever is less than or equal to zero then
we actually want to do something so
obviously the character would die or you
want to respawn or do something then
we'll actually say that we'll write a
new function called character death
cause the brackets and add no semicolon
so here what we can do before the GUI
we're gonna save function character
death and then I love this character
death with two brackets about two curly
brackets underneath and then we'll say
application dot Lord love on open
brackets and then we'll put in a level
that when it said death level so this
might bring up and say a GUI or
something like that in another scene
which says you know you died and then
you can have a button that says respawn
so realistically that shows that you
know when your character dies you can
actually do something it doesn't mean
something to you again so it's about
keeping them alive or you will fail so
that's pretty much it for this tutorial
and hopefully it helped you out and
helped you know and do something you
know more dynamic to you again and as
ever thanks very much for watching and
