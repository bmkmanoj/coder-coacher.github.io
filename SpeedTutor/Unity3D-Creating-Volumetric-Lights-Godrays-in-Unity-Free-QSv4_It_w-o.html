how to create a god Raya sort of effect
or volumetric lighting that you can use
in unity free are units prone it's
usually singing games where if you look
if you you know lights coming through a
window and you see sort of the fade in
across the room which is almost sort of
like you can see that in real life
sometimes if you see but through trees
or and sometimes dust when you see dust
across your window with the lights
coming through you'll see a sort of
volumetric light effect now we're going
to you know create this simple in unity
using a plane so all I've done I've got
my scene which may have seen before and
I've got a plane that i've imported in
I've just you know made by going game
object create over and then plan and
just positioned it where I'd like the
light to come through so I've got a
little learn you know really basic
object and light is going to come
through the top now I'll position my
plane where I'd like the actual you know
Gadre effect to come through so what we
need to do is go into Photoshop next and
create the effect that we're looking for
so what we're going to do we're going to
go new and I'm going to create a new an
actual new document which is going to be
a thousand twenty four by a thousand
twenty four I'm going to press ok and
what we want to do is want to create a
new layer down the bottom and delete
this background layer we had now we've
got no color in this section now at this
side it usually has the paint bucket
tool now if we hold over that and we go
to the gradient tool what we're going to
want to do is then create a gradient
I've already made one here but I'll show
you how to make it now the second preset
along is far ground to transparent so
what I'll do is I'll just select this
first color what we do is select a
yellow and choose a yellow that I'm
looking for so pale yellow and then you
can still see a bit of the sort of the
green tinge so what I'm going to do is
actually pull this all the way across so
we get rid of as much as that as
possible
I'll press ok and then you get your
gradient tool now if you hold shift and
left-click you just can drag down and
you can make yourself that gradient now
what we have do is drag you know the
majority of the way down so I get almost
a half split between the color and then
it fades off to nothing
so then what I'll do is save this as god
rare new and I'll press ok now if I go
back into unity and import a new asset
and then got import God renew what I'm
then going to do is add this God renew
to the plan now you'll notice it's
slightly changed you know you can see
it's slightly on the plane but it's
still a default color now what we're
going to do is we're going to click on
this object and we can see God renew has
been added for with whatever shared I
had before but now I'm going to use a
new shared I'm going to use the
particles and use addictive soft and
then what I'll do is sometimes you get a
bit of edging at the bottom you can very
vaguely see the edge now what I'll do is
I'll click on the texture that I'm using
and instead of having that mod repeat
I'll use this clump and then press apply
and you don't actually see any hedging
at the bottom which you sometimes get
with the repeating texture now what we
can see now is using the actual
particles addictive except shared it
holds the transparency put put so soft
and look to it
so almost looks like light going through
so if you can see now there almost looks
alike you would see in a game that light
is coming through the gap and you know
we can I can change things up you know
we can make it a bit further forward we
can make it longer we can make it wider
but once it you know to cover the full
space of the actual hole we've got and
you know you can just do different
things there depending what you want to
use it for and it's good for as I say
you know windows in your game which
you've got light wanting to come through
and you know it gives that effect
of you know something you can find in
unity pearl but creating it even for you
know mobile games and things like that
which you know and always you know you
can't use hi process empowered
performance assets so you just create a
simple plain and add that texture to it
so that's pretty much the basics of
creating you know volumetric lines
within unity and as ever if you liked
