tutorial today and this is going to be
me focusing on telling you and
discussing the most common mistakes that
I see in horror games and indie horror
games that people create and I mean I
fall into some pitfalls of finna be
similar things that I'm going to mention
when I created my horror game but I've
seen an awful lot of games of poly scene
hundreds and hundreds of different
horror games whether that be Triple A or
whether that be some of you know the
most smallest titles and I've made sure
that it's been one of the things that I
concentrate on and it's one of the
things that you should do if you intend
to make yourself a horror game because
it's really important to see look at
what other people have done maybe you
can glean some ideas find out you know
what maybe didn't work what you might
have liked what you thought looked bad
because the whole thing about game
development and things like that is to
help you improve and be critical about
the things that you'll see so you don't
fall into specific pitfalls I'd like to
thank naksan who's got a YouTube channel
where he does gameplay videos of games
where it has no commentary and he's
allowed me to use some of this content
in my videos so I'll leave a link in the
description if you want to check his
channel out so as a start for the most
part in a lot of specifically indie
horror games that you'll find is the
people will make it their game to dark
the commonality is usually people think
that if it's dark it's going to be scary
I mean you might have heard this a lot
but in the end it's not so much about
how dark it is you can have dark periods
in your game but don't make it solely
focus on being too dark and just
increase either increase the ambient
light increase the amount of lights
you're having the scene and just avoid
that darkness and check the darkness on
different types of monitors and people's
games because not everybody has the same
type of computer screen when I was
making my game and I had a really good
monitor and the contrast on it was
really good and I could see all the
objects and things
that one it was a extremely dark but say
I put it on I had an older monitor which
wasn't very good
now the contrast was really poor and
when the low it was let in low lighting
you couldn't really see many of the
assets and you couldn't see very much
detail so you've got to try and work mid
ground to avoid any inconsistencies you
could create yourself a sort of gamma
slider to increase the gamma you know in
an options menu or something like that
and number two would probably be if
you're going for a type of flashlight
that you're going to have in your game
and trying to avoid the sort of generic
things that you will find most commonly
and say that I'll take my again let
alone for example is that you can put
yourself say a point light in front of
your player which would act as the light
you can put cookie in front of that
which overlays are sort of up mask over
the light to make it a different shape
and that's fairly easy to do well one of
the things that people often fall into
the pit fall over and I did was and if
your flashlight intensity is going to
drop over time make sure it doesn't drop
too quickly because a lot of people end
up searching your game and maybe not
play at how you did because you know
exactly where to go what to do and how
to solve any of the puzzles so just try
and be mindful about you know how
quickly you want it to drop and if
you're going to collect stuff like
batteries don't necessarily make that a
focal part of your game if they say a
flashlight is not necessarily them you
know the core of your game where is the
thing again like outlast and the video
camera you know it is a part of the game
as in you know you trying to document
the account of a fina what you're
reporting on and you need that to see in
the dark because it's almost a night
vision mode there it's more prominent
whereas if you have a flashlight which
is only rarely a sort of side element to
your game then try not to sort of use
that as a crutch for the gameplay that
you've got and number three a big one
that I was find with a few games if you
know care attention is not paid in
the development as much is that if
you've ever noticed in a game where your
player would if you've seen in unity if
you have your character controller too
high above say where the flaw would be
and you press play it will drop the
character down because it'll be pulled
down by physics and if you the player
sees that and it drops down I think that
takes away from the immersion of the
game so try your best to keep it sort of
fairly close to the ground without
clipping through because obviously if it
clips to your character would fall
through the ground and a good thing to
avoid this sort of issue if you need it
to drop is have a fade at the beginning
of the scene and toward the end and
that's a lot of things that you know are
people often miss out on you fade into
the scene and you fade out just like you
would in video editing or something like
that
and the fade just allows you to you know
do everything that the player doesn't
have to see for that amount of time so
you might drop some assets in you might
drop the player in and you might do some
extra loading whatever and the fade just
allows you to you know gradually move
into the scene without you seeing any of
those behind the scenes sort of things a
lot of games say so it's a slow game and
it's got no sprinting that's all most
difficult ones that you can run are
sprint it's sometimes an issue is there
any dependent on your game and what
happens in it but a lot of the time when
I see them and you walk really slowly it
can detract from the game overall and
make it slow it all the way down
unnecessarily and make it almost
frustrating for people to play so if
you're going to have something and sort
of have a walk or a realistic speed zone
you don't Ram you know walks you slowly
or run too slowly and make sure you
balance it in a way that it won't get
frustrating to people who play a lot of
games have a limited sort of stamina
sort of an invisible meter in the
background where you might limit the
players stamina now again try to make
sure that you don't make it so that it
can only run for three seconds and then
it stops the player because nobody
necessarily in real life stops after
three seconds unless you really like so
you're really unfit but
in the case of many games that you see
for the player who needs to maybe run
around a large space run away from an
enemy having a cool-down too soon or too
long of a cool-down unsteady sprinting
can make it very tedious to play another
one I would say is that the one that I
noticed and in a lot is say footsteps
footsteps even in you know the best
games that I've ever seen and can have
mistakes in it and I like when I say
footsteps I mean the audio when your
character would walk on different
surfaces it's really important too and I
will come on to this and you know my
future points going along here is that
footsteps are a big thing in terms of
you want different footsteps for
different materials that you will walk
on so stay off you're walking on gravel
concrete you know paving slabs on graphs
on a wooden floor on snow things like
that is that you want to vary it so it
feels more realistic than you know
without having to put too much effort
into development and it can very
important say you're going across a
corridor and you won and you run across
a puddle you want that to change or
maybe you want to do a little bit of a
splash sound effect as you walk across
you might think it's small but people
sort of psychologically in the back of
their mind to pick up on you know little
subtle things and it can almost add to
the sense of immersion without you ever
knowing what was really there it just
makes it feel more believable and
footsteps don't have the volume of
footsteps too loud you almost want it to
be in the background because I have in a
lot of games and they'll be really like
you know horse hooves on the ground and
it's really unnecessarily in itself two
tracks from the game like I've said
before and one thing I will care to
mention is that it's good to have you
know three to four different footstep
sounds which you might randomize
throughout your game for you know two of
the left foot two of the right so then
you don't always hear that same two
footsteps over and over and over and I
mean you can get around with that by
keeping the volume alone it's just some
in the background but that's very
important just be aware and the problem
is just a sheer lack of ambient sounds
or ambient noises if you go anywhere in
real life if you just sit in your room
or if you go out in the real world if
you go to school anything like that
listen to the sounds that you hear if
I'm in my room now and say I've got the
window up and I might hear the sound of
wind I might have a you know a fan on I
might hear some birds tweeting I might
hear the sound of my computer I might
hear some sort of creaks of the house I
might hear somebody downstairs and I
might hear some water in pipes and it
can be any little thing that you might
hear and it adds the sense of emotion
that you feel within a game so if I
describe how I did it in left alone say
I was in the school I would have the
sound of the footsteps I would have sort
of different creaking noises
and sort of things like that as if you
know old buildings and building in
general if you you know you've listened
out a night you'll hear creepy noises
and you know I would have sound coming
from vents sounds of computers moving
even the sounds of sort of like light
fixtures and when light sort of flicker
and sort of have that common buzz even
projectors things like that so you add
loads of layering of elements an audio
is extremely important in the horror
game another thing is to build tension
and you know use your audio in such a
way that you don't just play a really
loud sound and scare the player when it
was you know you were expecting it you
want to build tension over time without
ever telling you know giving the sense
that something's going to come out now
you know you can watch movies and other
games and you will expect a jump scare
and sometimes the best jump scare is you
expect it to happen then it doesn't
happen and it will happen at another
moment and you were caught unaware of
you know when it was even going to
happen so it's about building the
tension and often games don't build
enough tension and just you know throw
the loud noise or throw the thing that
we thought was scary at the player and
it almost becomes
football season I want to avoid these
elements another thing like I was
mentioning with the idea is specific
watch the audio volume so if you've got
things that are sorta like I said
footsteps want to be quiet you want to
have a home of the computer you know
quite quite you could have all these as
3ds sounds the only they attenuate over
a distance so only when you get so close
do you hear that sound you want to make
sure that if you've got fans are you
know vents you want maybe the sound to
you know that to be quite subtle
you only need background noises to be
quite subtle bring things up in volume
if it's something in parts and you want
to say you know do that
loud shocky jump-scare I'm not saying
you can't do that I'm just saying use it
wisely and avoid the pitfalls of you
know being rough tired too reliant on
things like that another point is that I
noticed that often in a lot of games
especially when it's dark and you've got
some lights is the shadows been overly
black in a lot of areas and if you look
often in real life and you look at a
room that might be dark and you shine a
light light bounces around and doesn't
just sort of go in one direction and
then create a shadow and then nothing
else sometimes you you know you want to
add your own ambient lights around they
don't have to cast shadows so we're not
exactly and you know a superhit on
performance you just want to be aware
that look at your game and look at you
know reference images and look at things
in real life and decide what do you feel
that it's realistic or not don't have
everywhere that's completely in the
corner of a room unless you go in for
that for a you know scary artistic feel
don't have it completely pitch black
just put yourself a sort of light there
and maybe a point light which is of a
low intensity and range and you can just
soften areas which don't need to be
completely black because I think that
sometimes takes away from the sort of
elements to your game another thing
would be try to avoid voice acting
unless you feel that it's somebody who's
very competent in speaking and has a
good sort of voice for voice acting
which is quite often your C game than
your heaven and you will hear a voice
actor
and you know it just might not sound
convincing so it's always good to get
people to test your game listen to it
you know do you think this works for
your game does it sort of roll off the
tongue does it feel believable what are
they trying to act and does it if you
ask people and they say the tracks from
your game trying to avoid it because I
have you know when we've been developing
again it's always good to sort of stand
by the rule of you know if you can't do
it you know well enough or properly and
it might look bad try to avoid it as
best you can because which goes
hand-in-hand with that is that if you've
got something like an enemy which is
your sort of very sort of modern
animations or you're a I might look you
know sort of bad and you've got stuff
that people might laugh at I know a lot
of people put a lot of work into games
and games and not easy to do but people
who you know players and people who
might look at your game player again
review your game won't be not as
sympathetic in terms of everything
because they don't know what it takes to
make a game usually if you've got
anything that looks sort of humorous and
didn't wasn't intentional to be like
that it will come across sort of funny
and however they might describe it it's
lame or anything like that you want to
avoid things that just maybe you are the
best at you will avoid making a
character with lots of animations unless
say you you know you go on close to a
star and online and buy a character or
something like that another big point is
looking at grammar in text or in pop up
sign letters or in anything like that
and you want to say to yourself does
this look you know right the you
natively english-speaking anything like
that if not you could find somebody to
sort of proofread the text that you've
got because quite a lot of games you
know just fall down on the fact that the
translations aren't very good and again
take away from the entire immersion of
the game you can find a lot of youtubers
who actually play horror games who have
oftenly said that there will actually
proofread the text that you've got and
help you sort of grammatically correct
any errors that you might have in your
game and I'm sure similarly with
people of other languages if you want to
translate it you can obviously pay
people to translate it for you and
they'll do it you know quicker because
it's paid work but it's something to
look towards in your game one thing that
I always like to mention is that it's
good to very game mechanics and a lot of
horror games rely rely on the same
cliches I mean I did it myself and left
alone but it's trying to break that mold
and do something slightly different so
you know since the beginning of time say
the very original resident evils and
things like that you will find that they
had locked dolls and you have to find a
key or a way to get in there and that's
still the same however many years on and
we're in 2017 and people are still doing
that whether that's triple-a or Indy
it's not necessarily bad it's just good
to like I say you can still have locked
doors in to find a key key card code
whatever it needs to be but try and very
elements so you varied the puzzles that
you've got in your game whether that
might be like I said you need to find a
card you need to find out how to
actually put this code together so if I
give you an example left alone I had
some key card does and in one of the
puzzles in the game had a certain amount
of shapes on the computer and the ships
corresponding to the rooms that were in
the score and each room and had them at
the shape sorry on the whiteboard and
you would have to have to look at the
numbers on the doll the rooms of the
actual dolls if the triangle will on the
whiteboard that might be room labeled -
in the school so you first you know one
of your numbers mummy - then the square
might be in room 9 then you would have
nine as year possibly second number and
you can work out like that and you can
sort of base different solve puzzles to
try and vary again place it isn't just
fine key opened door bang key opened
door fine battery power flashlight you
want to various so it feels interesting
now this lends itself to what I just
mentioned about making it believable
put your game into an original location
so I mean like I say you could say that
mine isn't very village original one
that I put left alone in a sort of
forest in a school well no it's not you
can see a lot in an asylum maybe not as
many in a school and a hospital things
like that maybe try are in a forest for
that matter I know it's the sort of
maybe only so many places that seem
really scary but try and set your and a
self a challenge of putting it somewhere
original and like you'll see a few games
that are coming out recently and a game
called agony that's saying Helen things
and that's got a very stylistic a look
and looks very much like as you would
expect hell maybe to look like and
original in its premise that that's
where it's going to be set even again
lie of the observer that's setting us
off near future sort of reality in a
sort of love and housing and city areas
and you know looks very futuristic and
you know avoid the standard cliches of
where it's going to be set and moreover
on that subject is a lot of people fail
on the basis of not having enough assets
in you seem to make it feel believable
and with the lack of assets comes a lack
of variation so people might have one
chair in a room on one table I see that
in so many even some of the ones that
have been more popular and even if it's
popular there is no excuse for if you
were to look in your house so now are
you will look to look anywhere on the
street or if you were to look in a
school you would see that in your living
room you might have surface you might
have cupboards you have a TV loved it
terrible your mouth and glasses
computers laptops books you might be V
DS games and you want to also be aware
of trying to avoid assets that have been
used in a lot of games so if say you buy
an asset pack or something from the
Unity stop or and something you might
have seen a lot because remember there
was video about people using the little
head with the salt spider legs too much
and it sort of appeared in a lot of
games and you want to avoid using stuff
that
you might have seen a lot if people have
seen that a lot it's not scaring anymore
because it's not believable toward your
game so you can use asset packs and
things like that there's no problem with
that as long as you variant enough and
you design your levels in such a way
that it doesn't look like you've just
bought an asset and you've just slapped
in you just slept a lot of models in
exactly like the developer of the actual
asset ad set up originally you want to
just use those things together and if
you pull them in and sort of vary a
level design and add lots of different
objects like I was saying if you have
lots of assets and lots of variation
nobody would even ever know that you
actually got assets from anywhere you
just want to be aware that you can make
your own custom assets use some that you
might have found elsewhere and make it
believable look at reference look up
again and see what works and what didn't
like I said at the very beginning of me
speaking about this is look an awful lot
of games whether it be horrible it be
film whether it be and you know any
types of other games and look how people
have dressed their scene look at things
in real life look at reference images
for the places that you're trying to
create and try and emulate the sort of
look and feel of those places to make it
more atmospheric so you can watch the
gameplays of people's games how have
they done certain jump scares how have
they created an atmosphere was it scary
how did it work what was their lighting
like you know did they have practical
effects did the help you know pipes
coming down the walls
did they have cracks in the ceiling did
they have elements like this all the
little extra details you can add you're
going to go a long way towards making it
feel more realistic and believable you
know as I just mentioned is try and get
people's opinions try and get people to
test again looking again send you know
test builds to people get their opinion
on how it works how it plays was it
scary was this bit good was any bugs
with any crashes you know did any of the
objects look weird you just want to try
and use as much as you can to make it
look as you know as professional as
possible even if you don't have this
of professional knowledge that you might
think you need you just have to look a
real life and you have to just try and
make it believable because if you can
make it look believable and you can make
it look like a school a house anything
like that you've got a long way to
creating an atmospheric game because it
goes a long way that if it's believable
the player will believe it
you know you'll feel drawn into the game
and anything that you do it doesn't even
need to be a loud jump-scare it will be
scarier if the player feels drawn into
the situation that they're actually in
so these were some tips all the things
that I feel that a lot of people sort of
make mistakes in a lot of horror games
and these can be relevant to other games
as well but hopefully you know you like
the sort of format of this and hopefully
in the future I can carry on doing
things like this so thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
