tutorial today and it's about adding
stuff like a laser sight to a weapon in
your game in unity and all you need to
use is use something called the line
renderer I showed something one of my
other tutorials called the trail
renderer but all the line renderer does
is as the name suggests it renders a
line that you specify so first of all I
love getting my scene like before he's
got a first-person controller whatever
so I've got one of my gun models here
and just you know the terrain so first
of all I've got my main camera
I've already positioned my gun next one
main camera if you could see the main
camera preview it's about that this is
just to save time so I have to show your
position in front of the camera and then
all you need to do is you need to drag
the actual weapon onto the camera so
when you play your game your gun will
actually follow your camera it's not
necessary but otherwise it what nothing
will happen so what we need to do is we
need to actually add a get an empty game
object what we're going to do is we're
going to place this wherever you want
your actual gun laser to reside from so
this example I'll just put it at the end
of the barrel just position it yeah and
something like that that's okay and I'll
just name this and laser and what you
want to do is you want to parent that to
whatever weapon or object that you've
got in front and when you've got that as
long as you collect in it you can go to
component effects line renderer and what
I'm going to do here
Deas the line renderer options I'm going
to create got right-click create
material and so we'll call this laser
Matt fillets material and all I've done
is created um an actual gradient image
in Photoshop just using the grade
tool here gradient tool with a red solid
that goes to a transparent background
and I've saved it out as a PSD and you
can see it here in unity so with my
layers material I'm just going to drag
it on to here and I'll just set it to a
transparent cutout diffuse just so you
know we can see it like that you'd have
to do it like this doesn't really matter
and then on the laser what we can do on
the material we can add the layers of
material so that's them we'll want to
change the Z position so that's the size
of which the layers will actually come
from the end of the barrel and what we
want to do is actually change the start
with so if we change the start with to
the site not point not seven five and
then the end width will make it fit in
not point not one five what we'll do is
on tick use world space and what we'll
do is actually move this back so it
looks like the lines actually curling
from the gun emit you can adjust this
alpha cutoff I could have actually done
it so my map goes this way so the
gradient goes this way so we'd see a
fall-off in one of the directions and
that's just an error to do with my ball
of unities errors so basically got this
now we want to add something that will
let us actually not turn this laser on
and off because if I first show you
happens you know you get your layers of
that that's what it might look like now
you might want something to actually in
all the games you you might see the
actual laser to be turned on and off so
if you go right click create JavaScript
and we'll just name this layers a toggle
do is openly as a toggle up
and then once my developers open in the
start function I'm going to write this
start renderer dot enabled equals false
so at the start we don't want to see it
in our update function we're going to
write if input dot get key down up and
brackets F close both brackets then put
two curly brackets below that will say
if this dot renderer dot enabled is
equal is set to should I say false and
then will add to mark early brackets in
here and said this stop renderer dot
enabled is equal to true and then below
here we'll put else and then put our
curly brackets else they start renderer
dot enabled equals false and that's
pretty much it will save that out so
that means it'll start off you can't see
the actual line then if we press F it'll
show virtual line and if then if we
press F again it won't do so if we save
that as we have done now on the laser it
could do is you can add your layers a
toggle to that because this dot renderer
works because it will find this line
renderer and if we play the game so the
beginning nothing there press F you can
see the actual line and switch one I
keep pressing F and you can change you
can change other parameters like you can
make the line longer by adjusting this
Zed value but basically that's how to
make a very simple cell laser sight for
games all right thanks very much if you
