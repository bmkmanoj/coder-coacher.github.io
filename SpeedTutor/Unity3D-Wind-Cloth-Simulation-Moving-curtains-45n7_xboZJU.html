today and this is gonna be about
floating curtains or some sort of
physics of a window where the wind might
be coming through and might cause
curtains to you know sort of move about
a little bit now this is only going to
be a very simplistic example but here's
my example of it working so you can see
that we've got some interactive cloth so
they both move randomly depending on
what settings that we actually give them
in turn so to begin with all we're going
to need to do is we're going to need
three things in particular so what we're
going to do is we're going to use a just
a box or a cube and this is gonna act as
our curtain rail or something which
would hold the objects that would float
so we're just gonna create a cube and
make it small it doesn't really matter
what it looks like as long as it's got
an actual Collider on it so this needs a
box Collider so we'll place this box
Clyde on near to this wall here because
it's better when your curtains are next
door and objects or the doll fall
backwards and they actually cause some
physics collisions with that so we're
going to go to game object create other
and then choose cloth now it's gonna
make a interactive cloth object we can
just parent that to the cube we've got
for now so this interactive cloth will
just be made as a plain so that'll be
pulled in what we'll do is I'm going to
rotate my plane around to 90 degrees so
it's straight on and you can hold
control to actually give that a smooth
um rotation and what we going to do is
we're going to narrow this down to make
it look like sort of the size of the
curtain or whatever we want to make you
can follow my other cloth tutorial and
I'll show you that you can replace the
mesh here so you can add your own mesh
later on so we can do is we can add the
curtain just initially close to the
tool curtain mail that we've got and
what we can do then is on the attached
colliders we can write size of one what
we can do is we can add the cube into
there so that's going to be the attached
collider and what we want is the
stretching stiffness is that you can
change that to around nine point seven
you can use gravity because it's going
to need to pull it down so it won't flow
up into the air we need to we can tick
self collision so it will collide with
itself and do some things now the main
things to take into account when doing
this I showed you in a last video to use
a wind zone now winds on can affect this
so what we need to do is we need to add
random and external acceleration to make
it do a certain amount of things so this
is really dependent on what angle you
want your own cloth to move and how you
want it to behave but for my example if
I change the random acceleration to five
and I press play you'll notice that it
begins to move and then what we can do
is change the external acceleration to
maybe three and then we'll get some
variation on what we want it to do and
now we can really if if you leave your
game plane and then what I like to do is
just look back at the object we've got
just click on the interface again and
we'll see it playing and what we could
do is we could have vet investigate by
you know just going around and seeing
what some of these assets and things
apply to our object that we've got so if
we adjust the tare factor - maybe not
point one and then the attachment
response - not point not one we just get
a sort of more free-flowing
object in terms of how we want the
curtain to look so as I've said we can
move this when we press on play it'll
take away everything that we've changed
because we've only done that in game so
we can just change it back to what we
wanted you can obviously just these
however you feel that you like to adjust
it if we go back
to the scene view we grabbed that
interactive cloth and duplicate it this
time I will put it at that side and then
if we press play we'll get a similar
look to both of the curtains or whatever
we might be wanting to make and it just
you know can simulate some wind coming
through a particular window in your game
or it can be used to simulate not just
curtains clothes any sort of sort of
fabricated item that you might have it
again so that's just a really simple way
of just in the external and random
acceleration and it just in some points
in there and it was fairly simple no you
need to make sure is that if you impart
your own custom mesh you can see here
the unities plane for some reason it's
actually made of purple lots and lots of
different polygons and normally at one
plane is just made up of two triangles
or wooden face whereas this is made up
of an awful lot that's what you need to
make the fabric that we want to act as
if it is real we needed to be able to
bend in as many places as possible so
when you're thinking about making your
own mesh make sure you add a lot of are
enough segments to your model to make it
look realistic but it's something you
need to try on so again thanks very much
