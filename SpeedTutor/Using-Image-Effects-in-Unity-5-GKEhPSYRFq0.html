tutorial and this is going to be what a
few people have been asking this is B
about using image effects and image
effects were not previously available in
versions of unity free but seen as the
unity 5 has most of the features now you
have you know full access to the full
range so what you want to do to actually
impart your image effects is if you
right click on the project panel unless
you've imported them already when you
started your project is you can go to
import package and import effects and
then the effects will end up being with
inside your standard assets and it will
come with all the different sort of
assets that solve together in terms of
the things that are provided with Pro so
image effects are one of these and
they're just a bunch of scripts that
doose things within the camera and such
some say you've got our first burst
controller that you brought in as a from
the prefabbed
first-person controllers you've got your
first-person controller now it says the
first person character and this is your
camera so this is what we want to add
any one of our image effects to now you
can do this on this side on the right
hand side you can add component go to
image effects and choose one here bump
and so you can see the menu more clearly
I usually like to go to component image
effects and then we'll choose an image
effect that we want to use now there's a
few main image effects that I've used
previously and ones that I think feel
they're good and I'll go through them
very quickly and very briefly just to
show but I'll tell you now bloom is
something that almost brings colors out
and makes the more bright so if there's
a a Sun or a bright light it will almost
make it glow around the edge or bring a
sort of glow the blur saw a normal
motion blur is just when you move you're
going to have a solid blur in front of
your camera
the camera motion blur is just going to
be a motion blur around the edges of
your camera not directly into the center
depth of field is something when you can
set blur
depending on the distance that it is
aware sometimes that you can have a blur
class and you can see distance in fog
objects in the distance in focus or vice
versa you can also have vignette and
things like that which will add a black
edging towards the edges of your camera
you can have color adjustments which is
just in the either it fits black or
white for gray scaling or you can use
color correction which used in a lot of
games and movies to change the overall
look of an again so say you've got a lot
of varying colors you can change the
color correction to make it look more of
a solve blend of one particular color
edge detection I think is just more if
you want to add to certain effects to
edges of particular game objects
displacement these are things if I don't
really know where they come in handy but
a twirl of art X mix solve a vortex in
the middle of your camera rendering Sun
shafts is another good one which will
create god rays or light shafts from a
light source and passed all through
other objects that would realistically
cast the particular shaft and screen
space-time occlusion is also a good one
and it'll add the darkness between
objects which you get in real life and
then noise is just something that you
might seem from like Slenderman and
things like that now they were just a
quick overview I'll quickly show some of
the ones I'll add a bloom I'll add
motion blur camera motion blur scene as
are these being the main ones
the Vigna add a color correction and I
will add it from the rendering Sun
shafts and screen space ambient
occlusion so I will minimize all of
these to show you them in turn so we can
go in our game now then things might
look a bit crazy at the moment
so they turn all those off and make this
a little bit bigger you can see that the
bloom is enabled and if I play the game
you'll notice that the objects look
slightly more with a glowy sort of
effect if I turn the bloom effect up if
I turn the intensity up you'll notice
that everything gets quite ridiculous
and it can be use just to make a nice
effect if you wanted maybe like a sci-fi
II solve air we are seen the motion blur
you can add that and it's one that just
when you move the motion blur is across
the entire camera and you can change the
blur amount camera motion blur somewhat
similar but not directly in your line of
view it's just the edges that get a
particular blur and can be changed with
all these settings accordingly the
vignette you might have seen that the
edges got slightly darker if I increase
the amount you could do like almost a
blinking or somebody that has got a sort
of tunnel vision effect like that color
correction is another big one is that
you can set depending on the kerbs that
you set within your game you can get an
overall more dynamic look and moss of
consistent color scheme where if I own
ticket it almost makes it previously it
was looked a little bit washed out now
it sort of makes it more uniform the Sun
shafts works in a way where you can add
a shaft caster which is you can add your
directional light to that property which
that if I turn the intensity up just for
this example and we look towards the Sun
here which is in our skybox you can see
the very subtle light shaft now I've got
nothing that will really show the light
shafts but that's just a simple sort of
setup towards it now the screen space
time the occlusion like I said the
darkness between your room objects and
you see now you can see that everything
that is separate will actually have a
a bit of ambient occlusion in between
you can obviously change all the
settings based around that so you can
change the occlusion intensity and
things that affect the look of the
entire game you can obviously do ambient
occlusion with baking but these are just
things that you can add to your your
entire scene just to make it look maybe
a little bit different overall I'll take
that in bloom and lens flare down and we
can add all the things together to make
some sort of crazy-looking game but that
was just a sort of brief overview of
some of them are appropriate image
effects if people want me to go through
the image effects
Martha Ellie I will but it's really a
case of you're just messing around with
what works for your scene and what you
feel is appropriate for what you want to
do so again thanks very much for
watching and don't forget to Like
