tip today and this is how to bring up
statistics and 3dsmax statistics and
help with along with if you're working
with games if you want to see a polygon
count and such so you don't go and you
keep within the set boundaries that you
may be given so in 3dsmax if you press 7
on your keyboard it will actually bring
up the statistics box so you can see my
currency and I've got nothing there if I
just create a box in my scene you can
see that my actual poly count increased
but sometimes you don't always want to
see the poly count you want to see some
actual specifics about the object so if
you press the little plus next your
perspective and you go to configure view
parts what you can do is you can make
sure you click on the statistics tab and
here's the statistics cell what you can
do is you can just click triangle edges
whichever you want
I usually like to use triangle count and
here you can see that it has total
selection and total plus selection now
what this means it will show the total
in you seen when nothing selected if you
choose total plus selection press ok
it'll actually show you what the actual
selected object at that side that's all
so if you've got many say high poly
objects in your scene and you want to
just narrow down see what one object may
be so for pulling a a cylinder as well
you can see that my total scene is on
the left but whatever I click on shows
my poly count either side which is
really nice when you just want to see
what's going on quite easily and quite
simple so that's about it Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
