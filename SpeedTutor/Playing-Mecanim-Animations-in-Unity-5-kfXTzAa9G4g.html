tutorial today and today I'm going to
show you how to play an animation or an
meckenheim
animation which is using the more modern
version of the animation system that
they brought in with unity 5 now this
one is one I've been avoiding using but
I've used it in a couple of bits
recently and it's not one that everybody
explains how to do but I'll go through
some sort of basic examples on using it
and setting it up and playing a basic
animation so few people have actually
asked me so in the scene we've got
something better just FPS control and
I've got cube now I'm just going to
remove the things cuz I did a little bit
of testing before we do it so when you
get your cube it'll just be with a mesh
renderer and a Collider when you want to
add an animation you can go window
animation we're going to be doing it
from unity so you can actually do it if
you bring it in from a end 3d program or
something like that but when you go to
the animation window it'll pop up when
you go window animation we'll just click
create and new animation what we'll do
is we'll save this in or call it box
move and we'll press save and you'll see
the timeline across here to make
animation I'll just hold ctrl and use my
scroll wheel to zoom out and all I'm
going to do is I'm just going to push
the timeline to about one second get the
move tool and push it that way and then
go scrub across to two seconds grab the
first two keyframes copy those and press
ctrl V to paste in the end so all we get
there is we get a pretty much a looped
animation and we could adjust the the
way it actually moves by adjusting the
curves and things but for the sake of
this here animation and you want to know
how to play that on mekin
and things like that because ceylon our
cube you get the animator component and
say we press play and it will just play
automatically forever and you know we
want to be able to control when it
actually plays so if you go window and
animator which is slightly different
you'll get another thing that pops up
and what we can do is we can select
the cube and it will show up some it's
called the state machine which controls
all the things it's more like a
flowchart to control what's happening so
I'll show the stair and eggs and things
like this and I mean I'm not on trips
include upon everything but what this
means is that it runs through and it
will instantly play then emission and if
we double click it you can see that it's
looped so what we can do is to stop
actually playing automatically we can
right click in the empty space we can
create a new step create empty so now
we've got something that doesn't off
thing because we've got nothing in it a
little scarlet static or something like
that so then you can see there and one
going to do is I'm going to right click
my static and say the set is the default
layer now the entry then runs to the
static object that we've got now if we
go back into the scene and press play
you'll see that nothing happens because
we've it doesn't do anything it doesn't
understand what to do now on our box
move what we can do is double click and
on tick loop so that when we play it in
the script
it won't loop when we do it so that's
all one good how do we tell it what to
do so if we go create JavaScript we'll
create a script cold we'll call it
animation play because this can be used
for any type of animation you might want
so we'll get into whatever program
you're in and I'm in visual studio and
what I'll do is I'll get rid of this two
starting functions and we'll start by
writing our own so I'm going to do is
write start void star two brackets and
two curly brackets below and then we're
going to save this dot getcomponent
and then in two angles we're going to
look for the anime tour component and
then we're going to have two brackets
after that and we'll say dot play and
then in brackets we'll have the name of
the animation so we called it cube move
if I just quickly check it was called
box move so we'll call it box move and
then we need to have a comma minus 1
comma zero point zero F and then it's
semicolon on the end and all we're doing
here is we're going to add this to the
actual box itself so we're going to say
that this scene as they were calling
this it means the object that it's
living I'm going to get the component
animator and we're going to play the Box
move animation - 1 0 I'm not 100% clued
up on these two values but you can have
a look at the Unity documentation and it
just says to use minus 1 and 0 F and you
just need to increment I you just need
to change your wording here and
obviously this will do it a start of the
game but say you put in the update
function and had it on a bottom press
you could do that but I'll show you what
happens here because you saw they didn't
play so I'll minimize I will go on to
the cube I'll put box I will put the
animation play on to it and you can see
that if I own ticket and we press play
nothing happens but if I tick this and
at the beginning it should just play the
animation as so perfect and that's all
it did so say you might want this
actually looped for instance what we can
do is I don't know it's created another
instance of itself there what we can do
is we could potentially say you've got
multiple animations on one object so
you've got for a character but for this
box we'll duplicate the animation that
we've got on the box which so it's
exactly the same and we'll just call
this box move loop if we select the box
move then right-click in here can create
from selected so it will add the box
move the loop up here so what this means
is that now if we double click box move
loop we can take on loop time pause and
if we double click on box move you can
see it won't be looped so now we have to
animate
on this box and one looped one nan
eloped so what we could do potentially
is we could go into this script now copy
the exact same line again and instead of
having that we can just call it box move
loop now it will do it straight away
after it but we just I just want to put
a little pause so we can you know we're
a couple of seconds before it actually
does the animation sort we can do is we
can go yield return new waitforseconds
I'll put five seconds in and put
semicolon I just need to change the void
to ie new numerator and that lets me do
a core routine to where a couple of set
a few seconds now what we'll notice is
that when we play will get the normal
animation it will stop we'll be waiting
five seconds throughout that and then
once it starts playing
we'll get the step where all it does is
just loop forever and ever and ever
until we decide to you know do something
else with it and what we could also
potentially write if you need to stop
your animation at any point is that you
can just save this don't get component
that we did before two angled brackets
again just right in the animator because
that's what we've been using and two
brackets then walking save dot stop with
two brackets and a semicolon so
realistically all we're doing is just
saying we're looking for the component
animator or playing box move or were
paying box move loop and then on the
animator we're just making sure that
we've got and not something that doesn't
do anything at the beginning so it
doesn't play the animation until we tell
it obviously if you've got a character
this could be idle or and then we've got
mocks box with and box loop one which
loops and one which doesn't and it just
we choose when to play them accordingly
so as I said you could have an update
function you could have you know when
you press W and the animation played
anything like that it's really dependent
on what you need to do so this was just
a basic example of how to make just an
animation basically play you
using the Meccan emanation system so
