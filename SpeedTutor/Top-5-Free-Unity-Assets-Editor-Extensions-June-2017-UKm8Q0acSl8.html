video of the of the top 5 for utility
and extensions for June 2017 and number
one is the PCG assistant which is a tool
which lets you experiment with
procedural generation and it lets you
sort of interact with certain levels of
procedural generation unless you build
sort of grid so you can test this out
and you can explore a little ways that
you can generate levels within games and
you know could help you with 2d and 3d
and help you in politics for different
generators to help you achieve a
different style and number two is v2 the
tail map level editor and this is a
pretty much a level editor which allows
you to sell create levels fill the
levels with specific tools which that
you move to save pin the specific areas
with the assets that you have and lets
you zoom in save and all those things
and helps you add a whole host
customizability and allows you to create
and share your users content number
three is the easy pinned prefabs and
this is pretty much something that
people have been waiting for allows you
to pin prefabs onto the sort of world so
you can take prefab from your scene and
literally just paint it into the world
really easy and make it speed up your
level designing much quicker if you know
you've only got prefabs available number
four is the autosave sea and this is
actually pretty cool one if you're a
person who forgets to do auto saving or
saving you know all of the time in case
you know unity might crash or something
like that and this is just something
which will also save your scene into a
specific folder and you don't we'll save
you the hassle of you know losing work
and then it's all gone and number five
is the GPU skinning and this can allow
you to bake a animation with a regular
skeleton to texture 2d or skin it to the
GPU rather than it being CPU intensive
now I don't know a whole host about this
but this might be
a good sort of saver on the CPU side if
that's something that you're looking to
optimize so again you can check out all
the assets I have featured for June and
in this video I'll leave a link in the
description and you can check those out
thanks very much for watching don't get
some light coming as you subscribe
