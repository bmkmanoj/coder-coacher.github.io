extensions for March April 2018 so no
one is the autocomplete text field and
this is a package which contains a class
which is called autocomplete text field
CS and it allows you to have a fully
functional autocomplete text field for
the editor and it can be used in custom
editors or field attributes and it has a
system which is built-in to use the same
way as the unity editor field would work
and it returns the string with the value
selected and it contains a couple of
examples showing you with different
scenarios of where it can be used and
the next one is called project prefs
and project prefs allows you to easily
save preferences for your editor assets
and this is an asset that can be used in
the editor and the preferences are saved
in a specific any file under the project
settings folder and also content editor
won't emit an editor window which allows
you to easily modify the saved
preferences and the UI allows you to
easily manage your settings and the next
one is something called and just pivot
and we've seen a I've seen a few assets
from this developer and they've made a
few good quality assets that can really
help your work and this work allows you
to change the pivot point of an object
without having to create an empty parent
and change the pivot like that and it
allows you to change it two types of
ways to change the pivot if the object
doesn't have a mesh which is a mesh
filter then you can have a script which
simply changes its position and rotation
and if the object does have a mesh then
the script first creates an instance of
the mesh and adjust the meshes pivot
point by altering its vertices normals
and tangents and can finally change its
position and rotate the child objects
according and the next one is we've
called Bezier solution and again from
the same asset and it's a plugin which
helps you career Bezier splines and
easily create the more of a visual
editor or by coding during gameplay
which includes in some utility functions
like finding the closest point point on
the spline or traveling along the spine
spline
comes from speed and there's a simple
user interface its parts of runtime
spline generation bytecode and it's a
cool way to create them if you choose to
do it if you need to maybe make a track
or something in real time and again from
the same developer this one's called
asset usage detector and this allows you
to find the usage of a specific asset or
object in a unity project like that
lists the objects that refer to them and
you can use search usage of an object
which extends the unity object search
for references in the asset folder
search every corner of the project and
allows us to search for nonspecific
unity objects data types and a lot more
the next one is called icon generator
generate icons from prefabs and this one
suggests have you ever wanted to create
a icon in for you game but now you can
easily do it and you can create icons
for inventory items MMO games etc and
this allows you to create icons
specifically from prefabs custom name
for every icon you can have custom
settings for each the icons by default
are Feige produced at 1 to 8 by 1 to 8
resolution includes an ample scene so
you can check out the functionality and
this is actually a fairly good one so it
might be something that you want to
check out and the next one here we have
something called texture combiner and
this allows you to be able to merge
textures directly into unity and combine
multiple black-and-white textures into
only one so this if you want to convert
textures into one now you know atlas
texture it might save on some
optimization and the last but not least
is called you model a 2.0 free trial and
the only the limitation of this allows
3u modeler objects in any one scene and
the HUD for the scene is displayed at
all times and is just a bigger
functionality of almost modeling tools
within the Unity engine so you can
create in a custom sketch based modeling
modeling with extrusion and
extrusion based modeling box modeling
and I allow you to cram really quickly
iterate on things that you've made and
allow a lot a lot of pitch features as
you can see in the video below and your
model is just a unity extension to let
you model prototype easily quickly with
in the engine without ever having a 3d
program be sure to check out all the
free editor extensions for March April
2018 and be sure to check out all the
other assets for this month and thank
all the developers for making such
fantastic assets for free so thanks
again for watching don't forget to Like
