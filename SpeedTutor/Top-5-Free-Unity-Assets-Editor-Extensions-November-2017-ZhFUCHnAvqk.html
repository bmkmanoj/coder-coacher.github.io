editor extensions for November 2017 a
newborn is an asset called a shadow
volume which and shadow volume allows
you to use static objects which renew
scene and you can beg the static shadows
using shadow volume you can look at the
little example in there but I'm not sure
if that means that it's on a per asset
basis so you can build down you can bake
a shadow on a per asset basis rather
than building the entire scene as one if
you maybe want some particular assets to
have shadows and other things know when
number two is an asset called X node and
this is a powerful editor framework
which is ideal for custom dialogues
state machines procedural generation and
behavior trees for things that you might
want to do and there's a forum in a wiki
if you need to look at and you can see
that the features allow you to zoom and
pan it's got a lightweight features in
it when it's actually built out for a
runtime it's a very little code behind
the scenes it's strong separation from
the editor a long time and it's very
similar to how it's structured would be
something created in unity and number
three is poly toolkit and poly toolkit
allows you to browse find and download
3d objects from poly Google calm and use
it in your own apps and you can use the
editor window to browse and import
assets directly for the projects and
then you can also search import models
at runtime so if you need to grab
something at the time you can have
something which pulls something in from
places where it might have been already
made and then before is easy camera
positioning light and the ECP system is
it helps you navigate and position the
editor cameras with a new style and then
you can save our load the preset for
existing cameras new cameras and empty
game object which just allows you to
have a different way to change cameras
whether it be you need it for a specific
shot whether you need to be able to
control it for a render that you're
gonna be doing all you need it for
specific scenes in your game and number
5 is the beta of the resin a visual
search and it's a plugin which is in
viola so you need to register for
Beata or the link provided this visual
search is a plugin which is available
for unity developers specifically and
it's a search engine which understands
the shape of objects and it allows you
to discover 3d assets based on the
visual similarity by what you might be
using in UTS actual scenes and it's
powered by machine understanding and
geometry and structure and it searches
3d content making it easy to browse and
access it's easy to access to a vast
data set of content which is already
available with a full integration with
the unity asset store and s in any asset
that you might have already imported and
it has a preview of all the assets which
might be available and advanced search
filters to set by poly count so if
you've got lots of things you know you
might be looking for something in this
star you might be making a forest e area
and you might you might be looking for
some plants or something like that and
it might something that automatically
finds that this might be suitable for
your scene these were the top 5 editor
extensions for November 2017 so I'll
