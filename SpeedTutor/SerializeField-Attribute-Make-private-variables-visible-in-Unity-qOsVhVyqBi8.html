tutorial today and this is gonna be
another quick tip on showing you another
unity attribute element and this one is
going to be serialized field and what
this means is that if I give you an
example of how things work and good
practices in unity when you're coding
you've got you know too many types of
variable you can classed as private or
public and private just means that it is
just essentially private to this script
and this script a lot so you can't
access it anywhere else whereas public
means that if in another script you want
to access this hunger variable and
change if you say eat some food for
instance you can do that but it's not
always beneficial to keep everything as
public because and it's just good
practice to hide things away so you
can't get any issues down the line of
things accidentally accessing it are
other people down the road getting into
your code and then changing something if
a lot stuff is actually public when it
doesn't need to be so if I give you the
example you can see you can see an
inspector is that the only thing visible
is hunger but we might want our actual
other private variables actually visible
in the inspector without them being
public because they're not needing to be
accessed they don't really need to be
public so what could do say we set all
of them and none of them need to be
accessed within another script we can
just keep them available for the
inspector salt we can do is you can
write it above us off to the side but I
will write it here so above any of your
private variables you can write in
square brackets serialize field and we
can save that out and go back into unity
so now you can see that he'll is now
available in the inspector and we can do
a similar thing for the other variables
that we've got sometimes I like just put
the square brackets and put the
serialize field just right next to my
actual variables themselves rather than
have them at the top because sometimes
it just needed to organize it that way
but it doesn't matter where you put it
and if I go back you can see that now
damage is actually appeared in the
inspector and they're all private
variables so
no need for them to be accessed
elsewhere and it just helps them stay
protected and helps you them to be
sterilized and visible within the
inspector so it's just a nice way to
manage your code in a particular way so
remember into square brackets you can
write sterilized filled in from above
any of the variables that you need to be
visible so thanks very much for watching
