tutorial today and this is going to be a
pretty basic one I did cover it for
unity far but it's about changing scene
on a trigger on a collision within your
game now I've seen that a few people
have been actually struggling with it so
I'll help you by going through the vit
the basics again and doing it through in
unity 5 so what I've got is got a new
scene just as you would start to level
you've got a main camera directional
light what I'm going to do is we're
going to delete the main camera so we
don't need any more you want to bring in
the standard assets and you one
characters to bring those in you can
right click import package and import
the character's package if not you can
download them from the unity asset store
and then import them in that way so from
your standard assets we won a
character's first person control our
first person character and then we want
to bring in the FPS controller so we can
do is we can pull that in drag it in and
you'll notice that this FPS controller
has audio source it's a rigidbody so we
need to make sure that it has one of
those on to detect collisions and it's
not currently tagged anything so we want
to tag that player because it's good
it's useful when it's tagged playable
for when we do collisions now what I'm
going to then do is go game object 3d
objects and create a quad now you can
create a plane but I like to create a
quad because it is not as many polygons
I'm going to do is I'm just going to
scale this up really big and then what
I'm going to do is add my material to it
so we can so it's got a good contrast
now then what we want to do is also then
game object 3d object then we want a
cube now we've got a cube in our scene
you can press W to go to the move key I
like to press F to zoom in no and again
I'll just bring that up what we can do
is we can scale this up so it's
be along here so we're going to be easy
to be able to walk through this Collider
and this is going to be our trigger so
that we've placed the trigger or it's
not really a trigger yet so I want to
make sure we do is the on that our box
Collider want to make sure it's set to
is trigger because when we walk into it
we want to be able to detect the
collision so we're going to write a
really basic script which is going to
control moving to a different scene so
what I'm going to do is right-click or
any JavaScript and I'm going to call
this move scene and what I'm going to do
is then open up in monodevelop and then
what I'm going to do here as I'll delete
the two starting function we need to
write another function called on trigger
enter and then in brackets call call on
Collider you may have seen me do this
before it's pretty much the identical so
unity files version if call dot we want
to I would I like to use compare tag and
then in brackets and then in course
player you can use the double equals but
this one technically is more efficient
at finding tags and then we want to put
two brackets on the end add two curly
brackets below there and set application
dot load level and then open brackets
and what want to write in here is maybe
new scene then we'll close that up and
use a semicolon now below the pragma
script we usually write our variables
want to write a variable and we'll call
this new c and as that is type string
with a capital now sometimes it might
make that locket or want to do is make
sure that it's uppercase so you can see
it change color and we'll save that and
if it does moan about anything we want
to just convert anything that it's
talking about then when we go back into
unity what we can do is on our collider
so we can put this
as our we'll rename this is collider so
then we'll see it what we could do is we
can add the script and it's got a script
and it's got a place to add a new scene
in so I want to do is I will save this
scene out currently and I will call this
scene 1 so they'll see one saved and
what I want to do is I'll create a new
scene which is blank which only has a
main camera you can see it just look so
into space and then what we'll do is we
can save as and we'll call this scene
two so you can see them both down there
what I want to do is open scene one
backup I can select this object again in
a new scene I can add seem to in there
just right in so you can use this script
over and over and only have to change
that sort of level name then we go file
build settings and we want to add
technically both scene 1 scene 2 in
there and then once we try and play we
will be playing the game and we'll walk
into that Collider and we'll move scenes
so if you look back it what we're doing
is we're setting a string which we can
input which is a word or a series of
characters that we can put together to
make something and we're just checking
that the tag that we've got within our
game we made sure that the first-person
controller had a tag of player and we
move scene quite easily and you can do
this you could create another cube say
here and have the same script on it's
got exactly the same script I'll change
this to will move to scene 3 and if I go
back on the other object that's still
seem to so you can use it as many times
as you want to move to different scenes
so really that's just the really
simplistic way to move scenes on a
trigger in unity 5
so hopefully that I undoubting buddies
issues and thanks very much for watching
