system which is available on the unity
asset store it's actually a small system
which you pull a set of lever switches
whatever you want to call them and if
you get the switch right it can do
something there's a set of indicator
lights on this side which you can see
that if it's ready to be pulled if your
limit has reached if it's accepted the
actual serve switches we pulled an order
or if it's resetting and you've got a
test and reset button everything is all
the switches are animated the buttons
change and everything is independent so
you can keep on adding switches however
you like you can add multiple in the
same scene and I will show you this in
order each of the switches actually have
their own number so you can set a number
according it's hour if you want then
you've got one controller at the top
which you can set the lever order which
could be whatever you already want be
and I have just put a number at the top
to make easier and then you set the pull
limit to the amount of levers that you
want to be able to pull in a particular
order and when you hit that pull limit
it will tell you that you've reached the
actual limit I'll test this so you'll
see that it's one two three four five
and going in order they're all named one
two three four five in that order so
you'll see that here we're ready to pull
the switches what we could do is we can
press one two three four and five it'll
say that you've reached your limit you
can keep on pulling but it's not going
to do anything you can press reset which
will reset the system and you have to
start again or you can test and you can
see that it accepted and we'll get a
sound effect for that and you see with
then we cannot use anything on this side
again so you can have a bit of script
which does whatever you need to do
whether it be activated or generate or a
secret mission whatever it may be
now we've got something which the still
odd the same but we've got six levers
this time so we can do you know one six
this many and in a weird odd it'll say
the limit if we press test hey we didn't
get it right so it will just reset
automatically again the switches or the
levers are a timer so you can't spam
them you have to you know we're a split
second before you can do it again and I
did two three two three two three two
three and I can test it and you can see
it is accepted the code so really all it
is is very simple you can add as many
switches like I said as you want you can
change your Sam you sort of your lever
old indefinitely so you could have some
randomization if you need that but it's
really a simple solution for just adding
a little maybe min again to you again or
adding something a little bit different
and if you also have a keypad system or
message start if you're interesting is
something like that so thanks very much
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
