make an in-game cutscene today and this
can be used in unity pro unity free
whatever you want to use because the
problem is with the unit if we can't use
movie textures so you can play a video
if you wanted to make it as your little
cutscene so you've got doing copyright
things that make it real time and
in-game so I'm going to show you a
really basic where that's going to let
you have a new camera do something with
this camera disable all your
first-person controller elements and
actually do something then when the
camera looks an object and then switch
control back to your player so then you
can actually play the game again so in
my scene all I've got is my physics
objects so I've got ten box boxes each
with a rigidbody component if you've got
a component physics rigidbody and that
just means they'll be affected by
physics and they've all got use gravity
ticked
I've just got a basic scene with a quick
text wrap on got start this out another
time I'm a first-person controller with
the main camera and then a second camera
which is positioned in the back corner
of the room and you can make one of them
as you go a game object create other and
then camera and what you can do is if
you if you wanted this view you can
click a line to view and you can line it
to whatever view you're looking at in
your actual scene view but when you play
this scene you'll notice that you know
you'll have camera two is the main
camera and then you'll be able to play
around with the character controller now
in a cutscene you don't want to be able
to use that first-person controller you
don't want to be able to see it and you
want to make sure this camera 2 is the
one that's going to do something and
then it'll switch control box you can
players it so we'll start off really and
I'll start off with something something
basic this is going to be it's going to
be part of the cutscene so I'm going to
create as I'm going to create
a script called box physics and what I'm
going to do here is this box physics is
going to it should be what I'm going to
do for my cutscene so it's remember
boxes explode so I'll do run through
this quickly because you can find this
on the unity scripting reference about
adding an explosion to rigid bodies but
for the sake of this we don't need to
cover it too much if you want me to
cover it I will do and we can show how
to make things explored really quickly
now we don't need to have this yet
because that's referencing table bits
that I'm going to show later on so
really I'll put a link in the
description of how to get this script
and all it does is has a really sort of
power and you'll notice that if I get
rid of this as well this is what the
script looks like you'll notice that it
just takes all the colliders in a
certain range and certain radius and
adds an explosive power to them and that
solid does and then it just makes a more
blob so I'll save this and it's my box
physics script and that's basically what
we want for now so that's going to make
my boxes blow up watch I'll actually
show you what happens so if I click on
cube one add box physics what I'll do is
set the radius something like 100 and
set that's ten thousand years something
ridiculous when I apply this to my box
it won't do anything because I'd set
myself is on its own function so what
we're going to do here is I've just said
to a function start so as soon as the
script loads or their work will play the
scene and you're not it's the blow up as
soon as the actual scene starts so
there's just the basic script of that
right so I'm going to create another
script and this is going to control what
our main comes do how we disable some
scripts and the basic stuff we're going
to create for a cutscene so we're going
to call this camera switch and keep
these named as I've named them just so
you can follow along because you were
going to need to reference them in the
script
so if you notice now what we've got will
delete these two out we'll say when it's
set to variable so we'll say camera 1
and we'll set that as type camera and
then what's create another variable
called camera 2 and set that as type
camera and then what I'm going to do is
create private variable called box
physics I can spell physics right and
then set that to type box physics but to
make this differentiate from the actual
variable name we'll just have that as a
lowercase and then what we're going to
write is even a right function start now
we're going to two curly brackets on
what we're going to say is that game
object with two capitals dot find and
then we're going to find the first
person controller as its spell in unity
so if we go back into unity and you see
the first person controller you'll see
it there with spaces in and then we'll
said don't get component in brackets FPS
input controller dot enabled equals
false so if you save that what that
means is at the star it'll find the game
object called first person control and
they'll find something called input fps
input controller and that's what lets
you use you and keys to actually control
so if that's as false you won't be able
to control it and you'll be able to do
anything then what I want to do is copy
this same line or paste it in and then
what want to do is find the game object
called graphics and in unity the
graphics is this and it's the capsule
Collider or whatever you use in as you
Umesh and we don't want that to show so
we're going to get rid of the mesh
renderer so we're going to say get
component
mesh renderer done that done able the
equals false and then we're going to
actually reference our two cameras so
camera one dot camera dot enabled equals
false so whatever we set is the main
camera or whatever we set to camera one
will actually be disabled and we'll put
camera two dot camera that enabled the
equals true so whatever we put in that
variable slot that will be enabled and
for now that'll be okay that's what
we'll do is we'll go on the main camera
on will put camera switch on there we
see we've got two spaces if we put me in
Cameron come board and that on camera
two
you'll notice that when I play my game
yep my box is explored run camera two
eyes we were before but you'll notice
that we don't have the FPS controller in
the scene anymore so you'll notice that
if I go on the first-person controller
the FPS input is been rid of the
graphics the mesh renderer is gone and
then it'll have changed our controller
as well so if we go off play so that's
that's nice as it is now but one what to
do is actually do something with the
camera to so it actually works as a
cutscene so we'll go window will go
animation and we'll say that we
recording your animation by clicking up
and then we'll click well name this is
camera zoom too what I'll do is click on
transform so selects all of them add a
keyframe at the top go across to about a
second what I'll do is then grab my
camera make it go towards my boxes
so I can see in the look view and then
we scrub back and notice it flies
towards my boxes not so careful now so
that animation is now on camera - we
want to unpick play automatically
because we don't want it to play
automatically we'll go back into our
camera strips and switch script and then
we'll say camera 2 dot animation dot
play and then we'll put close the
brackets and pop semicolon and then what
we're doing is making that actual
animation player when we start so if we
do without you'll notice that my camera
zooms in and then exploits what we're
going we're going to sort this out so
what we're going to need to do is
actually reference the function here so
I'll change this function back to
explode so we're going to want to make
this active it only when we actually
have zoomed in on waited a period of
time so as I added a private variable P
R for box physics we're going to say at
the bottom we're going to set box
physics equals game object dot find and
we added it to cube one and then we'll
say get component the bracket and set it
to capital box physics so box physics is
the variable here then the script is
actual box physics so we're setting it
to that or finding this and then what
we'll do is then after we've done the at
the camera animation will say yield
we're four seconds and then we'll put
two seconds something like that so we're
going to wait two seconds then we're
going to call a new function called move
boxes and under here I'm going to say
function move boxes then we add our two
curly brackets and say box physics dot
explored so what we're doing is we're
just calling the other function in the
other script so I'll mean in our other
script if we go to our o the script or
sit in here we'll see that when x blood
is called it will do the explosion and
what we are in touch to do is give the
control back to the other script when
we've done so what I want to do is I'm
going to create another function called
go back because it has a problem when
you call back to a function when you've
written a yield doesn't like it so what
we'll do is if we create a new function
here so when we get to here I'll just
run to this function and say say yield
we're four seconds I'll explain all this
at the end so make sense when we wait
three seconds then we'll say what one
says so we need to add a new variable so
private variable camera script I'll set
this to camera camera switch oops come
from a switch because like we did here
as box physics set to box physics and we
ask it to find the component we're doing
it in this script now so we can go
backwards and then we'll say when
explored is called we'll say camera
script equals game object like before
dot find and then we'll find main camera
so it's attached the main camp
get component come switch like here and
we'll close that almost say we'll find
that component so when we go if we go
back to this function that cut goes back
to our camera scriptable say but we'll
say is camera script dot and what we'll
do is call this min camera switch
because we're going to actually go to a
function in our other script so if we go
here and then what we'll do is we'll
make another function we'll call it min
camera switch will add the curly
brackets and then what we'll do is we'll
copy these two lines pass them in set
this one to true and this one to false
and then what we'll say was we'll add
find these again I'm also first-person
trail it will set up to true and then
we'll set this to true or save that out
if we go back into unity and I got an
arrow so you make sure that you remember
that the variable needs a semicolon at
the end sometimes forget and what will
happen is we'll play the scene so it
seems in towards it where it's a few
seconds things fall where it's a few
seconds more and then we give control
back to the player so you can play as
you would before so that may have been
quite confusing and quite daunting but
I'll go through again so really all
we've got is we've got the box is in the
scene we've got one of the boxes and
it's named cube or we've got box physics
script attached to that we've got one
main camera and we've got cameras which
attach to that so if I go back into
camera switch you'll notice that what
two variables camera one camera two
satis camera all we're doing is on the
start we're finding the components that
we need so we find on the first person
trawler the FPS the FPS input control we
disable it we find the graphics game
object and we disable the mesh renderer
we've added the main camera on camera -
we set main camera at first to false and
then the second camera the true so we
can play that we play its animation that
we made and then we wait an amount of
seconds so wait two seconds after it's
done now and then we call the function
move boxes and what move boxes does is
that it goes to the variable that we set
which was box physics or box physics is
this script and we call the function
which is explored and there is explored
and when we go to explode you'll see
you'll see that we're actually doing the
script which makes the boxes blow up and
we call function go back and go back we
made here and we wait three seconds
before the the camera script that we set
up here and is called as cameras switch
and we found that by finding the main
camera component getting that component
we wanted and we're calling the function
again which is in our other script down
here and so after waiting three seconds
it goes to this function it gives and
the main camera true so it enables it
again it turns our other camera off and
it actually gives us control of the
player by setting it to true and turning
the graphics back on so we can actually
see the player if we need to so
realistically basically as I said before
the camera zooms in as soon as it plays
wait two seconds the berm cubes blower
goes back to our other function and now
we have control back of the player so
you had two cutscene whatever you wanted
so in actual fact in your box physics
say that this was say you call this
explode you could do anything here you
can do anything you wanted you could
another animation plane you could create
an explosion you could create a zoom in
on the characters first any anything you
want anything you need to do this is
just a basic of the main points are
actually disabling the FPS input
controller the graphics and choosing
what camera you want to use and then
doing it like that and if you need any
more help on this subject please let me
know and I'll try and you know make it
more of any easy option but give it a go
and tell me what you think so that's
pretty much it
