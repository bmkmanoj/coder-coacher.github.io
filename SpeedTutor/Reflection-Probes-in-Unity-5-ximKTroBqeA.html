tutorial and this is going to be talking
about all showing you how to use
reflection probes within unity itself
unity 5 introduced reflection probes in
the you know the beta in the newest
release and even if I use to have to
back out a cube but based on your camera
and it do a similar sort of thing but
this is more built-in with the global
illumination everything and is built-in
with the physically based shader and
things like that now what I'm showing
you here is nothing really exciting
going on I've got a cowl model that I
mail awhile ago now my material is if
you see the our video the diffusers just
read the metallic is all the way down at
zero and the smoothness is all the way
up to one because a reflective material
are a material that will actually have
some shine or reflectivity will need to
be reflected because if I move that in
the middle you can see that it has some
sort of specularity to it now if we set
that all the way to one it's ready to
prepared to use for a reflection probe
because something like a carp in shader
or a window or glass something like that
which is going to have which is going to
be shiny and is going to actually
reflect all the sky is going to reflect
on things now this is just an example so
it's not the best way to do everything
now what you can do now is go game
object light and then add reflection
probe now you can see my reflection
probe has already been added to my scene
over my vehicle and you can see the
preview in down here but what I need to
do is I don't want it to be baked
because if this car is going to move
then it's going to be no use to us
because if it bakes the reflection once
it moves it's not going to follow the
sort of sky and be realistic so if we
set that to real-time you'll notice that
you'll see the preview here and you can
see that it just makes a dome of the
entire scene what I'll do is I'll bring
the entire reflection probe up so it's
the top of the vehicle and you can see
that the reflect the reflectivity
are from the sky box actually changes
and you can see that now we can see the
very top of the vehicle and all the sky
box in there what we can do is the
Refresh mode is currently on awake so
when we play the game it will build out
the reflectivity or activate the
reflection blog but on it but the
reflection will be only built out once
you run the game now if we set this the
Refresh mode to every frame or by a
scripting we're going to say every frame
so every frame that you have in your
game and if it's 30 frames a second it's
going to be built out every you know 30
times a second now we can set it by our
scripting if we want to do this slightly
differently we don't want every frame we
want to every other frame and so on and
so on we can do that we want the slicing
to be alpha is at 1 we can set the
importance so if we want this reflection
probe to be rendered more importantly
than other things or other reflection
probes is is going to be our MIT and
vehicle and again we want to make sure
that that's got the most important so
you can set the value accordingly we can
change the intensity so it'll just blow
out your car and the reflectivity there
so we want to keep it to a moderate
amount we can change the size of the
reflection prop based on you know how we
want it to be portrayed in our scene so
we need it to encapsulate the vehicle
for this we could could actually attach
this reflection probe to our vehicle if
it moved around and we'd always get the
real-time reflections on it no matter
where it actually went in the scene we
can set its resolution to something
higher if we're needed to so a thousand
25 just sharpen up the resolution all
the reflections on it and you can just
set you can set the clipping planes and
search down so it doesn't render as far
if you don't need it to because it just
acts as like a camera in selecting all
the things from the scene and putting it
into sort of worn spherical map as you
would see for sort of visualization
renderings and things especially for
vehicles and such what you can do is
once you've got all that set up and
ready to go if you press you know you
can test you get
and you'll see that you'll notice that
reflectivity of the sky and such will be
on your vehicle and on the car pen and
it will cause it updates in real-time it
will follow wherever I move it will
update accordingly because it's always
updating if we had a moving sky it would
update so the reflections would move as
the vehicle moves and such so the things
that you've got to remember are the
reflection properties to be big enough
to encapsulate the area that you want it
to be in needs to be above the object
that we're using and wanting you need to
make sure that material on the object
has enough smoothness or reflective it's
so if we take this down to 1/2 where you
won't get any or you might get a very
small amount of reflectivity and that's
not very realistic because if it was a
really nice shiny car we'd want to see
the reflections of the sky and such on
them so you can obviously adjust the
parameters within your reflection probe
and obviously a real-time reflection
probe refreshed
every frame is going to be taxing if you
had a lot of them but obviously if
you're making a PC application and such
it might add a little bit more realism
to your scene but you've got to just
make sure you look out for those things
and you can make something and
moderately realistic
obviously this isn't the best way as I
said to do it but it can add a little
bit of more realism to your scene
especially if maybe you're doing some a
car game or something that has a lot of
shiny materials so thanks again for
watching and don't forget to Like
