age-old question today of you know what
PC spec are what hardware is required to
make video games now it's a very
open-ended question if you've ever seen
somebody so I've discussed this topic
before it's one aware there's not one
simple answer it's very much dependent
on what type of game you're trying to
create so if you imagine if you're
trying to create a 2-d game you're going
to be a sort of optimizing to hit mobile
platforms and most mobile platforms will
never hit the sort of core quality of
desktop platforms or console quality and
then they should go from more higher-end
3d again then you're going to need more
hardware now if you can see the system
requirements here for the Unity 2017
point one this is very much sort of
recommended and the very vague
specifications for using unity and all
it does is required you know just
regular Windows seven onwards it
requires a graphics card with Derek's
DirectX 9 or later and most modern even
a lot of older cards support DirectX 11
and above and it's really just dependent
on what you're trying to make and the
differences between let's say unity and
unreal is unreal engine suggests similar
it selects minimum of eight gigabytes of
RAM and a DirectX 11 compatible graphics
card are above and a quad core CPU with
2.5 gigahertz off faster so most of the
time when I've done development I had I
still got a a laptop with just a pretty
much it's an i5 laptop which is not a
fantastic laptop and it hasn't got any
GPU and for the most part when
developing even doing some 3d work on
unity and things like that
it will handle it just fine if you go in
and you know stepping into more and more
visual quality then it will start to
struggle and without the GPU and the
extra power that it will you know you'll
get artifacting
get black areas you'll get really weird
stuff but if you just day-to-day
environment whether it's 2d whether it
is just pure coding a laptop with no GPU
just running from the CPU on the Intel
on the sort of integrated chip will be
absolutely fine so you've got to imagine
if you're on a 2d DM you can quite
easily use a laptop use a low-end laptop
even you know spread that out and you
could move into some 3d applications if
you're using a program such as Unreal
Engine Award probably sway more towards
a higher-end laptop or a desktop PC with
you know as we said at least eight
gigabytes of RAM a quad core and most I
v i7 CPUs will be pretty good and then
add a graphics card a gtx 1050 or above
are equivalent to the standards and
unity you can go for similar sort of
platform but for the most part you don't
see a lot of card games pushing out the
sort of graphic side so for me for
myself I have a high spec PC for
development but of course you don't
really need that it just depends you got
to sit down with yourself and decide
what type of game you're looking to
Korea because you've got to remember the
more polygons the more lighting the more
scripts the more material so not
everything urg again the more that's
going to tax your hardware and the
engine itself so you'll need hardware to
accompany with that so at the end of the
day the better the hardware and you know
the better that everything is could have
run and the better it is for you day in
day out but there's not one set rule to
say that you need a super high-end PC
for everything that you do I like having
and read on multiple monitors and a hand
PC then I can you know get max the
settings out and go as far as I need to
without you know needing to sacrifice
any sort of elements of quality so maybe
some tips to look out for is that you
can use websites like PC part picker and
you can look at people's completed
builds and you can have a look at a
price range I know this is in the sort
of UK pricing but you can have a look at
see what other people have made for a
particular
nice and you want to maybe look out for
a sort of a higher end maybe you could
go for an old GTX CAD like the 900
series look out for a public and i5
processor or above and minimum of a
public 8 gig about 4 to 8 gigabytes of
RAM depending on what you're trying to
do and and it's not really there's not
really anything many other major points
to look out for so hopefully this little
discussion helps you sort of decide that
decide what you might want to look to do
in the future so thanks so much for
