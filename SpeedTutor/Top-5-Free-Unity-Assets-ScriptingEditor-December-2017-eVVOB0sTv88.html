scripting sort of slash editor
extensions for December 2017 there
wasn't a as big a selection as normal so
I thought I just condensed these two
into one video so number one is we've
got object editor and this is a quite a
cool little asset and it lets you
actually take an object within 3d bring
it into unity and you don't have to then
open up a modeling program again you can
select the vertexes and actually
manipulate around it just as you can see
in the video below so you can pull the
little nodes around the object select
and deform the mesh as you wouldn't a 3d
program I think this is probably one
really helpful if you're looking to just
you know make so in just meant to your
model inside of unity and number two is
something called spline mesh as it
really suggests is it's a spline sort of
mesh behavior which allows you to create
curved content in real time so you just
add a component the generic curve
component and you can have 2d shape
extrusion it's got all really nice
little editor you can see with a little
video down here where you can adjust the
sort of Bezier curves just like it would
in a 3d program and then you'll be able
to create your curve as you want and it
allows you to do it directly into the
editor and without any extra legwork
altogether and number three is the heli
sim pack and it's an easy to use
helicopter simulation and it's as simple
as adding just a simple script to the
helicopter you've got as you can see in
the video below you use the default
simulation you can tune the parameters
accordingly and you can have
acceleration the four axis two flight
controls and I think the developers
added a lot more features as it's gone
along so you've got an awful lot of
functionality in this sort of basic
controller and it's free so what can you
say for that and before is an asset
called surge beginners and professional
users which is an essential essential
tools which you'll find in unity and
it's a collection of free tools just to
make unity development easier and it's
from people who have know what two is to
make a game people from the Triple A
games industry so you've got the
developer I think was somebody who made
eight
which is the animation system on the
asset store that you could buy it's got
that included it's got singleton
functionality
it's got spline functionality and it has
a lot of just a lot of little integrated
systems to make your life a lot easier
for just controlling the content
creating splines for moving objects
Singleton's for controlling how many and
you know again monitors you make me seen
lots of different functionality all in
one package and the last one is called
super pivot free modifier and this
allows you to take a group of game
objects essentially and adjust the pivot
accordingly because in unity don't have
a great deal of flexibility on where the
actual pivot point will be and sometimes
you might have a pivot somewhere else
and it might not be very worthwhile but
this allows you to move the pivot around
easily and this allows you to take an
empty game object which you'll often
organize your sort of game objects with
and allow you to adjust the pivot point
so you can put it directly in the center
on the underneath at the top depending
on how you want to actually place your
things and it's just got a simple UI
with a button for you to redefine where
you want to position it I will leave a
link in the description so you can check
all these out so thanks very much for
watching Dhafir gets a light go and
subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
