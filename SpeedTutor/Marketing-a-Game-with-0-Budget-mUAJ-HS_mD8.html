today and this is going to be talking
about the best ways that you can
advertise your and again when you really
don't have a lot of money to spend on
blowing on a lot of advertising and
things like that not really that you
need to and all of these things that I'm
going to mention or even that biggest
secrets is just some pointers to think
about that when you come to release you
want to just have an idea in your mind
if I give you some examples from what
I've done in the past and things how you
can do it even better you can use sites
like gamejolt and you can make yourself
a page you can start the page going even
before you release you can put
screenshots on there you can put your
own and heading and you get the ball
rolling in advance you can keep a little
miniature devlog to update on what
you're doing and you build up followers
as the time goes on and then eventually
when you come towards release you can
release the game people will be able to
comment and give you an pointers tips
you can even release demos and things
like on this platform and it's a really
nice way just to it quite easily build
up a small following for your game and
get some sort of feedback on what they
think there's a similar site as gamejolt
called it geo which can you can do a
similar style of thing whether you can
you can put your game up for free or you
can sell it in the end and it will also
be another platform for you to possibly
get a bigger audience because people
from YouTube come to game Joel and it's
you have to try and find new games that
they might be interesting and playing so
it's always good to look at your
different options available to just up
and adding some sort of information on
the web about your games I know this is
just a picture of my youtube but this is
another thing you can create your own
company YouTube channel something like
that or something for your game
specifically and you can upload little
bite-sized little teaser trailers
trailers and other things like that so
you give people an area where they can
come and visit and actually just you
know look everything that you've got
here and that's somewhere where they can
interact with you on another medium just
with a big thing about YouTube you can
when you come towards release if you
need to build up a following and get
some more interesting again you can find
a lot of different youtubers who might
be interested
you contact them in advance or you
contact them before maybe you have a
demo that you can give them to build up
to interest in your game or like I say
when you come to release people can play
and I've just searched my game left
alone you can see that a various amount
of different youtubers have actually
played the game this is a good way to
even if directly people don't watch
these youtubers to actually gain
recommendation on playing a game good
might you might get a certain amount of
people who have actually gone take upon
to actually buy your game in general
another fantastic way to do it is like I
just said about you know creating your
own YouTube you could create your own um
Facebook page and do the exact same
thing you upload screenshots your blood
videos gifts anything like that to drive
users to your stuff share it with your
friends get them to share it all those
types of things you can join group so if
you type into Facebook indie game
developers you can get a whole host of
different groups that associated with
whether it's unity unreal indie games at
a biggest group that I found is the
indie game developers group with about
87 at the current 87,000 members and
they do a screenshot Saturday so you can
share new information on a Saturday you
can ask discussion and development
questions you can do anything like that
and there's a whole host of other groups
where you could deserve showing a show
and sort of test group and you can just
post things up now again and then you
will get more and more following and you
build up as time goes on
similarly with Facebook or yourself a
Twitter account built itself a following
here the things that work best on
Twitter are things like gifts videos you
know nice presented screenshots anything
like that and make sure you use a lot of
different hashtags so if you're using
unity you say write hashtag mailing
unity hashtag indie dev anything like
that big key point that hashtag it up
and then you might get the retweets from
the box so that people might see it
gather a following but you have to be
consistent about everything that you do
make sure that you're tweeting a lot of
the time I mean that I'm criminal for
not doing it in the fair where it's
speed cute or anything like that make
sure you're posting new screenshots
about you development anything like that
because people are always interesting
seeing new and interesting things
especially if you're looking
to get your game out there tore the peep
up similarly with all the other things
that I've mentioned is you can create
yourself on your own website specific to
your game your company whatever it might
be and you can use it as a way to blog
different things just like I mentioned
in everything else because the
screenshots posted videos have a little
development log where you write about
the things that go on and you know
eventually be put into Google
automatically and people might end up
search and you can post on things like
Reddit anything like that to just drive
up excitement and some viewers for your
game you could even look into doing
things like Kickstarter if you're
looking to drive a big project that you
want to take and maybe hire more people
make it bigger if you think you've got a
really good idea you can even create
things like a press kit for your website
and people can download that with images
screenshots any information that they
might meet without having to first
contact you and one of the last things
that I'm going to mention is if you
choose to release our guts for a release
on Steam you could when with the
inclusion of steam direct now from the
movement away from greenlight and you
can just release your game instantly it
appears on the star they want you to
leave it up on the star for a period of
time in coming soon and you can see this
is the upcoming section and you can see
that all these games that up here this
current time say that when they're
actually available so these are
available in August and you can check
down and this helps you build up a
following because people you know
millions of people use steam every day
so people might be interested in looking
to see what's coming up filter by a
particular type of gaming a co-op game a
single-player game what type of game
they might like to have achievements
anything like that and you can filter by
other things that you might be looking
for so just remember the key points are
advertised you go in there's many
different men social media platforms as
you can create accounts for all of these
if you've got any screenshots or videos
post them literally everywhere that
you've got put your little hashtags in
but it's just important to be very
consistent and you want to share it go
ahead and share it in all the different
areas that you can if you've got
questions you can ask them in the
Facebook groups you can even you can
take a look at things like
joining a discard unity related are
games related things you can take a look
just searching google and you can find
big actual discard channels available
for all people of various walks of
development whether it's for is a 3d
games unity anything like that and this
one is one of the bigger unity ones and
it's got thousands of actual members
that have already
I sort of powered this this actual disc
garden you can ask for questions you can
advertise anything that you want be
consistent make sure you screenshots and
videos are professional and then you'll
go a long way interpretation your game
to make people really interested so
hopefully these tips give you some
information on how best to get around
advertising your game so thanks very
