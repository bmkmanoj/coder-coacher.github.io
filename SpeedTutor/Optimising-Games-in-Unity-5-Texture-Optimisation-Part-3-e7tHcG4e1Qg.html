unity 5 this is gonna be part 3 and I'm
going to be showing you how to optimize
good things are get the best out of
textures within your games no it's not
really doesn't have to be specific to
unity 5 but we'll go into things that
are specifically to do with unity but
good practice is to remember to hold is
it really got to think about what sort
of asset you're going to create if you
take this for example this is a thousand
24 by 1024 there UV layout with my
texture on it and this is for a
cardboard box now seeing as though this
isn't really a main asset it it doesn't
need to be that higher resolution but
seen as that I might end up duplicating
this a lot it's good to have a nice
resolution it's always good to go a
better resolution and then you can scale
it down afterwards because it's not good
to start say at 512 and then scale up
you're gonna lose some quality there so
if anything make it bigger than you need
to then you can scale it down and do
some optimization in unity and I will
show you that in a bit now I'll give you
an example of the sort of resolution
difference between certain textures now
here I've got a little sort of document
which is sized at 2048 by 2048
because it's good to keep your very
important to keep your texture size
within these boundaries so 2048 1024 512
by 512 256 by 256 128 64 and so on
because you need to be in those
increments for the game engine to be
able to understand it easy enough
now you can go higher than that but if
you start with going probably above 2048
it's gonna become rather large file
sizes and what I would say that I was
only recommend to use 2048 is if say
you've got very large textures which are
going to be duplicated Allah ie things
like walls or floors or ceilings that
you might have over and over repeated
but like I said if even if you didn't
make it 2048 you could scale it down in
Photoshop or whatever photo manipulation
program you're using or you can scale it
down in unity but remember it'll have a
larger file size on disk say a 2048
might be 10 megabytes 2024 might be a
few megabytes 512 lower and then much
lower from there but these are the
resolutions that you should stick to I
think a regular asset it's good to have
a thousand 24 and then you can as I said
you can scale it down for an asset that
you might not see all will be very small
have it as 512 or lower but it's just
some sort of things recommendations to
stick to one thing that you can do is
say I make a new canvas and I make a
2048 canvas for instance this was just
an example we can make something called
a texture Atlas so if I just quickly
merge these layers here and then just
copy this you will see that I have one
texture for this corner so this one text
you could be for one of my boxes I could
duplicate this and put another texture
at this side another texture at this
side and another texture here so 1,024
mix up 2048 because if you see my
example you can see that you can fit
four thousand 24 textures into a 2048
and similarly with 512 and 1024 and say
imagine all these four of edek are all
different textures this one could be for
a barrel this one could be for a
cardboard box this couldn't be for I
don't know a television set and then
this one could be for a shelving unit
and say you've got all these on one
texture and it's four different assets
sharing the same texture that's going to
be a lot more optimized than say four
different text just saved out for one
particular object it just depends how
you want to do it if they're not very
important objects you could start a
thousand 24 document put four textures
into it and then you will save yourself
some optimization it really depends what
quality of assets you're trying to make
and what resolution you
going fall and like I said if you've got
a hair or a set or something a wall
ceiling the floor 2,048 good one thing
to remember is if you are then serving
out your asset are saving out your
texture so that this is a PSD or
whatever document it might be if it's
got layers it'll probably end up being
quite a large file size maybe 30
megabytes something like that if I give
you the example I brought something into
my unity scene a different cardboard box
that I've made now I've got one 1024
diffuse map here and if I open that up
with where it's actually saved you can
see it's a PSD and that's nearly 20
megabytes that's too much we don't need
it that big so what I could do is in
turn open it up in Photoshop
on white chef program will save out and
then I will drop down and I will save
out as a tag because that's usually good
file formats Xero will save that map out
as a tagger and you want to make sure
that it's 24-bit pixel if you're just
using kinda normal texture and then when
we click on it now a lot Bunny only
three megabytes and it won't have lost
that much resolution but it'll be
exactly the same one thing that's good
about unity is I will delete that so we
can see which one is the right one is
that it will automatically compress all
textures that are brought in so even
though that was three megabytes in its
file size it will compress it to not
point seven megabytes due to its
compressed format that it brings in so
if I give you an example here and we
choose this material and I just apply
the diffuse back to it and I zoom in a
little bit you can see that this now if
we click on the imported texture you can
see this 1024 by 1024 but unit is now
max size has defaulted at at 2048 now
there's no point it being that big if we
knock that down to two thousand five
thousand twenty four and press apply I
didn't even see I didn't even see a
noticeable difference if I even take
that down to 512
and press apply it may well have lost a
little bit of quality if we take it back
it sharpened up slightly but say we take
it down to 512 you can see that it's
reduced the overall or increasingly a
compression it's only 170 kilobytes so
it's less than a megabyte we can even
take that down further 256 and yes now
it starts looking a bit blurry and
that's probably not what you want but
it's really dependent on what type of
asset or item you make if it's large
like this and I will see it up close
it's a bit too shiny you want it to have
some resolution but if it's only this
small and it's really tiny
there's no point it been compressed at
such a large file size because you're
never going to be able to see the detail
in it so say it was that small we can
compress that to say a 128 and you then
press play look at your object and you
probably wouldn't even notice a
difference yes you may notice a little
bit of difference but it's just some
ideas to keep in mind and I will go into
this more thoroughly when we are going
to important actual models with
collisions and things like that and
getting your optimization of that but
this was just a few things to mention
about textures specifically so good
texture sizes 1024 lower for normal
assets anything that's a really detailed
asset or something very repeated you can
have a larger texture you can create
texture atlases which have multiple
different textures on one texture sheet
and make sure you make your textures
bigger than they need to because you can
always compress them down afterwards
then remember to give them a good file
size file type so don't save them out as
PSD if you've got a lot of layers
because it will be ridiculously file
sized save them as a Targa and when you
bring into unity you can select that
model or text you brought in and you can
compress it however you want and
depending on what type of asset you've
got so hopefully this helped
people get some sort of ideas and
clarification if you needed it on
textures and working with that within
your game engine so thanks very much for
