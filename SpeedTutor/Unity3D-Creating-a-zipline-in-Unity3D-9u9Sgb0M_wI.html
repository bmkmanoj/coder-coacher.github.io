and this is gonna be about showing you
how to make a zipline now I got the ask
this quite a long time ago now when I
actually first created this channel and
also you know wanted to make it myself
because it was one of those things that
I thought I've seen in a lot of games
and I wanted to try and achieve it so I
spent a little bit of today just this
morning you know working on something to
make it work for everybody so this as
ever I said they've always pretty basic
and you know you can change these ideas
however you like but I'll just show you
the basis of what and the core elements
are so if you imagine and you look at my
scene I've got a first burst controller
I've got my test scene I've got I've
just got a box so you can stand them to
begin with now what I've got here is
I've got another box in front but I've
made sure that the collider is much
bigger so I've just increased the Y
value so the collider goes all the way
up so when you stand in it you'll
obviously be able to activate the
zipline or whatever you like to do and
I've made sure that that is trigger is
ticked so you know when we walk inside
we can actually detect when we've walked
into it now this cube here that cube and
this line a rather redundant in a sense
that they're on it for a visual lock
because we're not gonna you know grab
any hands on and slide down we're just
gonna basically use the fpf controller
and change the position over a period of
time so I've also got another box at the
bottom which you'll need to create which
is just called my end point and
obviously you can actually hide this
because you don't actually need it to be
there it's just we want to tell the
player where we want to end so as long
as you've got the first burst control at
a collider which we can walk into and
then the end point then we'll start
writing the script so first of all what
we can do is create a new script create
a new JavaScript file and call this zip
line
then what we'll do is open them on a
develop and once this is up and I'll
zoom in a little bit and what do you'll
notice something monodevelop might look
different this time is because I've
changed the syntax layout so we actually
get more contrast so when you're looking
at my videos you can actually see what's
going on more easily so first of all
what we're going to do is delete the two
functions and write variable and powers
of n position as type transform and
after that as the semicolon and then
we're going to write our own function
called use zipline and then we're going
to add two curly brackets below and then
at a used vehicle time as type flow set
equal to five variable elapsed time as
type float equal to zero variable
starting pause as type vector 3 equals
transform dot position with a semicolon
and all these is going to do is we're
setting the a time value to 5 we're
setting a time which when a elapsed over
a period of time to zero and we're
setting our starting position whatever
our transform position is so fairly
simple to start with then we're going to
write while open brackets elapsed time
is less than what time is equal to and
we'll close up and add two curly
brackets below and then we'll say
transform dot position equals vector 3
dot lerp open brackets starting boobs
make sure that's logo starting
pause comma end pause
dot position
, open brackets elapsed time / time
close-up the two brackets and put a
semicolon then we're gonna say elapsed
time + M + equals time dot Delta time
and then we're gonna write year yield
with the semicolon so I'll quickly go
through what this means so what we're
doing is while the elapsed time is less
than time so while elapsed time is equal
to zero so it's below the 5 we'll
actually be able to do the movement of
the position so what we're actually
doing is elapsed time is counting up
every second or so every frame which
means that it'll eventually get to the
value that we want but for every portion
of time that were still sat counting up
then we're going to change our position
vector and lerp means it'll move
gradually from the starting position to
the end position over the time of which
elapsed time is divided by that amount
of time so really it just takes the two
values and as long as times as long as
the elapsed time is still below it
we'll move to the end position so
obviously what you can do is you can go
to first person controller and add the
zip line script then what we want to do
is add our end point to the inspector
there and then what we wouldn't need to
do is actually make sure that we can
actually activate this so we'll create
another JavaScript and call this
activate zip line and once that's open
in monodevelop what we'll do is write
private variable zip line script as type
zip line with a semicolon then also
function start up and back it up in the
two brackets and say that zip line
script
is equal to game object dot find open
brackets add quarts first-person
controller close that up get components
open brackets zip line close that up and
then under there we'll save that
function on trigger enter open brackets
call call on Collider and then we'll add
the two curly brackets below if Carl
don't game object dot tag is equal to
player close that up then we'll add two
curly brackets below now what want to do
is create another variable so create
private variable can zip for instance
and have that boolean equal to false and
then what we'll do here is that if we
have gone inside the collider with the
player will say that can zip is equal to
can zip with a semicolon and will write
a lot of function below here say
function update what we'll do is roll
right if can zip and and input dot get
key down up and brackets quartz F close
that up then what we'll do is we will be
able to do zip line script dot use zip
line two brackets and a semicolon
what branch to change this to is if can
zip is equal to true so here I just
wanted to make sure that everybody
understood that so once in the update
function and that is set to true we'll
say if it's true and we press F we'll be
able to call the other function which is
you zip line so what we'll do is if we
go into our game
make sure that the script is on the
collider that you want to walk into
press play what we'll do is you can see
my little D book because they added
something a bomb it's currently equal to
false if we walk into the collider it
sets it to true then if we press F
you'll see that you position starts
moving towards the block at the end and
obviously wasn't perfect you might want
to move this block slightly further down
but for the sake of you know just a
simple zip line it works very well what
you can also do is in your zip line
script if you wanted things to move
faster or slower so say I add timed as
equal to two and save that what I could
do is actually do it in the editor if
you made them all public but now if I
play it and walk into the collider and
press F will move a lot quicker because
we don't have as much time to go in
between so obviously you can adjust that
accordingly how quickly you want to go
so obviously the bigger the value the
slower that you will go because the
further you've got to travel in terms of
the smooth speed so that's pretty much
it for the tutorial on how to create
yourself a simple zip line so as ever
