tutorial about creating a sort of
lightning flash in unity 3d and you can
use this for anything really you know if
you want to see Muller lighting if you
want to do a shocking again if you want
to surprise the player with something
it'd be a good way to do something maybe
add some sound-effects with it so first
of all what we would want go missing is
I've got first best controller my scene
I am actually got anything called light
so we'll get rid of that so it doesn't
confuse anybody I've got one directional
light but I've turned this off if I turn
it on now you can see my son at my seem
like something some shadows but for now
I'll just pretend that I've got the airy
sky so it looks maybe a little bit film
degree so um that's all I've got nothing
major nothing exciting it's what we're
gonna do first of all gonna create
JavaScript and we're gonna call that
lightning flash we're gonna do open up
with that in monodevelop we're do is
create three new variables one bow of
all called min time and set that to not
0.5 I'm gonna say variable rash hold
which equals not 0.5 as well I know I'm
gonna make a new variable called my
light and set that to a time light not
lightning and then I'll add one private
variable called last time and set that
equal to zero so in the update function
what we're going to do is write if two
brackets time dot time - last time close
the bracket is greater than min time
close the brackets then under there
we're going to say if random dot value
is greater than
threshold then we're gonna say light dot
in air-balled
is equal to true then we're going to say
else light dot enabled equals false and
then we're gonna say last time is equal
to time dot time we'll save that out
then what we'll do is go back into unity
and what we'll do on our directional
light will add the lightning flash and
then I like the directional light to be
my light slot and then when we play the
game what it's gonna do
it's actually every so often based on
our min and threshold mounts I'll do a
flash by turning the actual directional
light on and off and then you could set
this and make it only activate when
you've got a trigger and make it last a
certain period of time but that's all
that's really simple and if you liked
the tutorial don't forget to Like
