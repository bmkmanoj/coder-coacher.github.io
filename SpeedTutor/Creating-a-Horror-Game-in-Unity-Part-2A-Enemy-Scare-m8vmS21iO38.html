my horror game series and in part 1 what
we did we created something which was
almost like an insanity meter or
something like that so if you walk into
a Collider it makes you go a slightly
more insane so then you see more sort of
blurring or you know dizziness which is
created with the motion blur asset from
unity Pro now people a lot of people ask
me about this and I thought I'd cover it
this is only gonna be a short video and
it's going to be about actually so when
you actually see an enemy it makes that
effect happen without walk into
colliders so then it's more realistic in
terms of a horror game and so this is as
I said part two and I'm gonna go on to
show you making a level making some
enemies and doing some crazy things like
that so to start off with what we're
gonna do is if you've seen my other
tutorial you should have these assets
now I had an asset called scare that we
created and what that does that actually
you know when we walk into the collide
as I said before it will increase the
amount of blur that we see so what I'm
gonna do is just duplicate that and I'm
gonna rename it because we're gonna you
know base it off that but actually make
something slightly different so we'll
open that up in modern development and
when we've done that what we're gonna do
is we're gonna do this using a rare cast
so I did a tutorial on rare casts if you
don't know how you know these work you
can watch that and you can get a greater
understanding but I'm just gonna quickly
cover the breaker casting again so we're
gonna set variable in the update
function called forward have it
transform dark transform Direction open
brackets vector 3.4 word then we're
gonna have another variable called hit
and set that as type rare cast hit but
make sure the C's are lowercase
then what we're gonna say is if physics
dot rare cast open brackets transform
but make sure that transforms are
lowercase sometimes when I run through
this excellently do stuff like that and
then you say put a dot in it position
comma FWD for forward then comma hit
close up two brackets add two curly
brackets below and we actually then want
to say if hit dot distance is less than
or equal to ten point O and and hit dot
Collider don't get checked dot tag is
equal to then what we'll say is we'll
save the enemy so when we see the enemy
then we'll add two curly brackets below
there and so that some before we
actually write that I'll actually copy
it from here so when we entered the
collider it then changed our sanity so
then what we can do is go along and just
delete this function so we've actually
got an update so if we're you know in
the rare cast and we see the target
within the distance of ten you know you
can chain this depending what you like
or what works for your game and then we
if we look at the game object with it
she's in the distance of 10 which is
tagged to enemy then will it adjust the
actual escape centage shuttle add 20 on
every time put problem here is if we do
this on the up dale do it every second
and it met every second or every frame
which is really fast within unities
terms so what we need to do is actually
sort of adjust the time at which it's
going to count up so what we'll do is
we'll say times time dot delta time so
that's the time of which sort of in-game
time sort of per second that it happens
so it's not as crazy and obviously you
can adjust this so it's only ten for
every second that we look at the enemy
so now what we can do is save out on if
we go back in
to unity what we'll be able to do is on
the first person controller I've already
added my script and you need to make
sure that I've got a box here which is
you know very scary enemy but make sure
that it's tagged as enemy and you can a
new tag there and make sure it's tagged
enemy and what I've done is I've made
sure that the box Collider is a lot you
know a lot bigger so wherever we look at
it you know we'll see it so you know if
we were slightly above we'd still see it
and you can do that by just changing the
Y value of the box Collider now if we
look and if we'd gone near you can see
the sanity it's decreasing as time goes
on obviously if I click to blink it'll
go to zero but if I go towards the enemy
you know I'm be looking at it you'll
notice that the sanity then you know it
goes up and if we're a distance I'm not
looking at it anymore
then you know gradually go down and
we'll be able to blink to get aware and
if I show you again when we look
directly at it and we're in the distance
of it you'll notice that it goes up
again you know as I say as it normally
does and what you can do if you notice
out of any problems when you look it's
off to the side of it you can obviously
as I say increase the size of the
collider that's there so then no matter
where you look at the object you know
it's there within sort of range so that
was just the basics of creating and when
you look at an enemy it makes you your
insanity could increase more so if you
liked the tutorial don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe and make sure you
keep checking back because I'll be
making part three of my horror series
very soon Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
