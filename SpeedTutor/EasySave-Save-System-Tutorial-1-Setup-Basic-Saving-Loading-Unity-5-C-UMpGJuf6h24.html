tutorial today and I'm gonna be showing
you how to make a save system using the
easy save script on the assets star and
I'll be showing you how to save and load
some simple variables boolean's and
things like that and in further episodes
I will show you how to go about loan
saving your characters position really
loading that reloading from a main menu
and then re and loading in everything as
soon as you seen stats but what I'm
gonna do today is I'm going to show you
how to easily use the easy save complete
serve and Lord asset that's on the asset
store the person who developed this
plugin is a very helpful and will reply
to emails that you might have and will
help you pass through it so I thought
I'd do a simple thing and go through
this the simple setup of creating a
basic save system and loading within
your game in unity 5 so if you search
the unity asset store easy save it will
be 32 euros which is about 27 pounds or
35 dollars and if you if you're
interested in games development of
making games as a even a hobby a
business whatever you're looking at its
I would recommend doing this and this
price is really a drop in the ocean
compared to what you get out of it will
save you hours and hours and hours of
time messing around so what I'll do is I
won't go from the basics of it and go
into as much detail as I think we need
to cover so what I'll do is whenever you
gonna make this you want to start a new
scene and when you've done that you want
to bring in the asset that we're looking
for so you want to do that and you want
to go to asset stop and you want to go
up here to your download manager and
then we can search saving at the top and
press filter and we will get the easy
save and what you want to do is if you
haven't already download it and press
import and import this package into your
new scene now once that's imported you
can get rid of the asset stop and
there's only one thing in my
a project that I've got is I've got the
standard assets and I've got the
controllers pack which you might want to
have an FPS controller to run around I'm
just going to get rid of this link
because we don't need it for now now in
our scene there's nothing going on what
won't do is we want to save two scenes
out particularly so I'll save this scene
now as it's gonna be our level one as an
example and what I'll do is I'll serve
another scene out save scene as and save
as menu I'm gonna have two different so
we're gonna have a menu which we can
load from and then the level which we
can serve and load from depending what
we need to do so based on this in our
level one and we'll have two buttons in
our menu we'll have a button so we'll
start with a menu I'll show you
basically so what you need to do in your
menu to get something working we want to
go to game object UI and we want to
create a canvas and then it will bring
the canvas and the event system what I
like to do is create an empty game
object so I can put those two things
together so I'll put this as menu UI and
I will drop these two things in the
empty game object and they're just
encapsulating this anything now I will
click on the canvas then you can press F
in your game view and you know it will
zoom towards it or we can go to the 2d
view and we can see that this is the
canvas that we've got for the screen
that we couldn't using so whatever we
place with the UI if you familiar with
the hue is will be straightforward and
you could potentially skip this I might
put an annotation in the video but if
not we can go game object UI
and we'll create a button and you'll see
that the button there is positioned
directly in the center and what you can
do is you can leave it there but I'm
just gonna put the button at the side
here and then what I'm going to do with
the button I'll reload rename that
button I just click on it twice or
renaming at the top here is I'll just
call that load BTN I will open up the
drop-down and there'll be a text box
that we can edit so here and we'll just
rename this to load so that's all we've
got for now and
now menu you can see is if I press play
you'll notice that I've got a load
button which does nothing because we
haven't told to do anything so that's
all one I'm good that's nice for the
menu for now and we can sell its menu
because we can see up here that we're on
the menu and we can jump to level one
we're at level one now now there's
nothing in this scene now there's a few
things that were do want to do a similar
thing so we'll go UI and canvas then
I'll create another game empty game
object and call it just save load UI and
then I will put the two things that the
canvas created together and one object I
will go back on the canvas I'll go game
object UI and we will create a button
then in 2d like we still will click on
the canvas we'll have a look where we
are you can see that the buttons there
down at the bottom it doesn't really
matter where we put it we can just stick
it in the top corner roughly like that
what I'll do is I'll rename this button
save BTN o on the drop-down I will
rename this button to save also and then
what I'll do is I what you will get this
button by clicking on it I'm pressing
ctrl D and then I will just drag this
now and then what we do is we can rename
this button to load BTN then we can
change the text to load so we don't get
confused then what will do for me we'll
go off the 2d view and we'll work in our
workspace now so what I want to do is I
will create go game object 3d object and
plane so this is going to be for the
floor that we're going to use so for the
flower I'm gonna have four different
flower pieces so you can easily see
where we've moved to based on the save
system so what I'll do is I've got a
plane there is what I'm going to do is
create a material folder
and just call it materials and then in
that I'm gonna create a new material and
hold this red and I will change the
color to red duplicate that three more
times call this black we can call this
blue and then we can call this one
yellow for the sake of this and now
we're here we've got the plane selected
I will just duplicate they blend three
more times you can see that we've got
duplicates and I will just select them
and drag them out into the scene all I
need to do is select one plane press V
on the keyboard and I will can snap the
angles to the corners of the pieces that
I want so I can just snap it and now
you've got four planes together and the
reason I'm doing this is because I'm
going to add the colors themselves on
the material so I'll change that
material is black to a black albedo so
I'll drag that on I'll change the blue
to whatever blue you might want this is
just a visual representation of what
we're looking at so you can understand
it and we can add red there and we can
set yellow to yellow and maybe slightly
orangey but it doesn't really matter so
now we've got that there we've got four
different planes almost now for this I
will tidy up by having an empty game
object and call this misc for
miscellaneous items because we don't
really need to worry about it nor do we
need to worry about the directional
light really we can go into US standard
assets go characters first-person
controller prefabs and we want to drag a
FPS controller in and that's all well
and good we've got that in now and we
can get rid of the main camera because
we don't need it now if I press play you
can see that everything's fine there one
thing I'll care to mention is if you do
put your canvas in your event system
inside
a SAM to game object make sure position
is set to 0 0 0 or these scaling will be
slightly out so I can just quickly grab
these two objects and just move them up
so in our game view we can see it now
when I press play and you can see that
this save and load buttons that ready
for us to do things with and based on
our scene view I'll go back into it look
at my FPS controller everything's
looking good so far what we also want to
do is our create an empty game object
and I want to have this as an ANA
manager object because this is gonna be
something I'll set it to 0 0 0 this is
gonna be something that we're going to
use to explain how it's all going to
work I'm just gonna impart in a texture
that we're gonna use later on and I'm
just going to set this to you sprite and
hit apply and I'm just going to set it
to 512
I might provide this if people really
want it but it's nothing basic it just
says saved on it so we'll get straight
into it now because we've sort of set
everything up and everything that we
need to do so far so what we'll do to
start off with is we'll create AC sharp
script and what I'll do is we'll call
this manager script and for the sake of
this tutorial we're just going to have
this manager script as a pretend way
that we're going to control things that
we're doing our game and these are the
things that we'll want to save and I
will go through it as we go through so
you know you can open up this in
whatever editing program that you've got
for coding so what we're gonna do is in
this public class for the manager script
what we'll do is we'll have a public
integer ammo take everything here that's
just a pure example and you can do
whatever you want but this is to show
you how it all works so we've got public
ammo public integer magazines and this
an example if you're making a
first-person shooter game something like
that is a pure example we've got ammo
magazines both as public integers and
then this is an example we've got a
public boolean and we can say if we've
got a broken arm or something this is
just pure as I say we're going to be
able to look into saving integers
boolean's and saving our players
position and then going into doing other
things so once we've got our manager
script that's all we really need to do
and we can just add that to the manager
object so you can see we've got no ammo
I've gotten our magazines and
technically now we've not broken around
because we haven't take the box so what
we're gonna do now is go create C sharp
and we're gonna create the way that
we're gonna save the game and I will
explain this as we go along so I'll call
this simple save and it just telling me
to change the line endings but that's
fine problems simple save and now we're
in our simple save script we're gonna
save those things we just created in our
manager script so what do we
realistically need to do we need to have
a way to talk to this script and ask it
what this is what we need to save so
what we can do is we can add a public
game object with two capitals and have
this as a just we'll give it a name
manager script with a lowercase M and
this is going to correspond to the
script that we've got then what we'll do
is I'm going to write a public void save
to brackets then two curly brackets
below and we want to make this a public
void so then we can use it as our button
because we'll do it as a trigger as a
salt button event for the button that
we're going to use so what we can do is
we can write this as if we're going to
just declare the script that we're
trying to find
so we'll say manager script so the name
of the actual script and then we're just
going to give it a type like or a name
that we would as short-handed just like
we did up here so we're just going to
call this script and then we'll say
equal we're going to say equal to the
manager script that we created are we
referenced up here
don't forget component and then two
angled brackets and then within the
angle brackets we're going to write
manager script with a capital and then
add two brackets and a semicolon so what
we're saying here realistically it was
were just saying that the manager script
that we're looking for we're going to
get the component manager script and
then we're going to be able to just save
the values that we need so with the easy
save system that's been created this
documentation online if you need to look
into it more deeply let's say but it's
very easy and like I said it saves a lot
of time because it's all done for you
and you start by writing es2 dot save
and then we open up the brackets and
then we can start by writing like I said
that we give this a shorthand a off
script and then because we referenced
the manager script we can then take any
variable or anything we want to save and
pass it to this so we can say gamma and
then we can put a comma and then in
quotes we're gonna write in Amer and
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
do a semicolon so what this is pretty
much saying is that we're calling the
easy save so ES 2.5 and then in brackets
script dorama so we're just calling this
Emma and then we're saying that we're
gonna save it with a file name of ammo
and we're gonna say whatever value is
inside this integer into that file and
similarly with magazines we do ES 2.5
open brackets script
don't magazines from we can say coma
magazines with a semicolon
and that will realistically just save
what is ever in our magazines to a file
called magazines and yeah again to
really bury this home es2 dot save
script doll and then we can have broken
arm the scripting reference knows what
we're looking for working do comma and
then we can call this broken Oh add a
semicolon we can save that out so that's
really nice that's pretty much the base
is to saving that script and the values
in it and it will create files files
so let's put this into practice I will
go on to the Save button like I said on
here you can see that I've clicked on
the Save button in the canvas I'm going
to add simple save to it you can see
that it's looking for the manager script
I'm going to add the manager game object
to it then on the on click event in the
button I will click the little plus box
then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
add itself to the game object that it's
looking for so at runtime we are asking
what do I want it to do so from the
simple saved script we want it to call
the function save so it's as simple as
that now if you right-click any project
and you've employed easy save you can
see that you can right click and go to
settings and here are a list of settings
that you can do you can encrypt your
file you can choose where it's going to
file there save the file but it's pretty
good just set as default you can open up
the default save folder and you can see
there's nothing there in my cell folder
currently because I would not create
anything to save so you know it's that
any good but if we press play we expect
that when we click Save
you know you won't actually see anything
it's all click Save we click Save did it
do anything we can right click on our
project go easy save to settings go
tools again and we'll can open served
folder and it served three different
files one for Emma one for broken arm
one for magazines some fat in there
we've saved three different files with
the things in what you're saying well
how do we test if that works well we
need to create a really simple load
scenario so what we can do is we can
create another c-sharp file call it
simple mode and we'll do is I'll open
that up so once we've got simple load up
and we will get rid of the stuff inside
the class then and then what we'll do is
we'll do the same thing that we did
before we'll do public game object
manager script like we did before
save that for now we could do public
void load two brackets two curly
brackets below then we'll say manager
script but we want to make sure that
manager script is the capital and then
we have script equals manager script
with a lowercase don't get component
angled brackets you manage your script
with a capital two brackets and the
semicolon so like we did in the simple
save you can see that it's exactly the
same reference that were making but
we're just making it to this specific to
this function so we're not made it for
specific to the entire game then we'll
do something similar so here we did ES
2.5 and then we specified what we wanted
to save here we do script dama equals ES
to dot and then we need to angle
brackets and we're going to specify what
we're doing to load so we want to load
the integer and from that is we can
operate the brackets and then in corpse
we can say what we actually what file we
want to load from so want to load
ammo so I'll go through it we're saying
that from our referenced script were
saying we want to give it in here want
to push into this file ammo and what do
I want to do we want to easy save to
load the integer of whatever's inside
that ammo the file that we created and
similarly with the magazines script dot
magazines equals es to then in your
angle brackets George for integers
because again we're looking for a whole
number because we've got so many
magazines then in quotes we want
magazines spell correctly as you would
expect then the only difference is we've
got a boolean now that we want to load
it so cup script and then we want to
save broken amp so we want to fill
broken down with something so we said
easy easy save to load then in the angle
brackets this time just as if we're
going to declare a certain variable type
old Karla's boolean in brackets in
quartz and then Barak and arm as is
spelt in the other script so save that
that is pretty much the be-all and
end-all of that as well so we can go to
our load button add simple load to that
it's looking for the manager script or
the manager game object we update we
want an on click event so I'm gonna
click the load button I'll do something
will click the little plus box will give
the reference of itself then we'll be
able to access the scripts they're on it
will say that for the simple load we
want to call the load function so when
we do that we expect it to load the
things that we've given so as a pure
example to this let's say that on the
manager you can see there's nothing
there currently we can press play we can
run around do whatever we need to do
this is the game running now so if I
unpause this you wouldn't see any you
would see they go back to zero if I
change any of these values so say now
we've picked up to mama over 500
we've got five magazines and we've
broken an arm what do we do so from what
we did we'll click the Save button it
will have overrated all the stuff that
was saved originally in those folders
and now once I own play you'll see
there's nothing there you've got to
either say if you go to settings you can
go tools open up default said you can
see it they're all there and they were
updated very recently now if we press
play like I said if I go back on to the
manager you'll notice there's nothing in
there so what we going to do going to
expect to press load and we expect from
what we'd saved previously we expect it
to fill that content in so we'll press
load and you can see now it's brought
from those files that we just saved we
had five hundred and five magazines and
a broken home for the instance so we're
playing our game and we're doing
whatever we're doing we've used up we've
used up some bullets with shots and
annuals we've got 250 bullets two
magazines and now we've used a med
medical kit and we want to reset it
click Save that's all well and good you
can then unplayable and then when you
come back to it later there's nothing
there load 250 hammer 2 magazines and
now the arms not broken anymore so
really you just we've just covered a few
ways that we can do an extremely simple
loading system all we've done is we've
got a script which controls how many how
much hammer we've got or whatever
variables that you want to control
though it's a boolean integer whatever
values you need then from the save
script we've just said were looking for
the the actual manager script that we
created what saving the es 2.7 script
armor and we're giving it an an a name
that we want the file to be actually
saved out as we're saying we want to
save the magazine's very variable into a
magazines file and we want to save the
broken arm variable into a broken arm
then similar with the load we're looking
for the manager script again and we're
going to pass into that script so we're
going to pass into here the easy save is
going to load an integer that were
looking for which is inside the alma fun
we're going to load the integer that is
inside the magazines I'm gonna load the
boolean which is inside the broken arm
folder this is really simple because the
same system only needs to be what you
specifically need to serve ie specific
items whether they've created certain
parts of your story crip been collected
certain items and you needed to remember
what specific things people actually
have and I will be doing a different a
more of an extended video to show you
how you can possibly go and save your
characters position and also save the
scene that you're in and be able to load
from there so this was just the initial
setup and this shows you how you can
basically with some simple buttons save
and load values that you need in your
game extremely easily using easy save so
thanks very much for watching and don't
