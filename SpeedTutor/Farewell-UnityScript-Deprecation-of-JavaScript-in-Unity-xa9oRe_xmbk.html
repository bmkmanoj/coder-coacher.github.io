and this is a quick video just to tell
you that we'll have to say a final
farewell to what unity always described
as unity script which is a sort of
variation of JavaScript now a lot of the
programming that you see nowadays will
be actually c-sharp and a lot of my
tutorials that you'll see will be in
c-sharp and it's just something that
over the time has become more and more
supported and is widely adapted across a
lot of industries and not just specific
to unity so unity have announced that on
the 11th of August roughly that they're
going to be deprecating are slowly
transitioning away from the use of the
unity script or javascript in the use of
unity now the reason why they say they
want to get rid of it is because there's
a lot of interesting things coming up
with c-sharp in particular so the things
that unity are working on they're going
to be updating to newer versions of and
the c-sharp api and they're going to be
introducing a new job system which helps
you write a new multi-threaded code and
other specific features which help
compilation and improve the pipeline for
c-sharp at the current time now java
scripts and the unity scripts at the
moment is you know some somewhat on
power with c-sharp for the most part but
as the time goes on it's going to be
just pretty much they're gonna cancel
support and everything from pretty much
now on with 2017 point one two they're
going to be making these changing PC
sharp and it's just going to leave the
JavaScript behind and they don't want as
far as much of an edging language if
it's not as easily supported across you
know millions of sort of thousands of
tutorials and content available on the
internet and with all the things that
they're trying to put into making it
more than appropriate platform now that
doesn't mean that you won't be able to
carry on using it because we give some
statistics at the bottom which specify
you know a lower percentage of the
amount of actually JavaScript related
files that you find in actual projects
when they're built out
like I said you'll still be able to use
it any projects but if you're still sort
of on the fence whether you want to
stick with it or move to c-sharp now
would probably be a good time to sort of
you know unless you're in the middle of
an actual project is actually just start
switching to c-sharp and then you will
not reach any see any problems so much
in the future and be aware that all
assets style packages from now on will
be required to be submitted in c-sharp
so all unityscript versions will be sort
of a drop support from now so you won't
be able to find as much as time goes on
so you can read the entire article about
unity sort of a way to describe that the
long road into the sunset for unity
script and maybe you can take some
advantages from this and choose to do
something for the future so thanks again
