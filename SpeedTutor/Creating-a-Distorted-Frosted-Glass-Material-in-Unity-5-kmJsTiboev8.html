tutorial today and I'm going to show you
how to make a solve stern glass or a
distorted glass effect now last time I
showed you how to do just a basic glass
and sort of material but if you want to
do something that's more like a bathroom
window or something to that effect what
you can do is you can right click in the
project panel go import package and
choose effects you can get the standard
assets and things from the assets start
or when you choose to install unity and
they'll be pre-installed when you come
to need them and you can import them
into whichever scene you want now you'll
get them in your standard assets under
effects and you will get class
refraction and effects along with all
the other effects that you can use what
I do is I'll create a new material and
what we can do is we can call this we
can call this distorted color let's say
and then what we can do from there is go
on to the shed and we can go FX glass
and spend bump to start and then we get
two options that we can actually change
the actual pink color with a texture and
we can change the distortion or the
effect that it gives the normal map and
we can choose how much distortion it has
now given in this pack is the effects
and the glass refraction is a glass then
they'll be they'll earned a gasps then
normals so if I choose that material and
select over the normal after typing
glass stem normal and it will double
click that to it so I can choose it now
it's not the new thing because I need to
apply it to this object now once I apply
it you can see a little bit of
distortion in the background we can do
is we can encourage the distortion that
it gives based on the normal map that
we've given it so if we click on the
normal map we can see it here that it's
a got a stained glass look about it
now we can click back on the actual
object with material on and we could opt
it out and at the sort of albedo color
and you can see that adds a
stained-glass effect to that and you
know either side we can see it now
obviously we can change it to whatever
material we might like these just
whatever is in my scene now I can add
and a sort of cookie that's been given
to add a light effect and you can see
that it's our vignette and you can look
at the end Distortion you can a
different normal map here and my project
so I've got cliff normals you can see
that it gives more of a a different
smelled effect and you can reduce the
distortion even get rid of the salt and
I'll be director tell us a little you
can just slip this into or whatever door
or window whatever you might need
increase the distortion amount and you
might be wanting to get a frosted look
over a doll so it's how to create some
solves and distorted our stand frosted
glass whatever you might need and so
that's pretty much it thanks so much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
