my time trial system and this is just
gonna be very simple if you want to make
something for a racing game or a puzzle
game where you have to complete it in a
certain amount of time you can obviously
just write this little bit of scrip
obviously time goes down you can walk
into a box and add ten seconds and then
you know walk into another and add
another and you know you can do this on
and on so first of all what we want to
do so what I've got machine is I've got
a first person controller my normal test
scene and obviously my players tagged as
player with the tag and what we need to
do is I've just created two boxes with
the you know a box Collider with is
trigger set to true so just ticked and
you know I've just renamed them to game
time back so we can collect them as we
need to so first I'll gonna write a
little controller script that's going to
control the timer that we've got and
what we're gonna need to do so I'll name
this script and TT controller what I'll
do is open that up in monodevelop and
then what I'm gonna do is start by
writing a variable called timer set as
type float equal to 10.0 with a
semicolon so that's gonna be our initial
time you can obviously set this to
whatever you like so I'm gonna have
another variable called add time set
that as type float
equal to 10 seconds as well again you
can change that up but I'm gonna have a
variable called GUI sure as type boolean
and it's equal to false then we're gonna
write function up there to brackets add
two curly brackets below and say time
minus minus equals
time dot delta time and then if we say
if time is ever less than or equal to 0
then timer will always equal to 0 that's
just in a case so that's all we've got
for the update function you know that'll
just count down the seconds of the timer
appear so that'll just count down you
know till it gets to 0 and if it ever
gets to 0
I'll just set 0 in the GUI now we need
to do a lot of GUI to make this work now
we're going to say function on GUI open
the brackets add two curly brackets
below and say that G y dot box open
brackets rect comma and open bracket ten
comma 10 comma 50 comma 20 close that up
put a comma I had two quarts said plus
timer dot two string open the brackets
adding quarts zero close a two brackets
another semicolon now that's just going
to show the timer as an actual whole
number and then what we want to actually
be able to do is show another GUI which
is gonna add the time like I did in my
preview so we'll say that if GUI show is
equal to true then we'll add two curly
brackets below and say gee Y dot box
open brackets rect open brackets then
we'll sis 6510 5020 close that'll add a
comma put in quartz plus then add a
little space then under add a plus after
that then say add time dot to string
open open brackets add two
brackets again another semicolon put
zero in there like we did before and
then what we're going to want to do is
make sure that GUI doesn't appear all
the time because we might collect
multiple items so what I'm going to do
is start by referencing to a new
function and it's going to be sure G or
Y two brackets in a semicolon because I
can't do yield within an update function
so if I save function sure GUI with two
brackets and there are two curly
brackets below I can say yield we're
four seconds and then in brackets I
could put something like two and then
we'll say GOI sure is equal to false so
after that two seconds it sets the
boolean back to false again so what
we'll do is I will just add this to my
first-person controller to show you that
it you know initially works time is ten
add time is ten so you know you can see
the time when it counts down but
obviously it won't show the other timer
unless I obviously ticked this box I
never take that you know you see that
and it'll go off but we don't want to do
with that we want to make sure we
collect something so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna write a script to collect
an item so if I write a script called
game time then I get rid of these two
functions and I say start by writing
private variable timer script as type t
t controller for a time trail controller
then i'll say function start add two
brackets two curly brackets below and so
that time a script equals game object
dot find open brackets first-person
controller close the all up say get
component open brackets TT controller
close that up another semicolon and
below there will say function on trigger
enter open the op call call on collider
close that up add two curly brackets
below and want to say if call dot tag is
equal to player then add two curly
brackets in under that and so that time
our script dot timer plus equals ten
then we'll also say timer script dot GUI
sure is equal to true and we'll say
destroy open brackets lowercase game
then uppercase object add a semicolon so
all this does it references the script
that we're having here so we can access
the variables and then once we enter the
trigger with the player tagged it
allowed ten seconds to the timer which
is shown in the GUI up here and then it
will set GUI shorter true which means
it'll show the GUI to 110 seconds and
then it'll destroy the game object that
we've just landed on now if I show you
this now if I go to my two boxes and I
add game time again timer again time and
then you can see it counting down you
can see that then I added ten seconds to
the score and as I say you know you can
do GU white GUI texture and add a
texture to it whatever you want and then
you know you walk up to it again and you
like that amount of seconds so that's a
very simple way to make a time trial
sort of thing where you have to collect
time or add time for doing certain
things doing objectives so thanks very
much for watching and as ever liked the
