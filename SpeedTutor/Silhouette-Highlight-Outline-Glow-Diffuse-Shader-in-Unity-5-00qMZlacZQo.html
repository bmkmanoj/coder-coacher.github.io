tutorial today now this actually can be
used in unity 4 and previous versions
and it's going to be showing you how to
make an outline defect or a solve
highlighting effect over objects that
you might be able to click on interact
with now I'll show you the web page
where you can actually find the shared
Accord itself and you'll get the example
so if I bring my tab over here you'll
see on this side is that we will get a
highlight if you've ever played games
like I think it's Team Fortress and
things like that you will see that the
character has an outline all around it
and if you go through our past walls so
if you not be able to render the actual
character it will show a full block film
so then you will see it actually through
walls you can get a different version
down the bottom which is just the
outline variant alone so you don't have
any sort of cutting through walls but
it's really dependent on what you need
for your game but this is a nice shader
and there's two sections to it there's a
just a diffuse which controls the
outline that's created with the
thickness and there's a bumped version
for that so if you've got a normal map
that you need to use because the shader
has to have that programmed in and then
the as I said the outline vet of variant
if you need to use that now I'll show
you how to use the to make your own shed
and actually use this sort of silhouette
diffuse so I want to do is on this page
it's the silhouette outline diffuse on
the unified community so it's wicked at
UNC 3d comm and then you can search at
the top outline diffuse now when you're
on this page what you can do is you can
I'll leave the put these on our website
or you can copy it from here at the top
it'll start by saying share the outline
silhouette diffuse in red we go down and
pretty much just copy the entire
section where after all the way up until
the last curly braket the end just
before it talks about having a bumped
version we'll copy that we'll go
straight back into unity and I've
created myself a shared as folder if I
right-click on that create and then what
I want to do is create a new shed and
share there's a slightly different two
materials that you create because a
shared resort holds all youth and
textures and you can do all sorts of fun
things with shared as if you now it's a
program so what we'll call this we'll
call this an outline diffuse what I'm
going to do is I'm going to double click
that and it'll open up in monodevelop
and then when it's open it will already
have a solve set basic shared a output
for whatever me we might want to do so
what we can do is highlight it all get
rid of it and what we're going to do is
we're going to paste in the script that
we copied from the website so we'll just
paste that in you need to make sure that
you've got this line at the top which
talks about the outlined select diffuse
because that will put it into the unity
shaders and then we need to make sure
that it's ended nicely then we'll click
Save then what we can do is we can close
and share this will go game object 3d
object and sphere so we've got a sphere
here which is nothing crazy
now what we're going to do is
right-click create a new material
because we're going to be able to do the
new things with it so a new writer will
call this outlined material and from
there in here it's c5 on the right hand
side if you've got that there you'll
have your share door options before
unity fire would be in your legacy share
does but it will be called outlined and
silhouette diffuse and then we've got a
certain few parameters that we can
adjust now if I change this color to red
and I add this outline diffuse to my
sphere you will notice that we get an
outline color and now we can change it
to whichever color we'd like to have
maybe a highlight
again a bright yellow to make it obvious
you can change the outline width or
thickness to have how thick you'd like
it to be you can add a normal just
diffuse map in there the main color just
adjusts the color of your main texture
overall share the look now if we look
through a wall there here you'll notice
that you can still see the object
through a wall and obviously you can use
that other share day if you don't want
to have that so if we press play and
would you have a quick test you can see
that mus fear has a nice outline over
what we can do is if we bring this cube
over and I press play and then I go away
you'll be able to notice that you'll be
able to see things through walls if
you've got maybe some interactable
objects in your scenes so again what you
can do is say you want to make a bumped
version of that same shed what you can
do is create a new shed by
right-clicking pist
this script all the way from there down
to just before we get to the outlined
only variant and then then you'll be
able to create a new material with that
bomb shed and the outline only variant
is what you can copy and just do the
same thing and you want to get an
outline and I will put all of these
three on my website but this is just a
really short tutorial to show you how to
make something quite cool very
straightforward and thanks to the
information on the unifier wiki so
hopefully this helped everybody out and
helped you create a basic outline so
thanks very much for watching don't
