tutorial today and this is going to be
showing you how to make a simple splash
screen or a logo screen or something
that happens when you start a game and
you see company logos just fade in and
fade out ready simply now this is
something fairly simple to do all I've
got is a my speed shooter logo what I'm
going to do is it's a PNG and if you
haven't already it comes in as a texture
so you want to make a sprite a 2d or a
UI image you can compress the mac size
if you want believe it 2k just for the
sake of this and then we'll get the UI
graphic with the transparency in the
background what we can do is we can get
rid of directional light because we
don't need it we all need a main camera
for this what we can also do is actually
get rid of the skybox because we don't
want that so we can just go to the
lighting if not you can go windows
lighting and click on the plus box by
the skybox and just clicking on and then
we want to get skybox in this scene
because this will be really light scene
and you want to set your camera
background to whatever you want usually
it set it to black so in the game view
we actually get a nice black background
then what we can do is we can go game
object UI and then we can just go image
so now we've got an image in a scene we
can go to a 2d view and then I can
select the image press F in the scene
view and you can see that if I just zoom
out a little bit we get the image that
we want so we can then Center this so we
can do the X and the y position of 0 0
the Z position can be 0 also you will
see in the game view it will be directly
centered now now what you could do in
the image you can add your whatever your
logo is I'll add it to the very center
and what I might do is I might set this
to 256 by 256 for the sake of the
example so that's it's all nicely
positioned if we press play
it doesn't nothing it's just pretty much
a static image just sitting that so we
needed to be able to fade in amount so
we need to do is we need to actually
create a script so we'll go create C
sharp and we'll call this splash fade
can be anything really but we'll just
have it as that for now we'll up and up
in whatever program you've got to map
edit the code and we'll staff by we'll
get rid of the first two sort of
starting methods we've got so before we
start we need to use a couple of
references at the top so we need to
because we going to be using the UI
components and we're going to be using
scene management so we're going to
moving scenes so we need to write the
top using Unity engine dot UI with a
semicolon and using unity engine dot
seen management with a semicolon
then from there we're going to be
referencing a couple that we're going to
be declaring a couple of variables so
we're going to say if this is public
image and we'll call this splash image
with a semicolon
then we'll have another public variable
and we'll then this string and call it
load level so we're doing is we're
saying we're looking for a public image
and image is part of the unity 5 UI and
we give it a name of splash image and
we're going to have a string for what
level we're going to load next then
normally you'd write a void start to
deal with things but because we're going
to use a car routine which is going to
be for stop waiting a certain amount of
time before we move the next scene we're
going to need to use I start by writing
I D numerator which allows us to deal
with co-routines within the method so
it's just the type that going to use
them we can write start which is pretty
much just instead of using the void then
we're going to have two curly brackets
below I'm going to say splash image dot
canvas
render dot set alpha in brackets zero
point zero F with a semicolon and I'll
explain this as we're going along and if
you see on the our image inside our
canvas don't mind the errors we've got a
color and the color has an alpha so you
can see that when I move this color to
the side and I drop this alpha down you
can see that it fades based on what the
Alpha is so we need to make sure for
this particular thing we need to make
sure that alpha is or the transparencies
are a hundred percent so we can see it
so in this case two five five because
that's the solid value start may well
have a little sort of red squiggle
underneath but that's because we haven't
written in the yield and weight in
anytime yet so don't worry about that so
first all right were looking for the
image so the splash image were going to
find the canvas renderer and we're going
to set the Alpha to zero so it's going
to be completely invisible for as soon
as we start the game then um what we can
do is we're going to have we're going to
create a function called
fading with two brackets in a semicolon
then we're going to have a yield return
new wait for seconds open brackets and
then 2.5 F and then a semicolon on the
end then we're going to have another
function called fade-out with two
brackets and a semicolon then we're
going to have very much another yield
return new waitforseconds and then we'll
set this to 2.5 F with a semicolon and
then what want to do is do scene manager
dot load scene upper brackets and then
we'll say load level with a semicolon so
I'll explain this so we're going to be
calling a function then we're going to
be using yield two where two point five
seconds and we need an F because it's a
flop value
so that can take in two decimal places
then we're going to run the fade-out and
then we're going to where they're 2.5
seconds before we load the next scene so
then below our tutela brackets for the
whole method for the start we're going
to call this void fade in
like we named above here then we'll have
two curly brackets below that and then
what I'll do is avoid fade-out and two
brackets and two colored brackets below
now within our third we need to do
something and with unity 5gy it's added
something new which we can take
advantage up or say splash image don't
cross fade alpha and then open brackets
we have to put a float which is going to
be the alpha value of the gyration and
then whether it should ignore timescale
and it says that it's between the alpha
value of the canvas render color
associated with a graphic so what we
need to do at first we want to say that
because when we start the Alpha is zero
so it's completely transparent so we
don't even see it we need the Alpha to
then be equal to one which is full which
is 100% then we'll put a comma and we'll
want to wear maybe 1.5 seconds before it
gets to full 100% then we'll put in
brackets false and then we'll put a
semicolon and so what this will do is
all just fed the Alpha from nothing too
soft from zero to 100% over the case of
1.5 seconds and then in the fade we'll
do exactly the same thing or copy that
line paste it and but this time because
the Alpha is set to a full hundred
percent will then set it to zero we can
say 0.0 EV which is it's going to be
invisible again and we're going to have
that over the space of 2.5 seconds so
based on what we're doing is that when
we start we'll set the Alpha to zero or
call the fed in function so the fading
goes okay
so we need to fit the alpha to one of
1.5 seconds so then once that's cold
straight away it will then wait 2.5
seconds before it does fade out so then
we'll do fade out it'll start doing this
and as soon as it started doing this
we'll need to wait 2.5 seconds according
to this one so just matching it so in
the instance of this the first one will
be doing the fade in 1.5 seconds here to
fade all the way in but we don't want
the logo to start fading out instantly
we want it to stay on the screen for
about a second all you really can change
it so you could make that 5 seconds
before then you do the fade out it just
you can mess around with the values so
we do the fade out where 2.5 seconds
while it does the hundred-percent and
fed to zero and then we'll load the new
scene so I'll save that out go into back
into unity what I can do is I can add
this to the image or I could add this to
the main camera for the sake of this add
it to the main come and say that the
image that we're going to use is this
one and then we can load the next level
but we don't have anything in the build
settings to load so it won't do anything
ok so in our build settings what we can
do is we can add splash and we can level
one and splash has this on level one has
nothing then from now on our main camera
we can set this to level would based on
what we've named have putting the build
settings so on our splash screen we
expect when we play it will fade in wait
a second and then it will fade out and
move to the next scene and you get your
notes in the scene because everything's
disappeared and it's just black so all
it was was a really simple way of
setting the Alpha to zero using a couple
of functions and a cup of yields to
where a few seconds then load the scene
after everything's been done on the fade
and the fade I'll just use the crossfade
alpha wouldn't be 100% zero ping and
fully and
visible or transparent and then whatever
seconds you want to do the fade over so
that's just a simple way to do a splash
pinning you could put another scene
after which does exactly the same thing
if you wanted multiple or you could add
multiple scripts like this to with your
level to do multiple logos fading and
now but hopefully that helped you solve
achieve something really simple and make
it look a little bit more professional
so thanks very much for watching
