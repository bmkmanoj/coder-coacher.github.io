tutorial and this is going to be showing
you how to use the new third-person
controller because a few people have
been asking me even though this is
fairly self-explanatory and unity I've
actually added some Docs in there to
sort of help you out with setting up
sides it's got a normal scene here and
if you import it in by going right
clicking on your project panel going
import and then characters and you can
just import that in it'll be in your
standard assets folder under characters
and then third person character now
there's a little document here which
says third person character guidelines
I'll tell you how to set it up or how to
replace the model if you need to and
it'll tell you that you might want to
add a camera so it won't actually run
away from the camera and you'll not be
able to see where it's going so
initially it's really quite simple all
we've got is we've got two prefabs we've
got a prefab which is a version of the
AI and it's got some nav mesh components
on it and I've not really tested this so
it might be quite good for using AI to
do pathfinding and avoid some object
collisions and things but that's
something for another time but this is
the normal third-person controller and
it's got its using the Meccan 'm
animation system it's got a rigidbody
capsule Collider the scripts the needs
for its third person character so
obviously you could take this and use it
for your wrong all I want to do is we
want to drag the character in you'll
notice that it actually looks quite
small so we might want to just scale him
up a little bit and that looks quite
nice it's got nice capsule Collider on
and it's not really got much going on
and you'll notice that from there once
we just dragged it in when we've got
nothing no other camera in the scene we
can press play nothing will happen but
so we'll need to add our own camera so
if we go game object camera
so I wanted to be able to add a camera
to our scene so we can see what's going
on you may have had a main camera in
there
what I'll do is I'll add the Cameron so
it sort of almost looks down our
character a little bit now once we've
positioned our camera what we can see is
that if we play the game you'll notice
that we can control the third person
character but we'll actually need to do
something with the main camera now we've
got our camera if it's a main camera
that should be fine but if you've just
had to create your own camera with a
game object and like that we need to
make sure that it is tagged main camera
there all we'll have a problem with the
control so now what I want to do is
attach or parent that to the
third-person controller itself by just
dragging it on and then you'll notice
that when we as long as it's got the tag
of main camera we can control the new
third-person controller and you can
adjust all the settings that it's got so
on the actual controller itself we can
look at the turn speed we can look at
the jump power so we can put that really
high and we can reduce gravity maybe put
gravity at not point to so say we were
doing a sort of space Spacey game look
you can notice that you can go really
high in the air before you drop down
again so it's something quite cool like
that you can adjust all the parameters
depending on how quickly you want to
move so you could have it really high
make sure you make the animation adjust
itself accordingly to the speed at which
you can move now that was really fast
and then it will change animations
accordingly to if it's on the ground or
not so really it's just a really simple
it's a really effective and good little
thing they've added but you can change
the mesh in this if you use in the
probably use of the Meccan in animation
system but it's a really nice way to get
yourself a functioning third-person
controller with without much hassle
really so hopefully that's helped a few
people out if you like the tutorial
stuff it's a like comment and subscribe
