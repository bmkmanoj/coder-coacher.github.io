tutorial today really simple how to
create some 3d text in max so you want
to just click on the ship's tab on your
side palette and find text so it's
almost like a little primitive so what
you can do is just in you from viewport
it doesn't really matter which view part
if you just click and drag you'll create
some text so it's just our line of text
I'll get rid of the grid so you can see
and literally all you want to do if you
lose that like I just did when I linked
to the move tool just make sure you
click on the modify tab so what I'm
going to do is just change the text in
the field just to what whatever you want
so this is just an example of what you
can do so there I've got the text in
there you can change the font to
whatever you like doesn't really matter
change the size to whatever you want
doesn't matter so what I'm going to say
is you want to go to the interpolation
tab and you want to take the steps down
to one I mean you can take it down
further because i'm just going to show
you how to make low poly texts or make
it as low poly if you're going to use it
in a game if you can or do whatever else
but if you're going to use in something
promotion or something where the
polycount doesn't matter you can turn
the interpolation up to make it slightly
more smoother and if you go to rendering
just change it to rectangular and set
everything just 20 so you don't have any
weirdness going on so now go to modify a
list and go down and find extrude click
extrude and you can set your extrude
amount so you can see the text extrude
by a certain amount if you want to just
quickly see the wireframe you just click
on with the realistic and go on edged
faces and you can see where the actual
polygons are created to make this text
and if I show you if we go back to the
text in the modifier
and we go to interpolation and just
knock that off a bit it just smooths the
actual texts with more polygons where it
doesn't really make an awful lot of
difference but as you can see if you
watch and this left hand side where it
shows the polycount it does increase
quite a bit with each interpolation so
it's been to what you want want it far
and what you want to do but essentially
that's a really basic where to make some
3d text thanks very much so yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
