a really simple tutorial a couple of
people have asked me this in the past
and it's taking me quite a while to get
around to doing it but this is a really
simple idea and it's about making
falling platforms so if you were going
to make a platform again where you jump
across platforms or crissy game and a
certain amount of time those platforms
actually fall down so you can just keep
on running back and forth on them so it
makes the demo game more difficult so
anywhere first of all what I've got is
I've just got two blocks either side so
you know you can jump across so you
start one and these platforms going to
fall down
so initially what you need to do to make
something actually fall down eventually
is that you need to add a rigidbody to
it and that will apply a basic amount of
physics so we can apply gravity to pull
it down to where the ground level is
here now one of the key things when you
impart a rigidbody all you need to do is
go up component physics and then
attached a rigidbody now you want to
make sure that use gravity is not ticked
because if we had it ticked obviously
with gravity gravity pulls you down so
it would pull the object down so as long
as you've got your rigidbody on it and
you don't have m user gravity ticked
then we're alright and then you can
start with this so what we'll do is
we'll start by writing a JavaScript file
and we'll call this falling platform and
what you want to do open up in
monodevelop
and when you're done that will get rid
of the two starting functions and then
we'll so variable platform as type game
object with a semicolon then we'll set
we'll do something new and we use in
function on can controller Collider hit
open brackets hit call on controller
Collider hit and we'll close that up
then we'll add two curly brackets below
there and we'll say if it don't
game object with a lowercase G dot tag
is equal to open brackets and then we'll
say platform which is its actual name
and you'll need to name that in unity
and then while I - curly brackets below
there and say yield wait for seconds and
then we'll boom brackets maybe two
seconds with the semicolon then we'll
say platform which is our variable up at
the top here which is a platform game
object dot rigidbody dot use gravity
equals true so what we're initially
doing is all we're doing is we're going
to set the variable in the inspector and
we were saying that if we use in a
first-person controller we want to make
sure that when the character controller
collider which isn't actually a
rigidbody it's a aware that the scripts
written by the people who made the unity
engine and then if we've landed on the
tag which is called platform then we'll
wait two seconds and then apply gravity
to that platform so it'll fall down and
once we go back into unity what we'll do
is we'll add this to our first-person
controller so the first person
controller has it attached then what we
can do is add p1 in the inspector and
then we can actually run the game and if
we jump across as we would normally jump
across to the other after those two
seconds the collider fell down and as
ever if you liked the tutorial don't
