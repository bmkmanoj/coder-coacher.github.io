5 tutorial and this is gonna be a simple
one about getting to your render
settings now render settings in unity 4
were where you could change your skybox
your fog settings and your ambient light
and so on now in unity 5 it's done
slightly differently so I'll quickly
show you in unity 4 this is unity 4
looks really similar if we went to edit
and then render settings on this side we
could take fog we could change the
ambient light we could add our own
skybox material but in unity 5 you'll
notice that if I go to edit there is no
render settings anymore the still
project settings and things but you
might want to find out where that's gone
so the big thing is you go to window and
then you go to lighting now I like to
just add my lighting component over to
this side so I can see everything going
on and now this is controls your sort of
global illumination your light baking
and all that sort of good stuff now if
you go to scene you can see that the
skybox is here in under the environment
a lighting setting so you can see my
skybox in my scene there you can change
the environment lighting so you can add
your directional light which is going to
be clusters your son if you're doing
outdoor scene you can choose your
ambient source as the skybox so it's a
default skybox from here one of the
thing like I said is that you could hide
your fog if we enable fog and we can
change the values on there if we add
objects in our scene for it to affect so
when the settings of sort of entirely
moved to a lighting tab now to sort of
consolidate all the different options
that you can have for baking and the
real time stuff for unity 5 and also
they have some extra settings for
dealing with other things but that was
just the best so running settings have
moved to the lighting options within the
window and lighting
just a quick mention the ambient light
is there and you can change that for the
ambient intensity and you can change the
ambient sources to color if you didn't
want the real-time sort of global
illumination from the sky and such so
thanks again for watching and don't
