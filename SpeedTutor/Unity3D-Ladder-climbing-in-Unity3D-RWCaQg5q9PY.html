today and this is going to be about what
people have been asking for a long while
it's going to be at ladder climbing now
this isn't going to be the very best way
of doing it because there's a lot more
complicated ways that you can do it but
this needs a bit of experimentation from
you guys in what you want it to do when
how you want it to work because this is
very dependent on what height that you
have you want to actually move up in
your ladder and I've actually written a
script that does it basically it's very
simple but you may need to adjust the
speed at which you can climb when we set
these settings so this is just going to
be an example of it working in unity so
I'll press play and you can see it and
then I'll go on to actually tell you how
to make this work
okay so I'm going to show you how to
actually do this now so I've only got a
few basic bits in my scene so I've got
my first-person controller as normal and
my test scene and now I've got some
ladder objects which are just organized
with a empty game object now for my
actual ladder objects have got just a
platform which is just you know so we
can get up to and stand on and we've got
a ladder object that just quickly made
in 3dsmax and that's you know nothing
crazy just implied that I've got a
Collider which is behind this sort of
square back section which means that we
cannot go through it because we need to
set this actual object as is trigger so
we can actually know detect the
collision but when we set to his trigger
we can walk through it so I'll mill what
I did is made in another box got rid of
the mesh render and just made sure it
was slightly in front of the box just so
we could not walk through it then my
last object is the ladder trigger I'm a
lot of trigger is just this square that
you see behind it and the box collide
has got it is trigger tick like I said
and the colliders bigger slightly bigger
than the ladder so you know the first
person controller fits in it and then
it's going to be higher than the thing
so I've got you know set to about 4 in
the Y and 3.4 in the z-axis this is just
so that when we step into it you know
it'll activate the ladder like we want
to do now all we need now is to write a
little script and we'll call this we'll
call this ladder climb and then when a
ladder climbers open will delete these
two functions and start off by writing a
variable called C hich control for the
actual character controller itself set
that as type transform with a semicolon
then we'll write another variable and
call that inside and set that as boolean
equal to false
then I'll set another hat a variable
called height factor and set that as
type float equal to now this is very
dependent on how you see fit for your
game but I'll show you this as I go
through but just leave it at whatever
three for now
and see how it works for you then I'll
write a private variable fps input as
type FPS input controller and then I'll
start by writing function start with two
brackets add two curly brackets below
and so the FPS input is equal to get
component open brackets fps input
controller plus a plus semicolon now
we're going to write a function on
trigger enter open up the brackets right
call column collider close that off add
two curly brackets below and said that
if call dot game object dot tag is equal
to and then we'll have create a tab
called ladder then below there we'll add
two color brackets and so the FPS input
dot enabled is equal to false then we'll
say inside is equal to exclamation mark
inside with the semicolon so what this
means is the when we go inside a
Collider called ladder which was set in
a minute then the FPS input controller
which lets us move side to side up and
down where everyone will be disabled so
we can't move anywhere other than M
somewhere else and then inside which is
our boolean will be set to exactly
opposite of what it is so if it's equal
to false it then a set set it to true
and we're going to reference that in a
minute now what we'll do is copy this
same function and paste it in below but
change this to ontriggerexit keep all
the same except we'll set fps
and important air both equals true now
so if we go outside of the collider will
then be able to you know again remain
controller take control back of the
character controller now we're going to
do one last function which isn't going
to be very long
going to save function of debt two
brackets than two curly brackets below
and then said that if inside is equal to
true and an import get key open brackets
in quartz we can say W or whatever you
want to set to climb a ladder then below
there will add two curly brackets and
say that CH controller there dot
transform dot position plus equals
vector three dot up divided by the
height factor with a semicolon
now we'll save that and go back into
unity so when we've got that we'll add
it to our first person controller so we
read ladder climb you'll notice that we
need to add a character controller to
the inspector so we'll add the first
person controller there and we've got
the higher factor which we can adjust
accordingly
now what you need to make sure that you
do is on your ladder trigger that you
have to end is trigger set you need to
make sure you add another tag called
ladder and you cannot attack that so
just make sure those tagged ladder so
when I play the game you want to watch
the FPS control of this side and this
inside boolean so when we go inside
you'll notice that FPS controller is um
you know disabled so if I'm pressing a
and D I won't be able to move anywhere
unless I press W to go up so I'll show
you what the height factor does say I
set it to a lower amount which is closer
to the actual vector up just by itself
it means that we can go a higher but
also when we go higher it makes is you
know increase its speed by quite a bit
so I suppose it's really dependent on
what height your own platform is our
unity ladder needs to go so you'd maybe
need to find a way to stop the game I
mean stop moving so quickly in that
direction maybe decreasing the magnitude
now if we set it something like 5 you'll
notice that I want to walk into a ladder
I won't be able to go off very far
because it's decreased it so much but as
I say for my scene I've set it to 3.2
and it's about the right amount to just
go up the ladder not go too high and not
go crazy fast all the way up so really
what you just want to be careful is is
you know you set this amount and you'll
notice there you can go up and down
it'll go up and down for you and just
like you'd expect on a ladder now as I
say not the most effective way of doing
it but it's just a simple way to
movement people understand of how you
could possibly make you a lot of work so
I'll quickly go through it again is that
I'm referencing the FPS controller which
is on our first-person controller and
I'm honest using getcomponent because
we're actually putting it on the
controller itself so it doesn't need to
find the game object so when we enter
the collider will set the FPS input
controller to false so we can't move
then we'll change the bool in
accordingly then if we exit will enable
it so we can run around and then if the
inside is every equal to true which is
in one of these cases when we can't move
and then we press W and the character
controller will transform its position
equal to what vector three up is and it
just changes the Y direction and then
we're dividing it by a height factor so
we can't go as high up so that's pretty
much the basics and thanks for watching
