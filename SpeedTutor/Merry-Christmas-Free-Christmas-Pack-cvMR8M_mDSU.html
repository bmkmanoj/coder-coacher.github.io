very happy Christmas and just something
to go towards Christmas some Christmas

models you know so it takes off a lot of
time but you know thanks for coming back

sort of a small sample sort of model
pack relate to Christmas that you can
download you know just with a few items
Santa's are touched on it in my last
sort of tutorial but yeah you can
download this and hopefully everybody
enjoys it and you know just some
screenshots to go along with the items
that I've created and you know these are
all suitable to be used within unity and
I've imported them in myself and they
all work perfectly fine so you know if
you have any troubles let me know and
I'll try and sort it out for you but in
the package itself I'll leave the 3ds
max files and leave the FBX files so you
can import those into unity and I'll
even packaged up a unity and file so
that you can you know import them really
easy into your scene and as ever thanks
