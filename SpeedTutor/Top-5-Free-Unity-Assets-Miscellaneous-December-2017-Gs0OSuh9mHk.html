miscellaneous assets for December 2017
so number one is we've got the seamless
textures realistic pack and it includes
20 seamless textures which should taken
from real-life photos which include
stoned metal grass and everything that
you can see in the preview here and
they're all worth 1000 by 1000 textures
with a normal map and number two is the
dynamic space background light the light
version includes a sort of high quality
background towel set with a parallax
effect and it is tiled on all four sides
so this might require the full pack to
get the most out of it but it's four
thousand by four thousand PM cheese with
a hand-painted and nebula including
stars and things like that so it's quite
a nice stylized effect if you're looking
to create the look of space or maybe
looking into the sky and number three is
the 2d betta sort of game kit from Unity
themselves and it's a project actually
designed for non-programmers
for artists and designers and it's
something which is a collection of
gameplay elements tools systems
everything like that to get you started
with an example of an entire system for
a sort of 2-d game and you can see it
here with all the elements lives
characters information and the sort of a
stylized look to the full thing and for
is simple UI and this is a collection of
UI elements with a particular theme of
just basic UI and it includes various
sample scenes and you can show us where
to use the assets and construct your own
using these samples and imagery that are
found here this pack does include the
resource icons and the simple vector
icons pack consisting of over 200 icons
and all the fonts used are perfectly
feasible for any type of game so you can
see the nice array of different sort of
UI you can make with this nice style and
the last one I'm gonna show is called
fire wing and this is quite a fancy
little shed which can career I don't
always use it or if it's suitable so
I'll modify this for another type but
you can change the texture on the shader
and you can sort of add different
effects to the wings different shapes
things like that whether it wants to be
wings or not there might be something
for you to try if you want to get a nice
effect like this so these were the top
five miscellaneous assets for December
2070 sorry this one's a little bit late
