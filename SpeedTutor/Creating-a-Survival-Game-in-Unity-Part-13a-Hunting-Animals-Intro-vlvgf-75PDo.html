tutorial and this is going to be part 13
or the first part of part 13 for going
on with the Survival Series so today
we're gonna be focusing on animal
hunting now before anybody gets it
carried away with themselves the animal
hunting is gonna consist of we're gonna
have some animal prints that you could
place on the floor or somehow generate
them within your game then you're gonna
have a Collider over those footprints
and then as long as you when you tranq
craft a say a trap you'll be able to
place that trap from the crafting option
menu and then in the next videos from
there we're gonna write a little script
to make sure that when you leave that
trap alone it might catch an animal or
catch something which either then add to
your infantry which could classes meat
or whatever it might be so it can allude
to the fact of or some really basic
style hunting which can just help you
get started with your game this is going
to be the introduction so it's gonna be
just setting it up and laying everything
out now I've got a folder called
crafting and I've got some folders with
the script and the prefabs and just
miscellaneous for the models and the
things that I'm going to bring in so
I've got when I upload this to my
website what we're gonna do is we're
gonna have this is the big standard
assets for the survival series and we're
gonna have some items in here which
you're going to be for the set up now
what you want to do first of all is
import the FBX and the animal print
PSD now you can do that by if we go to
right-click on the miscellaneous folder
go import new asset and then we'll look
for the animal print so that comes in
the imports we can leave and I'll import
new asset and I will called it and I
will import the bear trap and then we
can open up the preview and you can see
it's just a basic sort of trap I made
which can
that allude to something for your game
now scale that up maybe to naught point
naught 3 and then when you drag it in if
you're in your scene view you can drag
it in and you can see it just there and
obviously I'll provide these for free
obviously nothing fantastic but it's
just something to get you started now if
we get rid of that for now you can tick
on generate light them up in new fees if
you're gonna use that sort of thing now
we're going to do is we want to be able
to sort of add these animal prints to
the floor an animal print is just this
picture here which is a very small
texture what we could do is turn the
compression size down to two five six
because that's the size of the image now
what I usually like to do is create a
game object create other hand and our
wall creates a plane and I will call
this plane animal print and then what we
can do from there is drag the picture
onto the plane and we can see it's
really massive what we can do is we can
rotate this around say scale it down a
little bit something like that and then
we can place it just close to the floor
we'll have a look in a minute then on
the animal print on the material that
we've got is we can set that to
transparent cut out or transparent
diffuse for now and transparent diffuse
will allow it to have the transparency
of the Alpha so we don't see the
background and then we can obviously put
that closer to the floor if we need to
what we can do is if we close it up and
add a prefab in the right-click the
prefab folder click create prefab and
we'll just add animal print prefab and
then what we can do is drag the animal
print to the prefab prefab item so we'll
always remember it now we can drag that
out as many times as we need to so we
can just add this like say like this and
I can just duplicate that myself and
we'll just create
some footprints like that we might need
to bring them closer to the terrain but
we can leave that for now now what I
like to do is create a game object
career empty so we can organize this
together and I'll call animal print
again and what I'll do is I'll drag all
the animal prints into the main
selection and that's that's very nice
like that what we'll do is we want a
Collider to be able to detect whether we
can build something so what we can do is
go green object to create other and cube
and now we'll create a cube obviously if
you following unity five and things this
might be a little bit different but the
concept is similar we'll make sure the
cube is big enough to encapsulate the
entire sort of print section because we
only want to be able to maybe set the
trap where the animals will end up
walking or walk again so this is just a
simulate that one that make it nice and
big so that's about there say and then
what we'll do is we'll say that that's
the animal Collider and what we can do
is we're gonna add that to the animal
print folder to keep it nice and neat
and what we want to do is create a tag
so we can add a new tag at the top and
call it animal track then we'll go back
on our cube or an animal Collider
and set that as animal track for now and
then we can remove the mesh renderer for
now you can just on tick the box I'll
leave it for now okay so we actually
imported the bear trap I still want to
be able to make that into two types of
prefabs for this tutorial so in the
prefabs what we want to do is create a
new prefab I want to call the prefab
trap the player because there's gonna be
one prefab which is gonna be on the
player which is not really going to do
much other than appear in disappear and
then we're gonna have one that's gonna
make itself spawn which is gonna have
the script which controls what it does
so the trap player is going to be
whatever animal trap we've got so if we
go back into the miscellaneous folder
pull the trap in to the scene and you
can see it's over this side here now on
the we can add this to the trap player
and the trap prefab then what we'll do
is we'll get rid of that now from the
scene
so trap play this so this is the thing
that's going to be actually on our
player so we'll add that now so we'll go
to the will add that here put it in
front of our player we'll go on the game
view we'll be able to if I put it just
to the side here we can see then what's
going on but it's a little bit offset
there so if I pull it up and position it
roughly in front of our character like
so that'll that will do for now what
we'll do is we'll parent that to the
main camera so I'll always follow our
player around and what we need to do is
we will just get rid of the animate if
you've got that it'll have a non M
material on it you can create one if you
want if you've got more of a metella
material so that's okay for now we can
hide that if we need to well add a
script to this object after which is
going to be able to create the prefab
now on the prefab diversion again we'll
remove the animator because there's no
animation on it we'll add a component
physics and rigid body and the rigid
bodies gonna one allow it to fall when
we instantiate the brief up just like
the other things we've crafted then we
can go component physics and a box
Collider so that it doesn't fall through
the terrain okay so that's the basis for
it now now originally we had a crafting
script on our web men player now we're
going to edit this script to make it so
that we can then create our new trap so
what we gonna do is we had so the player
prefabs appear was we had variables to
make it can pry it and
we're going to change this to trap and
obviously you can change that to trap
icon if you replace that later on now
we'll go to the G wise now you can see
we talked about ten here now here will
said that the content here is the spare
icon and then if you've used a set
amount of wood and stone will set trap
so the game object that we're talking
about up at the top to true so yes
that's all we need to do in the crafting
scrip because we did that before so
we're just saying that if we click the
actual button which has the spare icon
picture and it's got a tooltip and we've
got this amount of resources in the
infantry we'll be able to make sure that
we make the trap visible on the player
and then take away from the inventory so
if I show you know on the first person
controller again we can see that we have
the trap so we need the trap game object
here so what we can do is we're gonna
add trap player to that the spare icon
is going to be still the tenth icon and
what we can do to test this is so I'll
um take the actual object to appear now
if we press play you can see well I'll
make this maximise on play so it's
easier to see my first player I proceed
to craft and then you can see that
there's a spare item tooltip here if I
click that the object will appear and
you can see it in front of our character
as if we could create it now obviously
doesn't do anything because that just
makes it appear we need to I don't need
the script to do something with it so
okay what we'll do is in the scripts
will right-click and we'll create a new
JavaScript then we'll call this trap
build and then what we'll do is we'll
open this up in monodevelop
no we've done that what we're going to
want to do is I'll delete the two
starting functions and what we'll do is
we'll write variable this is going to be
very similar to the campfire build very
similar but with some slight differences
but I'll go through it again I'll say
trap prefab
as type transform and variable player as
type game object then I have a private
variable called can build let's type
boolean equal to true then we'll have a
function start two brackets and then two
curly brackets below and we'll so
renderer dot material dot color equals
color with the capital dot red with a
semicolon then we'll so renderer dot
material dot color dot air is equal to
not not 0.5 and then we'll write stop
writing player equals game object dot
find in quartz in the brackets first
person control and then we'll close up
another semicolon so what we're doing
here is as soon as we actually enable
the trap that's on our player we're
going to make sure that we change its
color to red to indicate that we can't
build it yet and we're going to change
its alpha or its transparent is to make
it slightly see-through and then we're
going to just add the we're going to
find the first person controller so it
adds it to the player slot automatically
for us now what we do is going to need
to make sure that when we go inside the
Collider with our object we're gonna may
need to make sure that we detect a
collision this whole we need to say
function on trigger enter open brackets
cull call on Collider then two curly
brackets below then we'll say that if
call dot now we need to make sure that's
a lowercase C because it sometimes
changes it to try and be helpful but
it's not so cold dot game object dot tag
is equal to
animal track and then we'll close that
up so that's the tag that we initially
set for the actual collider we'll add
two curly braket below that and we'll
just copy the to render a dot material
little lines above that we'll press them
in here and then we'll say color dark
green then we'll leave that in nicely
and we'll say can build is equal to true
now below here what we'll do is we'll
say function on trigger exit then open
brackets call call on Collider again
close that off at two curly brackets
below then we'll do pretty much copy the
same lines again paste those in and so
that if cold game object tag is equal to
animal track then we'll set it to red
again and we'll say that can build
equals false then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna just make an on update
function to detect one we can actually
build the item so if I have known save
function update to brackets two curly
brackets below then I'll say if input
don't get key down open brackets and
then in courts B for build close up
brackets then say and and can build is
equal to true then I'll add two curly
brackets below and I will say
instantiate open brackets trap
prefab comma player dot transform dot
position + vector 3 open brackets 0
comma 0 comma 5 so that's going to be
the position of where initially position
it away from the character then we're
going to say comma quaternion dot
identity close the open and a semicolon
then we'll say player dot getcomponent
open brackets crafting close the up dot
trap dot set active in brackets false
and we'll save that so initially what
I'll go through is that we've got two
variables which are the trap prefab and
the player and then we've got a better
boolean to detect whether we can build
the item or not a 1 the script initially
starts up when we make the item active
from the crafting script we're going to
make sure that it's read and we find the
player if we enter the collider which is
animal track we're going to change it to
green which makes it the same like oh
yeah we can build it now we're going to
say that can build is equal to true if
we exit the collider which is animal
track it's going to change it back to
red and we'll go oh we can't build it
now if we're on the update function if
we press B and we're inside it so we can
build and we're going to instantiate the
trap roof up at the player's position
five units on the XY and five units on
the Z which is further away from the
player and transform its position and
then we're going to say that player so
we're looking for the play which of the
FPS control we're looking for the
crafting script which is here and then
we're looking for the trap object which
is that game object here and then we're
going to say we're going to set it to
false so initially if we set it to false
at this script then doesn't exist
anymore so we can make it do anything or
build it again in the trap build script
it's best to make sure that the can
build is equal to false to begin with so
just
the top to false and when we go back
into unity what we'll do is we'll make
sure that our animal Collider has got
its box Collider on it's set to is
trigger and the mesh renderer is
disabled so that's all well and good
we'll check that the prefabs are all
okay so the prefab that's going to be
created has got a box Collider it's got
a rigidbody which uses gravity now on
the trap of player what we're going to
need is we've got that script on and we
need to drag the trap prefab onto there
if we are done already
we need to add a component physics and
rigidbody because to do a collision with
something something has to have a
rigidbody to detect it so well we don't
want to use gravity annex we don't it's
false or set is kinematic and then what
we'll do to make sure is well a lot of
physics and we'll add a box Collider to
it as well so then what we'll do is we
will press simply and then from play if
we open up the crafting career craft a
trap you'll see that it's red at the
moment if we go towards the box that
we've got you can see it goes green if
we go away and we press B we won't be
able to craft it now if I go back to my
animal tracks and I'll press B on it
we'll have instantiated a trap which can
just be placed on top of the animal
tracks for that instance and now we've
created that in the next tutorial what
we'll be able to do is on this prefab
we're going to create a controller which
is going to sort of randomize the
possibility of catching an animal
because sometimes you might not catch it
and it might just close up or disappear
all might be able to do something else
so that was just a way to set up the
initial bit of the animal trapping and
obviously this could be more complicated
but this is just the basis to show
everybody that you can start with
something really simple and go on
forever so thanks again for watching and
