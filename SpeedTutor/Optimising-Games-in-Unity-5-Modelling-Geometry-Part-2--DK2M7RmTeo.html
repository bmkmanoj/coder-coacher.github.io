tutorial today and even though this
looks like it's in 3dsmax
it's going to be covering the basics of
optimizing geometry our optimizing
models with inside a modeling program so
when you're looking to actually optimize
models within 3ds max or any modeling
program you want to make sure that
you're looking to reduce the poly count
where necessary or the triangle count
the vertex count however you want to
look at and you can see I have this
object selected on my left hand side
which is a cardboard box I've made then
you can see that it's made up of 4 to 5
triangles 24 vertexes and you can see
that I've got one at this side which is
made up of you know say let's say over
double the amount of vertexes and
triangles and there's no point to it
really just like with any object a lot
of this is very basic knowledge but I'll
just go through it to sort of show the
example so you can see on this side of
these edges that I I don't really need
in my object I can double click it
remove it and it really doesn't affect
the overall look of my object so I'll
delete those three edges out and we
pretty much get back to where we were in
this and it's not really affected
anything yet we've reduced the polygon
count by half that's just one example
just to literally look every model that
you make try and take the edges or the
triangle count down
so as low as possible whilst keeping the
shape and sort of the resolution that
you want for your object because it does
a really matter in this instance one
thing that I will mention for unity
specifically is that we want to look at
the vertex count even though that's a
little currently less than the triangle
count now every time we've got say a
normal map on an object or we use
smoothing groups on an object that's
going to be taken into account when we
go into unity and say that the vertex
count is only 24 in your
blink program and say we uv-map this I
call show you if I put an unwrapped on
this model you can see everywhere my
green edges are this is where there is a
seam that I have UV but my object and
that counts as a vertex split so will be
sort of doubling up the count when we go
back into unity and to make certain hard
edges it will again add to the vertex
count really people try and scare you
with polygon counts I don't think it's
as big an issue it's just remembered to
keep it as low as possible through well
one thing which is a big thing when when
I have made games and things like that
is say we get a cylinder and we want to
make this cylinder it's good to optimize
this with an idea of keeping it as low
as possible so we don't need any height
segments because that doesn't affect the
shape up that's all we can actually you
can see that it's currently 72 triangles
now and unless it's an asset which you
see in your face on what a lot of
companies call a hero asset something
that you will see up close on your you
might see it all the time is there is no
point this being so high because it was
only a small object you're gonna see you
could take the signs down and we could
make it yes it's going to look more boxy
but for the sake of this you can't even
really tell at first glance especially
if it's obviously not going to be
something really massive one thing that
I always like to do with items and
objects within when modeling and bring
it into unity say this card bar box is
never going to be that tipped upside
down or done anything it's always going
to be positioned like this within the
engine then what you can do is what we
could do is we could delete the bottom
from the actual object itself so they
will delete the bomb we've then
optimized the model further and we've
lost some triangles out at the bottom
and it's as simple as that
Sam similarly with the cylinder we do
the same we can grab the bottom if we're
never going to see the bottom
maybe if we're not going to see the top
where there were saving faces where they
might not be necessary and another
example of this if I take that back say
we're modeling something which geometry
intersects with other geometry let's say
what I'll do is I'll choke it this
object I'll just rotate it around 90
degrees and I'll sort of scale up so it
looks like you can see that maybe I've
made some pipes here this is just a
quick example and you can see that I've
put this pipe inside this pipe now you
notice like I said before so the polygon
which is here would be current would be
actually inside that all the mesh so
there's no point to having a face there
so we can again delete the face we're
optimizing the model we're just taking
some of the triangles aware because
you're never going to see it so what's
the point of it being there there's just
some key things to remember is to try
and lower polygon counts to the best
ability without affecting the shape
their overall form of the object when
you're making cylindrical objects and
things like that try and make them as
low as possible by removing edges where
they're really not necessary and if you
intersect objects with others and then
delete faces that are going to be hidden
and you'll never really see and one
thing like I mentioned earlier say you
have a hero ice it like I was mentioning
which one which should see up class
don't be worried to give it a few extra
polygons if it needs it consider this
object that I've got here then pretend
this is going to be my hero I said now
you've got to remember that this
probably this asset is probably higher
than maybe it needs to be and I don't
have objects that are this cylindrical
let's say but when I put edge faces on
you can see there's quite a lot of
polygons that make up their tall mesh
and yes sometimes it isn't necessary cuz
I could remove some of these and it
become more blocky but in instances
where people scare you and say a polygon
count is a big issue no yes it's an
issue but as long as you turn optimize
things to the best of your ability and
take things out where they're not
necessary some objects
be more high-poly because you can go to
hundreds of thousands even millions of
vertexes triangles however you want to
put it and still not have a perform a
performance issue it really depends on
what platform you're trying to aim your
game towards if it's a PC platform then
you can go into millions if it's a mile
bound platform it's going to be less
really it's just really dependent on
that and one good thing to use in the
future is say you're going to do a lot
of maybe
grungy materials are you're going to put
some graffiti on walls make sure that
you just make a plan within your
modeling program or you use the quad in
unity and literally use the kiss them
quad or this thing here because all it
is it's made up with pretty much two
triangles when you split this diagonally
and then that's going to be the lowest
thing when you want to put decals on
walls and things like that and you can
reuse that object without it being very
taxing at all so it's a really good idea
to reuse as many things just keep as low
as possible and they're just some really
quick tips on trying to get the most out
of modeling and optimizing for games so
