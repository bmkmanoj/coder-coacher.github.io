penta tutorial today and this is gonna
be showing you how to almost hide a part
of your model which you might have
brought in form an external 3d modelling
program but you might not want to use to
texture sets and so simply before get
started
I'd be using creating a simple alpha
channel in your actual channels over
here and then be able to sort of hide
the section that we don't want now
obviously you can do it by using
multiple texture sets which are used in
substance so if you see here on my
padlock I have got the main body here
with the sort of latch and then these
combination spinners are separate with
its own actual texture set so if I
uncheck those and I own tick the texture
set by that'll unhide the model but say
for instance as an example I want to get
rid of this latch but there's no real
way of me doing that and just in the
similar way that we actually mask off
areas by maybe using an ID map to
texture parts of our model say as in my
latch has an ID map and so does the main
body so then we can keep you know
different parts to the same model on one
texture for optimization sake we want to
be able to hide this part if I say want
to add some detail up here but I can't
really see what's going on so what we
really need to do is go to the viewer
settings we need to go to the shader
that we've got which is normally PBR
metal rough and then we want to go to
PDB our metal rough with alpha blending
and that will allow us to actually do
the opacity so what we can do is we go
back onto the texture set of settings
we'll go to the channels we can add a
new channel and then we can choose
opacity will add the opacity to our
actual list of channels on whatever the
thing that you might have we can add a
potentially a new fill layer and I will
put this inside my
masked area which is for the lock I'll
put it above my original material that
I've got and you'll notice that because
it's just a fell layer or just being a
white what we can do is we can get rid
of all the other channels that are on it
leave the opacity channel so actually
wouldn't do anything because it is full
white at the moment so it's not actually
affecting everything now if we knock
this all the way down to black you can
see that it's now disappeared really the
model is still there but for the sake of
this now we could potentially start
painting on to this object and if I
bring up the UV mode and you need to
access apart if I start painting
so with that invisible if I go to my
sort of main body that I've got here and
I will add a standard this is some paint
layer inside my folder and I'll bring it
up to the top and I will just add solve
this plastic that I've got and I can
start painting over here and I can start
painting over the areas that I may have
had a problem with and say you might
have a more complex model and the thing
that we've just actually cut out with
the Alpha with the opacity is still
there in itself so it might block you
for me being able to paint it's only a
sort of superficial way to hide it just
while you're working so you might need
to work on your actual UV map itself
rather than on the actual model if
things again in the way when you're
painting because you've got to imagine
it is still there in the background
we're just hiding it with the opacity
you can duplicate the Alfred layer that
we've got and you can bring it into the
main body of something else and you know
we can do exactly the same thing and we
can fade it easily like that if we need
to hide and show different things
depending on what we might be working on
so I thank you very much for watching
