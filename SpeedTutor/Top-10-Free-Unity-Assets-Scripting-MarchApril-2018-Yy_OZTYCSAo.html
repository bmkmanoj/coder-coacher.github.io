assets for March April 2018 so no more
is the 360 screenshot capture tool this
a plugin allows you to create a 360
screenshots from just during gameplay
and its outputs and images injected with
XMP metadata so it supports 360 viewers
on the way up and out of the box like
flat Facebook and Flickr and it should
work on all platforms and devices that
support rendering to cubemap and it
supports JPEG and PNG format and the
next one is something called Nvidia
highlight and it visit and video
highlights is a feature of the G Fox
experience that allows you to enable
automatic video capture of key moments
kills award ring and plays and things
like that and it allows people to easily
share and create videos gifts
screenshots and uploading direct to
Facebook YouTube and other places like
that and it's been included into a lot
of popular big big games so if you're
looking to incorporate you know more of
a high-end feature like this
it might be something for you and the
next one is the VR Watson speech sandbox
and this is a sample application that
demonstrates how to incorporate voice
commands and speech recognition into a
virtual reality soft situation and this
allows you to do as it suggests add
Watson functionality with AI created by
IBM and it might be something you want
to look into if you're interested in the
VR applications and bringing sort of
more real-life elements to them and the
next one is the in-game debug console
and it looks like this developer has
created a few of these assets and this
helps you see debug messages which could
be logs warning errors exemptions in the
runtime when you're in the actual build
and it's just rewarding to sort of draw
call it can be minimized to a pop up and
always can be registering custom
commands to the console so it's quite
easy if you want to be able to have
something that's visible within your
game without you having to either
have the connoisseur somewhere else and
it might help you out for debugging and
testing purposes and the next one is
something called mobile ads and how
allows you to easily integrate the code
with itself maybe a one-line few lines
of code with just importing the SDK
along with this and it allows you to
have the biggest popular ad platforms
and have a really easy way to implement
this to Android and iOS
just like with unity ads and other
things and it has the specific ad types
available and it has full documentation
for you to have a look and the next one
is something called FPS counter and as
it suggests it's a lightweight FPS
counter for showing FPS and it has a
keyboard inputs to show and hide this
little pop-up and it's good say if you
build out your game and you want
something to track the FPS at certain
points you might not be able to bring
out the sort of debugging tools right
inside of unity so this might be
something for you just to show the FPS
and you can see where you might be
dipping in performance and this next one
is something called VR corrector another
VR asset and if this package tries to
eliminate the delay between the head
rotation and what you see on the VR
headset screen as there's an so if
there's no delay you might not feel as
nauseous and it does suggest that there
is a disadvantage that it starts to get
a little bit jittery but it depends
which way you're trying to correct the
VR so if you've had a problem it might
be something to look into
but I can give any recommendations and
the next one is something called mesh
slicer free and this is a free limited
version of the mesh slicer and character
slicer and you can use it to try out how
it works and see if you might like it
and it allows you just as it suggests
and you can see from the video here you
can slice objects I don't know how it
works but maybe if the objects in
several paths and last but not least
we've got an asset cop discard 'ti and
it's a solution for those who want to
integrate discard rich presence within
unity and it allows you to use the
discard RPC plugin which you can get
from github and connect your game to the
desk to the discard desktop claim which
would run low
and it allows you to show what you're
playing on your profile launch a game
request open up spectator mode and do
some functionality which should
relatively see in discard and apply that
within unity are your game so these were
the top scripting assets farm March
April 2018 so be sure to check out all
these and all the other assets from this
month and be sure to thank all the
developers for creating these great
assets for free so I think's again for
watching don't forget to Like comment
