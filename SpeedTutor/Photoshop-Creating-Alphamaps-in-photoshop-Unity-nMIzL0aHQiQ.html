how to make an alpha map from images
that you've got so I've got this image
think of some CG textures and what I
want to do is have it so if I apply it
to a plane a door action not just the
background it can work with any image
you've just got to follow a certain set
of rules to make it work it can be often
used with foliage sometimes fence meshes
things that you don't want to have to
model if there's gonna be a lot of it or
something that just doesn't need to be
modeled so what we're going to do is
we're gonna actually make a new channel
in our channels and what we can do is we
click the little button down the bottom
here which makes a new channel which
makes a new alpha Channel and we're
going to click on back to RGB and then
hi and hide the Alpha I'm gonna go back
to our layers gun press ctrl-a to select
all and ctrl C to copy the image go back
to channels choose the Alpha Channel
again and press control V and then what
we do is we paste that image into the
Alpha Channel and what we want to do
from here is go to image adjustments in
verb because the where alphas work is
anything that's dark or black you won't
see and anything that's why you want to
see you want to actually see this leaf
but noise background so what I want to
do is good image adjustments and then
curves and then change it so the leaf is
totally white and the background is dark
as it possibly can be then we want to do
is it doesn't really matter but we can
go back onto the igb layers and what we
want to do then is save it out and we
can call it a leaf water something when
I say that as a Targa save that out
32-bit pixels okay minimize that and
then if I show you how it works in unity
so if I'm parting you asset in part leaf
one
and you can see it's got the white
background on it we drag that onto our
plane we don't see any difference
because it's just a diffuse share that
we go on transparent cutout diffuse you
can see now that we've actually lost
that white background and what we can do
is by using the Alpha cutoff we can
actually scrub it across so we lose if
we take it down we'll get the Alpha back
but if we take it all the way to the
other end we'll cut out most of the area
that we didn't want so you can literally
use that as many times as you desire
in your scene to make whatever you want
to make so pretty much that's just the
basics of making an alpha map for any
image as long as you remember that the
dark area is what you don't see and then
the way is what you don't see Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
