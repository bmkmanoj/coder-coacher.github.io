tutorial today and this is gonna be
something we're gonna look at doing a
solve little ghost cam or a lot of fly
cam that you see sometimes than if no
you want to sort of have a little roll
around in your game without having to
you know literally zoom in like this you
can just I'll give you the example here
it is the arc of his pearl volume five
and you can see I can just move around
in it like a sort of local ghost camera
and I can move up and down with Q and E
and just fly around and potentially
press shift and I can adjust all the
settings just to be able to solve
flutter around and do those things okay
so you want to find yourself I go to the
unify wiki and I will leave a link in
the description and you can look for the
flight cam extended and the extended fly
cam is by Desi Quinton's and this is
quite a nice little one and what this
script allows you to do is like I said
is use the WASD keys to move Q and E to
move up and down shift or control to
move faster and slower respectively it
will lock it controller this is a
slightly older script but it still works
efficiently all it does is hey it's got
it tries to lock the mouse cursor at the
start but this code would likely need
updating I do have a video to show you
how you can lock your in unity 5 and
above so it does it does the X&amp;amp;Y
rotation based on your mouse movement of
x and y and then based on the camera
sensitivity and tunnel time helps you
move it it will do some local transforms
to rotate the angles of the Y and the X
in the up in the left directions and
then if you're pressing left shift it
will speed you up by doing the trans
fall forward and transform forward and
right based on some movement speeds the
you viewing it and it will if you're not
doing that and you're pressing the left
control you must be trying to slow down
so we're going to do that by a factor
depending on the access that axis that
we're currently moving in and then if
not you just gonna be WASD and you're
just going to be moving forward and
right with the normal speed and you'll
be moving around and then if you decide
to press Q ie is going to do a similar
thing where it's going to transform your
position up or down based on the climb
speed that was specified and if you
press the N key that it's going to
decide to lock or hide your cursor
so all you will need to do is when you
go back in soon as you can just
right-click cran you see sharp script
and then when you've got your new script
you can essentially just paste
everything in here and paste its trends
the script and you don't need to do any
modification or movements and what you
don't want to have is just a camera by
itself which is I've got a camera here
you can just go game object and add a
camera to your scene if you don't
already and you can just add the
extended flycam script make sure that
it's spelt the same as what you've got
in the class of the script so this is
just called extended fly camp with both
of the words uppercase and then the
canvas lowercase but you can change that
as you need to
so you can adjust the sensitivity of the
camera the climb speed the normal move
speed the slump factor speed and then
the fast move speed so what you can do
is you can set the sensitivity so maybe
you know the sensitivity previously was
too too high we can say that's 50 we can
set the climb speed and the same for
moving up and down we can keep the
normal move speed at 10 you can maybe
take down the factor of the fast move
speed and like I said we can just go in
and straight away as long as it's just
an ax camera by itself we can then
control everything that's going on in
this scene with the QE and whatever else
and we can just fly around and do
whatever we need to do so you can this
can help you just have a nice sort of
look around you've seen without you're
having to sort of use an FPS control and
solve if you need to get into really
sort of dark areas and you want to see
just things in the corner you can easily
do that so this was a great little
scripture so you can fly around in the
unity editor so thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like and
