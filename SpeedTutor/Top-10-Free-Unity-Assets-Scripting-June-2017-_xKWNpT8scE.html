assets for June 2017 so no mom we've got
the polar if AI free for movement and
this claims to be a saw of state avea AI
system which allows you to set up the AI
in just a few clicks are one click
specifically and it's oriented to be
sort of easy to use and usable very
performant and it comes with a lot of
custom behaviors so you can take a look
at this if you are looking to you know
stick with a free version and you can go
with twelve interact ability world
interact with collisions and
multi-threading and all the special
things like that and number two is the
2d online free which is a game template
for a multiplayer style game which is
almost like a tank cell game play
without it suggest the modifications of
the tank based on another particular
game and we'll give you examples and
show you the workings of how you can go
and achieve this yourself number three
is the vide dialogues light and this
solve will help you create a dialogue
system and it's easy to set up and
incorporate with many different nodes
and you can add sprite text a lot of
different things and you can go with the
more advanced version of this and you
can create complex and discussions
dialogues with this system all directly
inside of unity number four is a fire
propagation and it's to add fire and
elements to the terrain and it sort of
interacts in real time and realistically
based on so if you want to burn a
building grass and it's designed to be
fully implemented and featured in gr
projects easily and has a sort of
realistic behavior of what fire would do
so I think that's quite a cool note in
my I've never sort of seen before and
again it is free so you maybe want to
check that out and number five is the
color picker triangle and it allows you
to add at something which is a just
triangle color picker which you'll see
in a lot of different programs and allow
you to sort of create a functionality
based on that it's all using just a
shade
without any sort of text to the top so
and my vehicle thing for you to
implement number six is an asset from
Unity Technologies themselves and it's
an endless-runner sample game which is
just a cold trash - and it's optimized
for Marvel and it helps you sort of go
through some core functionality with
object pooling and resetting your assets
and using all the bundles within that
and helping you giving you an example of
how you can create yourself an endless
run again for a mobile platform and
number seven is the free turret script
and this helps you create a to access to
it which can be functional and can be
easily customized between what weapons
or system you might already have and
helps you target specific objects in the
world if you are looking to add some
self-belief ability to your scene and
number eight is the MS a vehicle system
free and it is pretty much a free
version of the premium cast system which
includes the controller fund then gears
skid marks and a simple system for you
know staring and the sounds of the
vehicle and helps you sort of create
some physics and functionality for a
basic driving situation and number nine
is Zeno prefs and this is similar to
preferences but this is a custom one
which allows you to save the player
preferences file to an actual file
rather than saving it to the registry
where you can actually access it very
easily and all the so data is still
encrypted so it's still easy to use and
access and number 10 is the Bui
and number 10 is Bui which stands for
their basic UI system and allows you to
create simple UIs with a saw with a
boxed base UI system and it allows you
to have basic functionality like simple
messages warnings when you feel complete
something only using a very few finite
amount of lines and it's got unlimited
customizability and you can just add
boxes in UI elements really easily so if
you're looking for a slightly more
simplified version of the UI system
which might help you
I never want to check this out again
thanks so much for watching and you can
