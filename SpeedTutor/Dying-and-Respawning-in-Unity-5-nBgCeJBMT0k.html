you told today and this is going to be
focusing on dying and respawning now
we're going to just do a simple
application of this so you imagined that
in my scene right now is we've got some
sort of their planks we could do in a
sort of platformer game and I've got
some water and you've got to imagine
that if you fall into this water you
know it could be poisonous or and I have
shouts or something and you could die
when you actually touch it
it could be a parent for a 2-d game a 3d
game whatever you want to do but you
want to find about where to respawn the
character or move its position back to
somewhere that you've won so if you
imagine now the player starts on these
beams and you can move across and if you
fall off then we're going to do
something so how we're going to do this
we're going to need a Collider I trigger
at first when we hit that trigger we're
going to kill the player so I'm going to
first off I'm going to create a cube and
I'm going to sort of put it to the level
of the water then I'm going to just
scale it out so encapsulate it's
probably everywhere that we can move for
the most part you can make it as big or
as small as you need it to be and then
I'll pull it down to where the water is
I can potentially get rid of mesh
renderers so we just leave the trigger
like that we want to say that is trigger
we want to make sure that our character
is a tag of player if not already make
sure that it is and once we've got that
we can call this respawn trigger and
then what want to do is want to create a
respawn point and when we create the
script that we're going to do we could
use this over and over so you could
respawn at different checkpoints let's
say but for this instance we're going to
occur game object create empty and we're
going to create an empty game object and
you can see the empty game object is
just about here I'm going to play say
I'm going to solve play set roughly
where my character is and make sure that
lightly above it just so that when you
spawn in you don't spawn too close to
the object and fall through it so once
we've done that we've got two things
we've got the trigger and we've got will
call this respawn point one and then
from that we're going to create a simple
script so right click create c-sharp and
then we're going to call this and just
call it respawn it doesn't really matter
if it can be called whatever you feel
that needed to be called then open up in
Visual Studio or monodevelop whichever
program you're using and then what I'm
going to do is I'm going to get rid of
the two starting methods that we have so
in this side the initial class going to
say void on trigger enter and then in
brackets collider and then other I'm
going to have two curly brackets below
that and then just before that what
we're going to do is we're going to
reference the player and reference a
spawn point that we're going to one as
in the things that we just created so
I'm just going to put some square
brackets and write serialize field
because I'm going to write two private
variables but I don't need them to be
public because I don't need to access
them from anywhere else and I want them
still to be seen in the inspector so if
I use serialize field it helps me do
that so I can put private transform and
I'll call this player and then I will do
another square brackets then serialize
field in there and also private
transform and then call this respawn
point and what I would like to do is
just shove them up together so the
nicely aligned then what I'm going to
write inside the Andre or enters within
the set up player dot transform with a
lowercase T this time dot position will
be equal to the respawn point will be
equal to the respawn point dot transform
dot position so it's pretty simple
really all we're doing is we're saying
that when we hit the Collider we're
going to make sure that the
players transform positions to the
players x y&amp;amp;z position are going to be
just the same as the respawn points
position and then what we can do is save
that out we can find our respawn
triggers that we created earlier we can
add our script to that and then it's
going to be asking for our player and
the respawn point that we want so we can
add the FPS controller that I already
had in the scene and you can bring that
in from the standard assets and you can
use you can add a spawn point one as
well so now when we test this out and we
press play so notice that I can play the
game I can run around and potentially do
all the platforming that I need to do
but if I fall into the water
you can see that I instantly respond and
I can do it again
I have spawned back into the position
that we previously were obviously you
might have some problems where say I'm
doing this and I'm still running unique
and just you can keep on moving because
you forget the response he could
disabled and players movement while
you're respawning and similarly if you
duplicated this Collider here and put it
over here and then had another spawn
point which could be spawn point 2 you
could have multiple sort of checkpoints
so if you fell off back here and you
would then respawn up here and they do
is just realistically duplicate this
Collider and that'd be fine
and just make sure they don't overlap so
pretty much that's the beylin end-all of
creating a simple sort of respawn point
for again that might be a simple
platformer you just transforming the
players position to the position that
you want with an empty game object so
thanks for much for watching don't
