Penta related tutorial and I'm going to
show you how that you can install or add
your own materials things that you might
have added from substance designer you
might have got them from substance share
game textures calm
awesomesauce from the company who were
actually behind substance itself you
will get a wide range of materials
throughout the internet and when you
download them they'll become in two
particular formats
they'll come in SBS AR and SP SM now the
most common public format you'll find is
the first one the SBS AR which is just a
basic material type with no extra sort
of layers added to them in terms of if
they've added sort of any grunge
overlays or any other elements to it
whereas the SP sm is something that
would be a smart material which might
already have a grunge is already applied
to that material so it just depends
where you've got them from and how you
want to use them so fairly it's both
fairly standardized when it comes to
installing them into substance itself
and what you get if you can see in the
sort of hierarchy that's got I've got an
iron rusty SBS AR and a fabric military
SP sn-1 is a smart material on one is a
normal material now what we'll do is
I'll copy the first the normal material
that we've got and we want to find a way
to install these so usually we'll have
to navigate to whatever a PC usually
your documents documents and substance
painted to and you will never get to
that folder and you will click on shelf
and then you will get a list of folders
in here and this is where you all use
things from your shelf will be added
that you will add you know yourself
really and what you can do is you can go
to your materials folder and you can see
my materials folder is full of SBS AR
files and they're all the standard
materials that I might have downloaded
from cher sauce and the like and what
you can do is you can right-click and
tastehh I am rusty there I already have
it my folder but that doesn't matter you
can go back to materials folder and copy
the smart material the SPSS and you can
press back and then you can go to your
smart materials folder and if you need
to you can paste that in there through
that folder with all those materials and
when you open up substance painter you
can check out your smart materials and
your materials and if it's a new actual
material that you've wanted to actually
bring in yourself and it might take up
one particular material might take a
long time to actually load so we added I
am rusty which is this material here and
in our smart materials we added a new
woodland and these are the range of
Woodlands I already have here so really
all it is a simple way is when you
download them or create them from
designer you need to make sure that the
going documents substance tend to and
inside the correct folder in the Shelf
and then when you open substance you'll
be able to see them within it you might
need to close and reopen substance if
and you dragged it and drag the material
files in whilst it was open or it might
not read the file from the actual
directory so thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
