miscellaneous assets for January 2018
and like I did with the models video
it's just gonna be a real off of a quick
list of all the different assets that I
found for this month and there's a whole
selection of great great stuff so you
should check it all now a newborn is the
draw physics shapes 2d and it's a
tutorial project which actually allows
you to give you an example of how to
draw shapes with the cursor similar to
in credit box or something along us
along that style allows you to click in
the scene and just start drawing so this
might what if you are trying to learn
how to do specific functionality there
might be some good code in there for you
to be able to draw on the screen and you
know just create some complex gameplay
mechanics out of that and number two is
the an improv a demo and it's a series
of professional mock-ups and pieces of
animation for fighting movements and
animations suitable for a game whether
plot action platformer hack-and-slash
anything like that includes 10-minute
animations which include an idle kick
punch Tom - Crouch
air attack and walking and it also
includes one skin model a mesh and all
animations are FBX Pharma for 60 FPS so
this might be a nice one if you're
looking to get into adding a few
different nations to your character and
third one is the curved space shader and
it's a simple shader that allows you I
don't know I'm gonna know the correct
from the correct terminology behind this
but it lets you put game objects in a
specific space with a constant and
positive curvature and allows you to
manipulate them with four-dimensional
rotations so if that sounds like it'd be
something for you it might be worth
checking out and you can check out the
puzzle game that was created with the
use of this header so maybe that will
give you some ideas of how it could you
use and the next one is the 2d breakout
example project and this is an asset for
learning processes and you can have
and learn how to do the sort of 2d Brit
Breck GIMP you know you move your little
paddle around and you hit the ball and
it will eventually break these objects
and then you get a scar and win at the
end and the next one is an asset called
gradient sky and it's a simple
customizable gradient sky useful for
platformer type games and it's
procedurally generated so there's no
need for textures and it's got fast
performance on the GPU so it's created
with a procedural mesh and you can
configure the gradient in the inspector
and you can see the example here so you
can fully adjust the gradient as you go
along and the next one is realistic
glitches light and this package is a
collection of post-processing shedders
and imitating sort of the glitchy
effects of those are cream sees where
you see you know you might get that
fizzling on your screen it comes with a
bunch of actual sort of camera effects
which include a scanner attended color
bleeding corrupted via round unsink and
CRT so it comes with a whole host of
sort of different ideas glitches things
like that that might be suitable for you
and the next one is Sunnyland forests
and I think I probably featured a couple
of these from this natural and developer
and it's a complete pixel art package
for a platformer game includes two
layers with a parallax background a tail
set of sixteen by sixteen and the seven
different Pro Payton's decorate scene
seven different animations for the main
character and three different animated
enemies and the next one is the tower
defense template from unity it's a
template for the unities tower defense
game template and it provides a simple
the polished example of how to create a
tower defense game the template serves
as two purposes is to provide an example
but a solid base which you can build on
and make a more complex tower defense
game if you choose to do so and it's got
a full written manual which you can
learn how it was made and following the
link available and the next one is
something called the jelly shader and
it's a simple shared and a c-sharp
script that you can turn any 3d model
into a properly jelly-like substance so
it's highly customizable with sliders
with it you can adjust the frequency
amplitude the distortion the speed the
wave speed but that's a pretty cool
if you choose to want to make some sort
of jelly it could be wobbly jelly on a
plate that might be a really cool thing
to create so this shader might be for
you and the last one last but not least
is the space shooter free and this is of
a waffle version and it's just a free
version of the spare shooter pack which
includes the graphics c-sharp the
scripts play controllers demo scene and
documentation this includes one player
ship and weapon customized by an in
movement suitable and optimized for
mobile for planet backgrounds a parallax
nebulizer and star background with one
enemy and one weapon system weapon
upgrades and it's fully documented with
all the visual effects and animations
that you'll see so again sorry I had to
do this in slightly a different style
because this is using the updated
version of the Unity star which I don't
really like as much for visually present
in it because itself does pop outs in it
which is not as easy to navigate I'll
try and I saw I will leave a link the
description for all the great
miscellaneous assets and all the other
assets that you can find for this month
of January it's an absolute fantastic
month for what people have been giving
away so be sure to check all these out
and give the developers a thumbs up for
everything that they do so thanks again
