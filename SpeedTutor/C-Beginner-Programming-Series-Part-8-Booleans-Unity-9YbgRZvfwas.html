another part of the beginner c-sharp
series and this is gonna be looking more
thoroughly at billions now we've covered
it a few times in the other scripts that
we've done and a boolean Allah is is a 1
R 0 R a true and false and you might
want to use this in a lot of different
elements when you're writing code and it
might be to check something to not make
something happen unless something is
true or false and you know it's a nice
way to just manage the code and you know
think of something that you might want
to do so we'll start off from or write a
new script soulguard Chrissie sharp
script and I will call this boolean z'
and we'll use this as just a sort of an
example script problem that in visual
studio or mono developer whatever you've
got and then we'll start and we've got
our beginning class now what we can do
is I'll get rid of the two functions
that start there because we're just
going to sort of start for the beginning
so now we're done before we can of
public and private variables and you
know we can do different things there so
what I'll do is I'll start by writing a
boolean source right public bull and we
can say that public ball is true so if
we save that out we go to unity and we
go into the player let's say and I just
drag that on to the player bulletins
there you can see that is true is
available in the inspector and you can
tick it and it'll be true if your own
ticket would be false and we can do
different things depending how are you
want to use that you can start writing
void stamp to brackets and two curly
brackets below and you can do things
like say you originally start there yes
them and you run this script you want to
say that is true is equal to true so
what will happen here is that normally
when it starts or as we are in just in
the editor it's not actually true but
when we press play we expect scene
the start function the start function
happens as soon as this script is active
and we run the game we expect that to
have a ticket I'll become true and you
can see that now it is true so we can do
little things with that you know we can
do different than we can write am
private ball is happening this is just
sort of some examples you won't be able
to see that in the inspector unless you
serialize the field but that's not
something I'll really go into today if
you do that you can google it and you
know you can then see private variables
in the inspector you know so you'd be
able to taken across them but the public
one just allows us to maybe access them
from other scripts and that's probably
what you like to do you know further
down the line so say in the in the stat
you know we can do exactly the same
thing so the looking set is happening
equal to true as well and it will be
just solve it will be encapsulated to
this class if it's private so we don't
have to use it anywhere else and it
doesn't get confusing now we can do
other things so say we need to check
something in our void update for
instance we'll just do this similar
thing and we need to say that maybe on
our void update we want to do something
like this is just a brief example we can
use debug log and then I say I'm
activated with in quartz in a bracket a
semicolon and what this will do is that
it'll post
I'm activated a lot of time into the log
and they'll just keep on going forever
and ever and you can see at this site
you can see it's stacking up because
it's doing whatever frame rate this game
is all doing and one of these calls are
one of the update calls every frame so
you see it's just stacking up a long way
but you know we might not want to do
that all the time and that might not be
the logic that you want for your game so
what you could potentially do is that we
could say that f is true
in brackets we can have two curly
brackets below just to encapsulate the
statement that we've said so what we
want to say that if it's true if that's
true then we want to do this and what we
could do is we could say one could say
that is if is happening with tutela
brackets below we can potentially say
something else we could set this to is
happening and I'll give you the example
that when you're a solver understanding
the boolean's when you write them in the
script is if you write in the in the
brackets if and you just write the
actual variable name itself that will
just mean true is it set to true if you
put an exclamation mark before the sort
of declaration name of your boolean it
will make it will ask if it's false cuz
the exclamation mark sort means do the
opposite to what it originally is so in
this case we'll say that if is true is
false it will say I'm activated if is
happening am is equal to true they'll do
is happening so I'll have a little look
at that in the game so we can see that
because it's true is currently true we
expected it to be false for it to report
anything but is happening is happening
all the time because we kept that
variable to true in the start function
now if I set this to false you will see
that now because it's running they'll
run both of those lines you know we can
do something if we control this so we
could say that if you know it's true is
false for instance we could say that
debug log I'm activated then we could
say that is happening we want that to be
four to false when this happens which
means that this statement won't be equal
to true anymore it'll set it to false
because the star only works at the
beginning and then the update works all
the time
and you just need to apply this logic to
anything that you do so what I'll do is
I'll set this to put public
so we can see so you can expect that if
it's true is false will it will start
posting I'll activate it but then it
will say that is happening is equal to
false and if that's the case due to RF
statement then it wants per posting this
line anymore so what we'll do is we will
play again I'll clear this I'll press
play and you can see that is happening
is actually running because that's what
the boolean now we wanted to say that if
it's true is equal to false it should
automatically set it's happening to
false so what this means is that it's
happening now stopped because we told it
to be false and I'm activated is now
running because that's the boolean that
we were after it's not necessarily good
to put a debug dot log line always in
you know say up there or any of the code
it's just good for debugging purposes
but you know you just want to be able to
manage your boolean for what you've got
and then be able to change them
according to the code so all you have to
do is write the variable name set equal
to true or false you can write checks to
check whether it's true or false you can
declare at the top as public or private
and you can write it pretty much
anywhere in your script to make some
logic be on or off depending on what you
want to do okay so I'll give you a
another example is that we could do it
with let's say I go to the trigger event
script that we did and you can see that
here we've got something which sets the
components true and false but I'm not
really concerned about this for now I'm
just concerned about the trigger event
that we've got so if I give you a solve
maybe a practical example is that say
we've got public and I'll call this game
object
maybe Cuban and public game object cube
- now we've got that we've got cube 1
and cube 2 noble born to do something
with that so we want to decide when we
should be able to deactivate and
activate Cuban and cube 2 without having
to have you know many different scripts
and things like that
so we could potentially add a public
boom as cube boom and what we could say
that here is that if cube boom and I
will leave it just with its name which
will said that if cueball is equal to
true we'll say that cube 1 dot set
active is set to false but what we could
also do is say that else cube 2 dot set
active is false so what this is meaning
is that if cube bowl is ever equal to
true we'll set cube 1 to false and if
there's anything else so if cue ball is
um false so if cube bull was like this
are the term along the plane it will set
cube 2 to false so we can give this a
test we can see it on our trigger event
you can see that cube bowl bull is equal
to false currently I will there's cube -
I will create one cold cube 1 so you can
see it that woman - now I go to the
trigger I'm just gonna add cube 1 &amp;amp; 2
and what we expect to do is from this
code if we walk into the trigger and
it's the player that walks into the
trigger if cube bowl is equal to true
then we'll set this set the cubes 1 cube
to false now F cube Bowl is equal to
false then we'll set cube 2 in this
instance when we walk through the
collider cube bolt a bool is equal to
false to begin with
so we should do cover this elves else
statement and it should deactivate cube
too so what we'll do is we'll go into
that walk into the trigger and you'll
see that cube 2 was deactivated now
similar if we now set cue ball to true
and we press play
we expect to number 1 to disappear
because that's what we wanted to do you
could even do a similar thing here so
you could say that when you walk into
this trigger here you could say that you
want cube or to be equal to true when
you walk into the collision and then
what we could do is we could then run
our own custom function we could just
call this cubes with two brackets an SME
column and then underneath this
second-to-last curly bracket will write
void cube to brackets into curly
brackets below and what we want to same
cube is will cube sorry we will say that
if cube
boom and is true like that then we 1
cubed 1 dot set active is false and cube
- so active is false so it pretty much
does the same things apart from the fact
that when we walk into the collision it
will set cube Bowl which is normally
false to true and then when we straight
after that line that we've just done
that it will run this line run to this
function and I'll say is cube all true
and we'll go yet because we've just
changed it so now you'll turn those two
things off if you see here well so what
we test it we need to make sure cube
bool is false so when we play it nothing
happens it when we walk into the trigger
the both get deactivated because it
became true and it run that next
function and the lines of code in there
now the reason why I put it in its own
function here
it's cursor we could put it like in here
in the update function and we're
checking every frame if it needs to be
true or not it's not necessarily a good
way to check in the update function if
something is true unless it's something
that needs to be updated all the time
because if you just check in its own
function this is only run pretty much
one time and that's very well sort of
optimized but like I said it really
depends what you're doing if it's
something like you need to update some
numbers on the screen or you need to
check whether you know your stamina has
gone down if all I want to do end up
there because you need to be updating it
all the time so it gives visual feedback
to the player but where is this only
required you know a few lines of code
executed once solve and sequentially one
after another and it just makes it
easier and more manageable as you get
you know further down in your
development cycle you can now set this
billions private because you don't need
to see in the inspector just to keep it
more refined and we're just changing and
managing boolean's as we go along so I
hope this may be clades up some things
and sort of iined out some issues that
might have had when needing to check
when things are true Awful's so thanks
very much for watching don't forget to
