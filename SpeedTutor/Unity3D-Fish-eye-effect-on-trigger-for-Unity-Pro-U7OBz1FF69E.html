somebody wanted to make which you could
use in a horror game or something like
that and it's about activating a fisheye
effect all similar when you enter a
trigger so all I've got is a box in my
scene and it's box with a box Collider
and it's tagged as is trigger now on
your first person control you need to
make sure that's got a tag of player and
you know you can add a new tag down
there now you know this isn't going to
try and be as quick as possible because
it's fairly simple and I have covered
stuff like this many times so if you
create new JavaScript and call it and
fisheye trigger then what we'll do is
open up in monodevelop and then what I'm
going to do is delete these two stanton
functions right private variable fisheye
as type fish I like that but watch the
upper case and lower case and not then
I'm going to say function start two
brackets two curly brackets below and
then say the fish eye with a capital e
lower case F equals game object dot find
up and bracket scores min camera close
that up getcomponent
open brackets and fish eye with a
capital F lowercase e with the semicolon
then we'll say that fish eye dot enabled
equals false so that's it for now so
we're just referencing the fish eye
script and then we motion its false at
the beginning then we're going to say
funk and on trigger enter open brackets
call a call on Collider closed those two
brackets up add two color brackets below
and so that if call dot tag is equal to
quarts player close that up add two
curly brackets below then what we'll set
is fish i dot enabled equals true then
we'll say
yield weight for seconds then we'll say
in brackets 1 for 1 second then we'll
say fish I got enabled equals false and
then also destroy game object close up
and add a semicolon we'll save that out
and we'll go back into unity now and
then we'll add the fish I trigger to our
Collider and then what we'll need to do
is actually add the fish I script to the
main camera so if you've got main camera
lingo component in Majer facts fish
alley then you might want to change the
fish eye to about not point 5 and then
press player obviously nothing happens
until we walk into the collider that
something changes where it's a second
goes aware and the colliders disappeared
so it's a one-time thing you can office
to change this so it lasts longer you
know you don't have to destroy the
collider so it happens every time this
depends what you want to do but that's
just a simple way of also yet not
enabling sibling sort of images image
effects on a Collider so thanks very
much for watching and if you liked the
