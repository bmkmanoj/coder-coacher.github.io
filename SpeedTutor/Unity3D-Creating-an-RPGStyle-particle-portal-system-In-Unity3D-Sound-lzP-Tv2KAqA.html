how to make a sort of animated portal
system now this is a nice thing as think
it's often used in like RPGs and things
like that when you step on a platform or
something and you get teleported
somewhere else and it's a really nice
and easy thing to make that you can use
in your games and with this tutorial I'm
not really going to go into mounds of
detail with creating the particle
effects and how i made other assets if
you want to know how to make other
assets like this this plinth all this
you know teleport platform and all the
particle effects in more details leave a
comment or send me a message and I'll do
a little tutorial on that as well but
really with my seen all my scene is is
like before it's just some terrain with
my object on it I've got a first-person
controller a directional light and I've
got a set of particles and I'll go over
briefly and what three different
particles are now I've got a normal
particle which is looks like this and
all that is is using the sparkles
material from the standard assets
particle pack which comes with the unity
and if you'd care if you don't have that
all you want to get there you can right
click import package and choose
particles and you can find that material
in there and then I've just got some
same settings going along with that so
it's in a cone shape about an eight or
nine radius you can emit from the base
and then my emission rate is 28 and then
the other settings it lasts five seconds
start life 16 start speed 17 and
everything's pretty much standard and
then you get a particle effect which
goes into the air and up but just a
basis to what we're going to do I've got
a secondary particle which is another
one just to you know add more effect to
it so it's very similar to the other one
but it's got sparkles to
and you know you can see all these
settings on Thea everything is very very
simple the shapes corn again with the
same settings emission 28 like the
others I think the settings are exactly
the same but just with another particle
effects of the both work together so if
I select them both you know you can see
the making our nice glittery globe no
Paul stone or whatever you want to call
it that's pretty simple i'll stop these
so we don't seem and then I've got one
of the particle effect which is going to
be my teleport particles so when you
step what we're going to do is when we
step on the actual platform it's going
to stop the particles that flat fly in
the air and sort of give another
particle effect similar simulate you
actually about to travel so that's
pretty much it for the particle effects
and things so we'll move straight into
it so what we're going to need to do is
we're going to need an actual collider
that when we step on this platform we're
going to be teleported somewhere or
you'll do something so what I like to do
is if I click on that and we've gone
game object create other then cube now
we're just going to create a cube for
ease of this tutorial and the cube is
just going to represent our collider
what we'll do is we'll get remove the
mesh render by clicking on that and then
click and remove and what we can do is
then scale this Collider all the way up
we go on the y-axis we can see you know
we can just scale it how everyone bring
up so it's you know so it fits nicely in
the box you know that's roughly that I'm
going to do is make sure that is tagged
as is triggered because if it's a
trigger and want to walk into it we need
to be set to that and then what we want
to do is will duplicate this Collider
and will actually put it somewhere where
we want to actually respawn or be
teleported to so we'll put it somewhere
I'll just stop the video so need out to
watch all this and now I've just placed
my collider here and I'm going to just
scale this Collider down because we
don't really need it
to be very big so and then I'm going to
take these trigger off so we don't need
and i'll rename this as destination i'll
save that and then I'll go back to my
other cube if you press F and you're on
your workspace you can snap straight
back to it and i'll name this hot or
collider so we keep everything easy to
navigate understand make sure that your
FPS controllers got a tag of player so
you know it's nice having some particle
effects it's nice just setting those
things up we need to make the actual
script now so if you gon create and then
create JavaScript and we'll name this
bottle and then from here you want to
double click on open monodevelop and
we'll start right in the card when one
would bail of work it shows up we're
going to what we're going to do is it's
a very basic script but we're going to
create five variables so we're going to
create a variable called destination and
we're going to have that set to
transform then we're going to have three
particle system variables because we've
got three particles in our in our actual
game so we want to actually reference
those so we can make them do things just
copy that over i'll name the normal
particle two and then my next war
telepon article and then we'll add
another variable for our sound effect
that we might want to use for when we
tell apart to teleport sound Oh teleport
sound as an audio clip so first of all
in our start function what I wanted to
do was I wanted to make sure the
teleport particles so that particle but
appears once you've stood on the
platform doesn't start until you and
doesn't start at the beginning so you
actually have to do something before you
can actually see that so I don't want to
need an update so we can write funk
on trigger enter and then you can write
anything here but for this for the sake
of this will put over Collider you
always have to write Collider but you
can write anything in the other slot
will create two color brackets and one
set if so other and the tag of other is
equal to player that are that you play a
will be tagged tongue then we'll create
two curly brackets again we want to say
normal particle 1 dot star and once we
type that we can copy this over we put
that in there three times and what on
their night is to normal particle to dot
stop and then we want to write in here
teleport particle and then we want to
say dot player and what with that does
there is that when you enter the trigger
if when you've entered the trigger that
you tagged this player those the
particles that show up in the air
stopped and the actual particle that
signifies that you're going to tell
apart appears and then why I wanted to
do to add some effect to it so you can
actually notice that the actual teleport
and practical effect is there before you
actually shoot off because if I didn't
write the yield we just shoot off as
soon as we entered the collider so you
know it gives a little bit of variation
to it a little bit more interesting so
if we write yield wait four seconds then
we write something like three wait for
three seconds then we can do audio play
one shot and then we'll write teleport
sound teleport sound and then we'll
write yield again yield wear it four
seconds one so once the sound is played
wait for one second and then we'll set
over dot transform dot position
equals destination dot position so what
that means is and if you're at semicon
what that means is that that what we
said was other sort of player its
position will now we equal whatever we
set the destination actual collided to
be so that means that will move off to
that position and then we won't want to
write so we can change our teleporter
back to its original function so it
fires up in the air so we can see it
from a distance I'll copy this and make
it on trigger exit and then I will just
copy these three lines just add in my
curly brackets and now will add these
three lines to my card the normal
particle one will want it to play no
particle to to play and then tell apart
to stop we've got a problem here I did
that a little bit wrong that one's got a
bit tell apart particle teleport
particle then we'll save our script now
and we'll go back into unity and on the
pods Collider that we've gone we'll add
our portal script and we'll open ol so
we need the destination Collider
attaching which is that we need our
particles which is normal particle one
no particle to teleport particle there
and then what we can use is a sound
effect for the actual teleport sound so
what can do nice test again and as you
can see when I look a virtual particle
you can see it shoots up in the air and
you can see it from a distance and if I
jump into it into the collider you can
see that it stops and playing the other
particle effect but you see this is what
you may have forgotten you may have
forgotten
actual audio sauce on your part collider
because we've got sound on there so it
needs something to activate that sounds
the audio audio sauce and then we get an
audio source on that and it will work
now that's all walk into again we'll see
the particle effect particle effect
changes hear the sound effect and then
we teleported all the way over here from
move over you can see in the very
distance you might be able to just about
make out there the particle effect so
that's pretty much it we've created a
basic and teleporter with particle
system and a bit of script to move your
player across so thanks very much and if
