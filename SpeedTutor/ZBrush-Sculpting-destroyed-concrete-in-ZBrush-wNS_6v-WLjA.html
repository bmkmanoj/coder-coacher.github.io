and this is gonna be about sculpting our
creating almost destroyed concrete
within ZBrush now initially what I'm
gonna do is just import an asset that
I've already made from 3ds Max and this
is just gonna be a really low polygon
sort of concrete barrier so if I pull
this in and just put T on to go into
edit mode I've got my M object in the
scene view now what you can do is
sometimes when you press ctrl D to
subdivide obviously when you want to add
trim or polish to the overall object it
will smooth it out then you don't always
want it smooth out if it's gonna be
almost a hard surface object so what you
want to do is go to geometry and you
take off the the smart smoothing and now
if you subdivide it and still look at
the active points it will actually take
it down and let you subdivide without a
smoothing it out so for the sake of this
I'll just go to three point six million
points for this mesh just whilst to show
you this and what we gonna do is we're
going to initially go onto the brush
selection and choose clear tubes now
what I'm going to do is set it to Z sub
so we're actually gonna subtract away
from the mesh and obviously you can mess
around with the intensity our brush size
but what we're gonna do is just it
really takes you to play around yourself
to make this work as you intend to but
what you can do is start chipping away
actual corners or pieces of the mesh of
which you have so viously if I increase
the brush size and start chipping away
at this corner we can almost build up
the look of destroying the edges of it
and taking that away
obviously it takes a little bit of
refinement a little bit of work to get
the way you want it to look but really
this is just the basis of trying to make
a more textured look to an object
instead of it being so flat but a lot of
them the concrete would probably chip
away at the edges before other areas and
obviously you can add it in certain
areas where it might be more prominent
and you can build upon the areas which
you've already got and add some damage
and things to there but obviously it
just would take a little bit of playing
around what you can also do is download
some or some brushes that people have
provided so and I'll put the link in the
description to the some of the ones I
found so you can already add a big crack
or a chip in and you got another crack
maybe I'll add that across here and
obviously you can try and blend that
yourself with what you're white what
you're actually trying to make so that's
pretty much it and thanks very much for
watching and if you liked the tutorial
