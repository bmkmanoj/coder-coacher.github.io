and this is a shredder which allows you
to sort of combine two textures on
materials such as say a rock and a lava
and have a sort of layered object look
and you can combine two base textures
with a build up material and you can
control the layer and the depth and
height of the filler for the desired
look it features albedo normal AR
Heights and other best texture with a
gloss and metallic features and the
build up layer consists of a texture
channel with accessible gloss a metallic
displacement tint and crevice fill
variables most lava and ice and
radioactive demo materials are included
in the package and as you can see here
these actually look pretty cool just to
get you started

icons which is a set of 150 fantasy
elute icons which include all the icons

free material scan Volume one this might
be : if you choosing to Train achieve
these sort of effects with a few
materials and number four is the MK
Glass 3 and you can see that this is in
the currently in its beech stage and is
to create real-time and refracted glass
with just a few clicks here and you can
see that the free version the full
version have slightly different sort of
characteristics so you for the free
version you can get refraction bump
specular
Cullerton distortion emission instancing
on fear and with the a fuller version
you get more in-depth features which
include reflection and occlusion but you
can see the sort of cool examples that
we can see here number five is the
cartoon particles fire and smoke free
which is a set of six animated particle
special effects at which a prefab which
included an explosion fire smoke for
arcade game strategy tower defense you
know whatever you would choose to free
