and this is a shredder which allows you
to sort of combine two textures on
materials such as say a rock and a lava
and have a sort of layered object look
and you can combine two base textures
with a build up material and you can
control the layer and the depth and
height of the filler for the desired
look it features albedo normal AR
Heights and other best texture with a
gloss and metallic features and the
build up layer consists of a texture
channel with accessible gloss a metallic
displacement tint and crevice fill
variables most lava and ice and
radioactive demo materials are included
in the package and as you can see here
these actually look pretty cool just to
get you started

the currently in its beech stage and is

with just a few clicks here and you can
see that the free version the full

characteristics so you for the free
version you can get refraction bump
specular
Cullerton distortion emission instancing
on fear and with the a fuller version
you get more in-depth features which
