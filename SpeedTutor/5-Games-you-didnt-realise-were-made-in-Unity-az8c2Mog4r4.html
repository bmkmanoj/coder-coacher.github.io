five awesome games which were actually
released and developed within unity now
as a lot of you know that unity sort of
gets a bad name for you know some of the
games that are rushed ow are made by
maybe new developers and soft brain the
whole concept of unity down but when
you've got a whole bunch of developers
who put a lot of time and even you know
big German Triple A companies can put in
time within the engine you can make
really awesome things so number one is
layers of fear and I'm sure a lot of you
know layers of fear a lot of the
misconception is that people always
think that it's made in something like
Unreal Engine but it's actually made in
unity it's just one of those games which
has a really nice visual style it so it
is a soft psychological horror game set
in a sort of old-fashioned Airy mansion
where you're playing and relive the
steps of a sort of crazed Penta it is
more of an on Rails experience where you
know we will follow the story as it goes
and find tidbits out about the storm and
find about the painter and finally
finishes masterpiece and work out what
was going on within the story and it's
not something where you can go and do a
lot of searching that doesn't mean to
say that it doesn't have an extreme
amount of detail and all the assets and
all the things that are created it's a
really cool experience I mean if you're
if you're into horror games that you
really should check out and number two
is stranded deep now again this is
another one there's a quite a few
survival games they're made in unity but
this one sort of a standout contender
because it's focuses on it has a really
nice sort of water and underwater system
and you sort of start your adventure on
a raft and you can go between the
islands which are procedurally generated
so you always get varied content no
matter what you do and you you know like
any core survival game the whole idea is
to survive find what you need craft new
things and go and in search for more and
call varied things with in
to solve weather system and all the
constant updates from the developers
themselves so it's a really cool course
of our game with everything that you
expect in there from crafting hunting
swimming all of that good stuff so it's
really something that you want to check
out number three is probably a pretty
famous one for most people is fallout
shelter originally released on mobile
but then released for steam and then the
Windows platform so you can play across
loads of different things whether it's
console or mobile and it's one of those
games where you can really get into it
and just spend up hours and hours and
hours with your ever spending a penny on
it and there is the little micro
transactions in there but you get the
little sort of lunchboxes where you can
get more characters and things it's just
something with a really nice art style
based on the fallout whole ecosystem you
can go out and do your quests manage the
little characters level them up given
new items armor it's just a really cool
game if you're into fallout and again
it's made in unity so it's a really cool
one to check out and then before the
siege this one you may or may not know
about it but it's yeah again one of
those really cool almost like a little
bit of a niche game where you can build
your own siege engine it could be small
really large based on the scenario that
he given you could attack a big fortress
all the things in there or it could be
just the peaceful inhabitants of a
certain area and you've just have to
defeat those all in any sort of means
necessary whether it's your big machine
with big wheels fire spikes cannons
bombs whatever it is you can make you
know whatever you dream about and you
can just go and crush the enemies in any
way you like so it's a really cool one
if you're almost creative and you just
want to have a bit of fun and number
five one of my personal favorites is
when The Witcher card game which was
originally a sort of small part of The
Witcher 3 gameplay which the developers
thought that putting like a little card
game within the game and it got so much
popularity that they thought they'd make
a standalone card game because you've
seen other card games like hearthstone
again made in unity which rose to
popularity and continued to do well now
this one is just based on the whole
which sort of universe and all the
factions in there and it just has a lot
of depth I mean I personally spend hours
and hours just playing this game that's
other people online and desist a whole
host of varied content and the
development team continued and continued
to just update and update and add new
cards new content balance it tweak it so
you're always on your toes in that
respect but there's just some really
cool artwork and just really nice stuff
in general for them for the going game
so hopefully you check out all these
games if you haven't already seen and
just remember to make whatever you want
in unity it just takes the passion and
the drive to do so so thanks again for
