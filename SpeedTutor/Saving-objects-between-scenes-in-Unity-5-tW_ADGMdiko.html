tutorial now this is not really specific
to unity 5 this is more of just
scripting in general it's been in unity
since sort of the beginning and it's a
way to carry objects or any particular
item into another scene without
destroying it because you say you've got
one scene and I move to the next
everything in that previous scene will
be forgotten about it gets rid of it all
because it doesn't need to deal with
that scene anymore it's gone doesn't
have to be a memory anymore so if I've
got scene 1 here and you can see it's
scene 1 at the top all I've got is first
person controller directional light a
plan for the floor and I've got an
object which is classed as important
objects that we want to keep in scene 2
I've made sure that it's slightly
different so all it is is a plane with
my first person controller and we've got
a cube there just to make sure that you
know that there's a difference and what
we want to do is we want to save this
particular cube in this position and
bring it with us into the next scene
this can be good for things like if you
want audio to go from one scene to the
next and stare so say you've got a bat a
piece of background audio that you want
through our every single scene within
your game or every single level you can
use this script and it will keep it
persistent throughout now it's quite
it's really simple it's just called
don't destroy onload you may have seen
it before but it's useful to know so
what we gonna do is going to right-click
and create a new JavaScript and then
what we'll do is write done destroy
and then we'll open up in monodevelop so
what we'll get is we'll get the norm
two functions that it comes with or
missed out the script now you can either
choose to do this on a function called
awake our front country called start
start just means as soon as the script
is enabled it will do it once our
function awake means it will be called
before a start function and even if that
script isn't enable it will still do it
so it's often quite useful to do all it
on awake if it's for an object that you
want to keep throughout your scenes we
still do it before any of the script is
run essentially and do it whether or not
you've got to say enable the script and
then what we could write there is we
right don't destroy on load and then in
brackets we can say transform with a
lowercase T dot game object on what
cause I'll put a semicolon and then what
we can do is we can save the hour so
essentially that is all we need to write
and it just means that when we load the
nother scene don't destroy the game
object with its position and it's a
you've got children are many different
objects within one object it'll keep all
those together so if I make an example
is my cube here and we call we put don't
destroying it and we want to be able to
move scenes now so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna go game object
create empty and I'm going to create
another empty game object so this is
gonna be my little thing that controls
moving scenes move scenes and want me to
do is I'm going to add don't destroy to
that and that my other script I made
there and all my move scene script is is
that when I press one or two it'll move
between scene one and two so what we can
one would just name here is that it's
gonna be seen one and this one is gonna
be seen to so like I said before scene
one has this and scene 2 has a cube in
the background
so now if I press play you can see that
this is here and this is only in scene
one if I press two on my keyboard to
move to the scene you'll notice that
that has been brought with me and also
you will see that my move scenes which
had the don't destroy has actually moved
with me as well so I can move back to
seeing one like this but you've got to
remember that if you're moving to and
from scenes that you've already been in
and you're using don't destroy it will
make multiple copies so you have to be
careful as in if I go back to seeing two
and then back to seeing one again it
will be make a copy because it's
recalling what we already had so really
that's just a really simple way to make
objects persistent make things follow
you into other scenes which you may not
want to destroy say your character or
something say your character walks into
a building and you want to bring the
exact scripts with you all year
character information on you can say
don't destroy and there it will be from
exactly the same copy from another scene
so that's just the really simple way to
achieve that sort of thing so thanks
again for watching don't forget to Like
