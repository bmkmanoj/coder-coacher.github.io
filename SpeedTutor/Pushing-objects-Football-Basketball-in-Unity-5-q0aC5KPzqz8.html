tutorial and today we're gonna look out
I did one very similar in unity 4 and it
was about pushing physic subjects but
this time I'll sort of rebound it and
update if unity 5 so we're gonna sort of
push a ball a football it could be a
basketball anything a physics object
push it along the floor I'm so gonna go
from sort of concept to writing the
script and then placing the objects so
in unity 5 we are here now what we need
to do is you need to import your
character if you haven't already C can
import the first person controller you
can right-click and your project import
package and characters and bring in the
first burst controller proof up when
you've got that it over here and you'll
have a camera and its main object you
might need to scale up this first person
controller if you need to now you've got
that initially set up what we're gonna
do is we're gonna create something so
we're gonna Chris Vegas all go game
object 3d objects our more creates feel
obviously you can bring in your own
objects from a different modeling
program if you didn't want to use one
like this while do is will make
something quite large and roughly like
this it doesn't need to be touching the
floor because we're gonna add physics to
it now what we'll do is we'll go
component physics rigidbody and the
rigid body allows it to have physics so
it's going to bring it down to the
ground and let us be able to push it and
we need to make sure it's got Sofia's
fear Clyde because obviously if it
doesn't elders fall through the ground
and continue forever we will right click
click create and we look at a new
javascript file and we'll call this will
call this push physics and then what
we'll do is we'll open that up in
monodevelop 1 we're in monodevelop well
do is i'll get rid of the first two
functions what we're going to do is
we're going to write a simple script to
make sure that it applies that push
values to all rigidbody objects within
the world so start by writing variable
push
what equals 2.0 with the semicolon and
leave to a couple of line breaks and the
most a place in function on the
controller collider hit open brackets
hit column controller Collider hit close
that up and add two curly brackets below
so what this does is create a function
for when we hit the actual controllers
Collider and it's gonna be looking for a
hit type of controller collider hit then
we're gonna have a variable called body
and have that as type a rigid body and
have that equal to hit dot Collider dart
at a CH rigid body with a semicolon then
we're going to say that if body is equal
to null or and we need two flat lines
and nuts in my case it's where my
backslash is opposite I'll just very
close to shift if you hold shift and
click the back spread base you'll you'll
do it and this just means this all that
then will say body dot we need to make
sure that that's lowercase its change it
dot is kinematic close the brackets and
then they're also returned with a
semicolon and what that means is that
we're going to look for so setting a
variable of body we're looking for a
rigid body and that rigid your body is
going to be it we're going to hit a
Collider which is called a rigid body so
whatever we hit then if we don't hit a
rigid body here
or the body that is kinematics of
kinematic in rigid body terms means it
doesn't move it means you're not going
to do anything for now so I'll just
return to the beginning but now we're
going to write another if statement
normal said that if hit dot move
Direction dot Y is less than minus not
0.3 then we'll close that up and have
returned again and this one means if we
hit an object and is below our character
we don't want to be able to push it and
now what we're going to do is we're
going to write another variable and call
this push direction as type vector three
equals vector through effect three open
brackets hit dot move direction dot X
comma 0 comma hit don't move direction
dot Zed
close that up and then a semicolon and
then below that we'll say body dot
velocity equals push
direction I'll push dir times the push
power that we set at the top so what
this push Direction means is that we're
set in a vector three and a vector three
is going to be x y&amp;amp;z so it's going to be
the sort of direction that something
moves so what this means is this one's X
this one is y this one's Ed so we can
only ever push something from the X or
the Z which is left and right say and
never up or down so we don't want to be
able to push it into the air unless
obviously you want to do that then what
we're saying is then then we now we're
going to set the body which we
originally set what's your rigid body
we'll set the velocity equal to the push
direction so the direction of which
you're pushing it times by the push
power so you can change the push power
accordingly what we'll do is we'll save
that script out then we'll go to our
first person controller again well I'd
push physics there I will have push
physic push power should I say it too
and then what we'll do is we'll play the
game and I'll look at our massive sphere
that we've got there and now we'll be
able to push that around in our scene
and it's a little bit difficult to push
and you'll notice that it looks like
that ball manages to go forever and
doesn't really stop very realistically
so what we can do is we can select our
sphere our ball whatever we've got and
we can put some drag on the actual ball
itself so we can add a drag of five now
we can push the ball again then you'll
notice that it stops much more quickly
and we can adjust things that it does
use gravity and what we can do in the
push power is we can set up to five so
we can have more power to add to the
object that we're going to push it a bit
easier to push the object and we might
want to take the physics down if it's
going to serve eight drag down if it's
going to be a lighter object say
and it's gonna go further it really just
depends what type of ball or what type
of physics object you're trying to push
because if it's a square object it's
gonna have a lot of drag because it
won't be able to smoothly roll now a
sphere depending on how much or how
heavy that actual object is you want to
adjust the drag accordingly to make it
as realistic it was a heavy soft Boulder
you want the drag to be vary quite a lot
if it was a really smooth like a
football and you want it to go along for
some time before it stops and you can
just adjust the push power and that
accordingly to what you feel is suitable
so you need to remember that you've got
a physics object it could be a square it
could be a sphere we have a Collider on
it make sure it's got a rigid body you
can adjust the drag accordingly first
person controlling needs your push
physics script and it's just a fairly
short script to apply find a rigid body
and push in a direction and give it a
force when you need to so this was just
a short one so thanks very much for
