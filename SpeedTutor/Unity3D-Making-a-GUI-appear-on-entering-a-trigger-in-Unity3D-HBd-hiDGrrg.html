for you today and this is from somebody
left a comment asking about something
that wanted to make GUI or something
appear when you got near an object and
make it disappear when you walk away so
I hope this works for them but it will
work for everybody else if you want to
make something appear if you want to
look at a certain item something a wall
could be a texture could be anything you
want so all I've got in my scene is my
basic scene here I've got something on
the wall which is going to be the thing
that you're going to want to look at
when you're in the game I made a quick
GUI texture in Photoshop and I just set
it to as GUI so if you import in right
click import new asset and you import
that into unity if you click on the
texture you change it from text to GUI
what you want to do is actually make a
new material so you can create new
material and then you can just apply
that texture to that material and then
you know you can whack it on your M
object you know got is a cube which is
just I important metal new cubes to
create the cube and then I actually so I
deleted the mesh renderer and just left
the collider and I made sure the
collider is set is trigger now what
we're going to do write the script so
we're going to create create JavaScript
and then we're going to say GUI ap or
something like that and then when we
open up we'll open up model develop and
then we're going to actually start doing
some stuff so what we're on the first
write is a private variable so so
private variable GUI sure and we'll set
that as a boolean and say equal to false
at the start and we'll set another
variable called riddle and we'll set
that as type texture so there are two
things because we're going to actually
say something
when we in and go inside the colliders
and stuff so we'll start out by saying
function on trigger stay open your
bracket right call as a Collider and
then we'll add our two curly brackets
and then what we'll do is we'll say if
call dot tag is equal to player then
we'll add to marker the brackets and say
GUI show and is equal to true and then
what we'll also do is copy the exact
same function paste in set ontriggerexit
and then we'll change that to show GUI
as false now then we're going to write
function on GUI and add two curly
brackets I'm going to say if GUI
sure is set to true if it spell it right
then we'll add two curly brackets
underneath and we'll say Gy dot draw
texture open brackets rect open other
brackets a screen dot weight divided by
four point 5 comma screen dot height
divided by four comma and then you're
going to set the size of your actual GUI
texture that you set so I'll explain all
this and then put a comma after you
caused your bracket say riddle and then
put a semicolon now let's play an orbit
if we end to the collider and we stay
inside that collider what we'll do is
the GUI show boolean will be set to true
which means that will show the GUI if we
exit that Collider or set GUI show to
false which means that GUI show will not
work anymore take the textual where so
what we're doing is drawing a texture
and taking your screen width and your
screen height and dividing it by a
certain amount now this is dependent on
your screen so it might not quite be a
number so mess around numbers
you could do your screen with / for 4.2
you could divide them both by 2 but just
see because I just wanted it to go
roughly in the center and then what you
want to do is whatever you set the
texture size in if you made you a
texture in Photoshop
mine was 1,024 width by 512 height and
then riddle here is just our variable
that we set for our texture so if I
close them and I say on my collider cube
here and what I'm going to do is add the
GUI appear so that and we asks for a
texture so what we'll do is we'll add
our texture and if we press play you'll
notice that I can see this item on the
wall with whatever is on the texture
itself and if I walk up to it you'll
notice that now you'll see what appears
on the screen is the texture that you
wanted and as long as I'm in this
Collider you can see it and you can go
around a step back goes away and you go
on there it was a way you can change the
size of your Collider you know to make
it more apparent less apparent so you
have to get really close or not but
that's just the basics of making
something appear when you go near it
so thanks very much for watching hope it
helps people out and as always don't

thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
