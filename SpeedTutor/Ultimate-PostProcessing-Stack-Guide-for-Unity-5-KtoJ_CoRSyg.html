tutorial today and this is going to be
looking at the post-processing stack
with unity 5 and this is going to be an
a range of image effects which helps you
achieve more soft stylistic effects to
achieve something more towards triple a
game development and help you make stuff
it's almost a lot more realistic and add
some sort of stylization in most cases
now the thing to understand about image
effects is that there's something that
use of new overlay over the top of your
camera and there's something that's done
after for the mouse cases I don't after
everything else as rendered within your
game so everything after you know you
know graphics have been rendered
lighting and stuff like that it will be
done as an effect on each pixel of your
game so the higher the resolution of
your game the more impactful on
performance each image effect will be
most of these image effects are likely
not suitable for mobile but it's really
up to you to solve debug and work out
which ones I'll give some indication on
how you can be more performant with some
of these effects and which ones will
likely work on mobile and where you will
likely see some dips if you put settings
too high so this is going to trim be the
ultimate guide to teaching you how to
understand using the processing stack
and getting good quality out of your
game so what you can do to start off
with is you can go straight to unity
asset store and if you go to the asset
store in just search in post-processing
you need to make sure that you have
unity 5.6 and above I think that's
what's appropriate for these you can get
it from unities github and I can put a
link in the description for that once
you're on this page you can click to and
download them and once you've downloaded
them you can choose to import so I will
just click import and I will pop these
straight into my project that I've got
going on right now and once you've
downloaded your asset and the
post-processing stack you will see the
post processing folder being put into
your project panel and I've got a scene
here from one of the viz at viz Pro
packs
and this is a really cool scene to sort
of just test out some of these image
effects that we're going to use so if
you've got an FPS controller stay we're
going to select the main camera and
there's a few things that we want to
remember one we're going to use these
things you want to enable HDR if you're
going to you know m4 a PC game or a
console game and you want to disable the
allow msaa because we're going to do
some anti-aliasing within the effects we
can also go to edit project settings and
quality and depending on your settings
you've got you want to disable the
anti-aliasing up here so we've done a
fat end you have any anti-aliasing going
on so we can go back to our main camera
and with everything selected we can go
add component and we can start by typing
in post our we can add a post-processing
behavior now we've got something in that
in our project panel we can right click
create and choose post-processing
profile and this is going to be the item
that we use to sort of control all the
effects that we've got so once that we
can just name that our and
post-processing v1 for version 1 and now
we have that we can go back on our main
camera and just drag that a new profile
into our slot available on the camera
and we now we never have to click back
on the camera and the thing to remote
air remember is the allow HDR just
stands for high dynamic range and it
just allows the sea to reach colors in a
color space which is it wouldn't
normally been able to reach in some of
the image effects will not render
without that an ebb if we click back on
post-processing version 1 we've got a
whole host of different settings in top
corner if I click the drop down on debug
mode right at the top you can see we've
got a whole host of debug modes and
these are the things that we can see for
quite a lot of the image effects so
let's make an example when we choose
onion occlusion then we enable ambient
occlusion we can see that this is our
diva blood so we can see exactly what
the envelope illusion is doing and
without any of the other graphical
effects or sort of materials and things
that are in the scene we can see exactly
what it's affecting and how it's
affecting it so we can use these modes
to understand where what is doing and
you know how we can change it more
easily so I'm
to disable those for now and start at
the top initial box of fog isn't very
important we'll first start with
anti-aliasing and if we open them dears
in box and we took the book we will get
a hostage setting so we'll get the
method and we'll get a preset I'm sure
you've heard of anti-aliasing if you
imagine any object or any shadow when it
is created in a game if you imagine the
likes of Minecraft when you try and make
a diagonal line out of squares let's
imagine and imagine those are pixels
you'll never make a perfect line without
it sort of looking jagged and need a way
to be able to fill those gaps and based
on what the computer can calculate so
anti-aliasing tries to take those points
and add points in between to just create
the illusion of a smooth out lines so
then you get rid of the jagged edges
that you might get in and shadows an
in-game and there's two different
methods you can use the fast approximate
which might be more applicable to marble
and that's much lower quality and
clearer listing so it won't give you as
and you know good resources extra it's a
lot more performant and you have the
preset mode and you can choose what sort
of quality so you can choose to do
extreme quality which was you know maybe
bog down the image in a little bit more
or you can choose to use the temporal
anti-aliasing which has a few settings
which is far more and you know suited
towards high-end PC or console
development now until anything can be a
little weird one on the effects that it
creates but we've got a few settings
which we've got the jitter here which is
spread the hair we actually make it the
more accurate the actual result becomes
and the hair it becomes is the more
impact it will have on your game and the
less obviously the less actual impact it
will have and the less accurate results
it may give and the sharpen at the
bottom is as you do the ng aliasing and
they tries to solve get rid of those
jagged edges you may lose some quality
and some of the textures or some of the
things that you can use and sharpen
tries to sharpen up those edges but it's
all about fine-tuning things and sort of
working on something that works well for
you and works for your game and is
really a thing to look at the profiler
and see how it works for you and
anti-aliasing that is a good thing if
you get a lot of jagged edges again we
can look at the next one which is called
ambient occlusion and you can see as I
take that on you can see and the edges
and between objects darken and we again
can use the debug mode at the top and
choose ambient occlusion and you can see
how it effects and things within the
world you can see that as light passes
into objects that are very much close to
each other our Jes and the light passes
into the objects bounces around and can
escape very easily so it's much darker
in places that are very much recessed
are things that would be very close to
or nothing if you open up the ending
occlusion you get a few different
settings so you can get an intensity so
you can make you know add a multiplier
and make it look far more intense which
is not always realistic you can increase
the radius which adjusts where the
actual ambient occlusion sits so you
could you know if I take away the I'm
going to cushion we can make it look
like a very different stylized scene
from what maybe we want for realism we
can choose to enable or disable down
sampling and if we enable down sampling
it will decrease slightly decrease the
quality of the immune occlusion but it
will also save on a bit of performance
so unless you want something that's
extremely specific on the occlusion from
and it's good to keep down sampling on
because it skips some pixels to be
rendered or so will save you your very a
lot of heartache down the line and
there's a few of the settings for
depending on your vendor settings so
whether you doing forward or deferred
and ambient on lick refers to if you
using deferred and the HDR camera it
will try and make it more accurate based
on that and it will be taken into
account when you do your lighting
reroute them in a post process at the
end of the actual banking things out in
the game so we can move on to the next
one which is called the screen space
reflections and this is a pretty cool
effect for making a scene look that a
little bit more towards realism because
we've got two examples we've got
additive and we've got the
physically-based and added
it is a much lower quality and easier on
the performance-wise and it will take
all the different areas of the game and
it will decide based on some
calculations what objects need to
reflect in what areas whereas if we take
for example our physically-based
it will do a much more accurate job do
more checks to check the materials and
the textures and do a much much more
accurate sort of example of where and
what the actual lighting and reflection
should be and the screens based just
means they will only do those
reflections in what the camera is
looking at any moment so say you've got
objects over this side that you can't
see it won't be doing any calculations
for those reflections unless the cameras
directly looking at it but you've got to
be careful that if say some objects are
still taken into account so you've got
something over here
which is reflected in the floor down
here and it gets called out if you look
too far this way
you have to be careful and you can tweak
some settings which which is the screen
edge mask which will blur areas to try
and avoid the area of things pop it in
and out of the reflections in the real
time and you've got a range of settings
which can increase the blurs and become
to increase quality and such there is a
box here called back reflect back face
and you can really see in my scene here
apart from on this wall over here let's
say we've got a mirror up here and we
want to accurately accurately reflect
this lampshade up here and sometimes if
we don't tick this box it will only
issue a will only do its calculations
one way but if we do the reflect back
faces it will do a much market
calculation to work out how it's
supposed to be displayed sort of behind
it but again this one's going to
significantly affect performance because
it's doing double the calculations for
something that's already very a
performance intensive and
this is something that you can use on
marble because they would just destroy
performance completely we can enable
something called depth of field and
depth of field is just something that
you'll see in photography and things
like that if you ever taken a photo and
you focused in on a particular object
and said you wanted the gram background
to be out of focus so you can get more
averse or stylized effects you can focus
on the object in particular if you want
to make that stand out against the
background this is how you can achieve
this so we can use another debug mode at
the top we can click the drop down and
we choose the focus plane you can see
that everything that's in red will be
completely in focus and we can choose
our tweak some of these settings to make
it so that we can you know look at
something different and make a sort of
different look about it so say we for
instance wanted this back to a bit of
the back here be very much in focus and
this of foreground here to be blurred so
him sort of maybe hover could be a
cutscene over this side we can decrease
the aperture all the way down until we
get to a point where we can just see our
red debug over this side and we can
increase the focal length just so in
capulet and capitalize this area and we
can do a change the kernel size
depending on what quality our looking
for so the higher the quality not
obviously the better the quality and the
more impact on your game we can get rid
of the debug mode and you can see now
that very much so that only that in the
very background is in focus and the rest
is out and you can just adjust and tweak
settings depending on what desired
effect you want to see motion blur is
another similar thing which is another
one which can you know quite heavily
impact performance because it will
create a blur burst based on the Martian
that you have within your scene so if I
enable it and we can apply the Martian
blood and it will blur the edges as we
move with the camera and we can use a
debug mode to look at that and we can
choose Martian vectors and we can even
increase
flip frame blending which if we take it
all the way down to the bottom let's say
and we then test our game you can see
what the motion vectors do it will give
us an indication of where the motion
blur is being applied based on these
little arrows that are moving between
the scene but like I said if we've got
the phlegm about frame blending all the
way up you can see that we can create a
very distinct motion blur which will
solve cause the effects of looking like
your character might be drunk or
something like that and the next effect
that we do have is something called eye
adaption and this tries to simulate what
your eye would do in real life so say
you went into a room or you looked
outside towards the Sun your iris would
close up to sort of not let as much
light in because it doesn't require that
light to actually be able to see
properly and similarly if it was a dark
room such as this for instance it would
open the iris up more to receive more
light so you can see more accurate
accurately and you can use the eye
adaption than just the ranges to try and
get something more appropriate so if you
have really bright areas it will help
you I'll try and simulate this when
we've got an able balloon so like I said
the next one we've got is bloom and you
can't really see much change in the
scene and what bloom tries to sort of
simulate is that in film and movies and
when you use a camera if you're looking
at a very sort of bright area you will
see the sort of bleeding across other
surfaces when you get a bright area and
can sort of give a pretty cool stylized
effect even when you just want to sort
of emphasize lights and things like that
so you've got a few settings here and
you've got intensity which will increase
the sort of the very much the brightness
of intensity of the actual bloom itself
you will increase the threshold and it
will can blow out all the areas that
you've got and you can almost make it
look like you're in another world icing
extremely sunny day compared to what we
previously had we can increase in turn
silver Way can almost look like you've
got a nuclear explosion or something
like that
so we're going to leave it on maybe a
realistic value that we quite like to
look at and you've got a slot at the
bottom which is for a dirt texture where
you can look make the lens or the camera
look a little bit more dirty and we can
look in a folder in the post-processing
called textures and lens dirt and we
have and some of these objects and we
can choose to go on the post-processing
profile that we created and add a
texture to this and you can see some
sort of lens flares and dirt which would
come off and you can add different ones
to sort of create different looks of you
know sort of aberrations on the screen
and when we press play you can see what
I can see on the screen you can see the
dirt across the screen if you want to
create maybe like a a war game or to
look like that your players seeing
something in a dream or let's say
something like that so say you've seen
the next one that we're going to use is
color grading and if we tick that say
you seem you don't like the way it looks
at the moment and you don't like the
color you don't like how the lights
affected up here we've got we start off
and it's got a tone mapper which
requires huge day on your camera and the
torn-up adjust and initially if I say
tune on it will do not turn mapping to
sort of try and neutralise the bright
areas it will and if I live on neutral
it will try and bring the areas down to
more of a consistent value to make it
more appropriate to use and we've got a
bunch of settings to sort of color
correct all the exposures the
temperatures and things like that but
one of the most important things and the
coolest things that you can use is you
can use the little track balls and you
can make the scene look more towards a
particular style that we're going for so
say we wanted this room to look more
sailor bright and sunny instead of just
being default and looking a little bit
gray we can move it towards maybe
oranges and yellows with the initial
trackball and do the same with the other
and what we can do is just things like
temperature so you can make it multiple
was a cold or warm temperature you can
adjust the tint of the overall see you
can decrease the saturation so say you
want to go to an entirely
black-and-white C or you wanted to go
something which is really saturate and
looks bright then you can choose to do
that so it makes everything really nice
and colorful and you can choose to
increase or decrease contrast for entire
C and we can choose to adjust the entire
exposure for the scene so if we say we
wanted to make it look far more brighter
than we previously did we've gotten
another setting which is called use a
lookup table and this is something where
it just uses a texture so if we took a
screenshot of this game now applied
similar settings to this with color
correction degrading brought into a
program like Photoshop did the sort of
similar tweaks we could then bring the
end texture back into here and without
having to do the color grading it could
refer to that texture or that photo that
we just made based on the settings we'll
see only these greens to look like this
and the quality to look and like this
sort of thing it will look at this user
look up and go yep yep yep and do the
settings without you having to use the
other post-processing so it can almost
be a little bit quicker than you would
have normally thought that it would so
be again slightly more optimized we've
got another thing called chromatic
aberration and this is something that
you would see in a lot of games trying
to simulate it with a broken camera
games will outlast and things like that
so you will see a solve if you lock it
down towards this bottom will increase
the chromatic aberration you'll see the
solve red green blue sort of banding
that we get and that's the sort of
simulate the look of what an
old-fashioned camera or lens would solve
associate and nothing sometimes see that
if you were sort of glasses because
that's a semi-soft and sometimes if you
were a stronger lens and you can create
this to make it look like as I say a
broken camera or something slightly more
stylized and you can use spectra
and lock up textures to sort of increase
or change different looks towards you
see so that's more one that you probably
want to use more sparingly because it's
quite yourself an effect that looks
quite annoying if you use it too much we
can enable something called grain and as
you might think
if we increase the intensity it will a
degree grain all the way over the screen
and if we decrease the the luminance and
increase the size we can get in as you
can see a lot of grain there and you can
choose whether it's colored or not if
you wanted to create some grain for
maybe an old-fashioned movie or
something like that then you have a cool
little fact called vignette and it will
darken the very corners of your screen
because screens are cameras and things
like that in real life lenses are not
square as you would a computer so
vignette just allows you to sort of
simulate this with a sim just a sort of
simple area and you can choose what type
of mode you want whether it's classic or
masked and you can choose to set a color
if you don't like the vignette being
black you could choose to increase the
intensity so you can almost maybe look
like the character might be blinking you
can increase or decrease the smoothness
choose how round the actual vignette is
so you can make it more square if you go
in for that sort of look and you can
choose to truly make it a sphere rather
than just more of an oval but if we pull
it more towards black you can see it
like that the intensity back so we can
get it more like so just it's also it
softens the edge more easily and the
last object at the bottom is not really
apparent for this so as I say it's just
a case of looking at a bunch of these
and image effects applying them and
deciding which ones work for you and
which ones will add a sort more step
towards realism for your game because a
blue is always a nice one the screens
based reflections
that's something that you can support on
high-end and thing you can choose the
color grading to try and remake your
seem suitable to a more interesting look
so I'll just quickly go back to where we
were at the beginning before we applied
any image effects so you can see what
happened so remember the anti-aliasing
smoothes out jagged areas and this is
more one for a console and you'll need
it for VR and it might be applicable for
mobile if you use the fast approximate
use the end occlusion to darken areas to
make things look more towards real life
if you just the settings it might be
suitable for mobile you can use the
screens place treacherous reflections
which is good for high-end because it
will create the illusion of things
reflected realistically in screen space
rather than and doing it for everything
in the scene you can use depth of field
if you want to blur certain areas to
sort of make it focus on something in
particular you can use motion blur to
simulate adronis or blur our edges as
you're moving which probably neither of
those a public great for mobile you can
use the eye adaption to bring a scene
more towards and real life so yeah I
adjust according to the values and what
you see in your see you can use bluem to
make the bright areas sort of bleed
across others and depend on what you're
going for you can use the color grading
to bring it towards a color that you're
looking to achieve you can use the user
lookup table if that's something you're
interested in and you can have a few
examples at the bottom here in the
neutral lockup you can use the chromatic
aberration if you choose to want the
effect of a sort of old-fashioned camera
or something which is and more towards a
camera lens you can choose grin if you
want to have more of an old-fashioned
look so your scene you can use the
vignette to darken very much areas of
your scene if you choose to use them and
like I said I will enable the eye
adaption to allow it to sort of more
accurately bring
down the very hard or harsh and sort of
blown-out areas and make it you know I
need to take in less light to sort of
see these areas so all in all you can go
from a fairly modest scene to adding a
you know a whole host of extra detail to
things that would take a lot of extra
effort if you can use these image
effects on this post processing stack so
all in all it's the case of you looking
at your stats and your profiler to see
which things affect you monde amassed
and judging from that
so hopefully this sort of helps you get
an understanding of the ways that you
can optimize for using the
post-processing stack and how you can
achieve better quality within your games
