about three crazy games made in unity so
the first one I'm gonna mention is I am
bread and this is probably the most
famous one and essentially you're a
piece of bread and your mission is to
become toast
so as silly as that sounds it's based on
really strange and we had solve physics
controls based on the way that you
control the bread and you can attach to
surfaces climb up it trying to traverse
your way through the environment based
on the other obstacles that are there
and just train it in the end make your
way to the other side to get into the
toaster and become toast and there's
lots of other game mods which just
they've added an auditor of the time so
it's really one that you should check
out if you're looking to have a crazy
time and the second one is something
called cluster truck or physics best
chaotic and truck farmer that they
describe it as you jump in slow motion
across insane levels where the whole
concept of if you touch the floor you
failed the game you jump across large
trucks which are driven by people that
can't drive very well and there's
obstacles explosions walls that come in
to try and crush you and there's a lot
of different things to try and stop you
getting to the end and as the levels go
on it just gets more and more and more
crazy and as you see if the trailers
enemy gameplay it's just another
absolute crazy game that should check
out and the final one is something that
I played quite recently it's called
overcooked and sometimes when you see
trailers
you're not as hooked but I gave it a go
and I sat with my family and we played
this in fall player co-op and it was
incredibly fun and essentially it's just
a sort of default play a couch co-op
game where it's a cooking game for you
to work together to place orders that
come in and you've got to do them in a
specific time limit or you will you know
lose points lose skull and you've got to
reach a certain score to pass on and the
levels are not just as you see the Fair
in levels of movement that can be
sliding across ice moving between two
moving trucks and there's a lot of
different variations to the whole thing
and it can get extremely chaotic
especially when the weather you cook
stuff can be sliding around and you've
got to rely on each other to do
different jobs and it can get insanely
confusing but a whole load of laughs if
you're playing it with some friends if
you're looking to play a couch co-op
game with some friends I can't recommend
it enough because it's absolutely
fantastic so these were just three
absolutely fantastic insane games that
you can look to play that were developed
in unity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
