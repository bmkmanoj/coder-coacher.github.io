another tutorial today which is similar
to my last one that I did which is about
video textures but i'm going to show you
how to actually interact with your video
textures to actually make it more
dynamic and games and things like that
one of the first ones i'm going to show
you is actually um activating it via
collider because i remember something
like this in i think it was a standalone
Slenderman game where you walked into a
room a TV came on with some footage and
then you sort of teleported into a
different scene and i'll show you how to
do this it's quite simple so what we go
so I've got everything like my last
tutorial I've got my screen here so what
I'm going to do is it's got no kalila on
it at the minute because I took it off
but if we go to component physics and
then add box Collider what we can do is
actually change its size so we can
change its natural excise exposition and
then we can change its position by
bringing this Collider our and you can
see it here I want to do is change it is
trigger so now this Collider here he's
actually going to be our trigger but
we've walk into it will activate the
actual movie so if i open up our old
script which is play moving you can see
it here we want to do something new this
time so we don't need the function start
anymore we can write a new function so
we can write function ontriggerenter and
then we can write over the collider and
then if we add the curly brackets in so
we can add if other dot tag is equal to
player then we can add two more curly
brackets then as we had before I'll just
copy these lines we can do this
so I will delete my function start now
because we don't need it so only when we
end to the collider and if our fif PS
controller which is if it is tag player
it'll play the texture and a loop it so
we can save this and now if we go on the
screen you'll see that it's armed and
what we can do is that nothing works
until we actually walk into the collider
one will when we went into that Collider
you saw it started but something else we
can do is like i said in the Slender Man
game what should happen what we can do
is we can actually yield sub done this
before yield wait four seconds and then
we'll wait for say three seconds you can
wait for the duration of your actual
video but then we're going to write
application Lord level and then we can
go into what level you want to going so
we're kind of new scene or something
like that and we'll take the loop out
because you don't need it if you're not
after it and then what we'll do it we'll
play they move it wait for three seconds
and then load a new scene now mine will
never go to New soon because i don't
have one cold you've seen but if you
create a new scene gone file build
settings and just add it in there once
you wear that three seconds you'll
actually go to a new scene but we don't
need that for now another thing that we
can do is actually doing this on a
button press so say well you know
something like you were watching your TV
and you wanted to do an actual TV screen
or something for flicking buttons we can
go in our function up there if we had
two curly brackets we can go if input
dot get key down open your brackets key
code e to bracket to the end add our
curly brackets
and then we'll just add those two lines
there so if we go into the collider
it'll do this if we press e it will
actually start and what we can actually
do is save that and I'll show you or
repressed player we could press E and we
get it playing but say you want to
actually as I said do it like a TV you
want it to play and then you want to
have a different bars button underneath
in your update you can write if we'll
just copy this line again so we're going
to do the same thing really take that
out if input do it get ki will put Q
then we want to do two curly brackets
and inside there we can do move TxDOT
pause you can do dot stop or anything
like that but if I play this you'll
notice that east arques it now press Q
it pause is it eat to start again q to
pause it and vice versa and make sure
when you're on your script you're right
loop if you want it to carry on looping
once it's finished that's pretty much it
for the basics and you can do this and
you can modify this in ways that you
want to do it for your game but for the
sake of interacting with your video
texture those just a couple of ways
where you can quite easily interact with
it so that's pretty much it if you liked
