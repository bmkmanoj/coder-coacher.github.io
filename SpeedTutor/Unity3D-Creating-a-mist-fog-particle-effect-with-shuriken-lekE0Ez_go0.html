tutorial today and this is going to be
showing you how to make a mist or foggy
style effect sort of particle system or
particle effects so if I drag my prefab
in you can see that we get a sort of
misted area and we get that sort of look
because I was trying to create this
myself and I you know went through a lot
of stages to try and make it make it
work as I wanted it so this might not be
the best for everybody but as I say with
all practical effect tutorials obviously
you can change it as you wish now before
you go about creating your practical
effect the one thing that you do want to
actually impart if not already is if
you're right-clicking you seen and going
part package and then particles you'll
want the particles pack that comes
default with unity with its standard
assets so then we can actually create
the particle system so you want to start
off by going game object create other
than particle system I've just prefabbed
it so I can drag it into my scene as
many times as I want so initially what
you're going to want to do in the
material slot for the material that we
want to choose we want to choose a
material called smoke one and that's one
of the materials in the legacy particles
as I said with unity and what it does is
it a sort of a misted alpha effect and
all that's going to have an additive
multiply shared it to it and we're going
to make sure that the actual color is
maybe not not fully dark but obviously
you can change this depending what
you're looking for but we want it so
that it says you don't quite dark and
this slide is almost all the way at the
bottom so once you've done that what you
can then do is with once you've added
that you want to make sure that it casts
some receive shadows the max particle
size around not point four and normal
direction render mode I think they can
be kept standard now that's all you need
to do for that then you'll pretty much
happier
particle effect going then what you want
to do is make sure that if not already
you tick share you have it as a shape of
a cone have the angle around 73 of the
radius around 10 have the length 4.5 and
have it emit from a volume and then
emission you want that set to 6.3 and
then keep the rate is over time and then
you want to go to the the main section
at the top and you want to make sure
that duration is a thousand looping and
pre-warm a ticked and start lifetime 30
to start speed not point to 6 because we
don't want it actually to move that much
want it to maybe differ a little bit
then the start size a 5 star rotation of
not point
- not point to eight of the start color
as the white obviously you can change
this you can have the fog going up and
down with gravity but I've kept both
velocity and gravity to zero have it
simulate in the local workspace play on
awake and then Marc's particles can stay
at a thousand so obviously then you can
get a fairly varied effect depending how
you want your for your fog or smoke on
mister however whatever you want to call
it so obviously I'll just run my game I
don't know why it's in this scene but
for the sake of this you might not see
it very well with all the image effects
on so if I go to my main camera actually
and I disabled the image effects now
you'll be able to see that it maybe
looks a little bit more misty walking
through this wooded area so obvious you
can create a nice effect just with a
simple just with a simple material from
the standard assets particle system and
then just making something with a slight
mixture of settings and then you can
make yourself a fairly nice effect as
ever thanks very much for watching and
