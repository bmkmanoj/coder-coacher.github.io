really simple today how to monitor both
the GPU and your CPU temperature and
utilization as you can see here in
battlefield 3 I can easily see what's
going on in both areas and they also
show you frame rate as well so it's
something easier than fraps because
fraps is good but it only shows frame
rate you want to show see a little bit
something extra instead of flipping tabs
in GIMP so basically all you need to do
is download two programs the two key
programs where you need to download a
love and both a description MSI
Afterburner so you just click download
MSI Afterburner and you want to download
hitch W info if you go on the hedge to
be win for website you can just download
whichever ones for your operating
systems you've got a 32-bit operating
system you download the 32-bit where is
your download the 65 we've got 64 just
essentially the same thing essentially
the same thing or you can click on
download tab and download whichever one
you want doesn't matter where you get it
from because they're all reputable
sources so once you've installed both
both these programs MSI Afterburner will
look like this
and HW info when I open it up will look
like this little program here so MSI
Afterburner lets you monitor GPU
specifically turning what the speed or
the temperature is and it will let your
mod if overclock some settings but
that's that's not for today so if you're
going to settings tab on msi afterburner
you'll see a few options but what we're
really interested in is the on screen is
the monitor and on-screen display so in
here we have a few options that we can
choose but for the interest of this
video I'm wanting to monitor the GPU
temperature and the GPU usage so if you
click on either of these two you'll want
to tick the box which set
show in on the screen display as well as
the other one just to make sure that you
can see them both in the only screen
display and then on the on screen
display tab if you click the more tab
you need to make sure that on screen
display is turned on and essentially
just press ok and that's all you
realistically need to do but on your
hair it'll be waiting for
you'll get you'll get some settings all
you need to do is you click run wait for
it to load up just give it a second and
you'll get you'll get these options if I
just shift everything over everything
across it'll just bring up some general
information about all the components in
your computer and all the monitoring
systems old census so you've got but you
don't need to worry about too much what
you want to do is click the button here
which is configure and you get a full
list of all the sensors in your computer
and it might look a bit daunting but
it's quite simple you just need to look
at specific parts of your actual a
computer so you'll want to find whatever
CPU you've got and you want to find
either this or something similar
it's your total CPU usage and what you
want to do here to make it display on
your on screen display as similar with
MSI is you want to click show and label
and you want to label whatever you can
do this anywhere you want but you can
set them on different lines as you saw
in battlefield seek as you saw the GPU
and MSI Afterburner will be set to its
on line one so it doesn't matter your
the line one column one will be
underneath the MSI Afterburner GPU
output so it doesn't matter what you set
it to it's not going to overwrite the
other one so what you could do if you
don't actually one a full length total
CPU usage you can set a custom name so
if you put CPU you and then rename it'll
change it for you and then it will just
be nice and simple but we also want to
find the actual CPU temperature so if we
gone down to the actual
temperature sensor that we've got for
our different components if we go here
and got CPU we can go show on label
again and what we can do is we can click
the line one so it's on the same line as
the CPU usage but if you put it in
column two it'll be next to it so it
will show you this usage and temperature
next to each other like it does with the
GPU GP will be the same in MSI
Afterburner
and then all you need to do is click
Clause for that you have to keep this
window open and Nemus I have to have two
burner up and you can minimize them both
and keep them either way
but essentially that's just simple way
to show the GPU usage with temperatures
as well as your CPU usage in
temperatures and your frame rate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
