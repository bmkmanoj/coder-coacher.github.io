a new tutorial and I've had quite a few
people actually asking about this and
this is about sort of so the people are
asking you know to have a teleport where
you can click on the screen and do
something like that and teleport to that
sort of location in within your game but
realistically I think I can make this a
little bit simple up so you can actually
still teleport to a location that you
want to Bob in you know different stages
and you can choose you know primarily
what stage because if we start click on
the screen it's going to get start quite
confusing and it's gonna be something
quite difficult that we probably won't
be able to cover in you know say one
video or something like that so I'll
quickly go through what's in my scene
because this will be important for a lot
of people so really I've got three cubes
here so you can see all these well
rectangles and they're all red so they
indicate where you can teleport to solid
it would you know game object create
other than cube and then once you've
created these cubes I'd to spread them
you know that far apart no real idea
behind it and just put a red material on
it now what I'm actually going to do for
this is I'm gonna keep the mesh render
off for all of those objects so you
can't see the mesh now what I did was
named them teleport one teleport to
teleport three and make sure you name
them that so with capital T and then
just with the one to entry on the end
and that's just the objects that were
going to have now what I did for the
destination so the destinations are the
same so the same cube but all I did was
duplicate each of the cubes and just
give them another name so on destination
one destination - and destination 3 but
I had to remove the mesh renderer this
time and just left that as it was and
then what I'd actually do is you know
take all of these objects and parent
them to the first person controller so
select all the objects and drag them
onto the first birth control
wherever you first best control will go
those objects will go with it so what
I'm going to do is actually create a new
script and we're going to call this tell
apart and then what I'll do is we'll
open up in monodevelop and once that's
done I'll delete the two functions at
the top and just start by writing
variable destination one coulomb
transform with a semicolon and then what
I'm going to do is copy that two more
times and then change that one to
destination - and that's destination
three then I'll have another variable
called player and also set that as type
transform and then I'll have a private
variable called can teleport set - with
a column boolean equal to false and then
under there are three private variables
also called the tele one set is building
an equal to false and then what I'll do
or like I did at the top is Pierce this
in twice but change the be tele it's two
and three and then we'll save that out
so they're all the actual variables that
were going to have so we can have three
destinations that are going to be able
to visit going to have the player we're
going to have way if we can telephone
and then detailing just means if we can
actually teleport to the destination
that we want to so i'll start writing
the script from the main majority of the
script so we're gonna had a function of
death add the two brackets then the two
curly brackets and then we'll say can
tell apart equals exclamation mark can
tell apart with a semicolon so that just
means that whatever can tell apart is it
will make it exact opposite
but just before we do that we need to
write the if input dot get key down open
brackets quote t plaza two brackets
add the two curly brackets around the
can telephone so that just as I said
just means that if you press T it will
just change can teleport between true
and false depending what you clicked on
it how we can make this easier is if we
put debug dart blog open brackets then
with pop can teleport in those brackets
it just means that you're gonna display
us whatever can teleport is equal to
true and false to see if it's on and off
within the game so we can just have a
little indicator of what's happening
okay so the next bit is we're going to
actually control whether we see the
objects or not so to choose whether we
can tell a parts we'll put if can tell a
part is equal to true with two equals
and and input dot get key down Open
bracket 1 close the brackets and the
quartz then we'll say game object dot
find open brackets in quartz teleport
one close that up say get component in
brackets mesh renderer dot in here bold
it comes true so that I need to copy
that line pissed in two more times and
then say that tell apart the second one
is tell apart two and the third one is
tell apart three and what we'll do is
change that to false and that's a false
so what this means if we can teleport so
if it's can teleport is true and we
press the number one key actually the
actual block that we can see that's red
the teleport one block will actually be
enabled so we can see it and then what
we'll add under here under this line is
D tele one
equal to D tally one with a semicolon so
that's all wrong and good for that now
and I'll explain this out as I go along
I'll copy this if statement that we just
made
I'll pass that in twice because we're
going to pretty much do the same thing
every time but instead if can tell apart
equals true I'm with press two
so you change the second one to two and
the third one to three so we're going to
be able to change each time now what
we'll do here is in the second if
statement will change that we take
teleport one and we make it equal to
false because we don't wanna see it
anymore but teleport to now is equal to
true because we want to view it as long
as you press that to key then in the
third if statement we want to actually
make the teleport three equal to true
and change the others to false so you
can see that the first one's false when
we press one
the second app the first one is true
should I say only press one the second
one is true when we press two and the
third one is true when we press three
but also in the bottom here you need to
change D tele one to D tele2 and in the
third one you need to change detail.you
one to D tele three in both cases and
then underneath here I want to say that
if d tele one is equal to true and and
input dot get mouse button down up and
brackets there are closeted brackets
then when it ear within there we shall
say player dot transform dot position
equals destination one dot position
then with a semicolon what we'll do is
I'll copy that again and as we did
before pest in two more times and then
we'll say if D tele2 equals true and we
press mark get Bausman down all we're
going to need to change is make sure
that changes to destination two and then
in the third if statement if MD tell it
to is equal to true then we'll move to
destination three so if I save this and
show you what's going on now so we'll
start off that if we press T table
activate whether we can teleport or not
and then if we can tell apart in the
case as if we press one else it'll make
the object appear so the first object
that's closest to us press to the object
further away from that will then appear
but the first one will disappear and if
you press three and the third object the
furthest one away will appear and the
others will disappear and each time
we'll actually set the colliders so the
actual invisible ones that we've got for
the destinations so where we want to
actually go to so whenever we press a
certain button it will make this boolean
if statement equal to true and then
we'll be able to teleport to the
destination that we want and always
dependent on you know whether it's true
or not
one thing I will mention before we carry
on is what we're gonna need to do is
change each of these of these details to
false when we're not actually using them
so what I'm going to do is change that
to D tele2 which we're going to set that
equal to false and the tele three which
is also equal to false so we don't want
to actually and use those when we use
them so what I'll do is copy in both
into the other two but what I'll
actually do is change the ones that we
don't have
so if it's three we'll change that to
two and lots of one then I'll click Save
I'll do is now go to my first-person
controller add the teleport script and
then what I want to do is add
destination one destination to and
destination three to the correct slots
and then add you player to that slot on
the player is just the entire first
person controller you want to move one
thing I'd like to mention before you
test this out so if you as long as we
add the script to the first person we
controllin you need to make sure that
all your objects are actually above the
ground when you play your first person
trolling will drop to the ground and if
anything's below the ground in this
instance you'll actually fall through
the floor so you don't do that when you
tell a bomb to make sure they're a good
above the ground once you play the game
so now if we test it that you can see if
I press T I'll be able to tell if I if I
press one two three you can see the
ranges at which I can telephone now if I
choose teleport one that means I can
teleports over that position for press
left click i teleport of that position
if it choose two I'll teleport further
if I choose three I'll teleport the
farthest and I'll eventually get to the
end that's pretty much it for this
tutorial that shows you know a simple
way of how you can teleport to sort of
certain destinations within the way that
you play us actually looking now
hopefully that helped people out if it
doesn't you know leave a comment and
I'll see you don't can make something
else work but hopefully that gives you
the basis of making something dynamic
that works within your games so thanks
very much for watching if you liked the
tutorial don't forget to Like comment
