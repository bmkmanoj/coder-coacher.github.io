version of my part two to trial that I
did for my horror series and this is
gonna be a different way to watch them
make you know the player aware of the
enemy being visible and it's gonna work
in a director with the sanity scripts
that I created in the other in the first
part but this is instead of Ray casting
you can detect whether the actual enemy
is within front of the camera and
obviously this wouldn't work as well if
you had things behind a wall because
it's still detected because it's
whatever is rendered in front of the
camera and everything is rendered in
front of the camera no matter how far
away it is depending on the term the
distance that you've got set within your
camera settings but I'll go ahead and
show you how we're going to create this
is a lot simpler than Ray casting and
you know may well be more suited to
people's games so I'm gonna do is create
a new JavaScript file and call this
enemy vis and then we're gonna open that
up in monodevelop but once it's open
what I'll do is start by writing like we
did before private variable called
insanity script and set that as type
insanity manager and then below they'll
set a variable called scare percentage
as float equal to ten point or the
semicolon then I'll start by writing
function start to brackets then two
curly brackets below and we're going to
say sanity script is equal to game
object dot find open brackets
first-person controller are wherever
you've got and your script attached to
don't get component open brackets
insanity manager close the upper
semicolon and that's it for the
Starbucks we're just referencing to the
other script so we can access the
variables and things now we're going to
write
function up there open up two brackets
add two curly brackets below and say if
renderer with a lowercase dot is visible
close that up add two curly brackets
below and so that saniti script dot
current sanity plus equals scare
percentage times by time dot delta time
and like with before it just means that
in the update function checks every
frame that if the objects are you know
the enemy is within the cameras render
and it is visible then will do you know
the scare percentage every second and
when you know you obviously look away
from it and it's not within the cameras
render then it won't do it anymore so
what we can do is then apply this to our
box and obviously you can change that
scare percentage variable what we'll do
press play you can see that it's going
up as it normally would now if we look
away it goes back down normally and we
can do everything and obviously when
we're looking at you'd obviously need to
change things up like you focal point of
your camera so you can as a say if I'm
behind the wall and we're looking in
this direction it'll still work so you
have to choose you know which element
you believe to work the best so that's
pretty much it and that covers sort of
the basics of just another way to detect
an enemy for your mini to appear so
thanks very much for watching and if you
