festive sort of unity scene today and
this is going to help show you how to
make you terrain look more snow it's
going to be creating a snug particle
effect we're going to change the water
plane so it looks more like ice and
we're going to simulate sort of skating
across ice and I'm also going to show
you some assets that you can download
for free that I've modeled you know
especially for Christmas so you know
this is going to be a sort of side
tutorial that you can learn some bits
look at some assets learn how to create
some stuff related to wintery scenes or
Christmasy scenes so you know watch it
by all means take a look and see if you
can learn something from it so first of
all what I did is a downloaded a package
from the unity asset star the 80s snow
package is a free package that you can
download which lets you add sort of snow
share to you terrain now it's a really
good package cuz I've got to rain all
around here and you know it doesn't look
very snowy at the minute I've changed
the sky box so it looks more of a sort
of dull area now what we're going to do
is we'll click on the terrain that
you've got so you can create a terrain
or whatever you want then what we'll do
is inside the package which you can
download from the asset store is add the
custom to rin script so if we add
that to here you'll notice that we need
to add a snow texture so what will then
do is add a file type in snow and you'll
find the snow texture that we're looking
for now what you want to actually do is
increase the snow amount so you know it
starts coming over sort of the mountain
tops that I have and then you want to
decrease you know it's all dependent on
what you want to do the snow start
height so then we actually get something
which takes up the oil area now what we
want to do is mess around with a few of
these
actual objects themselves so what you
want to do is you want to set you know
roughly terrain size X and Z and it
doesn't really matter you can add the
snow power Texas to about five at the
brightness naught point one five
you can add the snow amount keep that
maybe about 100 and keep the start
height about two and then keep you
tiling up whatever you want maybe ten
sometimes if this snow texture doesn't
appear you might need to just play scene
and then exit again now this is now
we've got some sort of snow on our scene
it looks you know it looks a little bit
more festive a little bit more wintery
now what we'll do is my water the minute
it moves and we don't really want it to
move it's just a unity Pro asset now
what I'm going to do is actually change
the color so it refracts a sort of dark
color and then I'll actually change the
the wave speed to zero zero zero and
zero so then the waves don't actually
ever move and what we're going to add is
you can add a mesh Collider component to
the water so if you got a component
physics mesh Collider and it'll just
make it so that you can I'll simulate
here so we can run onto the water you
know with our any troubles so I'll
quickly simulate a and now you see we've
got the snow on the terrain and then
we'll jump down towards this and you'll
see that the waves don't move
and it almost refracts the light as if
it looks ICN it's frozen so we can run
along it now as you might have seen just
before I did that it was a snow particle
effect now I'll quickly show you how to
make this now this is quite simple in
comparison to the solvent of the
tutorial added you need to add a
particle system if you go game object
create other particle system then what
you want to do if you don't already is
you might want to right click import
package and impart the particles package
and once you've done that if you call
like on the particle system what you
want to do is make sure in the renderer
you set your material if you type in
snow you'll get the snowflake shader
which is from that package then you can
keep the max particle size to not 0.5
keep everything the same there nothing
crazy the shape can be from a sphere
emitter about around about 10 the
emission rate can be about 10 and now
the only key points here is that you
want maybe the duration to about 25 make
it loop make it pre warm because
sometimes the particle doesn't work
start lifetime around 10 start speed 2
and start size not point 5 start
rotation 3 set the gravity multiply to
not point 1 so the actual width falls
quite slowly like snow would you can
maybe put inherit velocity is about 1
and then make sure it plays on awake and
you've got you know decent amount of max
particles around a thousand and then
it's sort of simulates some snow just
falling down and of course you can just
add that to your first burst controller
and obviously it will just follow we our
character around you know wherever you
go and you know you can just mess around
with some settings and see what you know
you can get working and what you like
now one other thing is we're going to
create so you could sort of slide across
the ice and make it you know even more
festive so what I've actually done is
created a cube which goes all the way
across my ice so just slightly below the
actual 2r n I've got slightly above the
ice it's a box Collider just said to is
trigger and then we're going to quickly
write a simple script so we can you know
scare across the ice so called this
scared I'm all up it up in monodevelop
and then what we can do from here is
type in private variable can scare
equals false another private variable
called CH martyr
and set that equal to character martyr
then we'll write function start to curly
brackets under there put that in and
we'll say CH motor equals game object
dot find open brackets quotes and
first-person controller close that up
dot get component then we'll open that
up and say character martyr close that
up add a semicolon then we'll save
function on the trigger
enter open the open the brackets call
call on Collider close that up add two
curly brackets then we'll set if tag dot
F sorry cold dot tag is equal to player
close that up then we'll say that can
get M is equal to true and then what
we'll do is under there we'll copy this
paste it in under here change
ontriggerenter to on trigger exit and
then say can skate is equal to false
because if we're not in it we don't want
to be able to scare anymore then we'll
say function up there up to the brackets
put two curly brackets below and say
that if can scared is equal to true then
what we want to be able to do is add CH
Marta dot movement dot max forward speed
equals twenty with a semicolon then CH
Marta dot movement dot max ground
acceleration is equal to five and then
what we can do is copy this same thing
paste it in but instead of this top line
we can just say else and then what set
this CH mark max forward to be
LEED is equal to normal 6 and then the
max ground acceleration is equal to 20
now what we'll do is save this out go
back into unity what I'll do is go on
the scared trigger and I will add my
script and now if you follow this here
you'll notice that my character motor is
normally set to 6 and 20 now what we'll
do is we'll go towards the ice and you
know to jump on it and do what we want
to do and then you'll notice that they
both changed and it'll take you longer
to run and also you sort of slide across
the ice but of course this is just
something that you need to you know a
practice yourself get something that you
know you feel works for your game or for
what you want to create so I'll come out
of that so this has really just been a
simple thing of I'll applying the shared
to the terrain creating a particle
effect making some sort of ice with a
simple script and that's pretty much it
for what was going to show you but that
shows you how to make a sort of wintry
scene and before you go I've got
something that everybody can download
for free sort of christmas-related
assets in my scene here so you know I've
put a bunch of assets that people can
download and you know use for whatever
you want just sort of like a Slayer some
presents and Santa's hat and a snowman
so you know we can you can have a look
around and makes the scene look slightly
more festive with what you want so you
know make sure you download those give
me some comments you know tell me what
you like and thanks very much for
watching Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
