painted 2 tutorial today and this is
something I want to get more into
because it's something that I'm really
interested in following up what I'm
going to show you today is how to apply
textures are materials in substance on
an object that might be just one object
by itself so sometimes that when you
might have models in the past you might
need separate models are in this case
I'm using the match will map character
that was given out by the substance team
when it was for the competition and it
is lit up into several materials but say
for this headpiece you want to apply
several different materials to this one
piece how would you go about doing that
now there's a couple of ways you know
common ways that you can do that you can
create yourself an ID map which is based
on your UV map you give it specific
colors and you can do that in a
different program or you can back that
out from your 3d program but I'm going
to show you a way directly in substance
and it's quite a simple it's just using
some folders and in our layers stack we
want to add a new folder and what I can
call this folder is I can call this face
or something like that because we're
going to apply a material to this face
here and what I can do is as soon as I
do that I can grab a any type of
material I'll just grab this sort of red
aluminium smart material that I've got
here now it applies it to the entirety
of that head and we might not want necks
I said that we wanted to only apply it
to one piece and similarly with like I
said before if you have an ID map you
can select by color selection and select
the piece that you want but if you don't
have that you can right-click on the
folder create a blank mask because we've
created a black mask it will hide
everything which is not selected by
white what we can do up at the top here
is we can look for
it's called polygon fill and probably um
feels quite useful for as it suggests
you can fill by polygon but because this
mesh is quite high poly we'd have to
click these polygons separately and then
take quite a long time so what you can
choose is the one on the end which is
called UV Chong Phil so if you click
that make sure your color selection is
all the way in the y
what we can do is we select by UV so if
I show you and I bring up the UV map
beside by side of this object here by
hitting f1 I can just left-click on the
face here because it's UV mapped
separately and you can see there I have
now applied just that material with the
mask because you can see the little
white mask there when I make it slightly
bigger
it's just apply to there you can go back
to your and paint brush soft tool and
you can see it's there so we want to add
something around the sort of edges on
here what we can do is we can
essentially just do it again we can
create a new folder and the reason I
create a folder is so that we can add
many layers inside here if we need to
add some grunge to this we can add some
more fill layers above inside this
folder and it just encapsulates it
because you can just add yourself a fill
layer and mask it like that but I like
to keep it in folder so it's nice and
neat and I can have multiple layers for
each part and I can call this say outer
and I can do exactly the same thing what
I can do is I can add I can add this
gold armor but I've got here and you can
see again a plays of the top because
this layer is above all I could do is
right click on the folder add black mask
and you can see again we can go to the
polygon fill at the top to make sure
that we're on UV chonk fill make sure
it's all the way in the white and we can
left-click and essentially we can select
as many parts as we want to to fill in
the areas that we might want to start
masking off and you can see it just like
that and we can do that for as much as
we need based on the UV coordinates that
have already been filled in for us and
say you didn't want or you'd made a sort
of error somewhere you can select back
on say this red iminium that we've added
you can click on the mask again you can
go back on the UV chonk fill and you can
take the color all the way into the
black and then you can left click and it
will get rid of that mask so now we
don't have any of that sort of material
painted on and like I say take it back
to the white we're going to just mask
off the area that we want to be able to
see so it's a really nice way to control
everything you've got within and the
objects that you've got themselves and
just a really simple where we just add
in a mask and selecting the UV fill
and you can get away with doing quite a
lot of cool things is if I give you a
really quick example of doing it on the
body here so if I get rid of the head
and I just click on the body piece here
usually you wouldn't split it up into
sort of three different materials if it
was maybe more of a simple object so we
can add a new folder create a black mask
we can just drop something in there just
garbage bag for instance and that's all
good you can't see it yet but if we
slack on its led to that black mask we
go on the polygon fill and then for this
time we can actually choose polygon fill
itself and as long as we're in the white
we can select individual polygons if you
need to be really specific but again you
can just use the UV chunk fill just to
add of a large parts of the model if
depending how you've UV mipmap your
asset and that's the normal ways that I
usually end up doing it because it ends
up working quite well so I hope this
soft quick tutorial just helped you out
when learning quickly about masking and
just blocking off different areas and it
can really easily allow you to iterate
on the objects that you have within the
program so thanks again for watching
