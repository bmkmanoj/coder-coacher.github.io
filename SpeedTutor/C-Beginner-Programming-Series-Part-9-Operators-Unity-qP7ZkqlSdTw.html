sharp beginner series and today we're
going to be looking into operators all
the things that you will do dead day in
unity which require you to perform an
action and that's probably the best way
to describe an operator an operator
might be a sort of multiplication or
division adding something together
checking whether something is greater
than something else and you can check
within if statements to see if and you
know something's equal to something else
or if you've got something else or you
can add increments to one another so
I'll go through some examples as I've
got here amid a little example so you
can see this visually what's going on so
we'll write in code some calculation and
then I've got a lot of button which just
runs the piece of code and puts it
outputs into the little box so if you're
going to do something wrong with
operators you can create your own script
you can right-click on the project panel
go Korea and choose C sharp or you can
add this to pre-existing scripts but I
will show you an example of you know
what we can do to make this happen so in
my script here is don't really worry
about the two functions that I've got
here because these just control the UI I
was talking about which controls you
know when we press the button it'll do
something so all I've got is I've got
just a public method which is calling my
button and it just displays the output
of whatever as someone's going to be or
what operator sort of code we're going
to write and then the Clear button just
clears it and we're going to round
function like in previous tutorials
called your operators and that's what
we're going to use to using this
tutorials and I'll just knock those down
so you don't have to really look at
those so what you can do is create I'm
going to create our own method and call
it your operators just so this is the
example for today and we use two
brackets and two curly brackets below
and all I've got is I've got a private
final sum and this is going to be the
thing that's going to output into our
box so when we use operators we need to
solve to give some examples we need some
values you know to be able to start
doing stuff so that was an improve yes
videos will start the writing at a
private flat and then I will give it a
name of a and set that equal to one and
these are just going to be some examples
of you just variables that we could use
which might hold some information and
I'm just going to write a few and just
have C base money so I've got a b c d
and the role of float value so they all
hold decimal place values and the each
of them equal a different number so
let's say we want to do something and
the most common or the most basic
operator just like it would with maths
is a plus and a minus so you might do so
we can output into the box will say that
final sum because final sum doesn't
currently have any value given to it so
we want to say that final sum equals a
plus B and we'd expect that when we test
it and based on the button we press a
plus B so age one beels two will get
three so if we minimize that press play
on our on our game that we've got and
you can see it here you can see my
calculation I'll press the bomb we get
three so that's exactly what we expected
and the reason why we get the hell put
it in that box is because when we press
the button tick player it looks at this
call this function here it runs the
function your operators your operator
sets the value of final sum based on
what and you know expression we put here
and then outputs it into that text box
so you know I'll give you another
example just like we could do before we
could do B and we could do B minus a so
what do we expect we expect to minus 1
we expect the calculation just to be one
perfect that's exactly what we expected
to happen
so it's all working as we expected for a
basic operator like that which is a plus
or minus which is often caustic clusters
an additive sort of operator now we can
I'll calm it down so we don't get it
doesn't get in the way we can do a
similar thing so we can say that final
sum equals and then we might want to do
C times B just the similar the plus or
minus with sort of basic mathematics
you've got a time symbol on your
keyboard which is just the star above
your a key normally and what that would
be would be the C times D so it'd be
three times four so what do we expect to
see we expect to see 12 in the output so
what we'll do is we'll go back into here
again we'll play we've gone the
calculation it outputted twelve perfect
that's exactly what we're looking for we
can do the same here we can say that now
we could potentially say that D and we
can do divided by B so it would be four
divided by two and what do we expect to
see two and there we go in the
calculation we get to those are probably
some of the most basic operators that
you'll find plus minus and then division
and multiplication now you can do things
which and check to see whether something
is greater than something else so then
we could say something like if B is
greater than C then we could have put
two curly brackets below and say that
final sum is equal to four for instance
so this is another common thing that you
will do and you will do a greater than
or less than so what do we expect we
expect that if B is greater than C which
it isn't so we don't expect it to output
anything into the actual game so
put a zero because nothing was actually
bigger than it shouldn't be allowed it's
a zero one it's not true but then again
if we do C if C is greater than B for
instance which we expect to happen we
expect the output fall which it did and
exactly the same if we go back into our
script we can do a less than symbol or
more commonly is that you can do less
than or equal to or you can do for
instance if C is greater than or equal
to B and then we can do some sort of
calculation here and as it suggests if C
is less than or equal to B because
sometimes you need some more accuracy if
you're doing specific things that may be
increment up and down and you want to
check if it directly hits on a
particular value or not because if it's
just less than it can be less than in
decimal places and it can make you
calculate a bit more and construed let's
say so we could do is we could get rid
of those because they're simple things
is if you need to check you know if one
values below another and then you might
want to do something in your game see if
your health is below a certain value you
could say that if health is this is only
soft pseudo codes of code that we
haven't written out is less than or
equal to sort of 10 then you might want
to you know drop a warning so that helps
look now you can get something which
also is quite important you can say that
if a is equal to B then we could do
something within the brackets and say
final sum is equal to 4 again but what
this means is the double and equal sign
means if it's equal to each other so
if a is equal to B I say is the same
value as B then we expect to output 4
but the problem or days we expect that a
is not the same as B so if we do
calculation we will get 0 and that's not
right but let's say for instance that we
made a new flat value private flaw on
set E and set that equal to 1 as well so
if we say that a is equal to R equals
equals to e we expect that to be true so
it would help put a value or for which
it does like we expect it similarly with
that we can have something cold so if we
leave the a and the e together we can
set an exclamation mark and an equal
sign and that means that if it's not
equal to so if a is not equal to we then
will output fall so what do we expect to
see we expect to see that we're going to
see a 0 because it isn't true and a is
equal to 4 so it can output that because
it's asking you know am I not equal to
this I am equal to it so this isn't
correct so if we say is a not equal to B
then that would come out as true yes
it's not equal to the same value so we
would expect to do the calculation and
outputs for because it what it wasn't
the same so that works perfect we can
have some other common operators now
what we can look at is we can say and we
can use two operators together one more
so we can say that if a is equal to 1
and then B is equal to 2 and then we can
say that final sum should be equal to 4
so we're using 2 together now so now
we're saying that we're saying if a is
equal to 1 and so and the double I'm
just means so we'll checking both things
together and B if B is equal to 2 then
we'll output the final sum which will be
4 so we can look back in
click the calculation and it will output
for now for instance let's say if we go
back into our script and say now that is
a equal to 2 now we don't expect a to be
equal to B is equal to 2 but seen this
of the two sort of conditions aren't
correct so we'll clear that and we can
see that it shouldn't be equal to
anything and we output a zero now
assimilate with an and and we can do a R
value which is between your shift and
you Z key you can hold shift and press
that button which is a backslash and you
create two straight lines which is two
symbol an operator of R so we can say
that if a is equal to 2 or B is equal to
2 then we'll do the final sum so if we
go back to Outback in unity we need to
make sure we've got a value we expect to
see a value of 4 and there we go we get
the value of 4 out because one of the
conditions that we've got here was true
so it was either one has to be true
other than the and and symbol says that
the both got to be true
another common operator that we could
use is a plus plus and a minus minus
which just means it increments each
value by one each time let's say for
instance you would this final sum is
equal to a final sum plus 1 all that
would mean is that we're incrementing
final sum by one now there's an easier
way to do that without having to
actually write that we can just write
final sum plus plus with a semicolon on
the end so what we could essentially do
is we could put final sum plus plus into
here
and we could slot it in under here and
just pretty much saver and if we start
by saying that our final sum is equal to
let's say 12 now we've got this if-then
which says if a is equal to or B is
equal to do then we'll do final sum plus
plus so we final sum starts off at 12
here we expect that every time we press
the button to test it's going to add 1
to the value of final sum sway expect to
get 13 14 15 and so on so make sure you
say value script you can press play and
what we expect to see really expects to
see a value of 13 so there you go we had
a value of 13 so increment the value we
can clear we can press it again we get
14 clear 15 16 17 is because it adds 1
each time to the value and similarly if
we do a minus - all right double
subtraction if you want to put like that
we won't get rid of 1 each time and it
just really depends on the sort of
complex TV code and what you want to
achieve so day to day when you're making
your games you will have subscribe and
addition and subtraction for maybe
adding values together if you need to
check something multiplication and
division and if you need to you know
effect something by a greater amount if
you need to check whether one value is
greater than another or less than that's
often very important if you need to
check if two values are equal to each
other so if you check in to see if
something's true and then some things
above a score value you need to do
something else or if something is not
equal to or you check in to see if you
should do this or you should do
something else and then you can now use
the operator to and increment the value
by 1 each time depending on what you
want to do so hopefully this sort of
visual representation helped you out
thanks very much watching don't get too
light come to describe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
