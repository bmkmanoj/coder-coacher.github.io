sharp beginner programming series so
today I'm going to be focusing on
triggers or trigger events and this is
one of the most common things that will
actually find in games design or
anything that you will see in any type
of game whether it be triple-a or
whether it be indie this entire series
is not going to be the car fundamental
of every step of programming it's going
to be more of the things that I think
that you need to cover to be able to get
straight into developing games and the
most common things you'll use dear today
and it's what I use myself so we'll get
straight into it this time is that I'm
sure a lot of you are aware but if I'm
going basis wise to use or to start with
doing collision events we need to
actually add a trigger so what we can do
is we can go a game object 3d object and
we can add a cube and our cube is going
to act as our trigger and what you want
to do with the trigger is make sure it's
big enough for everyone or for your
player to be able to walk through and
activate so that's plenty big enough so
what we can do in the inspector is we
can remove the mesh renderer so if we
click the drop-down choose remove mesh
renderer you can still see the box
Collider which is encapsulated there
what you need to make sure that you do
is have it is ticked is trigger and you
need to make sure that whatever
controller you're using needs to be have
its own tag of player or whatever tag
you're going to use we're going to
reference that in script now first thing
you want to do is create a new script
and you see sharp script and we're going
to call this trigger event and then what
we're going to do that is will open up
in monodevelop so like I was saying one
of the most common things that you'll
find is a trigger event and I will start
by showing you how to do it so when we
get this to starting methods we don't
need those
I like to bring the two encapsulating
curly brackets down because we always
need those in when we're inside this
initial class so what we want to do to
begin with is write void and void is
always the thing that we most often
start off a common method with and then
we want to write on trigger enter so
that's saying that this is our initial
method and we're going to name this well
it's a common method type of
ontriggerenter then you want to start by
opening up your brackets writing
collider and then after collider we can
have any name we want because we're
going to reference that in script in a
moment so you can just have that as
other which is most commonly used then
close the brackets up and then what you
can do
below there is add two curly brackets
now let's quickly briefly go over this
again is you can hover over many things
and you can see that the void is the
method the most common one of the most
common method types we can have is
ontriggerenter then in the brackets
we're giving some parameters to the
method and we're saying that collider is
the thing that we're going to be looking
up so it's going to be the component
that we're looking at and then we're
going to give it a name which we need to
reference so then when this just means
that one we hits a the on trigger and so
we need to do something and then in here
we can say if then we can open brackets
other dot compare tag open brackets in
quotes lair close that up with a
quotation mark and a bracket and then
another bracket and then what we could
do is add two curly brackets below
but sometimes it doesn't like to farm at
it the way I like and you always need
the curly brackets underneath everything
to encapsulate another statement that
you're going to write so if I've got my
initial method we've got two brackets
and if you click at the beginning of the
bracket you will see it highlights the
bottom one and there's always a left
facing bracket at the top and then a
right fist in bracket toward the bottom
and I just like to indent the code
according to how I'm going to write it
so say I was going to write it in here
you see sharp scripting just does this
for you it will already indent it here
then if I go across there it'll
automatically indent it again for me but
because we've got this I'll go into if
statements in another tutorial more
prominently but we want to say that if
so if just means as it suggests if we
give it this criteria we will do it if
the criteria is met then what we're
saying is that when we open the brackets
we're saying that if the other so if the
other which is the collider which we'd
given it we're going to compare the tag
and we're going to search for the tag of
player like we put on our player
previously and then from there I'll just
write a comment well I'll write actually
write a debug line in here so debug dot
log open brackets and we'll just write
hello and what that does is a debug log
just will show it in the error reporter
or the debug inspector and we're just
right in the brackets in quotes hello so
it'll just output that for us and we
always need to add a semicolon after any
particular stem and then we're going to
say as long as it's not an if statement
and it's not a method so what we'll do
is we'll save that we'll go and drop
down now we will you go to our cube
which was our trigger you can rename
that if you like we can add the trigger
event
- that cube specifically and what I will
do is I will play the game and you'll
notice if I then walk towards the
collider you want to look down the
bottom where I'll bring the actual
debugger up in a second and we'll walk
towards it and we walk to the collider
and you can see that it reported hello
so we know that it's actually working
now if I take that off what I could do
is I could just quickly add a mesh
renderer to that cube so we can see it
so that was the sort of simplicity of
writing your sort of first key function
and this is the fundamental of
completing an admission doing anything
again that you will find and you can do
any number of things within the trigger
event and if you write two sort of
forward slashes you this is just a
comment so you can write whatever you
want this means I want to say hello for
instance and I will show you a different
example so it's going to be on trigger
exit so this is going to be a different
version of a most commonly used method
type so like we've done before you can
practice along but you can see this
going to be very simple start write void
on trigger exit then we're going to open
up the brackets write collider again
then we're going to set over close that
up put two curly brackets below again
one left one right it will already
indented our code will say that if other
dot compared tag open brackets in quotes
player close that quarry top and add two
brackets then what we'll do is add two
curly brackets below there and I will
explain maybe I didn't mention before is
that you can see this bracket here at
the beginning in the beginning of the if
statement and you will see that these
two brackets are around the player
and you need the bracket on the end to
serve fish off I click on this first
bracket you can see this bracket will
end it so say I show you this you will
notice that that in bracket meets with
that bracket but this bracket has no
sort of let's say a friend to go along
with it so you need to add another
bracket at the end to encapsulate the
full if statement so we're just saying
that if other so if the collision that
we're going to detect is the player then
we're going to want to do something else
so again we can write debug log and then
we start by opening a bracket in quotes
we can say maybe we could say goodbye
and then we can close the up and add a
semicolon and then if I save that out
again this is all well and good so when
we enter we expect it to say hello then
when we exit that same Collider we
expected to say goodbye so if I now
press play again you'll notice that you
can see my pink Collider there if we
walk towards it you can see that said
hello and we walked out of it in the
same instance it said goodbye and again
if we walk through it as many times as
we like and it will just keep doing that
forever until we give it something else
to do now one last example is I want to
go through this entire example because
it's exactly the same is we can under
void on trigger stay in exactly the same
where as the others and all I'm on
trigger stay does is essentially white
suggests is if you stay inside the
trigger then you can do something cuz
enter is it will only do the statement
here all the lines of code that you've
given it when you enter it this
ontriggerexit will only do it when you
exit that specific collider and on
trigger stay is that as long as you're
all as long as you're actually inside
the collider and staying inside the
collider
so there's a few things those three sort
of methods are rarely important and I
use those day-to-day in doing things
whether their missions whether they need
to activate something else whether you
need to activate another game object
whether you need whatever you need to do
you've just got to remember that you
start off the method you give it the
collider type you give it an a give
their name you have the two curly
brackets up and below you have a simple
if statement which I'll go into in
future videos you referenced by saying
that the other Collider that we're going
to give we're going to look for the
collider B tag of player and it needs to
be in brackets and encapsulated for the
entire if statement then you're going to
need again two curly brackets above and
below left and right facing and then you
can write whatever lines of code you
want in between there for whenever you
enter exit or you stay in a particular
trigger so really that's just the
fundamentals of activating triggers and
just remember that you can either needs
to be is trigger and whatever you're
interacting with it needs to be tagged
as player or whatever tag we're going to
be giving it specifically here so thanks
again for watching hope this helped
