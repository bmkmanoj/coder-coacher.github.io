tutorial today is gonna be playing a
video just on top of one of these scenes
so whether you use this as an
introduction to game a splash screen so
when you're in unity I've got unity 2000
17.3 here and this was available unity 5
now I've got a little video down here
and it's just my speed shooter in from
and you can see that when I play it
there you can see in the bottom corner
here just as there it runs through what
you can do is you can right click in the
scene and import new asset and you can
pour yourself a video and then with the
video you can ill come automatically as
a video clip and it will import the
audio automatically for you in your
hierarchy if you create a new scene go
right click empty game object and we
could just name this intro video
something like that and then we'll just
reset the transforms by right-clicking
on the transform arrow and clicking
reset and now it's in our scene what we
can do is we can add a new component or
we can type in video and then we'll get
the video player component and you'll
see that you'll have a source slot and
you can choose whether it's a video or
you can play something via a URL but
we're going to be looking at the video
clip specifically today and it's got a
video clip slot what we can do is we can
just drag the video in there you can you
have similar settings that when you've
got an audio source lying awake this
means as soon as we start the game it
will start playing well wait for the
first frame suggests that it will wait
for as soon as it's all loaded up and
then it will start playing as long as
you can see at all but if you only tick
that you might lose it the first few
frames of your video because it might be
still stuff might be loading in the
background you can take it to loop if
you could choose to do so you can change
the playback speed if you want to make
it slower or faster you can choose to
make it a render texture but we're going
to do this so it's just almost in front
of the main camera so we don't have any
issues so we're gonna just either put it
on the cameras far or near clipping
plane so we'll do is we'll choose the
cameras far plane and then we've got to
specify a camera so we'll choose our
main camera from the scene and we'll
just drag it in there and we'll leave
the he'll from one and it's got an audio
source mode so you can leave that an
audio source we can add to this game
object audio so
and we can leave that just like that and
what we can do is we can drag the audio
clip back into itself laptop and then
what we can do is we can go onto the
game view and you can see that we can
see this background with the skybox so
we can go back to main camera and we can
set the background to completely black
and then set the clear flags to just a
solid color just so that we don't get
any issues in the future sometimes you
might need forward rendering for this
but and what you do is try this by then
pressing play and you will hear the
audio and you'll hear the video playing
in the background and then afterward
just any settings are all to make this
work
and you just want to make sure that it
fits a specific aspect ratio when you
render out your video so it's so quiet
it's a really simple and easy way just
to create just the video player play the
audio or with an audio source and just
sent it to the cameras far clipping
plane and if you need like a splash
screen and intro a little cutscene it's
quite easy to do so hopefully this helps
you out thanks very much for watching
