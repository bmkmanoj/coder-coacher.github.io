tutorial today and this is going to be
the start of the unity 5 optimization
series or how to go about optimizing
mainly let's say a 3d game in unity 5
now I think this is really important
because a lot of people often look past
optimization in games and a lot of
people and people who play games don't
realize that you have to put a lot of
effort in to optimize it and you want to
optimize from the very beginning of your
game so for every asset that you bring
in every asset you create you need
optimization in mind so I will just give
you a brief introduction of what we can
do in this series and we're going to
look at the just the basics of tracking
how things are optimized currently
within a particular scene we're going to
look at modeling and good modeling
techniques textures sizes importing
those into unity using the standard shed
light mapping level of detail and maybe
some occlusion culling a lot of
different things to help you optimize
your game that you might not have known
if you're more of an advanced user this
might not be for you but for the people
who maybe struggle to get certain FPS I
need some ideals and how to do it I'll
be having a series to help you do that
so first of all what I've got is if we
start off on this scene it's quite basic
all as is a few objects in the scene now
when you bring anything in it will have
however many triangles however many
materials that it's made of with what
textures brighting if you've got
lighting whether it's real-time or baked
or you've made light maps out of it and
are the other interesting features that
we'll go over in the future but the big
thing to look at is if we go over to the
game tab and you enable stats at the top
at everybody in unity 5 we'll have
access to this I'm sure this is slightly
changed from unity 4 but obviously unity
far I think had this in unity pradhan if
it was in free but anyway we'll have a
look at now just a glance the
top the audio is not as big an issue for
this for the moment and that just shows
the sort of audio settings want to
concentrate on the graphic sort of
things because you'll see things move
when I play the game when we test it in
a moment now
one thing you've got to look at is set
Pascal's and batches because they're the
sort of things how it's change from
unity fall and the things that we used
to class has draw calls and draw calls
are the thing they're taxing the CPU or
when I run around you'll notice that my
batches and my set patties sort of match
has been the same sort of thing so I
realistically have only got 12 draw
calls in my current scene which isn't
very high at all you can go into
hundreds of thousands depending on what
hardware you're I am in for and you've
got to remember that draw calls are
brought in for every object that's
passed to the CPU to actually do any
calculations with and then we have tries
in vertexes so triangle counts is how
many triangles your model is made up of
and if we click on a particular asset
you can see that if you can see the
wireframe you can see just about where
the triangles would be but the bigger
thing for unity is vertices because
vertices are counted with every point
that's made up on your mesh and the UV
map vertices so if you've got UV map on
all your objects is going to often
double up the vertex count even if the
triangle count looks being alone one
thing we'll do when we do the
optimization is you'll save some actual
performance by batching dynamic batching
is when unity if say all these objects
in my scene here they all share the same
material which is called IMG and what
that means it's dynamically batched so
it means that it groups all these
objects together and puts them into one
draw call so instead of the bin you know
however many assets there is in here
seven let's say it will change it so
that is grouped into one draw call
because it's grouped by the material
that it uses
and I'll show you this in the profile in
a minute but we can also do what's
called static batching and I think that
is also a feature in the free version of
the pro version for unity 5 and if we
take that it will make sure that it's
statically batched so instead of using
dynamic batching where it will do it
automatically without you even having to
do anything it will group all these in a
similar way and if the share and the
static tag on the same same object with
the same material there will be grouped
together into one single drakul and you
need static to be ticked to do light
mapping now obviously we'll go through
that in the future again and that will
be that'll say where it's saved by
batching and you'll see if I play my
game that I've got 12 or 23 depending
where I look said by batching so it's
batched it together without any hassle
on my behalf
really and then we can see how many
shadow casters there is so if we baked
out the lighting pretend this is me back
to the light into a texture map we
wouldn't get any shadow of casters so we
don't get an extra taxation on the draw
calls because for every shadow cast
you've got the mod raw calls going to be
cold because you're almost rendering
things again because you're having to
calculate shadows and then we've got the
screen which shows the resolution that
I'm playing it on which is only this
tiny little window box and shows how
much memory it's taking up so it's only
taking nine megabytes of memory and then
we can have however many skinned meshes
or animations we have in our scene and
I'll show your FPS count so just the
things to look out for is to reduce the
set draw calls and the batches as bunch
as you can save as much by batching keep
track triangle count vertex count as low
as possible just keep everything as low
as possible and you want to try and hit
whatever resolution and platform you're
looking for now I know I said I'd go
over the profile and the profiler is
something that is pretty helpful to
distinguishing different problems that
you might have because if you go to
window and profile it will bring it up I
will undock it from this so you can see
it maybe a little bit easier and this
just profiles as long as you've got
record on and you play your game
you can see that it's running and you
can see that it's recording what's going
on in the background and if I'm player
we can sort of scrub across and we can
decide all that looks like it's a big
peak in the performance look we can go
to the rendering and this is the thing
that we're most concerned about is that
at this point in time we had set passes
as 12 draw calls as 20 at the time
dynamically batching wasn't on because
everything was set to static and with
static batch 13 items so and it will
show as how many triangles and vertices
and what we've managed to save when
we've patched it together and how many
textures we've used to megabyte and
little things like that so it can almost
iron out a lot of different things you
see you can go to memory see where the
memory has been used
see where the CPU might be taxed and
you've got to also remember that
anything that includes physics our stuff
that's got to do physics calculations ie
rigidbody and things that will tax it
more along with everything like
particles image effects anything that
does more to the camera or could
essentially make more draw costs we've
got to remember draw calls or what would
necessarily see them the support strain
on the CPU and then the triangles and
vertices are what strain your graphics
card so this was just a brief overview
of how you'd might want to look at the
different stats in the game so always
keep draw calls as low as possible
keep trying on vertex count as a low as
possible itíd the best of your ability
and for this series I'll be going deeper
into all the different areas that you
can possibly optimize again so sorry
this is a bit of a long video but
hopefully this sort of helps you just
distinguish some issues that you might
find in the future so thanks very much
