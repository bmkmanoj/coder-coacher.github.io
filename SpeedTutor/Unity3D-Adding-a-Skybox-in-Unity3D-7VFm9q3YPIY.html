how to add a skybox in unit and this
works in both unity free and Perl
doesn't matter what you've got so really
I just got my scene for my other
tutorials edited that are in a little
bit change to clog the water but all
I've got is my terrain a basic
directional light some water
first-person controller and that's it so
first of all what you want to do is you
want to right click on your workspace
and then you want to import package if
not already because you can choose when
you create a new project to win include
certain packages but you want to include
the skyboxes package you can actually
download other skyboxes from the unity
asset store and things like that I even
create your own but for the sake of this
all you need to do is import the package
is in and you can see it important all
the different files and then once you've
done that that'll appear in your
standard assets folder right on the
skyboxes so what you want what you need
to do now is you go on edit render
settings and then on your skybox
material if you click the little search
function box you can see that you've got
different sky boxes so ones
sunny sunny 223 depends you may have all
the materials in here so you've just got
to search so you can search in your
folder to find what the names out of a
cast and things like that and they'll be
a nighttime our moon light so I'll just
stick with I'll just stick with sunny
one you double-click you'll see that it
appears and sometimes if you realize
that yes sky might not be appearing you
need to make sure the clear flags
actually set to Sky box in unity because
if you see in my little preview window
if I change the clarifies to just set
color like that
we can't see it but if you had the
background you'll see the reflections if
you get unity Pro you can see the
reflection in the front refracted water
so that's pretty much it Fred in the
skybox really quick and easy and really
simple to do Cheers if you liked the
tutorial don't forget to Like comment
