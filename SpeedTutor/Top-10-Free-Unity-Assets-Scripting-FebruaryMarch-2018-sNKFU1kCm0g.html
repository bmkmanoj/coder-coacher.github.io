assets for February March 2018 so number
one is the runtime inspector and
hierarchy now I don't know where this
one is actually fully beneficial but it
allows you to create a runtime inspector
a hierarchy that you can see you know
when you run your game and it allows you
rather than to have it with just
generally in the inspector you could see
this as you plan you get maybe for
debugging and things like that and it's
fairly optimized and allows you to get
all the men scene information within
your game as it's running without you
like I said been in the editor so maybe
when you've built out you can check some
things just on the fly and you can check
different settings as you go a lot
number two is something called scene
markup now I don't know how infective
this is but it looks pretty cool and
this is a simple script which allows you
to record movements have a game object
and convert that into an animation it
can be useful for example to record a
fall of various objects to in to avoid
having to use physics and things like
that
and you can optimize your game and turn
that into an animation the next one is
something called gamejolt
api and if anybody's released something
to game Joel this is an API for a
selection of features suitable for
online scores trophies and achievements
cloud data storage games a serene
logging and user verification and login
and it's a package which saw supports
all features supported by gambrel advice
and has an easy API routing and c-sharp
for you to integrate it fully into unity
so if you're looking to get a game on
gamejolt and you want to use the extra
features that are in that platform then
this might be something for you to look
at and the next one is breakable windows
and as you can see from the little video
here and the the little trap balls move
down and they hit the glass in the
bottom and it's a simple rigidbody soft
simulation which is specifically defined
for breaking shop windows and
essentially you can break the windows
with the collision just by using a
fairly simple script and the next one is
something called the great fleece and
the great fleece was commemorated in
partnership with unity and the assets
that we use were custom made
and it's gone accompanied course on
udemy for looking to how this game was
created so it looks like it was maybe a
robbery or a jewelry store and you're
looking to create this as it goes along
and the next one is daily rewards free
and this is something that's always
really good and popular within mobile
games to increase the retention of
customers especially when if you've got
a game that ends up being quite
repetitive and you give rewards for
doing certain things this might be one
form to keep customers coming back and
back back if you give daily rewards and
it's a great way to help monetization
and things like that and it supports
multiple days weeks months or whatever
you need to do and it's mobile ready
easy to use you can integrate it and it
comes with several different versions
and this might be something just for you
to nicely integrate into again just to
add those features and there is a pro
version if you want to do use that and
the next one is the simple city builder
and this is a a simple asset which
allows you to like mast mobile on games
clash of clans things like that includes
a way to add buildings with sort of
functionality which includes the C shaft
code with the unity GUI mobile friendly
and it comes with a selection of
building framework a tile grid named
buildings which include a town hall hot
gold mine storage and has overlays and
the shop with the unity GUI and it has
the kit for creating buildings and it's
been made easily and the next one is the
free horror game kit which is a project
for developers who wanted to create a
survival game and it includes a main
menu and advanced in game 7 load system
flashlight system battery charge system
a collect pager system health system
customizable UI modular buildings free
lots of free assets fog system and all
the c-sharp scripts so it might be
something if you want to get started on
making your own horror game this might
be just a selection of scripts assets to
help you out next one is called a wave
farm provide and it's an asset which
dynamically generates a text you
simulate waves making it easy to you and
the menus is with custom shaders and if
you need to customize the share of the
water surface to create lots of
different objects and it makes a task of
getting waves really easily so you can
see from the video here
you can sort of modify this and it
leaves quite a cool effect and last but
not least is the maneuver FPS free and
this is something that you can buy which
is a from a larger pack and the free
version includes one-click controller
create setup maneuver FPS controllers
script the camera controller script
health sub display and basic footsteps
audio system and in comes with a custom
inspector for all scripts and the full
version has a lot more functionality for
rare casts turrets and mobile support
mini-map complete weapon system all
things like that so maybe if you're
looking to create FPS soft style system
this might be one for you and just try
it out and see how it works so be sure
to check out all these scripts and
assets for February March 2018 and give
a big thanks to all the developers that
continue to make all these assets and
makin them for free so thanks again for
