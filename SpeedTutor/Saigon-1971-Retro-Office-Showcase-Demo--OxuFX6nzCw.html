showcase video and this is gonna be
featuring the 1971 a retro office and
this is a sort of model pack slash demo
scene which features a very typical
looking military style office focused on
the sort of 1971 with a bunch of shared
as textures all with PBR setups and has
a really nice sort of visual style
towards this sort of scenario that
you've been looking up it comes with
over 90 props God rares it's got various
scripted and objects for with animations
because they'll be animated fan cameras
and lots of other things and it can also
show you where's that the actual scene
has been set up how they've done the
lighting how to set up all the little
probes in there and all the things like
that so you can get quite a lot of ideas
from that in itself it's from a few
people who've got quite a lot of
pedigree in doing things for unreal and
unity and it's roughly around $60 give
or take depending on the fluctuation in
your currency and like I said it covers
a lot of high quality assets so it's
well worth the money in that regard and
I will give you a quick look of how it's
all set up in unity so you can see that
itself with a bunch of scenes it comes
with all the the lookups for the actual
colour correction that's used with the
post-processing and it uses 2000 17.2
and above so it uses the post-processing
stack version 2 as far as i'm aware it
comes with all the particles
post-processing prefab sphere scene with
over 90 props as you can see here
whether it be comes with the their
chairs the items the miscellaneous stuff
which are all featured for this style of
asset and I'll just give you a look
around in the scene because I like to
drop the an FPS controller in with the
similar settings just so you can have a
look around the scene so you can see the
way that it's set up an animated ceiling
fan the ceiling fan over here and we
have the specific decorations to a
military style office so if you added a
little bit of say a few sound effects to
this you could hear some cars outside
maybe some talking some rustling of the
fans and stuff like that you could
really get the
sense that you are in an office just
like this and it comes with all the sort
of specific items with a soft
old-fashioned record our tape player
with the technical items there with the
sort of decals and items that you would
feature just as props you could almost
use in any game whether it's military
based or not with just books and
containers and by looking at this when I
got out of here you could essentially
just make a corridor like these and you
can have a bunch of offices if you choke
choose to make that sort of scene and
you can clutter it up you could have
rows of offices which have got different
sort of army generals whatever it may be
and you can make the idea of just loads
of different military styles so it
depends if you're gonna feature and a
sort of old-fashioned sort of 1971 style
whether it's going to be a military
environment or you just want to take
some of these props and use them within
your own scenes so make sure to check
this one out on the unity asset start if
it's something that you are looking for
so thanks again for watching don't
