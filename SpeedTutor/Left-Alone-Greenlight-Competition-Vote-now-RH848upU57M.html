shout out for the game that me and a
friend of developing in unity we've put
it on Steam greenlight if you've ever
liked watching one of my tutorials I
ever felt that you've learned something
cool and take a minute of your time just
to like it on Steam all you need to do
is if you've got a steam account already
you can just vote yes and it will really
help us trying to get it greenlit and
one of the things we wanted to mention
is that if and when you vote on the game
please comment down in the comment
section and I'll keep a tally of all the
people who end up voting and then we'll
do a raffle or sort of like a
competition there at the time and we'll
give out some free cards for the game
when it's released so again thanks very
much for watching all the videos
hopefully we can get this game greenlit
and hopefully everybody can enjoy it and
to all those who follow my tutorials
normally we'll be getting into the next
part the Survival Series which will be
looking into fishing in the next few
days so again thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
