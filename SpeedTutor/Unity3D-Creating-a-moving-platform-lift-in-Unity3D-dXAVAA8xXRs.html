another tutorial today which somebody
suggested and somebody wanted to know
how to do a moving platform or an
elevator so you can see it in my scene
here that you know there's nothing crazy
here's my platform that I want to get
and here's like the elevator
sorry elevators just made up of an
actual rectangle with a non rectangle
with a sort of red button on it now what
we're going to do is going to create a
script for that red button but before I
do that you can see that I've got my
platform object to my elevator and it's
just a parented the two other objects
which were this and this to the elevator
what we want to watch to do is make
animations for this elevates it'll go up
and then from being up it'll go down so
we click on the other vector and if you
go to window animation then what we want
to do is you make sure that your
elevator selected if you press record
then what we're going to do is actually
make a new animation so if I just go
into my elevator folder and move this
and call it up then what I'm going to do
is select my transform sofa clip
transform it selects all the transform
units then what we'll do is create a
keyframe or the first frame and then a
keyframe so on a second in to the
animation what I'm going to do is use
the green arrow and just pull it you
know roughly to the top and that's it so
when you press play you know you'll get
that now that's it for the OP animation
and then from here where you can see it
says up or go on create new clip and
then we'll call this down and then we'll
save that out and like we did before
we'll press the record button or click
on transforms we select all the options
I will actually send you a keyframe at
the top and bring the arrow all the way
up to roughly where we had it before go
across scrub across to one second
and then bring this down roughly to you
know the floor
and then we'll close the animation
window and I'll bring that into my
elevator folder and you'll notice that
two animations are on my mesh now so if
you click on the elevator you're notices
up and down on tape player automatic
list will open a player as soon as we do
anything and then what we're going to do
is we're going to create a new script
and then call this lifts and then what
we'll do is open up the lift script in
monodevelop and then what I'm going to
actually do we're going to create two
private variables one cold pressed
button and set that type boolean equal
to false another variable called is
elevator up column boolean equals false
and then variable tag it as type game
object and then what you'll do is write
a function on mouse-over two brackets
then two curly brackets and then say a
pressed button equals true and then I'll
copy this same function paste it in down
below and have it as on mouse exit
and set press button equal to false and
then what we're going to write on the
dash is function on GUI and with two
brackets then two curly brackets and
then say if and pressed button is equal
to true then GUI dot box open brackets
new rekt they would say 300 comma 300
comma 200 comma 20 close that bracket
comma and then adding quartz press to
use left and then end that and put a
semicolon
now what want to do is actually that
will just bring up a message to say that
you can use it when you've hovered over
the button now what I wanted to do is
when you click on my button you actually
do something so now alright function on
Mouse down and then add the two curly
brackets and we're going to say that if
and then what I'll do is copy this
function so I'll spell it
I'm in this variable so I'll spell it
right and say if is elevator is equal to
false then I have to go to brackets and
we're going to say target equals game
object dot find open brackets quotations
elevator close that up then we'll set
target dot animation dot player open the
brackets and then write your animation
what was cold so it's cold up close the
hole and then what I'll say that is and
then I'll paste in is elevator up
set that equal to true so that means if
elevator is up so if it's not up then
we'll find the game object elevate or
finally animation will play it and then
will set and is elevator up to true so
then we can go down again then under
here right else add two curly brackets
and then say pred too much the same
thing so I'll paste it in again and say
that this one calls it down and then
elevate off equals false and then we'll
save that minimize this and then what
I'll do is add that to the bottom to add
the script to the bottom and then make
sure the Angie elevator game object to
this button this button script to the
target and then press play and you'll
notice that when I go up to my thing
you'll say press to use the lift so
we'll click it once we'll go up and then
we're on the top platform we'll click it
again and we'll go back down and you
know as long as you click it you know
you can go up go where and on if you
click it again will the actual button
you know let you do it so that's pretty
much the simplicity at all
just using animation is a simple bit of
script to control when you press table
to set buildings true and false so
that's pretty much it and that's all you
need to really know about this so thanks
very much for watching and as ever if
you liked the tutorial don't forget to
