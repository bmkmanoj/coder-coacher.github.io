tutorial this is just me asking for your
feedback on what you'd like to see far
now in the future now as I've said in my
previous video that I've just released
that unity 5 has just been released and
you can get the free version and such
which has all the features of previous
pro versions so that you can follow any
tutorials that you might have missed out
that I've done now there might be some
slight changes in the program and we'll
work on that if I need to do it as the
survival series i've been making in
unity 4.3 because that's what unity
version i've been using to make my game
so i haven't been very sort of reluctant
to upgrade because obviously if i'm
making a project i don't like to upgrade
in between in case anything messes up
now this unity 5 version i do have
installed so i can make some tutorials
as i say i'm just looking for some
insight from everybody who watches my
videos do you want to see some videos
for unity 5 do you want me to see carry
on making stuff in unity for now the
survival series is a bit of a difficult
one because i might carry that on in
unity for just for the sake of that's
how the series began but i may well make
a video or maybe carry on the series
with in unity 5 are make a video with in
unity 5 to show you how to import all
the scripts and do everything
accordingly because they've change
certain things with the FPS controller
and such so it'll just take me a little
bit of time to get round to using it i
haven't used unity 5 very much because
i've been working on my own projects in
unity far as I say but give me some
information tell me what you're sort of
looking for and then I'll try and bring
some content out in the future so thanks
again for watching don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
