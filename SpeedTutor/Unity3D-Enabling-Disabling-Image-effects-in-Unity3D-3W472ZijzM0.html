how to turn camera image effects on and
off now this was based on a subscriber
how having the problem and I thought I'd
make a quick video but it also ties into
their working with scripts and turn them
on and off on a man Cameron things like
that so all I've got is i renamed my
script it's similar to the a binocular
script that had previously another
tutorial so the slap scripts the same so
what you want to do on your main camera
is when you want to add an image effect
is as long as you get unity pro you can
go a component image effects and for
this example I use fisheye and this was
just a sort of if you search Google
Images and you get a fisheye effect if I
turn for a ramp this up something like
100 hundred and I press play you'll
notice that it's got a very pretty weird
effect it's got weird effect it gives
like a fish I sort of lens effect but
for the sake of this and just showing
you how you can actually work with these
depending on what you press what I'm
going to do is actually open my fish i
zoom script which is just the same as
the monocular script
and you'll notice the same thing is
you're not all the same components but
we're just going to add a few more
things that this and this will work in
any example so we're going to write
another part of it variable and we'll
call this fish eye and we're going to
actually set it to virtual fish I script
that's on the camera and then in the
start function i'm going to write fish
eye which is our variable i'm going to
set it equal to and then we're going to
find the get van components or get
component and then the fisheye script
and then put a semicolon and then again
we're going to write fisheye which was
our variable here and we're going to
write dot enabled equals false so that
means when it starts it finds the script
that rescate to find on the main camera
and then what we can do it on the actual
when it's set to true to turn the image
effect on and off and zoom in we can say
fish i dot enabled equals true and then
we can also this is just an added one we
can also say fisheye fish i dot strength
x equals 1 and similarly this is just
changing the actual variable on the
fisheye so if i go back into unity here
you can see that on the fisheye script
we've got strength x and strength white
and you can see that inside the script
you can see all the variables there
inside will set the strength why so you
can change all these based on what you
want to do and then what we can do is
set fish i dot enable to false so when
you actually zoom back out again you
don't notice the effect so what we'll do
is we'll start the script
we've got problem here exempla pot
capital when I shouldn't have done and
then if I play it again you notice that
the fisheye script is not actually
working because you can see down here at
some ticked and when we right-click
you'll notice that it is ticked now and
the strength has changed to one we undo
we get that effect so that's just simply
how you can turn scripts on and off by
referencing as a variable and saying
itself finding the component and then
just referencing that variable to change
different things so that's pretty much
it cheers and if you liked the tutorial
