tutorial and my last tutorial was about
actually pushing objects with the
physics but this time it's actually
adding a sound effect to these physics
objects so when they hit the floor and
you know to get a sort of sense of
realism so for my last tutorial I am
going to delete these objects and if you
didn't see that watch the last tutorial
if you want to well quickly go through
what I've got so I've got my scene with
my first person control I've got a
barrel and it's got a mesh Collider it's
been ticked as convex so it's not fall
through the vlog a rigid body with use
gravity on and that's pretty much that
for now we just want to create an actual
script which will detect how much the
object is moving and then we'll be able
to say you know play the sound effect
upon the velocity of the item I mean
this can be done in a lot of different
ways you can use the velocity to put
different sound effects depending on for
the velocity or the the speed at which
is traveling toward the ground is your
high you could have louder sound effects
you know you could have an ink explosion
instead of a just a hit you know you can
have a lot of different things but I'm
just gonna show you the basis of getting
something working and you can modify it
as you want so what we'll do is we'll
create a script called impact effect can
call you script whatever you want you
can open up that and monodevelop
once we've done that I'll delete these
two functions and I'll start by same
variable impact call on audio clip and
put semicolon at the end and I'll say
function on collision enter open
brackets hit call on collision collision
Clause brackets open up my curly
brackets and I'll say if hit dot
relative velocity dot magnitude is
greater than
or equal to five then I will close my
brackets and I will say under there with
the two curly brackets or deal a
one-shot open brackets impact and then I
had a semicolon
so what's that's going to do is that
when the actual object hits a Collider
on the floor so it's going to be that
mesh Collider that's on my floor plane
then if it's velocity is more than five
it will play the sound effect now that's
all well and good seen as though my
object is if I go back into the scene
and you see my object here it's floating
and if I add this I like it to this and
then I will go to my sound and find my
barrel sound effect that critter that I
got unedited all of the component and
add audio source and then one would play
it just yeah you heard that sound effect
so when it hit the floor you heard the
sound now the problem is hear that sound
but what you want to be able to do is
when you push it over what you want to
hear the sound again so what we need to
do is we need to just copy this function
again and then I'll paste it in here and
then what I'm going to do is actually
change this to on collider stair so it
works even when we're still inside the
collider but the thing is you need to
experiment with this with yourself it
works for me when I put the magnitude is
3.5 because if it puts it to you know if
I put this to one and this to one then
they would always do it even when I've
put a small force and the barrel you
don't want it to as soon as he hit it
you only want it when it's at such a
fast that it hits the floor with speed
not as soon as he hit it so if I now
play my game not hear the sound effect
and then I'll go over to it and you'll
notice that
only when I push it to the ground did
you actually hear anything but so really
that's just the basis of any physics
object if it hits a cup they collide on
the floor then you know you will play it
you'll play a sound effect and you might
need to change those values up as you
can see I've clicked on my floor I've
got a mesh Collider do you might need to
mess with those values and get something
that works for you but there you go
really simple really easy and thanks for
watching and if you like the tutorial
