update video today and this is going to
fill everybody in on the things that
will be coming up the Survival Series
and a new channel that I've launched
which is called game changes now I'll
start off by telling you about the new
channel some may remember that I created
a channel called Indies on probably a
year ago or so now and I never sort of
got round to do annex it was a lot of
hard work because that's but hard work
into it to do voiceovers now with game
changes what we want it to be because
I'm doing game changes with a friend
who's helping me make left alone and we
want this to be the hub for all the
trailers that you want to see whether
this be triple a village which these
titles that you'll see on console or it
be the titles that you create on indie
games and I want it to be that everybody
gets equal exposure so remember if you
think you've got a cool idea and you
want it to be sure kissed on the channel
hit em give me a message on speed
shooter or throw me a message on game
changes and i'll leave the link in the
description now on to the survival
series and i did say that and I've
talked to a lot of people in the
comments that when left alone is
finished I'll be able to start making
the survival series but you've got to
remember that the survival series unlike
a lot of lets players for example on
YouTube it might take the mic pick up
again play it for an hour they might
record it for an hour edit that for an
hour and then they can upload it where
is me especially with the series like
this available series that I want to
bring to unity 5 it's going to take me
another hundreds and hundreds of hours
to bring it and I don't want to start a
tutorial series that i can bring
everybody every week so i want to make
sure that I've got enough time so I may
well bring start bringing out before I
finish left alone or it's going to be
after I'll keep everybody updated but
it's just hard to say because when I'm
fully developing a game it's hard to do
the speed shooter channel work on the
game and do everything else that I need
to do in real life let's say so I hope
everybody can understand and that one
hundred percent will be making the
survival say
but I will be starting another series on
optimization in unity 5 and a couple of
other things which might be 3d sounds so
hopefully that you understand where I'm
coming from here and if you're
interesting game changes want to send
the trailer subscribe to that channel
and maybe send yours in and hopefully
you look forward to seeing more
tutorials for me thanks very much for
watching don't forget to Like comment
and subscribe Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
