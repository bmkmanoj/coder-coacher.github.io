different sort of tutorial and this is
gonna be in cover in 3dsmax and this is
going to be showing you the basics of UV
mapping within 3ds max I'm using 3ds max
2013 this is going to show you how to
make in our simple sort of wooden career
and just showing you the really really
sheer basics of getting to grips with
the UV map within this program so what
we're going to is going to create a box
and I've got cube checked so when we
know makeout in the scene it'll be you
know perfectly the same on either side
then what we're gonna do is right-click
the object say convert to and then I'll
say editable poly on the modifier list
what we want to do is go down to unwrap
UVW and now you'll get seams all the way
around your box now this can be done on
any object obviously so this is just
going to show you the basics now if we
click on the little plus next unwrap UVW
select a face and if you click at the
bottom here and say open UV editor
you'll see that here's the UV in the box
and it's got every single face all as
one now what once actually do is you
know unwrap this so we can you know put
a texture on it on each face now the
simple way when we're using face is
specifically on a flat sort of surface
what it can do is create a play this
bottom which is a quick planar map so
when we click this you'll notice that we
actually get a face of that size so if
we've got a face of this size we can
click on this face make a quick planar
map we can just scale it down we just
need to make sure you know we've done
every single side by clicking that box
or just scale it you know roughly the
same size this is just showing you how
to do it and then we'll do that again
so there
and we'll click that one I want to scale
it down and the top one will do the same
and then the underside click that and
that would just scale in now we roughly
have all the faces there so what I can
do is if I show you and I can move each
of these about and place them within my
UV box now you want it you know to save
as much space as possible so you know if
you wanted different textures on each
face you'd want to you know move these
up and scale and depending what
resolution but for this sort of instance
we'll just apply the same texture to
each face now what we'll do is actually
just scale everything up up to the top
of the box just so it's you know it's
roughly the same size so then you know
once we've done that we'll go to tools
render UVW template we'll hat we'll set
the box to 512 by 512 just keep it
within you know a good solid resolution
render the UV template this is not a
perfect template because I'm already
just you know making sure that you
understand the basics well you know save
this out as a JPEG and then have ours
box UV and press ok then what we'll do
is open up photoshop and if I go to open
if I open the box UV I've already got a
texture within Photoshop here so what
I'll do is copy and I'll paste this in
just here this is just for basics I'll
paste this in put it over there
save it back out as a JPEG and call it a
box
wooden UV save that out we'll go back
into 3ds max again seeing as though this
is now got the modifier for the UV map
what we can do is press M go to the
material editor now if I go down to maps
and I find diffuse color press Nam
select bitmap if I go to wherever I've
saved my file I'll choose my box UV and
then when I apply that I just drag it
straight on and I say sure shaded within
the viewport you'll notice that we get
the texture on every single side of the
box perfectly because we've actually
mapped it so it overlaps each other now
if I go back into the UV editor and if
we open the UV editor you'll notice that
when the box is actually overlap they'll
display the same texture on each face
obviously if I started adjusting it
you'd be able to see now you can see if
I select my map you can see that that's
where it fits and if I selected all of
these again all of these faces you know
and I moved it about you would obviously
see a difference within the map but we
know we keep it within the workspace now
one thing that you can actually do with
a UV map if you scale it across and out
of the actual UV radius you'll notice
they actually tails the texture so you
know you can tile something in a certain
direction but this was just the basics
of you know sort of UV map in a box
which is just sort of a planar mapping
and then you know working with the UV
space and bringing in a simple texture
within photoshop and then you know
texture maybe you're sort of asset and
then you know you can use crazy bump to
make a normal map for that and bring it
into again but that's just very much the
basics
and you know if people don't understand
I want to know more you know make sure
you leave a comment term what you think
so thanks very much for watching don't
