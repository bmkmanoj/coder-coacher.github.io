time today and this is going to be
another quick tip and it's going to show
you another attribute that you can use
within unity now this one is
particularly just for organizing the
variables that is similar to the header
attributes if you've seen my other video
and it's something called space and
space allows you to just put as it
suggests put spacing it's in between the
variables within the inspector so all
you really need to do to do that is add
two square brackets here type in space
and then what we can do is write in
brackets own number and you can see that
it's just an optional integer value so
we can put something like 10 and then
close up the brackets and what we could
also do is I could just copy that entire
one here and I could paste the same
thing here but maybe write 20 and so we
get a little bit of difference you'll
see a space of 10 and a space of 20 in
the inspector so now on this side you
can see that we've got a space from the
top of where the script is held and we
got the space of 10 and then between the
health and damage we've got a space of
20 and you can go as much as you need to
just to if you want to adds a little bit
of spacing and break the variables that
you've got within your scene so you
remember it's just in square brackets
right space and then inside two normal
brackets you can write number usually in
increments of ten so thanks again for
watching doctor to like comment and
