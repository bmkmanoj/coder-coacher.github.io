another good tip to use in 3dsmax is to
use viewport backgrounds and this can be
good when you need an image to look at
you cannot when you're almost looking at
an image I'm working from that so what
you can do it depends what images you've
collected it if you've edited them in
Photoshop to get a similar size but
simply to show you I'm in my front view
part and I need to do is you click the
little plus next to whatever you
viewport type is you've got to configure
view parts you make sure you click on
the background tab and you can click use
files and here is we can actually browse
for a file which we're going to use so
just for the sake of this I'll just show
that you're a concrete Barry Barry an
image that I got from Google because I'm
gonna do that in another tutorial so
what now you need to do is you want to
match the bitmap
and zoom lock and pan and what they do
is that when you scroll in and out it
doesn't actually adjust any sizes it
just keeps it absolutely set to actual
image of the picture and also you can do
it with the same with your left viewport
say if you want to do something from the
side from the background use use files
browse to where you want to find you
pick your image and then you can go
match bitmap zoom lock and pan if you
press G to get rid of you grid you can
just get that get those and start
working directly from that and see the
whole 3d perspective in your perspective
alright that's pretty much it
