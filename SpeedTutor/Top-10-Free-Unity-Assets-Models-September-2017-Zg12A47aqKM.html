for September 2017 and number one as you
can see is we've got a realistic salmon
and this is a 3d model which has got two
styles which is high poly and low poly
the low poly beam about 1200 triangles
with two textures of 1024 by 1024 and
you've got to which one has a normal
style Simon on one that looks like it's
been sort of bloodied up with an
additional normal map number two as you
can see is the simple low poly Viking
buildings and this is a 3d asset you
know possibly first some isometric games
and includes 44 models in the actual
entire pack and you will they all use
three 32 by 32 textures which include
models of seven houses three stones
seven farm towers a grass model shovels
buckets crates everything that you can
see in the land image below number three
is the prototype rocks as you can see
here that includes seven blocky rocks
and it could help you do some quick a
level laying out with simple geometry
and each rock is about a thousand
triangles with 4k textures in PNG format
and number four is the a low poly weapon
pack and this includes a bunch of 3d
models which are suitable for a mobile
game which are extremely low poly but
most the things are fairly low in the
facade been about 100 triangles she'll
be 170 the staff being 350 the bow 460
you know of that sort of variant below
500 damp triangles for each and they
have three variants on the each texture
with a red green and a blue in a 256 by
256 resolution number 5 is the low poly
fantasy monsters a demo version what
this is a pack of 4 prefabs which
include a goblin Hobgoblin troll and
wolf with basic animations and some
add-ons and particle effects depending
on what you go for the full package does
include 14 own prefabs combined with
add-ons you can see the different things
included in the package
below and number six is the tiny robots
pack and this includes three small
robots stylized with a cartoon sort of
feel and it's three models of robots
with a presentation of two basic
textures or more normalmap three color
variants of textures with the normal map
includes the models have been rigs the
Donovan animations both 1000 by 1000
Maps and you can see them playing some
things in the sketch pub preview here
and number seven is the low poly
buildings light and this is a free
preview of some low poly buildings they
includes one FBX file with two prefabs
with a grand yellow variant which you
could obviously maybe even adjust
yourself with 512 by 512 PNG diffuse
textures and the models are around a
thousand polygons and the commute like a
long neighborhood suburb packin you can
see from the wireframe down here that
the fairly low poly and number eight is
the skeleton swordsman and this is a low
poly unpainted skeleton warrior which is
suitable for VR on mobile and you can
see it in this preview here you can see
it with some animations playing you can
see is quite high quality looking
swordsman so if you're looking for
something like that maybe for you a
little fantasy game this might be for
you and number nine is the mini Legion a
grunt hand painted and this is another
one that I've featured from this
developer before gross style or core
warrior or something and it's optimized
for mobile which is about less less than
800 triangles with a bunch of animations
which include idle attack victory walk
of run and getting hit and it's got one
unlit shedder with a color texture of 2k
and the last one here is the m8 for stun
grenade which is about 3.8 K faces and
includes
2000 PBR texture maps and it's a quite a
nice high quality model of a stun
grenade so if you're looking for a nice
PBR acid that could grow new
first-person game this might be one for
you these are all the top 10 models
