how to go from 3ds max to unit 3d and
the actual process that you go through
to export all your materials and objects
out you know quite simply and easily so
you can keep everything with you and you
don't have to edit too much in unity and
not only textures separately so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to quickly just
create a box in 3ds Max and here's my
box you know I'm sure everybody knows
how to create a box and if I press enter
cause the material idea and I've got
already got like a rocket material what
we'll do is I'm going to convert my box
to editable poly I'm just going to
select polygons this is just an example
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
going to add this texture to each of the
sides of this box just just to show you
that it's actually got a texture on my
name put yourself so there we go there's
my text on the box same text on each one
just something very simple just to
illustrate what I'm gonna so if we just
close that what I want to do from 3ds
max now is you've got X bar X bar and
then save type as what you can do is if
you don't have it you need to find f VX
and FBX
you can save as of things like dot
object but FBX is always better fusing
unity and if you just save hours what if
you want to I'll just write the rock and
if you press yes what you'll get is
you'll get these options and what you
want to do is on the include options you
want to tick embed media because that's
what I'll take your textures from 3ds
max to unity so if you press ok it's
only because it's a very small file will
export the alphas now if we go into
unity and I've got my other scene here
from one of my other tutorials what I'm
going to do is go import new asset from
my unity and import the rock and you'll
see my rock and the scene
on what we want to do is when you import
into units you can just generate
colliders and generate light mapping UVs
so you can light map and you will be
able to walk through it and then you can
add it to your scene but my rock needs
scaling up slightly Saul you is just you
know adjust the actual size to what you
want it click apply so there's your
object from 3ds max into unity with
pretty much no troubles at all and it
brings all new materials for the text
just so you can change everything up
quite easily depending on what you're
after so that's pretty much it if you
liked the tutorial don't forget to Like
comment and subscribe thanks very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
