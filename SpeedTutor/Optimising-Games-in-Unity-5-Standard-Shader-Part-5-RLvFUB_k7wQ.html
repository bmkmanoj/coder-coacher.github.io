optimization series and I took a little
break from this one but I thought I'd
get back on track and this is going to
be looking at shared as and the things
that you want to keep in mind when
you're optimizing for the free game and
you wanting to understand everything
that's going on so this should be more
of a shot one but for the most part
you've got a shared as which when you
create a new two material let's give an
example if I go create and material and
I'll just leave this as new material for
the sake of this you'll get the standard
shader which you'll be able to use there
is a whole host of other shedders
depending on what you want to use say if
you're using for marble you're going to
want to use a mobile shader and it was
slightly more optimized but unity do say
that over 90% of use cases will be
available to use with the standard
shader and there's other shadows on the
assets tile which might help you out
which do interesting things but there's
just a few things that you need to
understand in previous versions of unity
you would use and the legacy shaders
which still exist here like the bump
specular and they have slots available
to you to put your diffuse normal
markings and things like that
now with these particular legacy and
materials are shared as when if you can
add a texture to one of these slots it'd
be wasting resources and it'd still be
computing those options but with the
introduction of the standard shader that
unity of involved with PBR is that
you've got a whole host of slots which
you can use to add textures to and
saying when you build again and you're
using maybe only three of these slots
and you've got all these are the ones
you know left out you might think that
are that might end up using resources
but it doesn't it just dynamically gets
rid of those slots if you're not using
them so for the most part when you're
using PBR related assets or textures you
will be using probably four five men
types of materials you usually have an
albedo transparency which goes in our
beater slot which is
color map which is what almost like an
old-fashioned are used to diffuse but as
no sort of detail are shadowing you've
got ambient occlusion which is occlusion
here which just Atkins off recessed
areas or areas that wouldn't technically
have in a light and reflectivity we've
got a metallic smoothness which can
often be known as metallic roughness if
you've done it in other programs and
that will control how metallic are rough
the surfaces and you will often have a
normal map which will highlight areas of
raised areas or bumpiness you can
control with a height map and you can
have things like an emission map an
emission map can control how and much
light a particular object gives off you
can control all the tiling here and you
can control secondary maps to add extra
levels of detail so if I wanted to extra
graininess on this object I could add
another map and it will put that over
the top with the things you've got to
just really keep in mind is that no
matter how many texts you use it will
dynamically change accordingly to how
many you've added you can use the other
shared as available but for the most
case that the Sun Shade that is
appropriate for most assets are you
going to use even if using assets that
are not PBR so there were just some
quick tips of you know quickly
explaining what it is explain how and
you know it's optimized and explained
that you don't always need all the maps
available and you can chop and change as
needed if some done you know and not
that important you can also remember
that if you click on your texture that
you might have imported you can scale
down its Mac size so you can make sure
that it weighs less resources if it's
not that important so you just change it
down to 512 or something like that and
hit apply and it will scale down the
textures and you want just to zoom in
and have a little look of the quality
and if it looks okay you know take it
down so thanks very much for watching
