tutorial for you and it's about actually
creating a simple level up system and
it's to go along with the GUI system
that I made for health minor and stamina
in one of my other videos and if you
haven't seen that video I'd go and watch
it so you can get an understanding of
the script or you can download it from
our website let's beat you to speed -
tutor.com
and go to the download page and you
download that GUI script
now what this actual system is going to
do is from what we've got if I play this
I've got health minor stamina with each
you know out of 100 we're going to
actually be able to collect xp so in the
actual example I'm going to show here is
that my boxes here are going to
represent you gain an XP you could gain
XP from killing enemies and stuff like
that but as with all my other tutorials
I've just shown you with boxes to make
it simple so each of my boxes in turn
they have a box Collider and the sector
is trigger ISOs really simple and then
my first-person controller which is just
got the GUI manager script attached for
now and then we're going to actually
write some things to be able to level up
change each of these stats that you've
got so you get more health more mana
more time on each level but again you
can change this depending on what you
want and each time you level up more XP
is needed to level up to that next level
and we'll all hold that in a little GUI
underneath health so you know what level
you are my ex PE you've gained
so what going to do is we're going to
create a JavaScript and we're going to
name this level up system and then I'll
just put this in my health system folder
just for ease my monodevelop when
monodevelop slowed it what we'll do is
we'll delete the two functions there and
we'll set a function called current XP
so variable current X B as integer and
set that equal to zero we'll write
another variable called Max XP
and after that as an integer equal to 50
and then have a variable called level
and have that also set as an integer and
equal to one and then we can have
something another variable called level
up texture and we're going to set that
as texture type texture 2d then I'm
going to have a private variable called
leveled up and has that as an other as a
boolean and set equal to true and then
going to have two more variables which
called time - sure
level up as flow equal to three seconds
and then variable time till not sure
level up as flow and equal to zero and
I'll actually add underneath this one I
like to have another variable called
level of sound and that's that of type
audio clip make sure every time you
write this that when I write variables
my first word is always lower case and
the rest always have an upper case at
the beginning of the word so first of
all what we're going to do is we're
going to actually write the GUI to
appear so all those functions that we
have in the variables that we just roll
we're not going to use them yet so what
we do is going to write function on GUI
with the two brackets then the two curly
brackets below or say GUI dot box open
brackets new rect open brackets five 140
20 and then close that bracket spa comma
and then set X P close the brackets then
add the semicolon so what this is doing
is just drawing a GUI box at the
position and five across
100 down and then fought fought to width
20 height and what we'll do is we'll
copy this same line pissed in there I
will keep everything the same except
we'll have five and then we'll have 120
here and then what we'll do is change
this XP to level and what we'll love
below here is will copy these two lines
again and just below here but we'll
change this one too far these two 245
leave all the same apart from changing
that to 100 because these are going to
be slightly below so these are just
going to be our little tags to show the
white XP in level and this is going to
actually sure what X being level you've
got so after this we'll remove this so
after you comma you're going to say
current XP plus then we're going to say
quartz and slash quartz plus max XP and
then we'll delete this one and will
actually say level plus then we'll put
quotations so all this means that it
draws the GUI bucks
so actually shows your current XP which
is zero and then it will display a slash
and then max XP which is 50 and also new
the one it will show your level but I
need to make sure that's such a lower
case to follow my variables and they'll
just leave a space after so if we save
them and just remember to add I
sometimes miss out a semicolon when I'm
running through the script so I need a
semicolon there go back into unity and I
got my first place controller and add
the level up system to it and what I can
do is if I press play you'll notice that
I now have XP out of 50 and level which
equals 1 so that's just basic there
now I'm gonna actually write an update
function to what you do what we need to
do is so function Det with my brackets
and then two curly brackets below what
I'm going to say I'm going to set if
current XP is greater than or equal to
max XP then what we're going to do is
call our level level of system function
that we're going to create we're also
going to say that if leveled up then so
if we actually leveled up we're going to
say that if time dot time is greater
than time till not sure not sure
levelled up if you select that then
close your brackets then in there we'll
say leveled up equals false
we'll say that so what this means is
that if our current XP which is here
ever goes above what our Max mount is we
actually level them and then if the
boolean value ever levels us up we'll
just set it straight to false now then
what we're going to do is create another
function under here or say function as
we did here so function level up system
get rid of the semicolon add the two
curly brackets below and what we're
going to actually say is we're going to
actually start doing something now so
when we've leveled up so what we're
going to do is we're going to say
current XP is equal to zero so when
we've leveled up current X B is equal to
set to zero in then we'll say max XP is
equal to max XP plus 50 then we'll say
level
plus plus with a semicolon so that just
means level plus plus just means that
level increases by one then what we're
going to say is our do dot play one shot
and then we're going to say that we're
going to play the level of sound and
we'll close that off we'll say leveled
up is equal to true and then we'll say
time to not show level up equals time
dot time plus time to show level up with
a semicolon at the end and if we save
that out so what this means when we love
a lot current XP was set to zero max XP
will increase by 50 every time then
level will also increase you can go to
level two you'll play a little sound for
the duration of a sound you could also
pop comma not point seven so you can
play it from not point seven over second
and then level unleveled up make sure I
get it right and say leveled up is then
equal to true and then we'll say that
the time to not show leveled up is equal
to the time that it takes to show the
level up so after that period of time of
30 seconds of showing the level up then
it does something so we'll save this and
what we're going to do here is now
actually and change the values of your
health manner and stamina so we'll write
a variable here we'll call this GUI
manager column GUI manager is equal to
game object dot find open brackets first
person person controller close the
quotations and we'll say getcomponent
open brackets gy manager semicolon then
we'll say GUI manager dot max health is
equal to 120 and then GUI manager dot
current health is equal to GUI manager
dot max health and then what's a GUI
manager dot max manner is equal to 120
and GUI manager dot max stamina is equal
to 120 so if we say of that energy your
manager script here we had some values
for current health current manner
current stamina max stamina max mana max
health so we want those to increase
every time so what we're doing here
which we're finding the script GUI
manager finding on the game object first
person control and then we're saying
that once we've leveled up and max
health is equal to 120 max tammer is
equal to hundred twenty and max mana is
equal hundred twenty so each of them
call by 20 when you've leveled up what
I'm actually going to do when I'm here
is I've realized that on the top of my
head now this isn't going to work
properly so once you've leveled up once
it's just an equal 120 and never go up
again so what we'll do is we'll do GUI
dot man that GOI manage dot max health
is equal to Gy manager dot max health
plus 20 and we'll save that
and then I'll do the same thing with
these so GUI manager dot max manner is
equal to GUI manager dot max mana plus
20 and then we'll say max stamina is
equal to GUI manager dot max stamina
plus 20 and what this means is that when
we level up each time it will actually
increase max health max mana and max
stamina by 20 instead of just setting it
to a value so it'll increase by 20
increments every time and here what I've
done is when current health is equal to
max health just means that when you
level up you're actually heal yourself
so your current health will actually go
fully now you're doing some games that
everything just goes back to the normal
amount instead of regenerating so if you
save that and go into unity and what
we're going to do is we do have any
errors so we're going to create a script
called gain XP we're going to put this
inside our health system and then what
we're going to do is we're going to open
up in one develop and once it's open
what we'll do is under the your very
overt private variable called level up
script and we'll set that as type level
of system and then push that down and
we'll say level up script is equal to
game object dot find and
first person controller then we'll say
dark get component open brackets level
up system close the bracket semicolon
and then will delete the function update
here will say function on trigger enter
open the brackets call set kohalon
collider then we put the two curly
brackets in set if call tag is e or two
player then what we're going to do is
we're going to say destroy lowercase
game object semicolon then we're going
to say level up script dot current XP
plus equals 10 and then we'll save that
so what that means is in here we found
the script which is called the level up
system and when we go into the collider
set those boxes it's going to actually
change an ad to the XP by 10 but what
we're going to need to do is I need to
make sure that's not capital P so if you
saw me do that make sure that it's all
capitals that and not the first bit
because I like I said before always keep
your first word lowercase when you talk
about variable will minimize that and
then what I'll do is I'll select all my
boxes and now I begin XP script to them
so what you'll see is I'll run over
these boxes got 10 it again technics P
get another 10 over 20 again another 10
another 10 and when I go over this lacs
box we went to out of 104 at level 2 and
everything has been set to 120 so they
have it each time you level up but
that'll also increment by 50 so you've
got to level 3 and then we're required
to get on 50 XP and so on so that's
pretty much it about this tutorial about
making a simple level up system now you
could take this and you can do it load a
lot of different ways but that was just
simple way of showing you what to do and
before I finished I'll show you that you
can just add a level up sound there so
when you love a look at player sound you
know like happy sound whatever you want
cheering ah and firework something like
that yeah and I'll be fine in then it'll
just - L just appear once you're level
up and then fair down so that's pretty
much it and if you liked the tutorial
