tutorial today and this is going to be a
simple one that people are being asking
for and it's about creating a crosshair
now you could go various ways about
doing making crafts how you can you know
have some that move change color and
things like about but what we're going
to do is put like an almost as very
small dot in the middle of the screen
and if you struggling with this
something sort of very basic like this
it's really simple to do all you need to
do is if you've got yourself and you've
seen all I've got is an FPS controller
in my scene with a plane you can go game
object UI and then add just click image
and it will automatically create you a
compass you can create the canvas first
if you want to you can go to the top
here and click in 2d mode and then when
you're in 2d mode you can see your
entire canvas if you click on your
canvas here press F and you see it will
just show you the entire canvas here
that we need to work with and just
imagine this is been your entire screen
we can see our image here that we've got
but that isn't positioned very nicely so
what we can do if it isn't safe
positioned very nicely you can make sure
that your anchor point is set to Center
middle so it won't change we're going to
change the image for now in our box here
and even though you can use anything but
we can just use the default things that
come with unity and just use the virtual
circle or it's called knob in here and
we get a circle UI sprite now what I'm
going to do is I'm going to set the
position x y&amp;amp;z to zero so you can see
that it's directly in the center of the
canvas what I'll do is I will adjust the
width and height maybe make it 5 and 5
and you won't really be able to see it
in the canvas because the gizmos in the
way but if I go to my game view you can
see it that will press play and
nevermind my own sort of yellow
indicator because that's just the center
of the entire screen rather than just
again view so you can see that the white
crosshair is there all the time no
matter where we go and if you need to do
something
like you know to make it highlight when
you go over something you could
potentially hover over your image press
ctrl D to duplicate it you know you can
rename them if you want and you can just
change the image material color to red
and you can enable and disable that as
you need to if you want to do some sort
of you know hit interaction or something
like that so that's just a really simple
way to make yourself simple crosshair
