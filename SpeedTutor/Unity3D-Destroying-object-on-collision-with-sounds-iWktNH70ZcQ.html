showed you how to make items spin and
this is going to be in card printing
some similar features and it's just
going to have the same object so that's
still got the this off coin here and
I've got a first letter central and
directional light and what I want to do
is actually so when you've got this item
spinning you can actually pick it up
like you would in say Sonic the Hedgehog
and then you could make a GUI or
something
to collect points so you can collect
objects as you go around again so what
I'm going to do is I'm actually going to
choose this ring here and it hasn't got
an actual Collider on it so what we do
is add a component physics box Collider
with the Box Clyde on I'm going to just
scale up the elements so when I get
inside this Collider we're going to pick
it up or destroy it and if we tag it as
is trigger that means that when we go
near that trigger and inside it with the
correct script ill change so if we
create a new JavaScript and we call this
object destroy and then we're going to
open up this 'madam develop and what we
want to do is we want to actually get
rid of these two lines and we want to
write function ontriggerenter open
brackets other call on and then write
collider and then - curly bracket then
we want to write if if open brackets
other dot tag is equals equals to player
then we'll actually do another two curly
brackets and say destroy with a capital
open brackets game object but you need
to make sure that that in the game
object that g is a lowercase so what
happens if we actually put this script
object destroy
on our object now we'll start the scene
we'll see the coin spinning when we go
towards it you'll see that we collected
it and now it's disappeared and you'll
notice that it's disappeared out of my
hierarchy which means essentially you've
destroyed it and what we can do from
here now is actually add an audio effect
which one we actually pick up the coin
it makes a sound so simply what we're
going to do so what we're going to do in
our object is dry script is that a new
variable and call that coin sound and
we're going to set that to us type audio
clip with a semicolon what to do in this
in these curly brackets want to write
audio dot play one shot and then we want
the name of our sound which is coin
sound close bracket semicolon now if we
actually run this and did it all
together the audio wouldn't player
because a strip after it decides to play
the object gets destroyed so it doesn't
understand what to do so want to yield
wait four seconds and then what we can
do is wait for not point four seconds
something like that and then it gives
the the actual sound chance to play a
but then destroy the object after so
make sure that's refreshed click back on
the object we need to add a sound so
there's my coin sound now when we walk
into our object you heard the sound it
weighed less than a second and then got
destroyed so that's pretty much it that
shows you how to destroy an object add a
little bit of an a sound before it gets
destroyed if you wanted that so thanks
very much and if you liked the tutorial
