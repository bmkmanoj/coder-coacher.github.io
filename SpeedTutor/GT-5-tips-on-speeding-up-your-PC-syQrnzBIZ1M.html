this is slightly different to what a
normal to do but this is just going to
be giving you some tips on how you can
speed up your pc my overall first tip
I'd say is that you want to get yourself
a solid state hard drive if you possibly
can and there are a lot quicker than
conventional had had this drives they
have usually got less space and the more
expensive but they've got such a higher
read and write speed which means if you
install windows on it it you know boot
up instantly or if applications that you
installed and a good example would be
the samsung 840 Evo which is you know a
budget sort of range solid-state drive
but top class if you need to you know
upgrade something and making machine you
know significantly faster now another
sort of good tip to use is driver
updates you need to you know off to make
sure that term windows drivers are all
up to date and you can use the windows
update function within your computer to
do that and make sure that your graphics
drivers are always up to date and you
can do that on your manufacturers
website all you know using the update
that comes maybe with either nvidia or
IMD's cards another great way top speed
up is if you've actually got a lot of
stuff on your hard drive so you've got
one terabyte hard drive or even on your
solid state drive the more you've got on
the hard drive the slower it will get
because it's got to search through more
files to get to files that you want to
use their by there so you know if you
want install programs that you don't use
anymore and you know clean up those you
know previous installations and even get
rid of old documents old files or videos
or photos and just delete some space if
you clear a bit of space it will speed
up your pc in the process once you've
done sort of all that may be uninstalled
some programs and you know done all your
updates you want to try and do a disk
defrag in a case of if you've got a hard
disk drive not not so much if you've got
a solid state drive some problems with
that but with the hard disk drive if you
you know do a defrag and the lazy disk
you might find that some of the space
has been you know not used properly a
good way to sort of describe Dave
fraggin is if your hard drive is so made
up of ten blocks save some files you
install some programs it takes up every
single one of those ten blocks so you've
got no more space anymore say you delete
a document from the hard drive and not
only take took one block for example
you'd have one space there and say you
wanted to install another program or
save another file and that took up three
blocks you might need it then would just
put it straight on the end in a sequence
so that one block is still there missing
at the beginning and when you defrag
your hard drive it pushes everything up
so it you know fits all together so you
hard drive essentially will run quicker
and so it can search much easier on one
of the actual last where's I would care
to mention that it's just a sort of
extra thing that you can do about CS
again saving space and hard drive is
that you can use a program called
windows directory statistics and it will
analyze all the space on your hard disk
drive I'll tell you where all the space
has been taken up so you can see maybe
if a dog is hidden some renders like
mind or sometimes on premiere and you
need to delete the sort of old caches of
it you can even disable the hibernation
file that sometimes is on your computer
and that can serve around 10 gigabytes
of space and and plagues me a little bit
for my solid state hard drive so you
know if you clean up bits and pieces can
make a whole lot of difference in terms
of performance another extra tip would
probably using programs like an
anti-virus program and anti-malware
program to get rid of things that might
be you know hiding somewhere on your
computer so spybot search and destroy
malwarebytes and also program like
ccleaner which will you know take
everything on your hard drive that might
be temporary or you know internet files
or things like that that can easily be
you know save you some space so this was
just a soft quick rundown of some tips
where you know you really can speed up
your computer most primarily with the
solid state hard drive but you know if
you take any of these tips in
combination you know you can really put
the wind back in your computer sales so
to speak so thanks very much for
