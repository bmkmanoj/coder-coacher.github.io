tutorial today and it's all about
creating a camera zoom or binocular zoom
it depends on what you want to use it
for really
most commonly I'd say it's more seen in
games like there's that where you can
right click and then you can zoom in as
you run it but I'll show you a simple
way ya creative way to do it so you can
give him visit of equipment by not
binoculars or something like that so
what we'll do is I'm in Photoshop but
I've got an actual image canvas size of
1020 by 1080 just my screen resolution
so whatever yours is you might want to
say it to that but usually it's HD
resolution if you've got HD monitor what
I'm going to do is going to fill the
background with black so we've got a
layer with a black background and what
I'm going to do is I'm gonna make and
two ovals they're actually white so I'm
gonna create one or oval here on one
circle and then we duplicate the other
and put them roughly both together and
while what I'll do is ctrl T and scale
them up a little bit it's lagging a
little bit because I'm recording and
what we'll do here is we'll place them
in the middle I will make the other one
we'll make it go up slightly just to try
and position it better and what we can
do then is if we right click select them
both right click we just got merge
layers what we could do if we select the
magic wand tool and we just select
inside we can delete that shape but then
if we select our black layer what we can
do is we can delete the insides so it
actually leaves a sort of outline and
what we'll do is delete the first layer
and then we'll double click on that on
the and that layer and what we'll do is
add an outer glow which just we said the
blend mode to normal put the opacity one
then put the spread to about one and
then we can adjust the size accordingly
so try 50 it gives us a little bit of an
edge 65 was that that's okay and then
we've got our binoculars there so what
we want to do from here once you've
created that once save it out as a PSD
and save it wherever you want I'll just
replace my existing one and if we're
going to unity we right-click we impart
a new asset we impart the binoculars and
then we change the detect from texture
the texture types GUI
they'll say it's scaling correctly want
to add a new component or in a career
other and a GUI texture because what
we're going to change this is going to
appear on our screen and morter you can
rename that anything you want and you
get the little unity GUI what want to do
is replace that unity GUI here with the
monoculars we've got and we want to set
the width and height to what you
actually set your image and it'll scale
up that's how you add it now depending
on the resolution of your screen and
things like that we want to change this
X&amp;amp;Y pixel in set so I change it to 960
by - 586 and that if we play after play
it again it fits perfectly in the
margins for what I wanted and that's
pretty much it for the basis of it we
don't want the binoculars out of all the
time so we're going to create a little
script which is going to control this
for us so what you want to do is create
JavaScript and then you want to call
this whatever you want to call it
doesn't really matter
call it I know for sharp and then just
open monodevelop and then what we want
to do in one develop is create about
five different variables and we're going
to have three variables one called zoom
set as an integer
equals 20 as a standard variable normal
as integer which is equal to 60 which is
a normal camera field of view and then
smooth which is going to make the actual
smoothing so when we zoom in it's not
just going to be a quick snap or a pouch
and then we're going to create a
variable called image by now this is
just gonna be set to a GUI texture and
that's what we want to use so we can set
that texture on and off and then we want
to create a private variable called is
zoomed and set that to false because we
want to detect when we've zoomed in and
such so at the start we want to say
image by you know dot enabled equals
false because we don't want to be able
to see it when we start the game we
don't know what to be able to see it
when were actually pressing something so
we want to write in our update function
if input dot I spell that wrong if input
dot get mouse button down and brackets 1
which is your right click and then we
add another bracket here then we'll have
two curly brackets and then put is
zoomed is equal to exclamation mark is
zoomed then that means I'll trigger on
and off and then we've got what we're
going to do under here it's create
another if statement that if is zoomed
and it's set to true then curly brackets
camera dot field of view equals math F
dot ler in brackets can
dot field-of-view commas zoom comma time
dot time dot delta time times by the
smooth and amount of times by smooth
we're gonna close that off and then
we're gonna grow image by no dot enabled
is equal to true and then under here
we're gonna write else and this is to
set it when it's no so what we're going
to do is we in our else we're going to
copy this line paste it here and what
we're going to change is instead of
changing it to zoom i'm gonna change
this to normal
i'm gonna have pretty much the same
thing and we're gonna copy this same
line and say is equal to false someone
we've unticked it and then what we're
gonna do is we're going to save this out
we're going to go back into unity and
what we're gonna do is on our main
camera we're gonna add this script the
Byner script
and you'll see we have a zoom of 20 so
if you can see the field of view is set
to 60 in a minute which is there the zoo
will change the field of view to 20 and
the smoothing just causes a smoothing
what we need to do in the GUI texture
slot is put these binoculars in there so
you put that texture in there so when we
play the game initially you don't see
anything you don't see any a binoculars
you don't see any zoom and if you press
it click have a right-click you'll see
that we zoom in with virtual image and
if I go back on the game view and I
maximize on place you actually see
pretty much the full resolution you can
zoom in over a further distance so you
can see and create a sort of very basic
binocular sort of cell so that's pretty
much it for this tutorial and thanks
very much fortune and if you like
