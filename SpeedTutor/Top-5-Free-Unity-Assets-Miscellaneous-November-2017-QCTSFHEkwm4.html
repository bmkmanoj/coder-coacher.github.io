miscellaneous assets for November 2017
now these miscellaneous assets are pre
corns because there's a wide variety of
shared as another sort of stylized
assets that you can look at cinnamon is
the fake interiors free which is made
with the amplify cheddar added to this
so affects the interiors to actual
buildings probably based on some of
these 3d models and then you've put it
into something quite interesting like
this so it allows you sort of render a
simple interior of an inside of
something without the use of actually
additional polygons and things like that
so the sort of features is a flexible
room control and you can fade the
softness with a pro player custom room
and prop textures you can change the
brightness and the tint color and you
can fall out if you do have access to
the amplifi shader so this might be
really wonder that you want to check out
if you've got say like this pitch
suggests lots of buildings which need to
fill out but you don't ever want to go
inside and number two is the light rays
2d effect which is a simple effect that
sort of imitates rays of light on the
surface of solve a 2d it doesn't
actually project any sort of real-time
light and interact with any objects or
shadows it's just sort of an animated
texture with some noise applied to it
and it can be useful for so I've added a
lot of atmosphere to especially 2d games
where you don't um that overhead there
so all you need to do is just literally
create the light hurt 2d sort of effect
and then you can create that for you
games
number three is the Sunnyland which is a
two set of 2d platformer a game a set
kit which includes a variety to build on
an old-school sort of 2d platformer with
a parallax backgrounds six animations
for the player three different animated
enemies and items and sound effects and
you can see yourself suggested in this
video here so it's got that sort of
classic so there's a 2d look about it
and before is the Wat caves and this is
a complete game asset pack which helps
you build a sort of pixel art related so
Metroid style game and includes two sort
of parallax background
with the tails and different selection
of props three different animated
enemies a female character with up to
five nine different animations and you
can see again like our last masa though
this is another really nice one if
you're looking to fit more for a unique
sort of maybe sci-fi styled environment
number five is the simple Sona shed and
this shit unless you make waves that go
across an object within the scene you
can customize their share to adjust the
lock in different ways you can customize
the color the texture the width
speed the range the intensity and the
number of rings that created so if
you've ever seen just a sonar effect or
like maybe an area of effect type of
thing from an RPG type of game and I
wanted to pause the video just so you
could actually see it working so as you
can see them from the video when the
object falls down it creates that pulse
on the ground and you can vary it by
creating lots of things when it hits the
ground different colors different
variation and these were the five
miscellaneous assets for November 2017
and I think this was quite a good month
for the miscellaneous ones because there
was quite a lot of interesting shaders
and assets that you can use big thanks
to developers who make these so I'll
leave the link in the description so you
can check these out thanks again for
