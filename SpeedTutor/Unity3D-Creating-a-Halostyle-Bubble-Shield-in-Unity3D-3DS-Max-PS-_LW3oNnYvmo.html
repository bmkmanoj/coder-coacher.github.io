it's all about actually showing you how
to make a bubble shield and above a
shield you might have seen from Halo 3
or the Halo series or anything like that
and now it's not going to be exactly the
same as any of the ones that you've seen
but you know I'll have a similar effect
and I'm sure that you recognize it
because somebody asked me how to do it
so we'll start off that I'm going to
show you how to make the actual object
in 3ds max first of all so you know I
might put these assets up to download if
you know people need them but I'll show
you quickly first off what we're going
to do so what what I want to do is get a
sphere and I'm just going to draw that
out in the workspace in 3ds max then
what we do is just check edged faces so
we can see what's going on we're just
going to actually create a hemisphere so
we'd actually want the whole of it we
just want you know half of it so once
I've done that you can see that we've
got half the actual sphere what I'm
going to do is then right click and
convert to editable poly and once I've
done this what I'll be able to do is we
can go up to the underside and we're
going to need to actually change
something to it so we can actually go
underneath it and see through it so what
I'm going to do is I'm going to select
one of my edges get a swift loop and
just put a swift loop into the moss
we've put the actual edge in what I'll
do is I'll select the top edge bring it
really close to the other side and then
I'll select the edges again hold shift
to select and I'm just gonna I'm just
going to scale it in very very slightly
so maybe about this much and then from
here what we're going to do is I will
select all the polygons at the bottom
I'll do when I select all the polygons
I'll bevel the way in so we just bevel
in and until we start we see a line
we'll go to there I'll just move it in
slightly and then we'll go up again then
I'll add a plus we'll go up slightly
again to make sure this just takes a
little bit of trial and error really and
another plus again come back a little
bit adjust the bevel slightly just so
that we're not seeing anything on the
outer edge press plus ik press the plus
again come back in just so we can get a
solve you know Dom shape like that so we
get a natural in a doornail now that's
the actual shape that we're looking at
to use so now what we can do is we can
go to X bar X bar and then if I go to
choose my desktop or wherever what you
want save and I'll save it as bubble
shield FBX because you want to save as
an FBX and the next bar down and once
you've done that we can actually go into
unity and then once you're in unity what
I want to do is import a new asset then
I want to import bubble shield FBX so if
I'm point to the scene it might be quite
small then what I'll do is I'll just
click on the actual asset in the project
panel and scale it by not by one still a
bit small not point to you know that
might be something that we're looking
for so that's all okay now then what I
want you want to do is within unity I
want to actually add the refractive
material that I used in another video so
I'll put the package up for download but
what we need to do is
select this refractive material and we
can apply it to the dome that we've got
here now it almost makes it look sort of
transparent like I showed for the crisis
bit but to make it look like a bubble
shield we actually create something in
Photoshop and now it's going to like
look like this texture here but I'll
quickly show you how you can do it so
what we can do is create a 5x5 twelve
new one segment in Photoshop and then
what we do is at the share creation side
if we select polygon tool and we make
sure you sides are set to six what I'm
going to do is actually scale out a
solve six sided polygon and what we do
is double click on the layer and I'm
going to set the color of a layer to you
know a blue then I'll set the stroke to
white oops
set the stroke to white then I'll press
ok arch will actually delete this
background layer so we can see what
we're doing a little bit and then what
you want to do is actually position this
polygon so just to the edges of your and
map essentially so as we can see in here
you'll notice that I've got a row of
particular polygons and when you put
them together if we press ctrl J we can
duplicate and what you can do is then
put that next to another one it's all
about getting us all visual style that
you like I didn't know the polygon next
to another you know get it roughly how
you want it do another just like that
then we'll collapse all these layers
and then what we can do is if you hold
shift and select across a few we can
right click and say duplicate layers and
then what we can do is drag them down
onto a lower section and do the same
until you fill the entirety of your
space up with these hexagons and then
we'll just create a new layer at the
bottom and I'll just fill that in with
the color that we've got so well we
really want to select the color that we
have here so if I select that with a
color picker and just paste it in then
what you can do is once it's full up you
can save out as a PNG JPEG PSD whatever
and then import that into unity so I'm
not going to save that just for the sake
of this I go back in to unity and you
can see that this is my texture here now
the material that we had on this object
the refractive material what we know
we're going to do is actually add this
bubble shield texture to the object now
you may need to adjust the title that
mines 15 and 8 and if you want it to
tail properly on the outside and you'll
actually have to make its out within
Photoshop so making it so it'll repeat
as many times as you want but that sort
of creates the visual effect of the
object now what we're going to do it
after this is we're going to actually
add a physics add a rigidbody and then
I'm going to say to use gravity in is
kinematic and then add a component and
then add physics again and then we'll
add a box Collider and this is just
selling the terrain and not fall through
because we want to be able to spawn it
and use it like you could in solve like
the Halo games so you'll notice that it
has that sort of similar effect with
solve a Spacey funky effect now make
sure you box Collider is this trigger
because we're going to want to walk
through it and stuff like that now the
main part of this is going to be
creating the script so we'll create a
new JavaScript and call this create
shield and then from there we'll
double-click and we'll start writing the
script so what I'll do is delete those
two function write variable player as
type transform then another variable
called bubble shield as type game object
then another variable called bubble
sound as audio clip just change that
bullet shield to capital and then what
I'm going to do is create three private
variables one private variable called
clone bubble as game object another
private variable called can spawn as
boolean equal to true then another VAR a
variable by variable called time until
next spawn and set that to is type float
now we're going to write function update
so write your function up there add your
two brackets and the curly brackets and
say if can spawn so if can spawn is
equal to true which it is and input dot
get key down in brackets key card dot B
or whatever a key one you bubble then
add two brackets at the end then add two
new curly brackets and then we're going
to write clone double equals instantiate
make sure you spell that correctly in
brackets bubble shield close the
brackets either setting a comb and
you'll send clone bubble dot transform
dot position equals player dot position
plus vector 3 in brackets knot minus 2 0
now lets blend this all when i've
written down and then we're going to
write can spawn is equal to false then
time until next spawn is equal to is
equal to 0 point 0 with a semicolon then
i want to set audio player 1 shot up and
brackets bubble sound close the brackets
add the semicolon so what we're doing
here is were if the object can spawn and
we press B then what object we set here
clone bubble will last and share the
object that we're asking it to make so
what we're going to make is the bubble
shield and then it's going to create
it's going to instantiate that object at
the player's position plus so this
vector 3 means it'll add some height to
it or make it lower or put it to the
left but it to the right and in max y&amp;amp;z
axis so here minus 2 is because my
character control is slightly big I put
it to minus 2 because if i spawned it
with no vector 3 it would spawn sort of
over the player slightly above some
minus 2 you might need to adjust this
and that's the y-value and that's how
high so when you press B you need to
make sure this you know looks like it's
on the floor and then we're going to set
can spawn equal to false won't be able
to spawn the bubble until the timer runs
down and the timer sets to 0 so we can
start it going and then we'll play the
sound effect for it now to make this all
work when you talk at the timer so I'm
going to say if X
milk can spawn that means that if we do
the opposite of what comes barn equals
and that the the motto you know the
beginning which is true which means it's
set to false then time until next spawn
plus equals time dot Delta time so
that'll count up I'll count up from 0
all the way up to whatever we set and
then under he will say that if time time
on till next spawn is greater than or
equal to or cr7 then we'll say that can
spawn is equal to true that destroy open
brackets clone bubble close brackets in
a semicolon then I'll say audio stop so
this means that if it's a false which is
it'll start the timer if the timer ever
reaches seven can spawn will then be
equal to true and we can make another
bubble it'll destroy what we had and
they'll stop this on the phone so in
here long when you made a bubble shield
it would destroy itself after a period
of time it wouldn't be something that
lasted forever so what we'll do then is
save that script we're going to unity
and then what we want to do is add this
to the first person controller so if I
drag the create shield to the first
person control we'll add our FPS
controller as the player will add the
sound effect which I I've got from
somewhere else so you will add the sound
effect you can look for your own sound
effects if you like and then when you
touch out a game object which is the
bubble shield so what I'm actually going
to do is create a new prefab so I'll
create a new prefab and call this shield
and then what I'm going to do this game
object that we created it's got all the
elements on what we can do from here is
if we drag this to shield and we delete
this out of our scene if we drag shield
back in it will be as it would normally
this just means that we can hold it in
our project panel without it and we can
use it in many different scenes now on
the FPS controller if we add the game
object shield will now get that so what
I can do now is when I run again you
know you can run about do whatever
you're doing
there will be a sound effect as long as
you added an audio source and then once
it actually ended and disappeared the
sound turned off it's like them and
spawn
so back
and if you know
soft hour with talent of the texture
within 3ds max before you bring it into
this
outside so that's just simply a way to
create a bubble shield within unity and
make it spawn make it appear at you
players position as like maybe a power
our ability to you know deflect
projectiles and things like that but
that that was pretty much it and as ever
