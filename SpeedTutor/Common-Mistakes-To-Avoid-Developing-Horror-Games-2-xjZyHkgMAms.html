previous tutorial that I did which was
about horror games and things to look
out for and mistakes to try and not do
and I thought of some more very
important things that I missed out in
the last video well I didn't want the
video to be that much longer so I'm
going to cover some extra bits today and
hopefully this again can help you with
your horror game and among other games
which might be up the 3d space one thing
I wanted to ask is that with me doing
these types of videos would people find
it interesting if I sort of playing
maybe a snippet of a certain game like
there's an evil seven and sort of talk
through the way they might have done
things the things that I don't like
things that did well things that you can
sort of take inspiration from and maybe
do solve that not so much a live
commentary but a commentary as I'm
playing the game not so much as a sort
of let's play as more of a sort of
developer insight into the things that
they might have done and because I don't
know how many people will end up
watching this or are interested in
making Korra games themselves but you
let me know in the comments so like I
mentioned last time about believability
and we're going to talk more about
things that are quite annoying if you
don't sort of you know keep it sort of
very minimal and one thing that you
might see in a lot of games is when you
use the head and Bob is when your ear is
when the character my Bob a lot so when
this head Bob on the character or
something like that so when you step and
you know realistically in real life you
know you don't step perfectly you know
in line every time but head Bob isn't
very realistic because when we walk we
don't really notice it very much because
the brain works it out in a particular
way and it's just sometimes in a lot of
games when I know it's nice to put a
little bit in if you subtle with the
head bob but sometimes it's a little bit
overdone and it just looks a bit jarring
if when you know every footstep you take
is a really big sort of Bob up and down
so if you minimize that and you can have
a head bob a little bit just to add a
little bit of real
one thing more over on the subject of
flashlights and things that I mentioned
in the previous video is a spotlight or
the spotlight angle of which you create
for your actual torch are your
flashlight itself you want to make sure
that it you know encompasses a large
enough area to make it feel
you know realistic make it feel not to
you know tedious to trend point your
flashlight around and look at different
objects if you go into a dark room and
actually use a flashlight yourself it
won't be just this little pinpoint area
which you can barely even see anything
it will actually illuminate a very large
area and with the sort of light fall-off
you get a very large radius or which you
can see so I've been mindful that you
want to be able to you know make the
player not frustrated when trying to
search through your game and make the
spangled big enough so it isn't a
hindrance one thing that I noticed and
I've noticed this in you know triple-a
titles and things I think we're done
notice it was Resident Evil Revelations
and in a midway through the game as a
recall I think one of the bathrooms in
the game password the toilets looked
really big and the sinks looked really
big and even the cubicles they were just
it was just weird it was out portion and
you don't normally see that in games
which have taken extra care when they've
been designed you see a lot of more you
know very indie indie let's say games
where scale is not everyone's or forte
but it's very important and the way that
I get around it is any modeling program
or anything like that you set yourself
up a scale and say you create yourself a
six-foot character or just a six foot
block which might be about 1.8 meters
tall and you just base all your assets
on that and then you can scale up and
down in there an engine as you need to
so you always keep consistent scale so
you don't have one absolutely massive
sink a massive chair and what goes hand
in hand with that is make sure your
character isn't low as I say that can
sort of be a symptom of the same type of
thing if your characters too small your
assets may be too big
and make sure yes characters big enough
it doesn't look like a child unless you
are going for again which you are
playing as a child which is fair enough
if you're playing as an adult you don't
want to be you know below the desk or
with your head just above the desk or
you want to make sure that you go up to
things in real life and beside to
yourself where's my waist depending on
how tall you are
where's your waist compared to the door
handle whereas you always compared to
your table where's your waist compared
to the sink
you know how big is this objects against
another and one thing that always annoys
me in games is I mean it's intellectual
II with the most of the things that
happen but walking up stairs is one
thing that say you had a let's imagine a
box Collider on each of this step your
character would have to solve jump up
these large saw of squares and sometimes
in some games that I've seen even
recently you get a weird sort of bobbing
as you go up the stairs because the
character has to you know get over these
large increments so how I got around in
my game left alone is I had sort of like
a cube collider and I made it big enough
when it almost acted like a ramp across
all of the stairs so you didn't get any
weird bobbing you just sort of went up a
big slope you don't see the collider
because you know you just get rid of the
mesh renderer and whatnot but but you
can get away from that awful awkward
sort of bobbing up the stairs if you
just make a nice even slope all the way
up the stairs that you've got and one
thing that's a big thing that it's not
always the case but when you've got when
people have light sources that don't
have say a light fixture and it just
looks weird I if you've got a point
lighting your scene and you've got a hot
spot on the left and a right and the one
at the top of the ceiling and you've got
none actual light fixture there it's all
about believability most of the time in
games that I've seen so on YouTube and
things like that people don't pick up on
it and it's not a bad thing even in you
know Triple A games it's not necessary
all of the time to have a light fixture
but if you come and you know
make yourself a light fixture you can
use a thousand times it can go a long
way to just sort of making it look
believable add an emissive texture to
your light bulb or something like that
just to make sure that it looks like
it's on so it isn't just sort of a maybe
a gray non let light bulb or something
like that just to add that element of it
does look like that is what it would
look like in real life again on the fact
of believability small details go a long
way to make something feel you know
believable the two fairly good examples
were what I showed in the last video
were contempt and precipice and they had
contempt especially had you'll notice
that if you download the game yourself
it would have pipes running along the
house even wires and a lot of sort of
particles which moths flying around the
light you know little things like that
go a long way because pipes you find
pipes in real life and you can you know
clutter things up by playing alphas on
the floor which could be paper books you
know scraps of anything it's not to be
specific to anything it just makes it
look believable in a house and like I
was mentioning before psychologically in
the back of your mind you know that that
looks right and you know the walls look
cluttered everything looks like it
should and it just goes and makes it
look a lot neater a nicer one thing that
I see again is things like object
clipping and I'm you know 3d models
clicking through another thing so say if
you've got a box inside another box or a
curtain through an object or a door that
then clips through the wall you know be
careful when you're placing items or
when you animate a doll let's say and so
it doesn't animate too far back and go
through the wall or placing an object
through something else because like I
keep banging on about believability and
stuff doesn't clip through things in
real life so you know if you can avoid
that especially minimal things you know
if you place in hundreds of thousands of
assets within again it's difficult to
minimize them all but they can go a long
way to just sort of be mindful
that to avoid clipping especially when
you do animations because it's quite
easy to just do it and then forget
especially if you can I triplicate Alvin
Arthur something that's all always
really frustrated me is things that say
you are can add re again
and I have not sitting some of them are
there was some of the smaller indie
games is when you get doll sounds that
are either doll sounds you've heard
before doll sounds that are extremely
repetitive or extremely loud so it's
good to just have a subtle you know
creaky doll let's say and then you know
keep that to a minimum maybe have three
four different random door sounds that
happen when you open a doll or interact
with something like that then you can
avoid the fact of its sounding the same
every single time you up and down
because if you open the doll it doesn't
necessarily in real life it won't always
make a sound it's just in games and
movies you need to add a sound to
something or it might just just sound it
just looks odd one thing that I do more
often than not see is really poorly
texted door handles and or and all
Paulding model door handles and I mean
to a lot of people it probably doesn't
make much difference but I think yeah
again if you're going to duplicate a
door maybe twenty thirty times it's just
nice to have doesn't take a little bit
of extra time modeling a door handle and
maybe put in a you know and actually
realistic soft metallic texture and or
material on T darkened up just so it
doesn't look so relieved to be you know
really rusted and things like that but I
spoil yet again it depends what game you
going for and I can't recommend
something like substance painter enough
especially if you're aiming for a sort
of 3d you know hot again one of the last
things I'm going to mention is you know
similar to the subject of the dolls that
was mentioning before and you want to be
very mindful of your actual doll
mechanics themselves and if you look at
doll mechanics like so resin evil seven
for instance you can either push the
doll as like an really character as if
you were going to push it in real life
or you know you can press a button and
it will play a sort of animation or
adjust it in that way
but you need to be mindful to make sure
that your dar system or Dom mechanics
work in a lot of different instances so
you want to test it to make sure that we
can spam the button lots of times to
make sure that it doesn't break it you
don't have doors spinning around doors
flying off hinges and if you've got an
interaction system with the doll like
you interact with a button then you have
to push the mouse forward or user
controller analog stick make sure that
that's intuitive and works because
there's nothing worse than playing a
game and then just the door interactions
annoying and if you're interacting with
a lot of doors all the time can be
difficult so it's important like I've
mentioned before get people to test it
and get people to give you you know
their opinions on what it's like I think
one more thing to mention is that say
you pick up notes are things that you've
got to read make sure that you'll use a
legible font and a font or a typeface
that you can actually read quite easily
because it's very difficult to have a
letter or something that you'll pick up
and read and then it'd been a font which
is extremely difficult to read a lot of
games actually have when you pick up an
object they will have a button that you
press and it will just bring up the sort
of an overlay of the text in just a very
legible font which is almost an overlay
on what the actual original note would
have said just so you can read it more
easily as if you were going to type out
in a Microsoft Word document it's just
to make it easy to read without you
having to then struggle reading how it
was you know originally written whether
that was by hand or a funky style font
and I think actually on the subject of
fonts and things like that
um they're quite important when you're
making a logo or things for your game
choose a font that's appropriate don't
try and go too crazy and make it look
too horror and by that I mean try to
avoid just soft childish ridiculous
fonts that look like you just typed into
google horror fun and it looks a bit you
know garish you might want that I think
layers of fear used one of the sort of
typefaces can what it's called face your
fears or something
that does sort of look like it was
painted on and that's that suitable for
that style of game so it's just
dependent what you you know really going
for but make sure you pick something
especially for things like logos they
can look quite bad if you don't choose
the right style of font so this has gone
on trouble if that longer than
anticipated but here's some more tips on
ways to improve a horror game or any
game because it's got a lot of tips in
there that can relate to any really type
type of game really so yet again thanks
very much for watching don't forget to
