to make a new Sky box within unity 5 now
it's I think it's very similar with
unity fire visitors with for unity 4 but
if you've had problems if you've brought
a project up from 4 to 5 you might
notice sort of weird
I'd say pixelated sort of black areas in
your skybox now units uses the
procedural sky in for its default
version now it's got it hasn't really
got any clouds or anything so there's
not an awful lot of reflectivity that
you can gain from it when I've got it
far semi vehicle here yeah it still
looks okay but so we want to make a
skybox with clouds if you import
something from unity for the images that
you used to use so if I show you here it
was there's a set of images that you've
got to make a skybox which makes up to
make a dome when you use the correct
shader so you need back down front left
right and up and now these are going to
correspond to the things that we need to
do so if we right click in the project
panel go create and material then we'll
call it sunny sky whatever we might want
to call it if we go to the inspector and
then we change the share to skybox now
we can have it as procedural like the
vert like this one and we can change the
parameters like how big the Sun is in
the sky
what sort of the atmosphere is like what
the tint that we can have so this is
just an example of what we can do in
those cases we'll make something really
crazy and then we'll set the exposure
quite high now if I leave that like how
it is and then we go into the lighting
tab and we add the sunny sky you'll
notice that we get a skybox which
affects it quite grill it all on the
ground surfaces we've got all on the
overall sort of saturation to the car
and gives you sup maybe look about if it
was a game in space or something like
that where you're neither really big
maybe a red hue but so want to add out
on personal images what we can do
instead of using procedural can you go
to skybox and six sided now it'll be all
pretty blown out because we haven't
added our images in now what you want to
do is if you copy each of these images
so I'll provide these or you can
download them from unity 4 we'll go and
create a new folder in here and we'll
call it sky images then what we'll do is
we'll show that those in a Explorer and
just pierce them in so we get them in
there and then unitl import those in for
us now we'll open that up go back to the
sunny sky and you'll notice that you
love from back left right up and down so
we'll add the back into the correct slot
you'll notice that it looks quite
strange we'll add the up we'll add the
right we'll add the front the left and
then the down now you'll notice that if
you ever had a problem like this sort of
weird issue and you need to ask unity
because if it contains an alpha we need
to make sure that we save fix now so
this might have been a problem that you
may have had and previously in your game
well and here we need to set the
exposure down because we need it to be
more realistic so if we leave the
exposure at about 1 and then everything
looks you know relatively normal we can
change the rotation of the sky if we
need to which will change the sort of
look of it and if we change the baby
there the color tint you know we can get
a slightly different look of a/c and we
can get a more of a hue of blue at the
bottom so that was really just a simple
way to either create create a procedural
skybox
or create a skybox which uses the images
that we used to use in unity far and
specifically using for reflections on
shiny surfaces or metallic objects so
really that's pretty much it and if you
